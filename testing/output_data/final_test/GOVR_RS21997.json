    "content": "The heightened interest in port and maritime security post-9/11 has focused on cargo container ships due to concerns about terrorist use. Only a small fraction of the millions of cargo containers entering the US each year is inspected, raising fears of a potential container-borne atomic bomb attack. Experts like Robert Bonner and Stephen Flynn warn of the devastating economic and physical impact such an attack could have. Container ships accounted for 30.4% of vessel calls to US ports in 2005. The report focuses on the threat of a terrorist nuclear attack using oil tanker ships, given the importance of maritime security post-9/11. Middle Eastern nations, chief sources of anti-U.S. terrorism, rely heavily on crude oil exports. In 2006, 28.8% of net U.S. crude oil imports came from the Middle East, with oil going to 30 U.S. ports in 2003. Key ports handling oil included Blaine, El Segundo, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Richmond, Corpus Christi, Freeport, Galveston, Houston, Port Arthur, Texas City, Baton Rouge, Gramercy, and Lake. Crude oil is shipped to the United States in supertankers like VLCCs and ULCCs, which can carry 200,000 to over 300,000 deadweight tons. These ships are the largest ever built, with interior storage tanks for the oil. The Coast Guard and Navy do not have responsibility for these ships. The Coast Guard and Navy do not have responsibility for security of foreign-flagged vessels at foreign ports. Security of foreign ports rests with foreign governments. The simplest type of atomic bomb is a gun-assembly bomb, with a uranium mass shot down a tube to cause a nuclear explosion. The Hiroshima bomb was of this type, with a yield of 15 kilotons. It was 6 feet long, 6 inches in diameter, and weighed about 1,000 pounds. Some items loaded onto large cargo ships are similar in size and weight. To stage a nuclear attack using a tanker, terrorists would need to acquire a nuclear device and smuggle it onto a ship. They might seek to place the bomb inside an oil tank, in a dry space on the ship, or in a blister attached underwater. Remotely detonating the bomb might be difficult due to wiring challenges. Terrorists could overcome challenges of detonating a bomb on a ship by smuggling it onto a vessel at sea. They might target ports with high oil traffic and dense populations, such as the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), to cause major economic damage while minimizing loss of life. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) is a crucial U.S. deepwater oil port handling 10% of crude oil imports. Detecting atomic bombs in tankers is challenging due to the mass of oil and steel blocking gamma rays and neutrons. Various techniques like chemical sampling and acoustic profiling are being considered for security measures. Securing tankers at loading terminals and in port is crucial to prevent terrorist attacks. Techniques like acoustic profiling and muon detection are being considered, but challenges remain due to the complexity of tanker configurations. Measures such as security perimeters, personnel screening, and technology from programs like \"Second Line of Defense\" could help enhance tanker security. However, the risk of bombs being smuggled onto ships at sea highlights the need for continuous improvement in security measures. Improving security for tankers at sea is crucial to prevent terrorist attacks. Challenges include the possibility of bombs being smuggled onto ships, requiring continuous enhancement of security measures. Questions arise regarding crew willingness to upgrade security, passing warnings without compromising intelligence, and screening for personnel reliability to prevent potential threats like a nuclear attack using tankers. The Administration needs to consider the threat of a nuclear attack using tankers and implement measures to enhance port and maritime security. Congress could explore options like clarifying federal responsibility for tanker security and creating a Tanker Security Initiative. A Tanker Security Initiative (TSI) could set standards for tankers transporting oil to U.S. ports and the ports they load from. Tankers not meeting these standards could be denied entry. Maritime domain awareness should focus on tankers, and U.S. intelligence assets should monitor threats of terrorist attacks involving tankers. The Intelligence Community could analyze steps and signatures to detect terrorist attacks involving tankers. Adequate funding for detecting atomic bombs aboard tankers should be ensured. International cooperation and agreements, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative, are essential for tanker security. Promoting offshore ports like LOOP and improving international cooperation are key measures to enhance tanker security. The United States could enhance tanker security by increasing bilateral cooperation with oil-exporting states and countries where tankers are registered. Potential measures include improving security at oil-loading terminals and enhancing background screening and training for port workers and tanker crew members. Funding for proactive steps could be covered by general revenues or through fees on ships landing oil in the United States. On January 24, 2005, S. 12, Targeting Terrorists More Effectively Act of 2005, was introduced, proposing a Tanker Security Initiative to prevent terrorists from using tanker vessels for weapons of mass destruction. The Secretary of Homeland Security would establish standards and activities to ensure tanker security. The legislation proposes a Tanker Security Initiative to prevent terrorists from using tanker vessels for weapons of mass destruction. It includes developing detection equipment, inspection procedures, and R&D on sensors to detect a nuclear device on tankers. The Secretary of Homeland Security would submit a report to Congress on terrorism risks posed by tankers and propose a budget for the initiative. Potential issues for further consideration include enhancing tanker security through port security grant programs and deploying imaging or radiation-detection systems for increased security. The current R&D investment strategy should consider tanker security and potential detection programs to be developed for implementation of the SAFE Port Act, P.L. 109-347."
