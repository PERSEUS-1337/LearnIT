SHORT TITLE.\n\nThis title may be cited as the \"Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation Act\".\n\nSEC. 102. FINDINGS. Congress finds that historically black colleges and universities have significantly contributed to equal opportunity in postsecondary education for African-American, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged Americans. They have historically relied on private support due to discrimination in funding allocation by States and the Federal Government, resulting in unique and historically important buildings and structures. The historic buildings on historically black colleges and universities campuses are national treasures worth preserving for future generations. SEC. 103. Preservation and restoration grants for historic buildings and structures at historically black colleges and universities. The Secretary will provide grants to historically black colleges and universities for preserving and restoring historic buildings on their campuses. Funding for these grants will come from appropriations authorized under the National Historic Preservation Act. Grantees must agree not to alter the property without the Secretary's approval for a specified period. The Secretary may provide grants to historically black colleges and universities for preserving historic buildings, with the condition that public access is allowed for interpretive and educational purposes. Funds for buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places require a matching amount from non-Federal sources, unless waived by the Secretary. The Secretary may grant funds to historically black colleges and universities for preserving historic buildings in cases of extreme emergency or public interest. Up to $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1995 and $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1996-1998 may be allocated, with specific amounts designated for Fisk University. For fiscal year 1995, up to $20,000,000 may be allocated for grants to historically black colleges and universities for historic preservation. If less than $20,000,000 is available, the allocation will be split with 25% for one purpose and 50% for another. For fiscal year 1995, up to $20,000,000 may be allocated for grants to historically black colleges and universities for historic preservation. 25 percent of the allocation will be available for grants to other eligible historically black colleges and universities. The Secretary will issue necessary regulations to implement this title.
