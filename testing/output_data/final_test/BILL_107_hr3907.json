The \"Stronger Tobacco Warning Labels to Save Lives Act\" mandates that cigarette packages in the US must bear warning labels addressing diseases, fatal health conditions, and physical addiction caused by smoking. The Secretary must establish regulations for these warning labels within a year of the Act's enactment. The regulations require cigarette packages to have warning labels with color graphics illustrating the health hazards of smoking, including secondhand smoke and the impact on young people. The regulations mandate warning labels on cigarette packages depicting health hazards like diseased organs, addiction, children exposed to smoking, and secondhand smoke effects on pregnant women and infants. Manufacturers are prohibited from advertising cigarettes in the US without these warning labels. The warning labels on cigarette packages must occupy at least 50 percent of the front and back panels, with text in 17 point type. Advertising must also feature warning labels covering 50 percent of the space, with conspicuous and legible text in a black-on-white or white-on-black format. The advertisement must include label statements in specific point types based on the type and color of the advertisement, such as 45 point type for whole page broadsheet newspaper ads and 27 point type for half page tabloid newspaper ads. The advertisement must include label statements in specific point types based on the type and color of the advertisement, such as 45 point type for whole page broadsheet newspaper ads and 27 point type for half page tabloid newspaper ads. The Secretary may revise the required type sizes as deemed appropriate within the 50 percent requirement. All letters in the label must appear in conspicuous and legible type, in contrast by typography, layout, or color with all other printed material. The label statements on cigarette packages and advertisements must be rotated quarterly in alternating sequence by manufacturers or importers, following a plan approved by the Federal Trade Commission. Manufacturers or importers of cigarettes must rotate label statements quarterly in an approved sequence by the Federal Trade Commission. They can apply to have a different rotation for a brand if sales are low. Manufacturers or importers of cigarettes can apply to the Federal Trade Commission for approval to have a different label rotation for a brand if sales are low. If approved, the label rotation will apply for a 1-year period. The application must include a plan for the rotation sequence. Manufacturers or importers can apply for approval from the Federal Trade Commission to rotate cigarette labels differently for low-selling brands. If approved, labels must appear an equal number of times on packages within a 12-month period. The Secretary will establish warning labels for cigars and pipe tobacco, including content-specific messages and graphic illustrations of health hazards. The labels must be clear and unambiguous. The amendment defines pipe tobacco as loose tobacco likely to be smoked in a pipe, with an effective date set for 1 year after enactment. The Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 is amended by replacing section 3 with a new provision on smokeless tobacco warning. The Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 is amended to require warning labels on smokeless tobacco products and in advertisements. The Secretary must establish regulations for these warning labels within one year of the enactment of this section. The regulations require warning labels on smokeless tobacco products addressing diseases, addiction, and the impact on young individuals. Each subject must have at least 2 warning labels, with one label on each package rotated regularly. The regulations mandate color graphics on warning labels for smokeless tobacco products, illustrating the text message. Graphics may include diseased mouths, individuals using the product, or children observing its use. The label statements for tobacco products must be prominently displayed on the packaging, occupying at least 50 percent of the principal display panel. The text must be in 17 point type, with alternating black on white and white on black format, as determined by the Secretary. Advertising and rotation rules are similar to those in the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. The Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act applies to advertisements for smokeless tobacco products and the rotation of label statements on such products. The amendment also prohibits advertising smokeless tobacco or cigars on electronic communication mediums under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. The effective date of this amendment is 1 year after enactment."
