    "content": "Corporate inversions involve a U.S. company changing its ownership structure to have a foreign parent, leading to potential tax savings through strategies like earnings stripping. Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes negative tax consequences on such transactions. Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes negative tax consequences on inverted companies, limiting tax benefits and imposing an excise tax on certain corporate insiders. The section applies to companies that inverted after March 3, 2004, with the aim of preventing U.S. companies from establishing shell companies in low-tax jurisdictions. Recent media reports have highlighted U.S. companies using inversions to relocate to Europe and Canada, unlike earlier inversions. These new inversions often involve countries where the company has a legitimate business presence post-inversion, not covered by Section 7874 due to substantial business activity or ownership thresholds not being met. Some argue these inversions are genuine cross-border mergers, not solely tax-motivated. Recent media reports have highlighted U.S. companies using inversions to relocate to Europe and Canada, unlike earlier inversions. These new inversions often involve countries where the company has a legitimate business presence post-inversion. Some argue these are genuine cross-border mergers, not solely tax-motivated. Section 7874 provides negative tax consequences for U.S. subsidiaries of inverted corporations meeting specific criteria. Section 7874 imposes unfavorable tax treatment on U.S. subsidiaries of inverted corporations based on ownership thresholds. If the foreign parent's stock is held by former U.S. company shareholders at 60% or 80%, the U.S. subsidiary may face limitations on tax credits and deductions. Meeting the 80% threshold results in the foreign parent being treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. tax purposes. The U.S. subsidiary and related persons are affected by this tax treatment. Substantial business activities in the foreign parent's home country post-acquisition can trigger Section 7874. The IRS finalized regulations in 2015 regarding \"substantial business activities\" for companies with foreign operations. The regulations define \"substantial business activities\" as meeting criteria related to employees, assets, and income in the foreign country. The IRS defined \"substantial business activities\" as having at least 25% of total worldwide income in a foreign country. Initially, regulations in 2006 considered factors like employee headcount, assets, and sales, or meeting a safe harbor of 10% in the foreign country. In 2009, the safe harbor was removed due to concerns of abuse, and in 2012, the IRS revised regulations. In 2012, the IRS replaced the facts and circumstances test with a 25% ownership threshold under Section 7874 regulations to prevent companies from inverting. Temporary regulations issued in April 2016 address ways companies might avoid the ownership threshold, such as disregarding stock issued by a foreign corporation in prior acquisitions of U.S. The IRS regulations disregard stock issued by a foreign corporation in prior acquisitions of U.S. companies within three years before an inversion, regardless of intent to avoid Section 7874. The rules also include an \"anti-slimming\" provision to prevent U.S. companies from reducing their size through large dividends before an inversion. The 2016 regulations address various statutes related to corporate inversions, including limiting tax benefits from \"hopscotch loans\" to prevent companies from avoiding repatriation of earnings. Inverted companies may attempt to circumvent this rule by having the controlled foreign corporation make a loan to the new foreign parent instead of the U.S. parent or subsidiary. The regulations address tax benefits from \"hopscotch loans\" in corporate inversions, preventing companies from avoiding repatriation of earnings. Inverted companies may use strategies like \"decontrolling\" and \"spinversions\" to access deferred earnings without paying U.S. tax, but the regulations limit these tactics. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aims to amend Section 7874 to address inverted corporations. Bills propose lowering the ownership threshold to 50% and setting a minimum floor of 25% for the \"substantial business activity\" standard. Examples of bills include the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act, Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, In the Red Act of 2016, GROW America Act, and Stop Corporate Inversions. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aims to amend Section 7874 to address inverted corporations. Bills propose various approaches to addressing the tax treatment of inverted companies, such as limiting earnings stripping and taxing deferred income. Examples of bills include the Corporate Inverters Earnings Stripping Reform Act of 2016 and the Corporate EXIT Fairness Act. Section 7874 provides rulemaking authority for the IRS. The Treasury Secretary will prescribe regulations to determine if a corporation is a surrogate foreign corporation, including treating various interests as stock. Section 7874(g) requires regulations to prevent the avoidance of tax purposes, including through related persons or transactions to avoid group membership. No court decisions have been made on this issue. The IRS's authority to issue regulations under Section 7874(g) is being challenged in a lawsuit filed in August 2016. The language in the provision allows for adjustments to be made, but it is unclear how broadly this can be interpreted. The legislative history does not provide clarity on this matter, and the IRS has not publicly indicated its interpretation. Some commentators believe the IRS may have exceeded its authority. Some commentators argue that the IRS may have overstepped its regulatory authority by setting a strict 25% threshold for determining substantial business activity. Concerns have been raised that this standard may be too stringent for many multinational companies, potentially leading to legal challenges. Chevron deference would likely apply if such litigation were to occur, granting significant deference to the IRS's interpretation of the statute. The Chevron deference principle applies when an agency's interpretation is the result of a formal process authorized by Congress. If Congress has directly addressed the issue, the law must be followed. If not, the court defers to the agency's interpretation as long as it is permissible, even if not the best. In this case, Congress did not define \"substantial business activities.\" The Chevron deference principle applies when an agency's interpretation is the result of a formal process authorized by Congress. In this case, Congress did not define \"substantial business activities\" in Section 7874, leading to ambiguity. Critics argue that the regulation's 25% standard is unreasonable and goes beyond Congress's intent. The IRS defended the standard as consistent with the underlying policies. Legal challenges have been filed against the regulations, with a case pending in federal district court in Texas. The plaintiffs challenge a regulation issued in April 2016 regarding stock issued by foreign corporations in U.S. acquisitions prior to inversion. They argue the regulation was unlawfully enacted without notice and comment, and claim the IRS exceeded its authority to prevent the Pfizer-Allergan inversion. The case is pending in court with the federal government yet to respond. The plaintiffs challenge a regulation issued in April 2016 regarding stock issued by foreign corporations in U.S. acquisitions prior to inversion, specifically the Pfizer-Allergan inversion. They argue the IRS exceeded its authority without notice and comment, bypassing Congress to impose the Administration's preferred policy result. The federal government has not yet responded to these allegations. Section 7874 overrides tax treaties, allowing for exemptions from its provisions. The Supreme Court has ruled that treaties and statutes are equal under the Constitution, permitting such overrides for preexisting treaties. The Supreme Court has ruled that tax statutes take precedence over conflicting treaty provisions, especially when the statute is enacted after the treaty. Section 7874's treaty override provision is permissible for inconsistent provisions in preexisting treaties. However, the interpretation of Section 7874(g) in future treaties is unclear due to the last-in-time rule. There is no case law on this provision yet. An excise tax is imposed on corporate insiders benefiting from a corporate inversion. Individuals subject to a 15% excise tax on stock compensation during a specified time period in the event of a corporate inversion. The tax applies to certain beneficial owners, officers, and directors of the corporation or its affiliates. Inverted corporations also face consequences under federal procurement law.
