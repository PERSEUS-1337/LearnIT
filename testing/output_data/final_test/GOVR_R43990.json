    "content": "The Stafford Act grants the President broad authorities to assist governments and citizens affected by disasters. FEMA administers these authorities through the Public Assistance Grant Program, providing financial assistance to states, tribes, and local communities for disaster response and recovery. The PA Program has allocated $52.6 billion in grant assistance between FY2000-FY2013. The PA Program has provided $52.6 billion in grant assistance for eligible response and recovery activities, including debris removal and repair of disaster-damaged facilities. The program's authorities were amended by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act. This report outlines key elements of the PA Program, such as applicant eligibility and types of assistance available. It also includes a summary analysis of federal obligations for PA Program assistance. The report discusses policy issues for Congress to consider regarding the PA Program, including potential changes and its role in federal disaster assistance. FEMA's resources provide detailed information on how the PA Program is administered, including eligibility criteria, grant types, and funding distribution. To be eligible for PA grants, a state or tribal government must receive a disaster declaration from the President. The disaster must exceed the capacity of local communities to manage. PA grants are also available to areas receiving Fire Management Assistance Grants. The primary grantee is the state or tribal government, but grants are open to tribal, state, and local governments as subgrantees. PA grants are available to tribal, state, and local government entities in the affected area, including general purpose municipal city governments, school districts, public hospitals, and transportation districts. Private citizens and companies are not eligible for PA grants, but certain owners of private nonprofit facilities may qualify if they provide essential services of a governmental nature to the public. The eligibility criteria for private nonprofit facilities are outlined in the Stafford Act and further detailed in FEMA's regulations and policy. Private nonprofit facilities (PNPs) must meet specific criteria to be eligible for Public Assistance (PA) grants. PNPs must be considered nonprofit under IRS or state law and provide critical services such as power, water, sewer, education, and emergency medical facilities. If a PNP provides a critical service, it can apply directly to the PA Program for grant assistance. If not, it must first apply for assistance from the Small Business Administration's Disaster Loan Program. The Small Business Administration's Disaster Loan Program provides assistance to Private Nonprofit facilities (PNPs) that are denied assistance or receive less than the eligible amount from the PA Program. PNPs offering non-critical services can then apply for assistance from the PA Program. FEMA's policy guidance states that PNP facilities primarily used for religious, political, athletic, recreational, or vocational purposes are ineligible for assistance unless they provide essential governmental services. Legislation has been considered to expand eligibility for religious entity-owned facilities. Congress has considered legislation to include \"houses of worship\" as eligible for assistance under the PA Program, which may raise constitutional legal issues. FEMA categorizes assistance under emergency work and permanent work, with categories labeled A through G. These categories are not explicitly defined in the Stafford Act or FEMA regulations but serve as a tool to manage the PA Program. Emergency work assistance under the PA Program includes two categories: debris removal and emergency protective measures. FEMA defines emergency work as immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and ensure public safety. Assistance is available to communities in major and emergency disaster declarations, as well as areas receiving Fire Management Assistance Grants. The categories are not clearly defined in the Stafford Act or FEMA regulations, leading to some overlap and subjectivity in classification. When a disaster strikes a community, it can generate a large volume of debris, including hazardous materials and building materials. Debris removal is crucial for emergency routes to remain clear and for the community to recover. FEMA provides grant assistance for debris management in the public interest. FEMA provides grant assistance for debris removal in the public interest under Category A of the PA Program, available for emergency and major disaster declarations. Eligible grantees can receive expedited payments for debris removal costs, with specific policy guidance established for this assistance. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act introduced alternative procedures for debris removal assistance. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act (SRIA) established alternative procedures for debris removal assistance under the Stafford Act, reauthorizing authorities similar to the PA Pilot Program. These procedures aim to speed up project completion and save money, with FEMA providing a larger federal share of eligible costs for quicker debris removal. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act established alternative procedures for debris removal assistance under the Stafford Act, increasing the federal share to 85% of eligible costs. FEMA allows recycling debris proceeds without reducing grant assistance, providing financial incentives for prequalified debris removal contracts, and offering a one-time 2% cost share adjustment for timely completion of debris removal projects. Emergency protective measures (Category B) in the PA Program cover activities undertaken before, during, and after a disaster to reduce threats to life, health, and property. Examples include setting up shelters, power generation, demolition of unsafe buildings, and emergency communication systems. Applicants with a debris removal plan and prequalified contract can receive assistance for debris removal within 90 days under a single disaster declaration. Applicants, including PNPs, may receive grant assistance for emergency protective measures for the general public during disaster preparedness or response. SRIA allows reimbursement of base and overtime pay for government employees for such measures. FEMA plans to implement this change through regulations but has not done so yet. FEMA determined that only overtime wages of permanent employees for state and local governments were eligible for reimbursement, not base pay or benefits. However, the full cost of contract labor for this work is eligible for reimbursement. The change made by SRIA did not affect wages for private nonprofits. FEMA also allowed reimbursement of overtime and hazardous duty pay for all state and local permanent employees conducting emergency protective measures. FEMA implemented the Sheltering and Temporary Essential Power (STEP) Pilot Program during Hurricane Sandy response. The Sheltering and Temporary Essential Power (STEP) Pilot Program provided grant assistance to local governments for emergency protective measure work on residences, allowing people to shelter in their own homes. FEMA granted a maximum of $10,000 per residence to eligible PA applicants. The program was found to be innovative but consistent with the authorities of the Stafford Act. The STEP Pilot Program, while innovative and cost-effective, was vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse due to lack of data collection on recipients. GAO reported $418 million spent post-Hurricane Sandy. FEMA is conducting an internal review. The Stafford Act grants the President authority in disasters exceeding community capabilities. The Stafford Act grants the President broad authority to direct Federal agencies to provide resources for State and local emergency assistance efforts. This assistance includes personnel, equipment, supplies, and advisory services to save lives and protect property during disasters. FEMA requires grantees and applicants to request federal assistance when states, tribes, and local governments cannot provide it themselves. The Stafford Act grants the President authority to provide federal assistance for emergency efforts. FEMA requires grantees to agree to conditions, including indemnifying the federal government. The President may provide financial assistance for restoring facilities to pre-disaster conditions. Eligible federal costs for restoration are based on the design of the facility prior to the disaster. Eligible federal costs for restoring permanent facilities generally fall into three groups: Costs associated with restoring the facility to its predisaster design, costs for improvements to bring it up to current codes, and costs for repairs/replacements to meet new building codes adopted after a disaster. FEMA requires facilities to have the same function and capacity as before the disaster. The President can provide financial assistance for these restoration efforts. The policy allowing grantees to adopt new standards and share costs with the PA Program after a disaster was reformed and restricted by FEMA. Permanent work assistance is only available in areas with major disaster declarations and requires a FEMA-approved mitigation plan. Categories C through G refer to subcategories of permanent work. Approximately 65% of all PA projects were for permanent work, including utilities like water treatment plants, power generation facilities, sewage systems, and communications. This accounted for $30.2 billion of federal obligations in the PA Program. FEMA regulations define hazard mitigation as cost-effective measures to reduce damage from disasters. Regional Administrators have authority over the PA Program. FEMA regulations give Regional Administrators authority to require hazard mitigation measures beyond local building codes. Policy guidance by FEMA outlines criteria for approving assistance for such measures. The criteria aim to maximize mitigation efforts to reduce future disaster risks. $3.7 billion has been allocated for hazard mitigation assistance in the PA Program. FEMA has allocated $3.7 billion for hazard mitigation assistance in the PA Program. Only FEMA has the authority to determine which hazard mitigation measures it will fund, with additional measures only applicable to repaired facilities damaged by disasters. Other forms of assistance provided by the PA Program may also mitigate future disaster risks. The PA Program provides funding for hazard mitigation measures to reduce future disaster risks. Eligible costs include complying with federal floodplain management standards and bringing undamaged parts of facilities into compliance with codes and standards. FEMA determines which hazard mitigation measures to fund, with additional measures applicable to repaired facilities. Triggered costs under the PA Program must be reasonable and can be considered as hazard mitigation obligations for permanent work assistance to improve facility design and reduce potential damage. Not all triggered costs may have this benefit, such as those related to increasing accessibility. Section 311 of the Stafford Act requires applicants to maintain insurance on the facility to protect against future loss, as determined by the President and implemented through regulations and FEMA policy guidance. FEMA requires facility owners to obtain and maintain insurance equal to the cost of eligible damage for the hazard type responsible. State insurance commissioners certify what is \"reasonable\" at the request of the applicant. Failure to comply makes the facility ineligible for future disaster assistance of the same hazard type. The \"obtain and maintain\" insurance requirement by FEMA reduces PA Program costs by transferring financial risk to insurance market. However, past situations show inadequate implementation by FEMA and grantees. Legal requirements for insurance apply to facilities in special flood hazard areas. Facilities in special flood hazard areas must obtain flood insurance to reduce PA Program costs. The amount of assistance may be reduced by the maximum available flood insurance. Owners are incentivized to obtain insurance pre-disaster to avoid penalties. Other types of disaster insurance are not similarly enforced. FEMA has proposed a revision to existing policies on the insurance requirement, allowing applicants to retain some or all of their risk through a self-insurance plan. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 directed the President to establish regulations for providing grant assistance to cover management expenses for disasters declared before November 2007. After November 2007, FEMA established a new procedure for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Costs are categorized into direct administrative costs (DAC) and indirect management costs. DAC are costs directly assigned to a specific project, while indirect costs are incurred in administering the grant. Eligible direct administrative costs include travel expenses and documentation preparation. The grant award covers activities like travel expenses and documentation preparation for specific projects. GAO audited the process and found unintended consequences from changes made in 2007. Direct administrative costs totaled $107 million from FY2008 to FY2012, representing 0.77% of total PA Program spending. Indirect management costs are provided to the grantee, not individual applicants, with a maximum of 3.34% allocated by FEMA. FEMA sets a maximum of 3.34% for indirect management costs for major disaster declarations and 3.9% for emergency declarations. The \"lock-in\" amount for management costs cannot exceed $20 million unless exempted by FEMA. There are no limits on the amount of money awarded through PA grants as long as the project is eligible. FEMA provides guidance on classifying activities as direct or management costs. FEMA awards funding for eligible projects with a minimum federal cost-share of 75%. The President can increase the cost-share up to 90% for certain disasters. FEMA may recommend a 100% federal cost-share for emergency work temporarily. The federal cost-share can be increased to 100% for emergency work after an incident, regardless of damage assessment. FEMA also has a policy for 100% cost-share on direct federal assistance. Cost-shares for disasters are determined in the FEMA/state agreement. In DMA 2000, regulations were established to reduce the federal cost-share for facilities damaged multiple times by the same type of event if proper mitigation measures were not taken. The federal cost-share can be reduced to 25% if a facility is damaged multiple times by the same event within a ten-year window. FEMA's proposed regulation in 2009 has not been finalized, hindering the implementation of this requirement due to tracking challenges. There is no reliable estimate on how many facilities would be affected by this cost-share reduction. The Stafford Act allows grantees and applicants to appeal decisions on eligibility or assistance amount within specific timelines. The PA Program has detailed regulations for the appeals process, including two stages of appeal to FEMA Regional Administrator. The Stafford Act allows grantees and applicants to appeal decisions on eligibility or assistance amount within specific timelines. The PA Program has detailed regulations for the appeals process, including two stages of appeal to FEMA Regional Administrator. SRIA established a new alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedure for PA Program assistance decisions related to a major disaster declaration. FEMA has implemented the ADR procedure in regulations and created a new manual on the appeals process. FEMA also maintains a database of appeals online and has established a Public Assistance Appeals Branch to manage the appeals process. FEMA uses two methods to determine grant assistance for emergency and permanent work under the PA Program. The FEMA PA Program issues grants based on estimated federal share of eligible costs for projects eligible for simplified procedures or in-lieu contributions. Grants are provided upfront for estimated costs or reimbursed based on actual documented expenses. Section 422 of the Stafford Act allows FEMA to provide PA grants based on estimated total eligible project costs, with a cap of $35,000. This simplified procedure is used for certain types of projects, such as alternate or improved projects. The simplified procedure under Section 422 of the Stafford Act allows FEMA to provide PA grants for projects with a cost ceiling of $35,000. FEMA is required to analyze whether raising the cost ceiling for small projects would improve cost-effectiveness and speed of recovery. FEMA produced a report on this issue in January 2014, one year after the enactment of SRIA. FEMA recommended raising the eligibility thresholds for simplified procedures to $120,000 for the maximum estimated cost and $3,000 for the minimum estimated cost. The new thresholds are expected to capture approximately 93% of all PA projects, though only 20% of the total costs of assistance in the PA Program. The analysis of project data from FY2000-FY2013 indicates that approximately 87% of all PA projects were small projects, accounting for 9% of the total federal obligations for assistance in the PA Program. The new thresholds for simplified procedures in the PA Program are $3,000 for the minimum project size and $120,000 for the maximum. FEMA adjusts these thresholds annually based on the Consumer Price Index and reviews them every three years. Applicants can provide their own cost estimates for small projects, which are validated by FEMA. FEMA validates small projects submitted by applicants for eligibility, compliance, accuracy, and reasonableness. They review a 20% sample size of all projects, with special considerations individually reviewed. FEMA lacks a process to ensure estimated costs align with final project costs. The Stafford Act allows the President to offer an \"in-lieu\" contribution based on estimated damage costs for eligible facilities, currently only applicable to permanent work projects. FEMA can offer an \"in-lieu\" contribution for eligible facilities, allowing funds to be used for alternate projects instead of rebuilding after a disaster. This decision must benefit public welfare, such as building a new high school or enhancing a nearby police station based on community needs. FEMA allows for in-lieu contributions for eligible facilities, benefiting public welfare in the same general area as the original project. The Cost Estimating Format (CEF) is used to estimate damages and determine the amount of assistance for the original project. The CEF was developed after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake and is not used for small projects. FEMA is required by law to reduce the in-lieu contribution based on the CEF estimate. FEMA is obligated by law to reduce the amount of assistance contributed in-lieu to the applicant for the new project. For governmental applicants, the reduction is 10% of the federal share of eligible costs for repairing the existing facility, and for private nonprofit applicants, the reduction is 25% of the federal share. The reduction of the federal share of assistance for public facility in-lieu projects was lowered from 25% to 10% by P.L. 109-347. FEMA applies the reduction to the federal share of the estimated eligible cost of repairing the current facility, not the estimated costs of new project or mitigation activities. This penalty on the in-lieu contribution can be considered a deterrent to applicants from recovering facilities in innovative ways. Under alternative procedures for the PA Program, in-lieu contributions for projects are not reduced by 10% for public facilities or 25% for private nonprofit facilities. FEMA rarely uses the authority for in-lieu contributions, with only a small percentage of projects receiving this benefit. Certain types of facilities are more likely to receive in-lieu contributions, such as roads. Improved projects for permanent work assistance allow applicants to significantly alter the pre-disaster design of the facility when repairing or replacing an eligible facility. An improved project does not have a reduced federal cost share like in-lieu contributions, but FEMA only provides the federal share for repairing/replacing the facility as originally designed, not for additional improvements. FEMA provides assistance for improved projects by estimating the original project cost minus improvements using the CEF. For example, if a fire station wants to add a third truck bay, FEMA won't cover the additional cost. SRIA directs FEMA to issue grants for large projects based on estimated eligible costs. FEMA requires estimation procedures to include methods for using a \"fixed\" estimate, accepting estimates from licensed engineers, and utilizing an independent expert panel when necessary. FEMA requires estimation procedures to include methods for using a \"fixed\" estimate, accepting estimates from licensed engineers, and utilizing an independent expert panel when necessary. The independent expert panel is used to review and validate cost estimates over $5 million, with FEMA covering all expenses. SRIA guidelines dictate how discrepancies between estimated and actual project costs are handled, with applicants responsible for overages and allowed to use extra funds for hazard mitigation or other PA operations. FEMA uses actual cost basis for reimbursing grantees for large projects, utilizing the CEF tool to anticipate project expenditures. Funds are obligated at project approval but disbursed incrementally as costs are documented. Full assistance is provided only after all eligible work is completed. Regulations govern the reimbursement process, allowing for project scope evolution. FEMA uses actual cost basis for reimbursing grantees for large projects, with regulations allowing for project scope evolution as long as changes are approved. Section 205(d) of DMA 2000 required the President to develop procedures for awarding grants based on estimates of eligible costs, but final regulations have not been issued. In October 2013, FEMA proposed a final rule to implement grant estimating procedures. The FEMA proposed a final rule in October 2013 to implement grant estimating procedures required by DMA 2000. The impact on the PA Program of this proposed change is significant, with large, permanent work projects accounting for a majority of federal obligations for assistance. If the regulation becomes final, only large, emergency work projects would be reimbursed on an actual cost basis. The FEMA proposed a final rule in October 2013 to implement grant estimating procedures required by DMA 2000. Large, permanent work projects more than 90% complete at the time of estimation would still be reimbursed on an actual cost basis. The status of the statutory changes made by DMA 2000 only become effective after these regulations are finalized. If the DMA 2000 grant estimation regulation is finalized by FEMA, there may be two options available for applicants to receive grants for large, permanent work projects. These options would be the new DMA 2000 method and the alternative procedure method, depending on FEMA's decision to continue the alternative procedures pilot or implement it permanently. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act (SRIA) reformed the PA Program under the Stafford Act by creating alternative procedures. These changes were initially piloted under Section 689j of P.L. 109-295. FEMA implemented the SRIA alternative procedures, which may be of interest to Congress. The changes made by SRIA to the PA Program are discussed in detail in prior sections of the report. FEMA established the Public Assistance Alternative Procedures (PAAP) Pilot Program under the authority granted by Congress in the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act (SRIA). The program includes new rules for alternative procedures on debris removal projects in emergency work and large, permanent work projects. FEMA has provided guides and supplementary documents on its website for administering the PAAP Pilot Program. It is uncertain if FEMA will revise regulations on the PA Program to formally adopt the alternative procedures. FEMA established the PAAP Pilot Program under the authority granted by Congress in the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act (SRIA) to introduce alternative procedures for debris removal projects. FEMA has not yet implemented fixed-estimate grants for debris removal emergency work projects due to challenges in estimating debris amounts accurately. FEMA has not received sufficient interest in using alternative procedures for debris removal grants. They currently estimate debris amounts to provide expedited payments to grantees. A pilot program for fixed grant estimating procedures was not widely used, so its impact is unclear. SRIA does not specify how applicants can participate in alternative procedures. FEMA allows applicants to choose alternative procedures at their discretion on a project-by-project basis, offering flexibility compared to other methods. Early statistics show varying popularity among different alternative procedures. FEMA allows applicants to choose alternative procedures for PA projects, with flexibility for disasters declared after a certain date. The PAAP Pilot Program guidance offers alternative procedures for permanent work projects for disasters declared on or after May 20, 2013. FEMA has approved alternative procedures for projects in Louisiana for Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav. FEMA's PAAP Pilot Program allows alternative procedures for disaster declarations after May 20, 2013. The pilot period ends on June 27, 2015, with a review of effectiveness to determine its continuation. The PAAP Pilot Program, which allows alternative procedures for disaster declarations, does not have an explicit end date. Analysis of PA Program spending for major disasters from FY2000 to FY2013 was conducted, excluding data from FY2014 and early FY2015 due to potential modifications. Data for the analysis were derived from FEMA datasets available on the OpenFEMA website. The PA Program is funded from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The PA Program is financed from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) without a distinct appropriation. It has been the largest source of federal obligations from the DRF, with more than 90% of major disaster declarations receiving assistance through the PA Program. PA grants accounted for 47% of total DRF obligations for major disaster declarations. During the time period analyzed, PA grants funded from the DRF ranged from 36% to 66% of overall obligations. Federal obligations for PA grants varied between $0.37 billion and $17.1 billion per fiscal year, with an average annual obligation of $3.9 billion. The federal government typically covered 75% of PA costs, but this percentage could be increased for certain declarations. During FY2005, Hurricane Katrina led to the largest amount of PA obligations in a single year, totaling over $14.8 billion for Louisiana and Mississippi. FY2013 is projected to have increased obligations due to disaster declarations like Hurricane Sandy. On average, PA grants for major disaster declarations amount to $69.8 million, with over half receiving less than $10 million in federal assistance. FEMA makes individual project worksheets for the PA Program publicly available, starting from FY1998. The worksheets from FEMA for the PA Program provide details on project amounts, categories, and grant administration. The data can be used to measure obligations within the program. Total spending in the PA Program is divided into emergency work, permanent work, and grantee management costs. Permanent work accounted for more than half of the spending from FY2000-FY2013. From FY2000-FY2013, federal obligations for the PA Program were divided into permanent work (57%), emergency work (40%), and grantee management costs (2%). Obligations for permanent work varied greatly, with public buildings being the largest category. Emergency work was split between debris removal and emergency protective measures, with Category A accounting for $9.8 billion and Category B for $11.3 billion. The annual federal obligations for permanent work and emergency work projects under the PA Program varied greatly from FY2000 to FY2013, with some well-known disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy having obligations in the billions of dollars. More than half of all major declarations had obligations less than $10 million per disaster. The data in Figure 4 and Table 4 illustrate this significant difference in obligations for each category of work. The largest 25% of disasters account for 91.3% of federal obligations for the PA Program, with a significant decline in obligation amounts between the most costly disasters and the next quartile. The majority of federal obligations are for large projects above $120,000, with small projects accounting for no more than 10% of obligations in most categories. Category C, which includes repairs to non-federally owned roads and bridges, had 34% of federal obligations for small projects. During FY2000 to FY2013, small projects accounted for 87% of project worksheets in the FEMA dataset. Over this period, $6.6 billion was obligated by FEMA to private nonprofit facilities, with the highest spending in FY2005 and FY2013. Public buildings received over 77% of all PA obligations for PNPs. Between FY2000 and FY2013, FEMA obligated $6.6 billion to private nonprofit facilities, with public buildings and utilities receiving over 77% of the funds. More than 8,400 PNPs received grant assistance, with large projects involving universities, hospitals, and cooperatives. Examples include Midwest Energy, Inc. receiving $60 million after winter storms in Kansas, and Memorial Hermann hospital system receiving over $100 million after Tropical Storm Allison. Volunteer fire departments also received grants for emergency measures. The average obligation per PNP per disaster was $566,000. Between FY2000 and FY2013, FEMA provided over $6.6 billion in grant assistance to private nonprofit facilities, with public buildings and utilities receiving the majority of the funds. The funding for hazard mitigation activities under the Stafford Act saw a significant increase in FY2013 due to major disaster declarations following Hurricane Sandy, with over $2 billion allocated for PA mitigation expenses in New York and New Jersey. The majority of this funding was used for public building and public utility projects. Between FY2000 and FY2013, federal obligations for PA mitigation assistance in New York and New Jersey following Hurricane Sandy totaled $1.7 billion. PA mitigation expenses accounted for 38% of total project costs on average, with New York and New Jersey projects seeing expenses make up 50% of total costs. Excluding these two declarations, PA mitigation costs fell to 29% of total project costs. The analysis did not include costs for bringing facilities into compliance with existing standards. The PA Program may provide considerable hazard mitigation assistance by including costs for bringing facilities into compliance with existing standards. Congress may consider various policy issues related to the broadly worded statutes of the Stafford Act that grant the PA Program's authorities. FEMA develops complex policies and procedures for implementing the program when key definitions are not specified in the law. The Stafford Act grants FEMA administrative discretion in interpreting key definitions and providing assistance. Congress has revised policies, such as in SRIA, to address issues like eligible labor costs and FEMA regulations for individual and household assistance. The PA Program under the Stafford Act allows FEMA to provide assistance to individuals and households. Congress has passed laws like the PETS Act to clarify FEMA's authority when needed. Congress can review and override FEMA policies for the PA Program or codify existing policies to ensure they cannot be changed without legislative action. The PA Program is constantly evolving through administrative policy revisions. The PA Program, governed by FEMA's 9500 Policy Series, undergoes revisions to administrative policies. These policies, required to be open for public comment as per the Stafford Act, are shared on FEMA's website and in the Federal Register. Feedback is solicited through various channels, although FEMA's review process may not include certain standard procedures like cost-benefit analysis and paperwork reduction reviews outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act. Congress may consider changing the policy revision process for FEMA's PA Program, possibly by amending Section 325 of the Stafford Act to create formal reporting requirements, expand consultation requirements with stakeholders, and establish conditions for more extensive APA procedures. The PA Program policy revision process for FEMA may be revised by Congress to streamline procedures and allow for more rapid changes. The SRIA reformed the PA Program by creating alternative procedures through the PAAP Pilot Program to reduce costs and increase flexibility in providing assistance. The SRIA aims to reduce costs and increase flexibility in providing assistance through alternative procedures in the PA Program. It also requires the DHS IG to assess the effectiveness of these procedures for permanent work projects. The IG's report is required to assess whether alternative procedures increased the speed of disaster recovery, used accurate estimates, and should be continued with any recommendations for changes. It is to be issued three to five years after the enactment of SRIA and provided to the committees of jurisdiction for the Stafford Act. Congress has also directed FEMA to produce quarterly reports on the implementation of the PAAP Pilot Program, especially for permanent work projects. The quarterly reports for the PAAP Pilot Program are required to include FEMA's assessment of challenges, recommendations, financial summaries of permanent work projects, and descriptions of projects over $50 million. These reports, along with the IG's report, may guide Congress on potential revisions to the Stafford Act to improve the PA Program. Congressional oversight may focus on whether the Pilot Program has achieved its intended goals and if FEMA's guidance has been correctly interpreted. The FEMA Pilot Program guidance aligns with Congress's policy intentions, ensuring communities receive necessary information and assistance. Both the federal government and applicants share similar views on the benefits and costs of alternative procedures. FEMA is finalizing a rule requiring grants based on estimates for large projects, as mandated by DMA 2000. The DMA 2000 grant estimation procedures were developed in 2002 and would have undergone multiple reviews if FEMA had implemented a final rule by October 2006. The delay in implementation may have led to unaccounted changes in the estimating procedures. FEMA acknowledges this issue in their proposed rulemaking. Congress may need to re-engage with the expert panel to validate the 10 percent threshold recommendation from the DMA 2000 grant estimation procedures. Additionally, Congress should consider the alternative procedures established by SRIA for fixed-estimate grants and evaluate the differences between the two methods. Congress may need to re-engage with the expert panel to validate the 10 percent threshold recommendation from the DMA 2000 grant estimation procedures. Congress should also consider the differences between the SRIA alternative procedure methods and the DMA 2000 methods, and evaluate if some of the differences in law for SRIA's grant estimating procedures should apply to the DMA 2000 procedures, and vice versa. Additionally, Congress could prevent, delay, reform, or endorse the implementation of the DMA 2000 grant estimating procedure before it is implemented. The DHS IG's Office of Emergency Management Oversight produces audits for the PA Program to recoup improperly provided funds and improve management. Audits for FY2009 to FY2013 questioned over $1.9 billion in PA assistance, recommending $387 million be put to better use. However, FEMA only recovered 13% of questioned costs and 64% of funds that could be put to better use. FEMA has established a new \"Recovery Audits Unit\" within its Recovery Directorate to improve performance based on internal reviews of audits issued between 2011 and 2014. The DHS IG has also started conducting proactive audits of the PA Program to prevent misuse of funds, resulting in published audits that allow applicants to correct noncompliance before spending the majority of their funds. Congress may evaluate FEMA's new Recovery Audits Unit and DHS IG's proactive approach to address noncompliance with Federal regulations in the PA Program. Recommendations from various entities, including GAO, suggest considering issues for improving PA Program assistance, such as setting minimum and maximum amounts for management award pass-through to subgrantees/applicants. In an audit, GAO found that few grantees passed through management assistance to subgrantees, confirmed by FEMA. Congress may consider providing assistance for administrative costs to prevent misuse of PA Program funds. FEMA should reestablish its pre-2009 method of providing management cost assistance. The CRS's research on the PA Program revealed challenges with existing data on projects, including limitations in implementing legal requirements to reduce cost-shares. GAO also noted issues with data collection in the STEP Pilot Program after Hurricane Sandy. Overall, policy issues within the program may be difficult to address. CRS research highlights challenges in evaluating policy issues due to data limitations in the PA Program. For example, FEMA struggles to track PNPs applying for SBA loans before seeking grant assistance, hindering assessment of financial needs post-disaster. Additionally, it is hard to determine if facilities receiving PA mitigation assistance have reduced damage in future disasters. Congress may need to oversee FEMA's efforts to enhance data quality for better program evaluation. FEMA established \"FEMAStat\" in 2011 to review its performance based on data. Congress should oversee the implementation and effectiveness of data-based initiatives like FEMAStat to improve the quality of data collected by the PA Program. Congressional oversight may also include evaluating the quality of FEMA's database systems and funding for database improvements. The Inspector General highlighted issues with multiple database systems hindering information tracking in FEMA. Congress may need to evaluate and potentially improve the existing system rather than implementing a new one. Considerations for expanding or restricting eligibility for the PA Program should also be explored. The PA Program was initially limited to public facilities but was expanded in 1971 to include private nonprofit medical facilities under P.L. 92-209. Subsequent legislation further expanded assistance to certain private nonprofit facilities. The PA Program, established in 1971, was initially limited to public facilities but expanded to include certain private nonprofit medical facilities. Amendments in 1988 and DMA 2000 further expanded assistance to eligible private nonprofit organizations (PNPs). Congress may need to evaluate the scope of eligibility for PNPs, considering if it is too inclusive or exclusive for entities providing essential services of a governmental nature to the public. Some PNPs must apply to the SBA before receiving assistance from the PA Program. Private entities, including owners of private infrastructure facilities and individual homeowners, are excluded from PA Program assistance for emergency and permanent work. However, certain private nonprofit organizations, such as houses of worship, are allowed to apply directly for grant assistance. Private homeowners may receive assistance through separate provisions. Private entities, including private infrastructure facilities and homeowners, are excluded from PA Program assistance. Congress may consider evaluating the exclusion of private facilities for permanent work assistance, citing concerns over moral hazards, capital market influence, and cost. Other governmental assistance programs like SBA disaster loans or the Economic Development Agency could address private infrastructure needs. In situational-dependent authorizations may also provide necessary private infrastructure assistance. Private entities, including private infrastructure facilities, are excluded from PA Program assistance. Congress may consider expanding eligibility to authorize assistance to private facilities, potentially through a combination of grant and loan assistance. The policy argument for providing assistance through the PA Program is strong, especially for critical infrastructure determined by the President or Secretary of DHS. The PA Program may need to consider expanding eligibility to include private infrastructure facilities. Congress may also consider additional restrictions on assistance, such as requiring owners to obtain insurance or mitigate future disaster risks. Hazard mitigation assistance can be provided for repairing eligible facilities in the PA Program. The PA Program provides assistance for repairing eligible facilities to reduce future risk, in addition to bringing them up to current codes and standards. FEMA has allocated billions in hazard mitigation assistance, including funds for specific projects like the NYU Langone Medical Center after Hurricane Sandy. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program also allows for cost-effective measures to reduce future risk. The PA Program provides hazard mitigation assistance, which can increase federal assistance through the HMGP. Congress may need to align various mitigation authorities and review FEMA's criteria for providing assistance. FEMA's policy for hazard mitigation assistance includes evaluating criteria for determining if measures will reduce future disaster costs. There is a debate on whether to make the SRIA alternative procedures for PA mitigation assistance permanent or revoke them. Additionally, there is a suggestion to cap the total amount of PA mitigation assistance per project. The CRS analysis of FEMA data shows that PA mitigation assistance accounts for 38% of the federal obligation for projects. Congress may need to consider providing assistance for mitigation measures not required by building codes, and allowing costs for repairing/replacing facilities to improved standards. The President recently revised E.O. 11988, Floodplain Management, with Executive Order 13960, Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard. This could lead to changes in federal regulations on floodplain management and hazard mitigation for federal investments in floodplains. The FFRMS may increase requirements for floodplain management, specifically by requiring additional \"freeboard\" for facilities exceeding the 50% damage threshold. This would raise project costs and federal obligations. Congress may need to assess the impact of E.O. 13960 and the FFRMS on the PA Program to ensure alignment with Congressional intentions. Congress may consider adjusting the FFRMS freeboard requirements for PA permanent work projects, potentially expanding the scope or changing the height requirements. The PA Program's eligibility often overlaps with other federal disaster assistance programs, leading to potential duplication issues under the Stafford Act. FEMA adheres to legal restrictions in the Stafford Act to prevent duplication of benefits by only providing assistance for an activity from one federal program. This restriction applies even if the other federal program lacks sufficient appropriations. FEMA aims to avoid redundancies by deferring to more specific assistance authorities from other agencies. FEMA follows legal restrictions in the Stafford Act to prevent duplication of benefits by deferring to more specific assistance authorities from other agencies like USACE and NRCS for flood control and watershed development projects. FEMA is generally prevented, not legally restricted, from providing permanent work assistance in certain circumstances. The eligibility of activities for assistance under Stafford Act authority is assessed on a case-by-case basis when other federal authorities are more specific. This can cause confusion for grantees who are unsure which federal program will provide assistance. Different programs have different cost shares and eligibility regulations, impacting the amount of spending required by the grantee. The cost-share and eligibility regulations of different federal programs can impact the amount of spending required by the grantee. FEMA may deny assistance under the Stafford Act if another agency's program is more specific and lacks sufficient appropriations. FEMA may deny assistance under the Stafford Act if another agency's program has more specific authority, even if that agency has zero appropriations. The Stafford Act clarifies potential redundancy between the PA Program and SBA's disaster loan program. PNPs providing critical services can apply to FEMA first for permanent work assistance. Congress has revoked disaster assistance authorities of federal agencies to avoid redundancy with the Stafford Act. For example, HUD's authority to repair public housing facilities and the Department of Education's authority to assist schools were repealed. FEMA can interpret existing legal provisions to pay for activities authorized by other federal programs, such as reimbursing the Department of Justice for deploying federal law enforcement officers. The Department of Justice can deploy federal law enforcement officers for PA emergency protective measures under the Stafford Act. Congress clarified the role of the Stafford Act and PA Program in new disaster assistance authorities. This includes provisions in the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program in MAP-21, allowing FEMA to provide assistance without affecting other agency funds. Congress amended the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program in MAP-21 to allow for debris removal assistance in incidents not declared major disasters under the Stafford Act. The PA Program is now the primary source of debris removal assistance for federal-aid roads in disaster declarations. Congress may need to assess the PA Program's role to address redundancies in eligibility with other federal authorities. Options include requiring further regulations on when Stafford Act authorities provide assistance alongside specific federal authorities. Congress may need to consider revising FEMA's regulations for permanent work, seeking a formal opinion on the use of Stafford Act authorities when other federal agencies lack funding, providing direction on deferring to more specific authorities, and clarifying the role of Stafford Act authorities in relation to other federal disaster assistance programs. The federal government's disaster relief framework has evolved over time, with Congress considering whether the Public Assistance Grant Program should be the primary source of funding for disaster assistance. This shift from reactive to proactive disaster management began in the mid-20th century, leading to the gradual expansion of legal frameworks for disaster relief. The legal framework for federal disaster relief has expanded over time. In 1950, Congress passed the Federal Disaster Relief Act (P.L. 81-875), establishing permanent authority for federal disaster relief activities. The Disaster Relief Acts of 1970 and 1974 further expanded assistance grants for repair and restoration of public facilities. The Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988 made significant changes to the PA Program, including setting federal cost-shares, creating an insurance requirement, and establishing an appeal process. Subsequent statutes like the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 and the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act have also impacted the program. The PA Program has been influenced by various statutes such as the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act, and the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. Appendix B discusses concerns with FEMA's data on individual worksheets for PA grants, highlighting potential caveats for analysis. The analysis in the report used datasets of PA Program project worksheets and DRF obligations from FEMA. The PA Program utilizes infrastructure-related spending for grants and Technical Assistance Contracts (TAC) to hire contract staff. Data for analysis was provided by FEMA for FY2000 through FY2013. Obligation totals were derived from publicly available data on the OpenFEMA website. Separate datasets were provided by FEMA for obligations related to private nonprofit facilities and hazard mitigation expenses within the PA Program. FEMA defines a project as \"a logical method of performing work as a result of a declared event.\" Applicants can combine work items into a single project as long as it is logical and consistent with FEMA criteria. FEMA provides accepted methods for consolidating projects, such as combining work items related to the same infrastructure system or facility type. The ability to consolidate eligible activities onto a single project worksheet has administrative benefits for both FEMA and applicants, but it makes it difficult to capture discrete work items and compare across disasters. Project consolidation decisions impact the comparison of total projects within a disaster. The public project worksheet dataset used by CRS includes over 621,000 individual project worksheets, but some do not represent a project. The project worksheets include a number of financial reconciliations for grantee adjustments, leading to the creation of new worksheets to correct issues. These adjustments are made in Category Z, State Management. The data includes disaster declarations with negative obligation totals in Category Z due to system-generated reconciliations. These reconciliations may have adjusted costs without being identified, limiting the analysis to the number of projects or average cost per project. The analysis in the report includes various categorizations not found in publicly available data, such as hazard mitigation and projects using alternative procedures. Proper manual categorization is required for data entries like project worksheets for financial reconciliations to accurately identify real projects. The FEMA staff identified project worksheets meeting specific criteria through text searches of FEMA data. Inconsistencies in tracking data across time, region, or declaration may exist due to individual users inputting information, making it difficult to recreate or verify the analysis using publicly available data."
