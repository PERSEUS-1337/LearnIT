    "content": "The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies are funded by P.L. 110-5, the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2007. The law maintains funds at the FY2006 account level, with agencies required to submit fund allocations within 30 days of enactment. This bill covers agencies in the Department of the Interior, Forest Service, and other related departments and bureaus. The bill provides funds for agencies in the Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and Environmental Protection Agency. It also includes funding for arts and cultural agencies like the Smithsonian Institution and National Endowment for the Arts. Additionally, appropriations laws for Interior and Related Agencies have funded activities within the Department of Energy in recent years. The FY2006 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations law consolidated jurisdiction over DOE and EPA under House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees. The FY2007 legislation followed a similar structure with three primary titles providing funding for Interior agencies, EPA, and other programs. The report discusses EPA in Title II and other agencies, programs, and entities in Title III. It does not include FY2007 enacted levels as agencies determine their funding levels. Appropriations represent total funds available, including regular annual and supplemental appropriations. Increases and decreases are calculated based on comparisons between FY2007 funding levels and those requested by the President for FY2007 and appropriated for FY2006. The House Committee on Appropriations is the primary source of funding figures in the report. The funding figures used in the report are primarily sourced from the House Committee on Appropriations, with additional information from the Senate Committee on Appropriations, agency budget justifications, and the Congressional Record. Funding details for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2007 are outlined in P.L. 110-5, which provides continuing appropriations until September 30, 2007. The law maintains funding at the FY2006 account level, with agencies required to submit allocations below the account level for programs and activities. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees require submissions of fund allocations below the account level within 30 days of enactment. Prior to P.L. 110-5, continuing funds were provided to Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies based on FY2006 or House-passed levels for FY2007. The FY2007 regular annual appropriations bill provided $26.05 billion for these agencies, slightly above the House-passed level. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill for FY2007 proposed changes in funding levels for various agencies. This included decreases for the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, and Environmental Protection Agency, while increases were seen for the Indian Health Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Smithsonian Institution. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted amendments for the Smithsonian Institution, requiring re-negotiation of OCS oil and gas leases without royalties. The House passed a bill providing $25.94 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2007, a 2% decrease from the previous year. The House passed a bill with $25.94 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2007, including amendments to prohibit certain uses of funds and increase funding for specific programs. The House Appropriations Committee adopted amendments to the bill with $25.94 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2007. Issues debated included land sales under FLTFA and the sale of National Forest System lands. The President's FY2007 budget assumed opening part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a topic of controversy regarding oil and gas exploration. Funding debates for BIA Schools and IHS Hospitals, as well as Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, are also contentious issues. The report discusses funding issues for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, Indian Trust Funds, and Land Acquisition, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The curr_chunk discusses various federal programs and issues such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund, Outer Continental Shelf Leasing, Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program, Royalty Relief for oil and gas companies, and the Smithsonian Institution. The curr_chunk discusses funding for the Smithsonian Institution, Superfund cleanup needs, Wildland Fire Fighting funding levels, borrowing funds for wildfires, and environmental analysis challenges. The curr_chunk discusses the Bureau of Land Management's management of public land for various uses, including energy development and fire management on DOI lands. Congressional consideration of the FY2007 Interior appropriations bill and challenges to agency decisions on fuel reduction activities are also mentioned. The Bureau of Land Management manages public land for energy development and wildland fire management on DOI lands. The House approved $1.79 billion and the Senate reported $1.80 billion for BLM in FY2007. The Administration proposed amending the FLTFA to redirect proceeds from land sales to reduce the deficit. Legislation would be required for this change. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved funding increases for the Bureau of Land Management in FY2007, with the House allocating $867.7 million and the Senate reporting $876.9 million. Both committees supported the Administration's approach to decrease funds for some programs while increasing funds for others, such as cultural resources. In FY2007, funding for the Bureau of Land Management saw increases for cultural resources and energy/minerals. The House approved $16.6 million for cultural resources, while the Senate committee allocated $18.1 million. Energy and minerals received $134.7 million, with the House supporting $133.0 million and the Senate reporting $138.0 million. The budget aimed to enhance access to energy resources on federal lands and expedite oil shale development. The budget for the Bureau of Land Management in FY2007 included increases for cultural resources and energy/minerals. The House approved $16.6 million for cultural resources, while the Senate committee allocated $18.1 million. Energy and minerals received $134.7 million, with the House supporting $133.0 million and the Senate reporting $138.0 million. The budget aimed to enhance access to energy resources on federal lands and expedite oil shale development. In contrast, the budget assumed legislation in 2006 to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for development, seeking an increase for preparing and implementing an ANWR leasing program and managing energy development activities in the National Petroleum Reserve\u2014Alaska. The House, Senate Appropriations Committee, and Administration had differing approaches relative to FY2006 levels for various programs. In FY2007, the budget for the Bureau of Land Management included increases for cultural resources and energy/minerals. The House approved $16.6 million for cultural resources, while the Senate committee allocated $18.1 million. Energy and minerals received $134.7 million, with the House supporting $133.0 million and the Senate reporting $138.0 million. The budget aimed to enhance access to energy resources on federal lands and expedite oil shale development. The House, Senate Appropriations Committee, and Administration had differing approaches relative to FY2006 levels for various programs. The Administration and House sought $35.2 million for conveyance of lands in Alaska, a 12% cut, but the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended level funding at $40.0 million. Both the House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills continued to bar funds from being used for energy leasing activities within the boundaries of national monuments, as they were on January 20, 2001. The amendment aims to prevent the sale or slaughter of wild horses and burros by prohibiting funds in the bill from being used for that purpose. Advocates suggest using fertility control as an alternative to reduce herd sizes on federal lands. Opponents argue that the sale authority is necessary due to insufficient efforts in reducing herd sizes through adoptions. In FY2007, the House approved $769.3 million for Wildland Fire Management, a $14.0 million increase from FY2006. The Senate recommended $776.6 million, a $21.4 million increase. Both levels provided funding for fire preparedness and suppression, with increases from the previous year. In FY2007, funding for Wildland Fire Management increased by $26.3 million (11%) from FY2006 to cover the 10-year average cost of fire suppression. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about high suppression costs and directed DOI and the FS to review fires with costs over $10.0 million. Reductions were made in other areas, such as a $8.3 million (4%) decrease for hazardous fuels reduction. The Administration and House aimed to eliminate funds for state and local fire assistance, while the Senate included $5.0 million for this purpose, emphasizing the effectiveness of rural and volunteer fire departments. Volunteer fire departments are effective in responding to fires and saving money for the federal government. The FY2006 funding level for state and local fire assistance was $9.9 million. Wildland fire funds are used for fire fighting on Interior Department lands. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of a comprehensive plan to deal with wildfire management needs. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of a comprehensive plan to deal with the Nation's wildfire management needs and directed the development of a strategy. Funding allocation for priority projects was questioned, and a report was requested from DOI. Funding levels for BLM construction and Land Acquisition in FY2007 saw varying support and cuts from different entities. The House Appropriations Committee approved a 64% decrease in funding for BLM land acquisition, citing it as a low priority. Funding for BLM acquisitions has decreased steadily from $49.9 million in FY2002 to $8.6 million in FY2006, allocated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. For more information, visit the Department of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management websites. The President requested $1.29 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for FY2007, with the House approving less and the Senate Appropriations Committee approving more. The largest portion of the FWS annual appropriation is for the Resources Management account, which includes programs like the Endangered Species program and Law Enforcement. The President's budget also proposed opening part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas exploration. The budget proposed opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas exploration, with the first lease sale planned for FY2008. It was estimated to generate $4.0 billion in federal revenues over five years. Additionally, there was controversy over funding for the Endangered Species program, with proposed reductions in FY2007. The President's request for conservation programs in FY2007 included increases in the Landowner Incentive Program and Stewardship Grants. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund would remain at $80.0 million, with a proposed earmark for the Idaho Salmon and Clearwater River Basins Habitat Account. The House approved cuts in some programs but a modest increase in others. The President's request for conservation programs in FY2007 included increases in the Landowner Incentive Program and Stewardship Grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved cuts in some programs but otherwise supported the requests. Total funding for the Endangered Species program would decrease slightly, while refuge operations and maintenance funding would see a slight increase. Law Enforcement funding would also see a modest increase. The Administration proposed $7.4 million for the study of avian flu in FY2007, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The focus will be on monitoring the virus spread through wild birds, particularly in Alaska, the Pacific Flyway, and Pacific islands. The funds will be used for monitoring, testing, and cooperation with other agencies. The Committee report directed funds for monitoring and testing in Alaska and \"vector control efforts in other areas.\" The House approved $19.8 million for Land Acquisition, a decrease of 29%, earmarking funding for six refuges in the northeast. The Senate approved $42.3 million for acquisitions funded by LWCF. The program focuses on acquiring federal refuge land and related functions. In recent years, funding for traditional land acquisition has decreased. The Administration reserved $13.7 million for specified acquisitions in FY2007, with the House-passed bill allocating a smaller fraction to acquisition. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported an increase to $42.3 million, earmarking some funds for an Alaskan land exchange. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands of the NWRS. Additional appropriations are needed as receipts are insufficient. The President requested $10.8 million for FY2007, down from $14.2 million in FY2006. The House-passed figure was $14.2 million, as in FY2006. The MSCF has garnered significant interest despite its small size, benefiting various wildlife species. The President's FY2007 budget proposed moving funding from the NMBCF to the MSCF, which was rejected by Congress. The proposed budget for FY2007 included $8.2 million for the MSCF, cutting funding for some species while increasing it for neotropical migratory birds. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee had differing approaches to funding levels. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants also play a role in funding wildlife conservation efforts. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, created in FY2001, help fund conservation efforts for species of concern to states, territories, and tribes. The program receives support from governments and funds conservation plans and projects. The President proposed an increase to $74.7 million in FY2007, but the House approved a decrease to $50.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved maintaining the FY2006 funding level. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the FY2006 funding level of $50.0 million for State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, setting aside $5.9 million for tribal grants. Both the House and Senate rejected the President's proposal for competitive grants. For more information, visit the Fish and Wildlife Service website. The National Park Service (NPS) oversees 390 diverse park units covering 85 million acres, with a mission to protect and preserve natural and historic areas for public access. The Park System includes various designations like national parks, monuments, and historic sites. The NPS also supports conservation activities outside the Park System through grant programs and partnerships. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill provided $2.23 billion for the NPS, $52.4 million more than the House-passed bill and $72.4 million above the budget request. The NPS budget request aims to cut the federal budget deficit but may impact visitor programs and services due to inflation and rising costs. Amendments adopted by the House increased funding for the Operation of the National Park System by $1.0 million. The House Appropriations Committee increased funding for the National Park System by $1.0 million to enhance security at the Statue of Liberty. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill directed the NPS to maintain the current rule allowing snowmobile use in certain national parks for three more years. The House Appropriations Committee increased funding for the National Park System by $1.0 million to enhance security at the Statue of Liberty. The park operations line-item is the primary source of funding for national parks, covering essential activities, programs, and services. The House-passed bill for FY2007 would extend protection for one additional year. Operations funding is mainly provided to park managers for resource protection, visitor services, facility maintenance, and employee costs. The House Appropriations Committee criticized a Department policy favoring law enforcement rangers over other functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.75 billion for operation of the Park System for FY2007, with a focus on high-priority facility maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation projects. An NPS \"core operations analysis\" program aims to reduce fixed costs by 20%-30% without compromising resource protection and visitor hospitality functions. 53 park units have completed studies, with 34 more scheduled to finish by the end of FY2006, and all unit studies are expected to be completed by the end of 2011. The NPS aims to complete all unit studies by the end of 2011. Park advocacy groups seek additional funding for park operations, security, land acquisition, and repairs. The U.S. Park Police provide law enforcement services in urban areas like Washington, DC, New York City, and San Francisco. The U.S. Park Police provide specialized law enforcement services to park units system-wide, with increased funding proposed for security at iconic parks and recruitment of new officers. An internal review in 2004 redefined USPP priorities to focus on protecting iconic park units, patrolling the National Mall, managing special events, conducting criminal investigations, and traffic control. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $53.5 million for park recreation and resource protection programs, $6.3 million more than the House allowance. This includes funding for state and local community efforts to preserve natural, cultural, and historic resources. The proposed decrease in funding was due to the elimination of the statutory and contractual aid program for specific sites, which was rejected by Congress in previous years. The House agreed not to fund statutory and contractual aid, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5.3 million for this program. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees rejected the Administration's proposal to reduce funding for the heritage partnership program and transfer it to the Historic Preservation Fund. The Senate recommended $14.1 million for the program, above the House allowance and FY2006 levels. The House did not provide funds for the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Water Trail initiative, while the Senate recommended $1.6 million for it. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 million for the NPS program, commending efforts to improve grant management. They also recommended $234.9 million for NPS construction, including funding for the Harpers Ferry Center not proposed by the NPS. Cuts in construction funds could limit maintenance reduction efforts. The Administration is proposing to hold the line against further backlog accumulation in the NPS maintenance by sustaining the same level of \"facility condition index.\" FY2006 appropriations for the NPS under the Land and Water Conservation Fund were $47.0 million, with funds allocated for land acquisition and state assistance programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $63.4 million for NPS land acquisition and state assistance, exceeding the House allowance and request. They also recommended $33.4 million for the federal side of LWCF, with $5.0 million specified for the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial. The request for state assistance funds was limited to $1.6 million for administrative expenses. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $28.4 million for state assistance grants and $1.6 million for administrative expenses. S. 3562 would provide $450 million annually for LWCF state assistance from offshore oil and gas development leases in the Gulf of Mexico, near Florida. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) provides grants for restoring historic districts, sites, buildings, and objects significant in American history and culture. The HPF is funded on a 60% federal/40% state matching share basis and includes funding for Save America's Treasures and Preserve America grants. For FY2007, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $70.7 million for the HPF, $44.5 million below the FY2006 appropriation. Both the House-passed and Senate Appropriations Committee-reported measure would include $35.7 million for grants-in-aid to state historic preservation offices, $3.9 million for Tribal grants, and $1.0 million for preserving and restoring historic buildings and structures on campuses of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The House and Senate Appropriations Committee disagreed with the Administration's FY2007 request regarding the America's Heritage and Preservation Partnership program and National Heritage areas funding. The NPS supports National Heritage Areas managed by private or state organizations. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $30.0 million for Save America's Treasures, while the House passed bill allocated $15.0 million. Save America's Treasures aims to preserve nationally significant intellectual. Save America's Treasures aims to preserve nationally significant intellectual and cultural artifacts and historic structures. Preserve America grants-in-aid were created to support community efforts in resource management and heritage tourism. The FY2007 House-passed bill would provide $3.0 million for Preserve America, while the Senate Appropriations Committee reported that $10.0 million of the $30.0 million for Save America's Treasures could be used for Preserve America grants. Pending legislation (H.R. 3446 and S. 1378) would reauthorize the Historic Preservation Fund through FY2011 and FY2015, making changes to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. For more information on National Park Service and Historic Preservation, visit their respective websites. USGS is a leading science agency in physical and biological research. The US Geological Survey (USGS) is a key science agency providing information on natural hazards, the environment, energy, minerals, water, and biology. It also serves as a mapping agency and monitors water resources. The Administration is focusing on USGS's role in monitoring natural hazards, land cover changes, and mineral resources in FY2007, with a requested budget of $944.8 million. The Administration requested $944.8 million for the USGS in FY2007, $36.1 million below FY2006. The House bill has $986.4 million, $41.7 million above the request. The Senate bill has $980.0 million, $0.8 million below FY2006, $35.2 million above the request, and $6.5 million below the House bill. The largest proposed change is transferring funds from the Cooperative Topographic Mapping Program to the Enterprise Information Program. The FY2007 Administration request proposed changes to the USGS budget, including transferring funds to the Geographic Research, Investigations, and Remote Sensing Program. The House and Senate bills would retain funding for Water Resources Research Institutes and mineral resource assessments, but not for the multi-hazards initiative. The Senate committee raised concerns about reprogramming funds for the USGS multi-hazards initiative without specifying funding sources. The Enterprise Information program consolidates USGS information needs, including security, technology, and resources management. It consists of three primary programs: Enterprise Information Security and Technology, Enterprise Information Resources, and Federal Geographic Data Coordination. The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) is a committee that promotes collaboration to make geospatial data available. The FY2007 budget requested $111.2 million for the program, with the House bill proposing $113.7 million and the Senate bill proposing $106.0 million. The increase in funds is due to a reorganization of the USGS budget. The National Mapping Program aims to provide public access to high-quality geospatial information, with a requested budget of $76.6 million. The Administration requested $76.6 million for the Geographic Research, Investigations, and Remote Sensing Program, a reduction from the FY2006 enacted level. Both the House-passed bill and the Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill recommend $78.6 million for the program, with the primary reduction in funds due to budget restructuring. The AmericaView program would not be funded, resulting in a $3.0 million reduction. The House bill would allocate $2.0 million to the AmericaView program and $13.0 million to the Mid-Continent Mapping Center in Rolla, Missouri. It also prohibits consolidating the MCMC into the National Geospatial Technical Operations Center. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill restricts funds for competitively sourcing functions of the NGTOC without allowing fair competition with other sites. Additionally, there is a request for a $16.0 million increase to support the Landsat Data Continuity Mission. The requested funds for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission, specifically for Landsat 8, would support the establishment of ground systems for data transfer, storage, and accessibility. The Senate Appropriations Committee questions the proposed reduction in force for the program, stating it lacks adequate justification and a resource plan. The Senate Appropriations Committee questions the proposed reduction in force for Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activities, reinstates funding, and expects research and staff levels to remain at the current level. The Administration requested $217.4 million, $17.9 million below the FY2006 enacted level. The House-passed bill would provide $241.9 million, and the Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill would provide $239.3 million, with a primary reduction in the Mineral Resources Program. The Administration plans to focus on mineral resource assessments and research for federal land management programs, cutting back on projects that support non-federal needs. This reduction will lead to the discontinuation of various research and data collection projects, including industrial mineral research and some geophysical labs. Despite previous requests for cuts, Congress is considering retaining funding for the program in the FY2007 budget. The House Appropriations Committee opposes the proposed reduction in funding for the program. The Committee strongly disagrees with proposed reduction in program funding and urges Administration not to propose elimination again. House committee disagrees with notion that objective data can be prepared in private sector. Senate Appropriations Committee states reduction has no merit. Administration's request for Water Resources Investigations was $204.0 million, $7.7 million below FY2006 enacted level. House-passed bill included $213.8 million, Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill contains $216.8 million. USGS support for Water would be discontinued in FY2007 request. The FY2007 budget request would discontinue USGS support for Water Resources Research Institutes due to successful leveraging of funding from non-USGS sources. Congress has provided $6.4 million for the institutes from FY2002 to FY2006. The Administration requested an increase of $2.3 million for the National Streamflow Information Program to continue operating streamgages and increase the number nationwide. The NSIP program aims to increase the number of streamgages by 30 nationwide, providing essential streamflow data for water resource projects. The Biological Research Program, with a proposed budget of $172.6 million, focuses on conservation efforts. The House and Senate propose funding increases, with earmarked activities totaling $6.4 million being removed for FY2007. The Biological Research and Monitoring Program funding would be removed for FY2007 as it does not address the highest priority science. Some program reductions may be restored in the House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills. The USGS will conduct activities related to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) under the Terrestrial and Endangered Resources sub-activity, with a requested budget of $3.2 million for FY2007. Sampling for HPAI detection in wild birds began in Alaska in 2005, with a steering committee established in 2006 to coordinate efforts. The USGS will continue sampling birds for HPAI in North America in 2007. The Administration requested $67.4 million for science support, a decrease from the previous year. The House-passed bill would provide $72.4 million for science support. The Administration also requested $95.5 million for facilities maintenance for FY2007. The House-passed bill and the Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill would provide $95.5 million for Facilities, the same as the requested amount and $0.7 million above the FY2006 enacted level. The Minerals Management Service administers two programs: the Offshore Minerals Management Program and the Minerals Revenue Management Program. OMM administers competitive leasing on Outer Continental Shelf lands and oversees production of offshore oil, gas, and other minerals. MRM collects and disburses bonuses, rents, and royalties paid on federal onshore and OCS leases and Indian mineral leases. The Minerals Management Service collects and disburses revenues from offshore leases, allocating funds to coastal states, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Historic Preservation Fund, and the U.S. Treasury. The MMS estimates collecting over $8 billion annually, with fluctuations based on oil and gas prices. Royalties from natural gas production make up 40-45% of receipts, while oil royalties are less than 25%. The FY2007 MMS budget request was $292.3 million, including funds for Oil Spill Research and Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management. The total budget request is 6% lower than the FY2006 enacted amount. The FY2007 budget request for the Minerals Management Service is $163.6 million, a 14% reduction from FY2006. The House recommended $164.4 million, slightly higher than the request, with funding levels approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Controversial issues include oil and gas development moratoria in the Outer Continental Shelf. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees retained the moratoria on oil and natural gas leasing in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for FY2007. The House approved an amendment for natural gas leasing in OCS moratoria areas, while oil leasing remained prohibited. Legislation (H.R. 4761) passed by the House allowed for natural gas-only drilling in moratoria areas and gave states a larger share of revenue from offshore leases. Royalty relief issues for OCS oil and gas producers have been debated during consideration of FY2007 Interior appropriations. The MMS did not collect royalties on leases awarded in 1998 and 1999 due to the absence of price thresholds in the lease agreements. Producers were allowed to extract oil and gas without paying royalties regardless of the price. The MMS claimed that the omission of price thresholds in the lease agreements was a mistake. The MMS omitted price thresholds in leases awarded in 1998 and 1999, leading to royalty relief for oil and gas producers. An amendment to include price thresholds in leases was proposed in the FY2007 Interior appropriations bill but was removed during House debate. A subsequent amendment prohibited new lease sales to lessees without price thresholds in their leases. Opponents of the amendment argued that companies with valid leases should not be penalized for lacking price thresholds. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved language on price thresholds similar to the House-passed version and required the Secretary of the Interior to renegotiate leases to include price thresholds. The amendment also affirmed the Secretary's authority to adjust royalties based on production prices. Leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico has been controversial, with blocks removed from sale 181 potentially becoming available after 2007. The Senate proposal (S. 2253) aims to lease 3.6 million acres in lease sale 181 area within a year. Coastal state senators are divided on the bill due to concerns about proximity to Florida's coast. Industry groups argue for more Eastern GOM sales, while environmental groups and some officials highlight risks to the environment and local economies. Offshore oil and gas leasing in California remains a contentious issue. The development of federal offshore leases in California was challenged by the State due to inconsistencies with the coastal zone management plan. The court struck down lease suspensions granted by MMS, leading to appeals by the Bush Administration. The Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court decision, and the Department of the Interior is working with lessees to resolve the issue. A breach-of-contract lawsuit was filed against MMS by nine oil companies seeking compensation for undeveloped leases in offshore California. The U.S. Federal Court of Claims determined that the government breached its contract with the lessees, ordering repayment of $1.1 billion. Final judgment is deferred pending resolution of additional claims. For more information on the Minerals Management Service, visit http://www.mms.gov. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) established regulations for coal mining reclamation, including the creation of an Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund funded by coal production fees. States and tribes develop their own regulatory programs based on federal standards. Fee collections are divided into federal and state shares, with grants awarded based on a distribution formula. Some states have requested increased AML appropriations in recent years. States have pushed for increased AML appropriations due to unappropriated balances exceeding $1 billion. Western states feel they are unfairly burdened as coal production shifts westward. The Administration proposed restructuring the program in FY2005 and FY2006, but it was not widely supported. Other reauthorization proposals have been introduced in Congress. The reauthorization of AML fee collection program has faced challenges in Congress, leading to short-term extensions. The FY2007 request seeks an interim extension while working towards a long-term resolution. The House Appropriations Committee supports an interim extension but emphasizes the need for a permanent solution. The Administration requested $185.9 million for FY2007, a slight increase from the previous year. The Administration requested $298.1 million for the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) for FY2007, an increase of $4.0 million from the previous year. This includes $112.2 million for regulation and technology programs, with a focus on environmental protection. Additionally, $1.5 million was requested for minimum program states with significant Abandoned Mine Land (AML) problems. The Senate Appropriations Committee and the House supported the Administration's funding levels for FY2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee and the House have limited funding for minimum program states to $1.5 million annually since FY1996. The Rural Abandoned Mine Program (RAMP) has not received funds since FY1996, with a $361 million balance transferred to the federal share of AML collections in FY2006. The FY2007 Administration request recommended continuing this practice, with the House including language to transfer the RAMP balance to the federal share fund. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides various services to federally-recognized tribes and their members, including government operations, law enforcement, education, and economic development. BIA's FY2006 direct appropriations were $2.27 billion, with a proposed decrease to $2.22 billion for FY2007. For more information on the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, visit http://www.osmre.gov/osm.htm. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget for FY2007 was proposed at $2.22 billion, with the House approving $2.23 billion and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $2.27 billion. Key issues for the BIA include reorganization and trust asset management functions. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget for FY2007 includes reorganization of the Bureau, trust asset management functions, and issues in BIA education programs. The budget presentation has been restructured to group programs with the same function under the same budget activity, such as education. Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA) budget activity is significant for tribes as it covers basic tribal services and allows tribes to prioritize programs without prior BIA approval. The BIA's FY2007 budget includes Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA) funding of $754.1 million, with potential overlap from FY2006. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees praised the new budget structure but requested reports on various aspects of BIA management. Interior Secretary Norton initiated a reorganization of the BIA, AS-IA, and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians in April 2003. The reorganization of the BIA, AS-IA, and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians was initiated in April 2003 due to issues related to trust funds and assets management. The BIA has historically managed trust funds and assets for Indian tribes and individuals, including 45 million acres of tribal trust land and 10 million acres of individual Indian trust land. Trust assets management involves real estate services, transactions processing, surveys, appraisals, probate functions, and land title records activities. The BIA has faced criticism for mismanaging Indian trust funds and assets, leading to trust reform in 1994 and a court case in 1996. The Office of Special Trustee was created in 1994 to oversee trust management reform. In 1996, trust fund management was transferred to the OST from the BIA. Efforts at trust management reform in the 1990s were unsuccessful, leading to a management consultant firm being contracted in 2001 for recommendations on improvements. The Department of Interior announced a reorganization in 2002 for trust management improvement after consultation with Indian tribes. The reorganization involves BIA, AS-IA, and OST focusing on trust management structures and functions, adding trust officers to oversee trust management at regional and agency levels. Additionally, a separate trust management improvement project is being implemented by BIA, OST, AS-IA, and the Office of Historical Trust Accounting. The reorganization announced by the Department of Interior in 2002 for trust management improvement involves BIA, AS-IA, and OST focusing on trust management structures and functions. A separate trust management improvement project is being implemented, including improvements in trust asset systems, policies, and procedures, historical accounting for trust accounts, reduction of backlogs, modernization of computer technology, and maintenance of the improved system. Many Indian tribes and tribal organizations have criticized the reorganization, stating that it is premature and insufficiently defines new OST duties. Congress responded to tribal concerns by excluding certain tribes from the reorganization for FY2004-FY2006. The BIA reorganization has faced criticism from Indian tribes, leading Congress to exclude certain tribes from the project for FY2004-FY2006. Despite this, the reorganization has not been suspended. The BIA funds numerous schools and dormitories, with tribes operating some institutions under self-determination contracts. Key issues in BIA-funded schools include low student achievement and inadequate facilities. The Johnson-O'Malley program provides education grants for Indian students, receiving $16.4 million in funding in FY2006. The Johnson-O'Malley program received $16.4 million in FY2006, but the Administration proposed no funding for FY2007, arguing that other Education Department programs could fulfill its purpose. However, opponents believe that the culturally-relevant programs of JOM cannot be replaced. The House Appropriations Committee recommended restoring the program to its previous funding level, while the Senate recommended a partial restoration to $14.4 million. Many BIA school facilities are in poor condition. The BIA education construction program faces a backlog of $942 million in facility repairs. The Administration proposed a $49.3 million reduction in education construction funds for FY2007, with a focus on completing replacement schools funded in prior years. Critics argue that many BIA schools need replacement or major repairs and funding should not be cut. The House approved the Administration's proposal for BIA education. The House and Senate committees disagreed with the Administration's proposal to cut funding for new BIA schools, expressing concerns about unobligated construction balances and the need for more robust appropriations in the future. They directed BIA to report on current unobligated balances and improvements in construction planning. For more information on BIA education programs, visit http://www.oiep.bia.edu. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to insular areas and former insular areas, managing relations and building fiscal capacity. The total OIA request for FY2007 was $426.3 million, slightly higher than FY2006. Funding includes permanent appropriations and discretionary funding subject to the appropriations process. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) requested $426.3 million for FY2007, with $347.1 million (81%) in permanent and indefinite funding required by statutes. This includes funding for freely associated states and territories, with the remaining 19% coming from discretionary and current mandatory funds. Assistance to Territories (AT) and the Compact of Free Association (CFA) accounts make up the discretionary and current mandatory funding, used for grants and infrastructure projects in insular areas. The Office of Insular Affairs requested $426.3 million for FY2007, with $347.1 million in permanent funding. This includes funding for territories and freely associated states. The Compact of Free Association account provides federal assistance to the freely associated states. Discretionary and mandatory appropriations for FY2006 total $81.5 million, with AT funded at $76.2 million and CFA at $5.3 million. The House approved $77.6 million for AT, while the Senate recommended $76.5 million. The House passed $5.4 million for CFA funding, $0.5 million above the request to support food production activities on Enewetak island due to WWII and atomic bomb testing. Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with the funding level. House passed $82.9 million for Insular Affairs, 2% above FY2006 and 5% above Administration's FY2007 request. Senate recommended $81.8 million. Administration requested $198.0 million for PILT in FY2007, down 15% from FY2006. House Appropriations Committee's details can be found on Insular Affairs website. The House Appropriations Committee approved $244.0 million for PILT, with additional funds transferred from the Smithsonian Institution and Interior Department salaries. The Senate approved $235.1 million, 4% less than the House. The PILT program compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions. Since 1976, over $3.6 billion has been paid out through the program, which has been controversial due to recent changes in the payment formula. The PILT program compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions. Appropriations have grown less rapidly than authorized amounts, ranging from 42% to 68% of authorized levels between FY2000 and FY2006. County governments claim the program does not provide adequate funding compared to property taxes, especially in rural areas. Additional PILT funds are needed to provide services in these areas.

The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets and manages tribal funds owned by about 300 tribes and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. Total asset value is approximately $2.9 billion for tribal funds and $400 million for IIM accounts. Trust fund management was transferred from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the OST in 1996. The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) manages tribal funds owned by about 300 tribes and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts totaling $400 million. Funds include monies from various sources and investment income. Funding for FY2007 varied with the Administration proposing $244.5 million, the House approving $184.0 million, and the Senate recommending $217.8 million. Key issues for the OST include funding allocations. For FY2006-FY2007, the OST received funding figures. Key issues include historical accounting for tribal and IIM accounts, with proposed funding of $56.4 million for FY2007. The House approved $45.0 million, while the Senate recommended $50.0 million. The historical accounting effort aims to reconcile all accounts, which is expected to be time-consuming due to the large number of accounts and missing documents. In 2003, the Interior Department proposed a $335 million project to reconcile IIM accounts over five years. The Interior Department proposed a $335 million project over five years to reconcile IIM accounts, including all transactions for certain accounts and land-based transactions over $5,000. Plaintiffs in litigation question the validity of the statistical sampling technique. Congressional committees expressed intent to limit spending for historical accounting and requested quarterly reports on funds used for litigation support costs. A class-action lawsuit (Cobell v. Norton) was filed in 1996. The class-action lawsuit (Cobell v. Norton) was filed in 1996 against the federal government by IIM account holders. The DOI estimated its proposed method for historical accounting would cost $335 million over five years. The plaintiffs' method could result in a total owed to IIM accounts of up to $177 billion. In September 2003, the court rejected both plans and ordered DOI to account for all trust fund and asset transactions since 1887. In response to the court's order for historical accounting of trust fund transactions since 1887, the Interior Department estimated the cost to be $6-$12 billion. Congress enacted a provision in the FY2004 Interior appropriations act to delay the accounting until specific obligations were delineated or December 31, 2004. The DOI appealed the court's order, leading to a temporary stay by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mediation between IIM plaintiffs and the government began during the stay, and on December 10, 2004, the Appeals Court overturned much of the initial order. On December 10, 2004, the Appeals Court overturned much of the September 25 order, citing a congressional provision that prevented the district court from mandating a historical accounting by DOI. The district court issued a similar order on February 23, 2005, requiring a comprehensive accounting since 1887 without statistical sampling, which DOI estimated would cost $12-13 billion. The Appeals Court later vacated this order on November 15, 2005. As of now, the district court has not issued a new order, and the Office of the Special Trustee continues with the historical accounting under the September 2003 plan. Congress is concerned about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit and DOI trust reform implementation. Possible costs include $12-$13 billion for historical accounting and a settlement amount that could reach $27.5 billion. Funding sources discussed include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund,\" but some consider it insufficient for a settlement. The current funding is insufficient for a $6-$13 billion settlement in the Cobell lawsuit. Congress is considering options such as enacting a delay, directing a settlement, or defining the department's accounting obligations. Settlement bills are being discussed, with a potential fund size of $6-$8 billion. The House Appropriations Committee expressed a desire for resolution but did not state an opinion on the settlement amount. The Senate Appropriations Committee noted ongoing settlement efforts in the Cobell lawsuit but did not express an opinion on the settlement amount. The National Indian Gaming Commission oversees tribal regulation of bingo and gaming operations. For more information on the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians, visit http://www.ost.doi.gov/. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) is primarily funded through fees assessed on tribes' Class II and III gaming operations. There was no direct appropriation for NIGC in FY2007, and Congress amended the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to create a formula-based fee ceiling. The NIGC's fee ceiling was increased to $15.5 million based on 2004 revenues of $19.4 billion. Congress had raised the fee ceiling to $12 million for FY2004-FY2007, and the Administration proposed an increase to $13 million for FY2008. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended repealing the FY2006 provision limiting the fee ceiling. EPA was established in 1970 to consolidate federal pollution control responsibilities. The EPA was established in 1970 to consolidate federal pollution control responsibilities. Its responsibilities have grown with the enactment of environmental laws and amendments. The agency regulates air and water quality, pesticides, toxic substances, waste management, and cleanup of environmental contamination. EPA also provides grants to assist state and local governments in pollution control. Its funding has increased over time, reaching $8.4 billion in FY2004. For FY2007, the House proposed $7.58 billion for EPA. In FY2007, the House proposed $7.58 billion for EPA, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $7.53 billion, both less than the FY2006 appropriation of $7.64 billion. Congress made an additional $80.0 million available to EPA in FY2006. The House agreed to amendments increasing EPA's funding by $3.8 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.8 million for Energy Star programs and the Senate recommended a slight increase. The House passed an amendment increasing funding for EPA's diesel emission reduction grant program by $2.0 million, while the Senate recommended $20.1 million. The President had requested $49.5 million. The House also passed amendments affecting EPA's activities, including one prohibiting funds for controversial wetlands guidance. Some other House amendments relevant to EPA were not agreed to. The House and Senate proposed changes in funding for EPA programs, including an amendment for additional funds for Clean Water State Revolving Funds. EPA's annual appropriation is divided into various line-item accounts, with proposed changes for FY2007 compared to the President's request. Funding for EPA programs in FY2007 has seen varying levels of interest, with a focus on water infrastructure, hazardous waste cleanup, scientific research, and air quality programs. Other areas of interest include homeland security activities and congressional funding priorities for research and water projects. The House allocated $270.0 million for congressional priority projects, while the Senate set aside $280.0 million, the same as FY2006. The President's FY2007 request also plays a role in funding decisions. The President's FY2007 request did not include funding for congressional priority projects in EPA's budget. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $687.6 million for Clean Water State Revolving Funds, the same as the President's request but less than the FY2006 appropriation. This proposed decrease has sparked disagreement over funding adequacy for local needs like sewage treatment plant upgrades. EPA issues grants to states from the STAG account to support Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee approved the President's request of $841.5 million for Drinking Water SRF grants, an increase above the FY2006 appropriation. Some Members support higher funding to meet local drinking water needs, such as assistance to help communities comply with new standards. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $11.0 million to assist small public water systems in complying with safe drinking water regulations, including funding for alternative technology projects and a competitive grant program. Congress has also provided specific funds in past appropriations for water infrastructure projects in certain communities. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated $200.0 million and $210.0 million, respectively, for congressional priority water infrastructure projects in FY2007, an increase from the previous year. The President's FY2007 budget did not include any funding for these projects. The adequacy of funding for the Superfund program for clean-up remains a prominent issue. The Superfund program's funding adequacy is a significant issue, with concerns raised about the need for more funds to accelerate cleanup at hazardous waste sites. The House, Senate Appropriations Committee, and President proposed similar amounts around $1.26 billion for the Superfund account, with increases from the previous year. Funding covers various activities related to hazardous substance cleanup, including administration and enforcement, but only a portion is allocated for actual site cleanup. The House approved $832.9 million for cleanup, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $833.1 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $833.1 million for site cleanup, slightly less than the FY2006 appropriation. The President had requested $822.9 million, sparking questions during budget oversight hearings about the pace of cleanup. Funding for the Superfund program comes from general U.S. Treasury revenues since dedicated taxes expired in 1995. Since 1995, Superfund program funding has relied on general revenues after dedicated taxes expired. Some Members of Congress advocate reinstating the taxes to uphold the \"polluter pays\" principle, while others argue that responsible parties still contribute to cleanup costs. EPA states that responsible parties cover over 70% of cleanup expenses at Superfund sites. Ongoing concerns persist about funding adequacy for cleaning up contaminated sites. The House and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the President's request of $163.3 million for EPA's Brownfields program to assist states and tribes in the cleanup of abandoned commercial and industrial properties with contamination levels warranting cleanup before reuse. EPA plays a key role in coordinating security of U.S. water systems under the Bioterrorism Act of 2002 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding increases for EPA's homeland security activities, with the House approving $143.7 million and the Senate recommending $155.4 million. These amounts are higher than the FY2006 appropriation of $129.1 million but lower than the FY2007 request of $184.0 million. Limited funding available for the bill as a whole and competing funding needs were cited as reasons for only a \"modest\" increase above FY2006 levels. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding increases for EPA's homeland security activities, with the House approving $143.7 million and the Senate recommending $155.4 million. The funding would support critical water infrastructure protection, laboratory preparedness, decontamination, protection of EPA personnel and operations, and communication. The S&T account would receive the largest portion of funding for these activities. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding increases for EPA's homeland security activities, with the House approving $61.8 million and the Senate recommending $68.2 million. The increases are intended for a water quality surveillance and monitoring pilot project called the \"Water Sentinel Initiative.\" The President's FY2007 request had included $91.8 million for homeland security activities, including funding for additional pilot projects under the initiative. Some concerns were raised that the increase in funding for homeland security was competing with EPA's core research programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding increases for EPA's homeland security activities, specifically for the \"Water Sentinel Initiative.\" The House approved $838.0 million for the Science and Technology (S&T) account for FY2007, while the Senate recommended $821.2 million. This funding supports scientific knowledge and tools for environmental pollution prevention and regulation. EPA's S&T account also advances understanding in environmental sciences. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding increases for EPA's homeland security activities, specifically for the \"Water Sentinel Initiative.\" Both committees allocated funds for the Science and Technology (S&T) account for FY2007, with the House approving $838.0 million and the Senate recommending $821.2 million. This funding supports research and development related to environmental contamination cleanup, including $30.0 million for congressional priority research projects. The President's FY2007 request did not include funding for these projects within EPA's budget. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding increases for EPA's homeland security activities, specifically for the \"Water Sentinel Initiative.\" Both committees allocated funds for the Science and Technology (S&T) account for FY2007, with the House approving $838.0 million and the Senate recommending $821.2 million. A significant portion of the increase is an accounting adjustment transferring $61.0 million into the S&T account for facilities infrastructure and operations. This adjustment would affect the total amounts allocated, with the Senate's amount decreasing relative to FY2006 and the House's amount being a smaller increase. Individual research activities within the S&T account saw both increases and decreases approved by both committees. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved funding increases and decreases within the S&T account for FY2007. The House approved $238.0 million for the \"Human Health and Ecosystems\" research program area, slightly more than FY2006, while the Senate recommended $230.3 million. Both committees allocated $11.7 million for research fellowships, including STAR fellowships. Homeland security funding within the S&T account also showed differing priorities. Homeland security funding in the S&T account reflects differing priorities for individual activities. There is debate over the adequacy of funding for specific scientific research, with concerns raised about declining support for \"core\" scientific research. The focus is on whether agencies' actions are based on \"sound science\" and how scientific research informs federal policy development. The Administration argues that reductions in funding for scientific research activities in FY2007 would not compromise the quality of science. In FY2007, some scientific research activities may not affect science quality, as less funding is needed due to efficiencies and cost savings. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee recommend funding increases for certain research, differing from the Administration's views. Interest in funding air quality programs has risen due to EPA's Clean Air Act provisions and climate change efforts. Funding in various accounts would support program implementation, research, and monitoring activities related to air pollutants, climate protection, and radon. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee proposed funding increases and decreases for air quality activities related to air pollutants, climate protection, and radon in FY2007. The funding would support program implementation and monitoring activities authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The House Appropriations Committee noted limited funding availability for EPAct activities due to competing funding needs. The President requested $49.5 million for a new diesel emissions reduction grant program within the EPAct category for FY2007. The House approved $28.0 million, and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $20.1 million. Some EPAct activities would absorb funding from separate line-items in prior years, such as Clean School Bus grants. Overall, the proposed funding for EPAct air quality activities is less than what Congress authorized in P.L. 109-58. Funding for \"categorical\" grants within the STAG account for state and local air quality programs has received attention in Congress. The House approved $220.3 million for these grants for FY2007, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $200.2 million, both higher than the President's request of $185.2 million. Concerns were raised about the requested reduction for these grants due to increasing Clean Air Act responsibilities. EPA has implemented new air quality regulations, placing more demands on states and local governments. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $4.15 billion for the Forest Service for FY2007, which was slightly less than the House-passed bill and more than the President's request. FS appropriations are provided in various accounts including Forest and Rangeland Research, State and Private Forestry, National Forest System, Wildland Fire Management, Capital Improvement and Maintenance, and Others. The President proposed selling about 300,000 acres of national forest lands to fund a five-year extension of FS payments. Legislation would be needed to authorize the land sale, as current FS authorities are limited. The Administration has sent draft legislation to Congress with criteria for determining eligible lands for sale. Relevant legislation has not been introduced yet. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not include authority for land sale in the bill. An amendment was passed to prohibit funds for road construction in Tongass National Forest for timber harvesting. Amendments in previous bills were removed or struck down. The Senate added a controversial provision exempting certain FS projects from NEPA documentation and public involvement. The Appeals Reform Act (\u00a7322 of P.L. 102-381) excludes certain actions from NEPA provisions, leading to debates on the need for administrative appeals. Fire funding and protection programs are contentious, with discussions on funding levels, locations for treatments, and the extent of public involvement in agency decisions. The National Fire Plan focuses on protecting structures during fires and addresses challenges related to environmental analysis and public involvement. Funding for the plan is not allocated in one specific place in Interior appropriations acts, but can be derived by combining various accounts identified by the agencies. For FY2007, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $2.60 billion for the plan, slightly less than the House recommendation and slightly more than the President's request. Total funding for FY2007 was also higher than the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $776.6 million for BLM wildfire funding in FY2007, $7.4 million more than the House, $7.1 million more than the request, and $21.4 million more than FY2006. For FS wildfire funding, the Senate recommended $1.82 billion for FY2007, $27.6 million less than the House, $20.9 million more than the request, and $37.1 million more than FY2006. The funds include fire suppression, preparedness, and other operations. The Senate also recommended $998.5 million for wildfire suppression funding in FY2007, matching the House-passed level. In FY2007, $998.5 million was allocated for wildfire suppression funding, $4.7 million less than the request and $77.6 million more than FY2006. No contingent or emergency funding was included. The Senate committee recommended $930.7 million for fire preparedness, with increases for BLM and decreases for FS. Additionally, $669.4 million was recommended for other fire operations. In FY2007, funding for fuel reduction was approved at $491.6 million, matching the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended retaining BLM's state and local fire assistance program at half the FY2006 level and increasing funding for the Joint Fire Science program. Proposed changes in State and Private Forestry programs were also debated. In FY2007, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $251.1 million for State and Private Forestry (S&PF) funding, which was $22.5 million more than the House, $6.7 million more than the request, and $57.9 million less than FY2006. For forest health management, the committee recommended $84.4 million, matching the request but less than the House and FY2006 levels. Additionally, $39.0 million was recommended for Cooperative Fire Assistance. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $39.0 million for assistance to volunteer fire departments, matching the House recommendation. For Cooperative Forestry in FY2007, the committee recommended $120.7 million, $39.9 million more than the House. Forest Legacy funding was recommended at $54.8 million, reduced by $4.9 million from prior year balances. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $33.9 million for Forest Stewardship, $27.6 million for Urban and Community Forestry, and $4.3 million for the Economic Action Program, with funding levels varying compared to the House and previous years. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $4.3 million for the Economic Action Program, a decrease of $5.2 million (55%) from FY2006 funding. They also recommended $7.0 million for international forestry assistance, matching the House and slightly more than the request. For Capital Improvement and Maintenance, they recommended $383.7 million, which is $27.3 million less than the House and $54.6 million less than FY2006. The Senate committee recommended funding reductions for Facilities, Roads, and Trails compared to the House. They also matched the request and the House for Infrastructure Improvement to address deferred maintenance. Additionally, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended slightly less funding for FS Research in FY2007 compared to the House. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding reductions for various accounts within the National Forest System, including a decrease in funding for the Valles Caldera National Preserve. They also recommended matching or reducing the House levels for other accounts, with a notable increase in Land Acquisition funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $37.0 million for funding, significantly more than the House and the requested amount, but slightly less than the previous year.

The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical and environmental health services for 1.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a system of federal, tribal, and urban Indian-operated programs and facilities. IHS operates hospitals, health centers, school health centers, health stations, and residential treatment centers, while tribes and tribal groups operate additional healthcare facilities through contracts and compacts. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The proposed FY2007 budget for IHS is $3.17 billion, with increases approved by the House and Senate Appropriations Committee. Funding is divided between Health Services and Facilities, with 88% allocated to health services. The Administration's budget focuses on the urban Indian health program. The Administration's FY2007 IHS budget focuses on the urban Indian health program and health care facilities construction. IHS Health Services are funded through congressional appropriations, private health insurance, and federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Reimbursements totaled $598.7 million in FY2005 and are expected to reach $648.2 million in FY2006. An additional $150 million per year is spent on the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. The House Appropriations Committee approved most proposed amounts but recommended a $34.4 million fixed cost decrease, which was also approved. The House approved a decrease in the IHS Health Services budget to address medical inflation and population growth. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a smaller fixed cost decrease of $20.0 million, affecting different programs within Health Services. The clinical services budget for FY2007 was $2.32 billion, with primary care at IHS and tribally run hospitals and clinics being included. The House approved $2.33 billion, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $2.32 billion. In FY2006, the House approved $1.44 billion for contract care services, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.43 billion. Contract care funds health services from local providers when IHS cannot provide care. For FY2007, contract care would receive $536.3 million, a 7% increase from FY2006. Other clinical services for FY2007 include dental programs at $127.0 million, mental health programs at $61.7 million, alcohol and substance abuse programs at $150.6 million, and the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund at $18.0 million. Preventive health services would receive $125.0 million for FY2007, a 7% increase from FY2006. For FY2007, preventive health services proposal includes $53.0 million for public health nursing, $14.5 million for health education, $1.7 million for immunizations in Alaska, and $55.8 million for the community health representatives program. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee approved these amounts. Other health services proposed a decrease to $374.2 million, with the House approving $406.9 million and the Senate recommending the same. Contract support costs were proposed to receive $270.3 million for FY2007, a 2% increase. Contract support costs for tribes to administer IHS-funded programs under self-determination contracts or compacts are proposed to receive $270.3 million for FY2007, a 2% increase. This funding covers expenses such as financial management, accounting, training, and program start-up. Most tribes participate in self-determination contracts. Other health services include urban Indian health programs, health professions scholarships, tribal management grants, direct IHS facility operations, and self-governance technical assistance. The House and Senate committees agreed on all amounts except for urban Indian health. The Administration proposed no new funding for the urban Indian health program, funded at $32.7 million in FY2006. The program helps fund preventive and primary health services for eligible urban Indians through contracts and grants with 34 urban Indian organizations at 41 urban sites. Services include direct clinical care, alcohol and substance abuse care, referrals, and health information. The Administration argues that urban Indians can be served through other federal, health, and local health programs, such as the Health Centers program in HHS. Opponents claim that alternative programs cannot replace the urban Indian health program. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for the urban Indian health program at its FY2006 level, citing its good assessment rating and ability to attract additional non-IHS funding. The Senate also included the funding amount in bill language. The IHS's Facilities category includes funding for equipment, construction, maintenance, and improvement of health-care and sanitation facilities for urban Indians. The Administration proposed $347.3 million for health-care and sanitation facilities, with the House approving $363.6 million and the Senate recommending $357.3 million for FY2007. The House committee suggested a $2.7 million cut in fixed costs for facilities, while the Senate did not recommend any decrease. The proposal includes $52.7 million for maintenance and improvement of health care facilities. The Administration proposed $17.7 million for construction of new health care facilities in FY2007, a 53% reduction from the FY2006 level. The House approved $36.7 million, 3% below FY2006 and 108% above the proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $27.7 million, 27% below FY2006 and 57% over the proposal. The House-approved bill for FY2007 would fund 3 ongoing projects in Phoenix, Kayenta, and San Carlos, AZ, along with partial funding for dental and small ambulatory facilities construction. The Senate committee's recommendation includes funding for 2 projects in Phoenix, AZ, and Barrow, AK. The Administration's proposed cut is part of an HHS-wide pause in new construction to fund staffing of newly-completed facilities and increase Indian health services, despite opposition citing a $1.5 billion backlog in unmet health-facility needs. Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about IHS health care facilities budget requests. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about the Indian Health Service's health care facilities budget requests, citing a growing backlog of construction projects and the need for more aggressive funding. The Committees noted that one-third of IHS-operated hospitals and health centers are over 40 years old, and it would take 48 years to complete the current priority list at the requested funding rate for FY2007.

The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was established in 1974 to resolve a land dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes. The 1974 act partitioned the lands between the two tribes, with provisions for relocating members of one tribe to new homes at federal expense. ONHIR's activities include land and housing acquisition, infrastructure construction, and post-move support for relocated families. The Administration proposed $5.9 million in new appropriations for ONHIR in FY2007, a 30% reduction from the previous year. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Administration's proposed amount for ONHIR. The Navajo-Hopi relocation, which began in 1977, is nearing completion. ONHIR estimated spending $12.0 million in unobligated funds during FY2006, reducing its balance to $3.0 million by the end of FY2006. Most families subject to relocation were Navajo, with 96% of Navajo families and 100% of Hopi families completing relocation by the end of FY2004. Approximately half of the 250 Navajo families who signed \"accommodation agreements\" under P.L. 104-301 on Hopi land may want to opt out and relocate using ONHIR benefits. As of the end of FY2004, 130 Navajo families were waiting to relocate, with some still residing on Hopi land. ONHIR and the U.S. Department of Justice are negotiating with the Hopi Tribe to allow some families to stay on Hopi land while relocating others who wish to opt out. ONHIR estimated that relocation moves for eligible families would be completed by the end of FY2006. The addition of Navajo families opting out or filing late applications would delay completion until FY2008. Congress is concerned about the speed of the process and pending legislation would transfer duties to the Secretary of the Interior in 2008. The long-standing proviso in ONHIR appropriations language prohibits evicting Navajo families from Hopi partitioned lands without providing a replacement home. As ONHIR's backlog of relocatees is reduced, forced eviction may become an issue if Navajo families refuse relocation. An agreement being negotiated with the Justice Department and the Hopi Tribe aims to prevent this. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum and research complex with 19 museums, the National Zoo, and 9 research facilities. It receives federal funding and trust funds, with a budget of $644.4 million for FY2007. The Senate committee-reported bill for the Smithsonian Institution would provide $537.4 million for Salaries and Expenses, the same as the Administration's request, $20.8 million above the FY2006 level, and $20.3 million above the House-passed bill. This covers administration of museums, research institutions, program support, outreach, and facilities services. The House-passed bill cut funding by $20.0 million due to a contract issue with Showtime, but the Senate Appropriations Committee argued against this cut for the benefit of the visiting public. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved funding for the Smithsonian Institution's facilities capital, revitalization, construction, and facilities planning and design. The total approved amount for FY2007 was $107.0 million for facilities capital, $91.1 million for revitalization, $5.4 million for construction, and $10.5 million for facilities planning and design. These funds are intended for addressing deterioration, maintenance, repair, and critical repairs in Smithsonian buildings. Studies suggest that the Smithsonian Institution requires a $1.6 billion investment for revitalization. The Smithsonian Institution requires a $1.6 billion investment for revitalization. A new National Museum of African American History and Culture has been authorized with funding of $3.0 million for FY2007. The museum will focus on African American historical and cultural material, including periods such as slavery, Reconstruction, the Harlem Renaissance, and the civil rights movement. The museum will be located near the Washington Monument on the Mall. Legislation has been introduced for an American Latino Museum on the Mall. The House approved $21.4 million for salaries and expenses at the National Zoo for FY2007. Concerns have been raised about the zoo's facilities and animal care. The Smithsonian Institution has a plan to revitalize. The Smithsonian Institution plans to revitalize the National Zoo to improve facilities for public safety and animal health. The Senate Appropriations Committee praised new leadership at the Zoo. The FY2007 budget includes funding for Phase II of the Asia Trail and Elephant Trails, as well as renovations to meet industry standards and correct infrastructure deficiencies. The House agreed to provide full funding for Facilities Planning and Design at the National Zoo but requested to review the list of projects before approval. The Smithsonian Institution receives income from various trust funds, including general trust funds, private contributions, and government grants. Concerns have been raised about the institution's investment in hedge funds to boost the endowment. The Smithsonian Institution has faced concerns over its investment in hedge funds to boost the endowment. A new business venture with Showtime called \"Smithsonian On Demand\" has raised worries about limited access to national collections, but the SI assures that collections will remain open to all researchers and independent filmmakers will be hired to produce programs for the channel. The Smithsonian Institution's new business venture with Showtime, \"Smithsonian On Demand,\" has sparked concerns about limited access to national collections. Lawmakers are questioning the terms of the contract, arguing that they have a right to know due to federal support. The House has included language in a bill to restrict the Smithsonian's ability to enter into agreements that could limit public access to collections. The House reduced the Administration's request for Smithsonian Institution's Salaries and Expenses by $20.3 million to $517.1 million. They also agreed to limit the salary of the Secretary of the Smithsonian and other officers to not exceed the President's salary. The Senate expressed concern about the reduction, stating it may impact program budgets but not the Showtime deal. The Smithsonian Institution, National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, including NEA, NEH, and IMLS, receive federal support for arts and humanities. NEA and NEH authorization expired in FY1993 but operate on temporary authority. IMLS funding comes from appropriations acts. Congress debates federal role in funding arts and humanities. The NEA and NEH funding concerns for FY2007 include keeping up with inflation and covering mandatory costs. There is a suggestion to combine the two Endowments, but it is unclear if this would be feasible. The NEA has been a major federal supporter of the arts since 1965, providing over 120,000 grants to all states. The NEA is celebrating its 40th anniversary with increased funding for FY2007. The House-passed bill would provide $129.4 million for NEA, with $44.9 million for direct grants and $39.5 million for state partnerships. An amendment added $5.0 million for NEA and NEH. $14.1 million would be used for Challenge America grants. The Challenge America Arts Fund provides matching grants for arts education and community arts activities in rural and under-served areas, reaching over 17,000 schools. The American Masterpieces program is funded at $9.9 million and includes touring programs, local presentations, and arts education in dance, visual arts, and music. NEH supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs, as well as regional humanities centers and state humanities councils. NEH supports various grants and programs, including Challenge Grants and the \"We the People\" initiative. The House-passed bill for FY2007 would provide $146.0 million, with additional funding for grants and administration. The Senate Committee-reported bill would provide $126.0 million. The budget request includes $15.2 million for the \"We the People\" initiative, focusing on model curriculum projects in humanities for schools. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually but requires appropriation for use by federal land management agencies. For more information on NEA and NEH, visit their respective websites. The LWCF funds land acquisition and recreational development through a grant program administered by the NPS. Money from the LWCF has also been used for related activities, with about $29 billion credited to the fund from FY1965 through FY2006. Annual appropriations have varied, with approximately $14.3 billion appropriated. Since FY1965, approximately $29 billion has been credited to the LWCF fund, with $14.3 billion appropriated. Funding for LWCF has historically fluctuated, with a spike in FY1998 to $969 million from $159 million in FY1997. FY2001 saw a record funding level of $1.0 billion, partly due to President Clinton's Lands Legacy Initiative. In FY2007, the Administration requested $533.3 million for LWCF, a 54% increase over the previous year. Additional funds were allocated for NPS land acquisition and state assistance in FY2006. The FY2007 budget request includes $9.8 million for federal land acquisition and state assistance. The House approved $209.9 million for LWCF, a significant decrease from previous years. The Senate approved $354.3 million, with a focus on new land acquisition and grant programs. The Administration's request for federal land acquisition was reduced to $83.6 million, with the House approving $58.7 million. In FY2007, federal land acquisition funding saw a significant decrease, with the Senate Appropriations Committee reporting $121.9 million for land acquisition, a reduction from previous years. The total appropriation for federal land acquisition has been declining since FY2001, with a notable decrease to $112.8 million in FY2006. In FY2007, federal land acquisition funding decreased, attributed to attention on the federal budget deficit and other national priorities like the war on terrorism. The Administration did not request funds for new state grants, citing alternative funding sources for parkland acquisition. The House supported $1.6 million for program administration only, following a trend of reduced funding in previous years. In FY2007, stateside funding for land acquisition decreased significantly, with a 79% drop from $144.0 million in FY2002 to $29.6 million in FY2006. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved $30.0 million for the stateside program, with $28.4 million allocated for new grants in FY2007. The President's FY2007 request included $440.6 million for various programs, a substantial increase from the previous year. In FY2007, the President sought LWCF funds and FY2006 appropriations for various programs. The House passed $142.1 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee reported $195.0 million for FWS, FS, and DOI programs. The House level would be a 34% reduction from FY2006 and a 68% reduction from the President's request. The Senate figure would be a 9% reduction from FY2006 and a 56% reduction from the President's request. In 1996, Congress authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a plan to restore the South Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was completed in 1999, with federal involvement authorized by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. WRDA 2000 is considered the key law for Everglades restoration, with appropriations provided for restoration projects in the region. The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations laws have provided funds to DOI agencies for restoration projects in southern Florida. Federal appropriations for South Florida ecosystem restoration projects exceeded $2.6 billion from FY1993-FY2006, with an average annual cost of $286 million expected for the next 10 years. The Administration requested $233.4 million for restoration efforts in the Everglades for FY2007, an increase of $31.0 million from the previous year. The Administration requested $69.4 million for Everglades restoration in FY2007, an increase of $31.0 million from the previous year. The House-passed bill provides $69.0 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill includes $13.3 million for the Modified Water Deliveries Project and $9.8 million for interagency coordination and planning. In FY2007, $69.0 million was allocated for Everglades restoration, with $13.3 million designated for the Modified Water Deliveries Project to improve water deliveries to Everglades National Park. The House-passed and Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bills would provide funding for Everglades restoration projects. Concerns exist about the federal government's commitment to implementing restoration activities, with some questioning the lack of authorized projects since WRDA 2000. Federal funding is expected to increase as projects move into construction phase. The House Appropriations Committee has concerns about the funding for CERP projects, particularly the Florida initiative Acceler8. Funding for Mod Waters in FY2006 was conditioned on meeting state water quality standards. The federal departments/agencies report that water entering the A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and Everglades National Park does not meet state water quality standards. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations disapprove further expenditure of funds, based on concerns regarding Florida state law amendments. The House Appropriations Committee opposes changes to the consent decree aimed at lowering phosphorus levels in the Everglades to mitigate pollution. They condition funds for implementing Mod Waters on Florida meeting water quality standards, even if the consent decree is terminated. Funds for Mod Waters in the House-passed and Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bills would be unavailable unless engineering and design documents for the Tamiami Trail component are appropriated to the Corps. Delays in completing Mod Waters would result in delays for other restoration projects.
