    "title": "AB 2481",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Charles Emmanuel Briggs Memorial Act of 2016 amends Section 12022.53 of the Penal Code to include various felonies such as murder, mayhem, kidnapping, robbery, carjacking, assault, rape, sodomy, lewd acts on a child, oral copulation, sexual penetration, and assault by prisoners. In the commission of specified felonies, using a firearm or crossbow results in additional imprisonment terms of 10 years, and intentionally discharging them leads to 20 years in prison. In the commission of specified felonies, using a firearm or crossbow results in additional imprisonment terms of 25 years to life if great bodily injury or death is caused to a person other than an accomplice. This enhancement applies to any principal in the offense if they violated certain sections and committed specified acts. An enhancement for participation in a criminal street gang shall not be imposed on a person in addition to an enhancement imposed for using a firearm or crossbow in specified felonies, unless the person personally used or discharged the weapon in the offense. An additional term of imprisonment may be imposed for each crime committed with a firearm or crossbow. Probation or sentence suspension is not allowed for individuals falling under this section. The court cannot remove an allegation or finding under this section. The total credits awarded shall not exceed 15% of the total term of imprisonment. The required facts must be alleged and admitted by the defendant or found true for penalties to apply. When an enhancement is admitted or found true, the court must impose punishment according to this section. If a firearm or crossbow is used in an offense and owned by the perpetrator, it will be deemed a nuisance and disposed of. These enhancements do not apply to lawful firearm or crossbow use. The section does not apply to the lawful use of a firearm or crossbow by a public officer or in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of property. \"Crossbow\" is defined as a device designed to fire a bolt or arrow projectile. No reimbursement required by this act as it creates, eliminates, or changes penalties for crimes, as defined by the California Constitution."
