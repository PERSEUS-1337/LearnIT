    "content": "The curr_chunk discusses the importance of trade in services, including various economic activities like audiovisual, construction, and financial services. It mentions the 1995 WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services and ongoing TiSA negotiations to further liberalize trade among 23 negotiating parties. Congress is interested in these negotiations. The TiSA negotiations are of interest to Congress due to the significant role of services in U.S. exports. Congress plays a direct role in overseeing the negotiations and would need to approve and implement U.S. commitments under TiSA if concluded. This report provides an overview of U.S. trade in services, background on services in U.S. trade agreements, and a detailed discussion of the ongoing TiSA negotiations. The United States is a global leader in services, accounting for 78% of private sector GDP and 82% of private sector employees in 2015. Services are essential for the economy, facilitating goods and enhancing productivity. Global value chains are redefining the role of services in international trade, with over half of global manufacturing imports being intermediate goods within supply chains. Manufacturing imports are intermediate goods in supply chains, while over 70% of world's services imports are intermediate services like transportation, logistics, research, telecommunications, business services, and financial services. Services are intangible and can be delivered electronically or in person. WTO classifies four modes of delivery for services to measure trade. The classification of government policies affecting trade in services in international agreements is based on different modes of delivery. Analyzing and measuring the volume of services trade is crucial, with two main categories: cross-border trade and services supplied through affiliates. In 2015, services accounted for a significant portion of total U.S. exports and imports, contributing to surpluses in services trade that offset deficits in goods trade. In 2013, U.S. firms supplied $1.3 trillion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold $878.5 billion in services to U.S. residents through their majority-owned foreign affiliates in the United States. Non-tariff barriers in services trade are often government regulations within the importing country. The United States aims to regulate service industries to protect consumers and pursue legitimate policy objectives. Concerns arise if regulations are protectionist or discriminatory towards foreign service providers, limiting market access. Trade barriers for services often involve establishing a commercial presence in the consumer's country or temporary movement of providers and consumers across borders. The U.S., as the largest exporter of services, is interested in opening international markets and has been leading efforts in this area. The United States has a history of tackling trade barriers in services, particularly in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Trade Promotion Authority legislation aims to expand market opportunities for the U.S. in services trade through plurilateral agreements with high-standard partners. The Trade Promotion Authority legislation allows Congress to consider implementing bills for agreements like TiSA under expedited procedures. The GATS is a multilateral framework for trade in services among WTO members, with market access and national treatment commitments made on a positive basis. Members can tailor their liberalization commitments to fit their national policy. The GATS provides a foundation for trade agreements on services, allowing members to customize sectoral coverage to meet national policy goals. U.S. FTAs, including the TPP, have expanded on the GATS to further liberalize services trade. Technology advancements have increased the volume and variety of traded services but also created new trade barriers. Efforts to enhance the GATS are ongoing through the WTO Doha Development Agenda. The WTO Doha negotiations are stalled, with the Nairobi Ministerial Conference in 2015 failing to provide a clear path forward. A group of 23 WTO members are discussing a potential sector-specific, plurilateral agreement to liberalize trade in services, known as the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). This agreement applies only to signatory countries and deviates from the WTO MFN principle. The Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) was launched in April 2013 by a group of 23 countries, including the United States and Australia, accounting for 70% of world trade in services. Supporters believe a plurilateral agreement would create a level playing field for business across multiple countries, while critics argue for separate agreements to achieve higher ambitions. Twelve G-20 members are participating in TiSA. China's interest in joining the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) has caused differences among participants, with the United States expressing concerns about China's readiness to fulfill the required commitments. Other major emerging markets like Brazil and India are not currently part of the negotiations, but their potential for market expansion in services could make them attractive to foreign providers. China's interest in joining TiSA has caused differences among participants, with the EU and some observers advocating for China's early participation. Some argue that concluding TiSA negotiations without large emerging economies involved could make it easier to establish a high level of liberalization commitment. The agreement is being structured to potentially be \"multi-lateralized\" in the future and incorporated into the WTO, but the timeline for this is uncertain as TiSA is still under negotiation. Incorporating TiSA into the GATS may raise concerns about updating the agreement as services evolve. Negotiations for TiSA may face obstacles similar to the Doha Round, but there is potential to update it as a standalone agreement. The structure is expected to include a core text, market access commitments, sectoral annexes, and institutional provisions. Sectoral annexes cover areas like land and air transport, e-commerce, energy, and telecommunications. TiSA aims to cover various sectors such as distribution/direct selling, energy, telecommunications, and financial services. The agreement is expected to build on GATS principles and include core rules like non-discrimination among TiSA partners. It would not restrict governments from taking measures for legitimate policy reasons, such as protecting national security or public order. The level of ambition in TiSA may vary among parties due to their different levels of development and priorities. The core text of TiSA would include rules like non-discrimination among partners and sector-specific obligations. It would reinforce GATS principles such as most-favored nation treatment and national treatment. Transparency and good governance are key principles sought by the United States in its trading partners, with commitments to publish regulations and allow for public comments. The TiSA agreement aims to address regulatory obligations and public consultation processes among participants. The EU has completed the Transparency annex, while rules on domestic regulation and movement of natural persons are being discussed. The United States has not yet made an offer on the movement of foreign nationals. In the proposed TiSA agreement, the United States has not yet made an offer on the movement of foreign nationals. The agreement includes commitments on the temporary entry and stay of highly skilled professionals in a separate protocol. The United States has proposed rules on State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to ensure non-discrimination, transparency, competition, and fair treatment. The TPP SOE chapter serves as the basis for the TiSA text, with efforts to expand the definition to include cooperatives. The TiSA agreement includes discussions on government procurement of services, with most participants being part of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. The draft TiSA language is reportedly less ambitious than the GPA, with the United States deferring to the existing WTO GPA for now. Market access liberalization commitments in TiSA involve a hybrid approach of negative and positive lists for services. The TiSA agreement uses a hybrid approach of negative and positive lists for market access liberalization commitments in service sectors. Each participant's offer is based on the GATS structure, with market access obligations negotiated under a positive list and national treatment obligations under a negative list. The TiSA agreement uses a hybrid approach of negative and positive lists for market access liberalization commitments in service sectors. Participants submit their \"best FTA\" commitments for TiSA market access offers, with some controversy surrounding the exemption of \"new services\" from non-discrimination rules. The TiSA agreement involves market access offers with some controversy over liberalization commitments. Participants have included market access reservations, and negotiations are ongoing on sectoral annexes, including sectors of interest to U.S. stakeholders like the audiovisual sector. The United States supports the inclusion of the audiovisual sector in TiSA, despite opposition from some countries like France and Canada who advocate for a \"cultural exception\" concept. A proposal for opening markets in the express delivery industry has been put forward by the US and EU, but the scope of this annex is unclear. A chapter or annex on e-commerce or digital trade in TiSA would likely address trade barriers related to cross-border data flows and consumer online protection, similar to provisions in TPP. TiSA may include provisions on international regulatory cooperation, cybersecurity, and support for small businesses, similar to TPP. Data localization and cross-border data flows are contentious issues in international trade, with regulations restricting cross-border data flows potentially limiting market access for firms. Forced localization requirements can increase costs for firms but are argued to enhance data security and local control. The Information Technology Industry Council reported an increase in forced localization requirements hindering their operations. The use of forced localization requirements has hindered U.S. technology companies seeking greater market access abroad. The U.S. International Trade Commission highlighted how localization measures create trade barriers, impacting digital trade in goods and services. Congress recognized the challenges posed by localization regulations and aimed to ensure cross-border data flows and electronically delivered goods are not impeded by unnecessary regulations. Congress aimed to eliminate localization regulations in trade agreements to prevent requirements for locating assets in a country. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield replaced the Safe Harbor agreement for Trans-Atlantic data flows, but legal challenges have created uncertainty. TiSA discussions on cross-border data flows were paused during Privacy Shield negotiations, with the EU yet to propose a solution. U.S. and EU privacy experts recommended \"privacy bridges\" for regulatory cooperation to resolve differences without changing existing laws in TiSA countries. TiSA members aim for language that enables trade and addresses evolving technology while protecting privacy and cybersecurity. The United States proposed provisions on Internet platform liability, with concerns raised by tech companies about hindering the digital economy. Supporters reference a UN declaration stating that internet intermediaries should not be held responsible for third-party content. Service intermediaries are not responsible for third-party content but must act on lawful court orders to remove content if technically feasible. They must be transparent in their practices and treat data and traffic equally. Some argue they should review all content for piracy. TiSA builds on GATS commitments in financial services. In the proposed TPP, financial services are explicitly excluded from the e-commerce chapter, limiting provisions on data flow restrictions. U.S. regulators sought the ability to restrict cross-border data flows in TPP. To address concerns, the U.S. proposed language in TiSA to prevent barriers to data flows in financial services, based on post-TPP discussions. The U.S. proposal in TiSA for financial services is supported by stakeholders post-TPP discussions. EU's position on privacy laws may conflict with the U.S. proposal. Uncertainty over Brexit and the UK's financial center status raise questions about the EU's negotiating stance. Regulatory cooperation in financial services within TiSA or G-20 is still unclear. The EU and the United States are in negotiations for regulatory cooperation on financial services, with the EU pushing for it in the T-TIP talks. The US supports regulatory cooperation through various venues like the Joint Financial Regulatory Forum and Basel III. Financial services provisions in US FTAs and BITs include ISDS for resolving disputes. The TiSA agreement does not include an investment chapter, so there is no ISDS mechanism for resolving disputes. Disagreements would likely be settled through a government-to-government dispute settlement mechanism. The inclusion of maritime services in the agreement is contentious, with the US and other parties possibly opposing it due to existing laws restricting foreign vessels in coastwise trade. Professional services may be addressed in a broader transportation services annex, but the US market access offer may not include maritime services or be limited to certain port services allowed by US law. TiSA negotiations focus on facilitating recognition of foreign professionals like lawyers and accountants, with medical services excluded. Telecommunications discussions center on whether obligations should apply to public networks or value-added services. Participants are debating the scope of commitments in this sector. Many members in the TiSA negotiations have made offers to improve their GATS commitments or make new ones, leveraging existing offers from the Doha round. Telecommunications is a highly restricted sector for U.S. companies in foreign markets. The proposed TiSA includes institutional provisions for clarity on its operation, potential admission of new members, and incorporation into the WTO. Negotiators are considering a rotating secretariat and a state-to-state dispute settlement mechanism, excluding an investor-state mechanism found in broader U.S. FTAs. Trade negotiations are a contentious issue in the United States and globally. Trade negotiations for TiSA focus on services and are less controversial than other agreements due to exclusions of sensitive areas like investment and agriculture. Business community supports TiSA for consistency, predictability, and eliminating trade barriers. However, debates arise on liberalizing trade, especially in sensitive sectors like healthcare. Opponents, including labor unions, raise concerns about services liberalization. Some labor unions and civil society groups are concerned about TiSA's impact on wages, employment, and government authority to regulate services. Import-sensitive sectors may oppose TiSA due to increased competition. USTR leads trade negotiations for the US, but states regulate many services independently. Uncertainty exists on how USTR consults with state regulators for implementation. The United States has used different approaches in the past for trade agreements. One current issue is how TiSA commitments apply to non-participants, with discussions on extending benefits to all participants in future trade deals. The U.S. supports the \"MFN-forward\" approach. Negotiators are considering a compromise proposal for the TiSA trade agreement, allowing parties to opt-in to the \"MFN-forward\" approach. Despite 21 rounds of negotiations since April 2013, outstanding issues remain, and the U.S. administration's position is uncertain. New members are unlikely to join unless they accept current provisions. The outlook and timeline for TiSA negotiations are uncertain due to complex issues being addressed. TiSA negotiations are uncertain as participants tackle complex issues. Congressional oversight may include monitoring progress and fulfilling TPA objectives. Congress has conducted oversight on digital trade, USTR budget, and nominations. Members support setting \"21st century rules\" while others express concerns about policy impacts. Congress may hold TiSA-specific hearings to address policy issues and negotiators' consistency with U.S. trade. The TiSA negotiations raise questions about consistency with U.S. trade objectives, impact on the economy, positive and negative effects, potential expansion to other countries like Brazil, China, and India, and the effectiveness of incorporating TiSA into the WTO GATS. Advancements in information technology are driving the need for a modernized legal framework to regulate the expanding services sector. Policymakers face challenges in balancing regulatory responsibilities with the goal of economic growth. The United States may consider regulatory cooperation in addition to trade agreements to address issues like cross-border data flows. The need for a modernized legal framework to regulate the expanding services sector raises questions about involving states in trade negotiations and addressing service trade barriers for U.S. providers overseas."
