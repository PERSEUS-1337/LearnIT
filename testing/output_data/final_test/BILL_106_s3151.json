FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds that railroad activity has significantly increased in recent years, with intermodal traffic up by 40 percent over the last decade. More than 9,000,000 containers and trailers traveled the Nation's rails in 1999, impacting the quality of life in many communities due to noise. Current Federal laws do not give communities authority to participate in railroad activity or provide incentives for noise abatement.\" Railroad noise abatement technology is an emerging component of transportation research that should receive greater support from the Federal Government. The Federal Government should support the study of adverse effects of idling train engines. The Secretary of Transportation is required to commission a study by the National Academy of Sciences on the noise impacts of railroad operations, including idling train engines, on nearby communities, the environment, and safety. The study will provide recommendations for mitigating rail noise, establishing noise mitigation standards, suggesting changes in Federal law to address railroad noise, and proposing funding mechanisms for mitigation projects. The report must be submitted to Congress within one year of the enactment of this Act. The National Academy of Sciences will submit a report to Congress on the results of the study on railroad noise impacts. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a credit for the purchase and installation of sound barriers and other activities to reduce railroad noise. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now includes a credit for eligible taxpayers, such as rail carriers, for 50% of eligible railroad noise abatement expenditures, which are amounts paid for installing sound barriers on property adjacent to railroad tracks. The taxpayer can receive a credit for 50% of eligible railroad noise abatement expenditures, including the costs of purchasing sound barriers, to reduce train noise levels to EPA standards. Sound barriers are physical features that reduce sound propagation. The taxpayer can receive a credit for eligible railroad noise abatement expenditures, including the costs of purchasing sound barriers to reduce train noise levels to EPA standards. Expenditures must be reasonable and no double benefit is allowed. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a railroad noise abatement credit under section 45D. A transition rule states that this credit cannot be carried back to years before the enactment of section 45D. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a railroad noise abatement credit under section 45D, with a transition rule preventing the credit from being carried back to previous taxable years. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The Railroad Noise Abatement Act includes a credit for sound barriers installation to reduce train noise. The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2000. SEC. 5 amends Section 20108(a) of title 49, US Code to include research on technologies for railroad noise abatement. SEC. 6 addresses consolidations, mergers, and acquisition of control in the railroad industry. Section 11324 of title 49, United States Code is amended to include the chief executive of any city in subsection (a) and to add requirements for safety, environmental effects, and federalism impact assessment in subsection (b). The proposed transaction will have preemptive impacts and costs for State and local governments. Mitigation and impact costs related to the transaction will be assessed, along with the potential compromise of existing local standards if approved. The proposed transaction will have preemptive impacts and costs for State and local governments, including the potential compromise of existing local standards if approved. SEC. 7. IMPACT OF RAIL CARRIER ACTIONS ON LOCALITIES. Rail carriers must notify affected states and communities before taking actions that increase noise, such as rail activation or expansion. Rail carriers must notify affected states and communities before taking actions that increase noise, such as rail yard activation or expansion, increased rail traffic, land acquisitions, or other new rail carrier operations. The Secretary of Transportation will provide localities with an opportunity for public comment on these actions. Rail carriers must notify affected states and communities before taking actions that increase noise. The Secretary of Transportation will provide localities with an opportunity for public comment on these actions, including a 30-day period for submission of comments and the opportunity to appeal any action taken by the Department of Transportation. During this process, rail carriers are prohibited from initiating any action subject to public comment or appeal."
