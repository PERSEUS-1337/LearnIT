    "content": "The U.S. Constitution allows Presidents to appoint officers with Senate consent or during Senate recess. President Obama faced challenges in confirming nominees for the CFPB and NLRB. Senate opposition delayed Richard Cordray's nomination as CFPB Director in 2011. The Senate Banking Committee approved Cordray's nomination for CFPB Director, but the Senate failed to reach cloture for a full vote. The NLRB faced vacancies during Bush and Obama's presidencies, leading to operational challenges. In National Labor Relations Board v. National Labor Relations Board, the Supreme Court ruled that the NLRB cannot make rules without three acting members. In 2010, the NLRB had a quorum of three members, but by August 2011, there were only three members left. President Obama nominated three members to prevent the board from dropping below the quorum needed to conduct business, but the Senate did not confirm them before the third member's term expired. The President considered recess appointments if the Senate went into recess. The Senate held pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments by the President during the 112th Congress. These sessions, governed by unanimous consent agreements, occurred every three or four days and involved minimal formal business. On December 17, 2011, a series of pro forma sessions were scheduled until January 23, 2012, with brief recesses in between, during which no business was conducted. The President made controversial recess appointments during pro forma sessions of the Senate, sparking legal questions about his authority under the Recess Appointments Clause. This report analyzes legal issues surrounding the President's recess appointments on January 4, 2012. It discusses the Recess Appointments Clause, standing, political question doctrine, constitutional validity of appointments, statutory restrictions on appointee authority, and potential impacts of court rulings on the appointments. The U.S. Constitution provides the President with two methods of appointing officers. The U.S. Constitution allows the President to appoint officers through the Appointments Clause and the Recess Appointments Clause. The latter permits the President to fill vacancies during Senate recesses. The Recess Appointments Clause aims to ensure administrative continuity. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to fill vacancies during Senate recesses to ensure administrative continuity. Ambiguities in the Clause have been primarily addressed by the executive branch, with some interpretive questions settled, such as defining a \"Recess\" to include both inter- and intrasession breaks of Congress. The shortest duration for an intrasession recess appointment is 10 days, with the appointee serving until the end of the following session. President Obama's January 4 appointments during the second session of the 112th Congress could serve until the end of the first session of the 113th Congress. As a recess appointee, one possesses the same legal authority as a confirmed appointee, as stated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The appointee is granted full authority during their limited term in office, with no limitations specified in the Constitution. The Recess Appointments Clause is not considered a lesser method of appointment, and there is no evidence to suggest it has subordinate standing in the constitutional scheme. The President's appointments of Cordray, Flynn, Block, and Griffin Jr. during a three-day recess between pro forma sessions may face legal challenges due to historical interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause. Congress has tried to limit recess appointments through legislation, such as restricting salaries for certain appointees. The legality of these appointments may be subject to judicial review, with preliminary questions of justiciability to be considered first. The plaintiffs bringing the claim must establish standing and address justiciability questions regarding the President's recess appointments. Standing determines if the plaintiff has the right to bring the claim, while the political question doctrine considers if the claim is appropriate for judicial resolution. These issues may pose hurdles to challenging the President's appointments. The court evaluates merits and standing of a claim, with the political question doctrine determining if it is suitable for judicial review. Standing requires a plaintiff to show a personal, concrete injury traceable to the defendant's actions and likely to be redressed by court relief. Constitutional and prudential considerations guide standing requirements in federal courts. Federal courts follow constitutional and prudential principles for standing inquiries. Prudential principles can be changed by Congress and require a plaintiff to assert their own legal rights, have a complaint within the protected zone of interests, and avoid adjudicating generalized grievances. A challenge to President Obama's recess appointments may come from private individuals impacted by actions of the CFPB or NLRB, or from individual Members of Congress or the Senate. Private plaintiffs must meet constitutional standing requirements, while congressional plaintiffs face a more rigorous standing inquiry. Private plaintiffs, including individuals, businesses, or associations, may challenge the validity of President Obama's recess appointments to the CFPB or NLRB. They must meet associational standing requirements and prove that the appointments affected their concrete and particularized injury. The case of New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB illustrates how private plaintiffs can establish standing based on agency actions. The plaintiff in New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB suffered a concrete injury when the NLRB found unfair labor practices. The injury was personal, traceable to NLRB actions, and typically redressed via judicial action. Private plaintiffs with similar injuries may have standing to challenge recess appointments. In Raines v. Byrd, the Court ruled that Members of Congress must show a personal injury to have standing. A Member can establish standing by alleging a personal injury, like losing their seat, or an institutional injury, such as \"vote nullification.\" Cases involving core separation of powers issues face a rigorous standing inquiry. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has held that \"vote nullification\" only occurs if Congress has no other legislative remedies available to rectify its alleged injury. For example, in Campbell v. Clinton, Member plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the President's decision to assert military force in Yugoslavia without congressional authorization because legislative remedies were available. A Member challenging President Obama's recess appointments may argue that the President's actions circumvented the Senate's appointments function under Article II. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has held that \"vote nullification\" only occurs if Congress has no other legislative remedies available to rectify its alleged injury. Congress could pass legislation that impacts recess appointees, such as cutting off funding or changing the leadership structure of agencies like the NLRB and CFPB. The CFPB Director's leadership structure could be changed to a board or commission by Congress, which also has the power to repeal legislation creating agencies. Legislative remedies may be available to challenge the President's recess appointments, potentially affecting a Member's standing to sue. Courts have recognized institutional standing for congressional bodies, but authorization from a House of Congress may be necessary to sue as an institutional plaintiff. Institutional standing requires an institutional plaintiff to show a concrete and particularized injury in fact. For example, being denied access to subpoenaed information is considered a personalized injury. Courts have allowed a full House to intervene in cases where the injury directly implicates Congress's authority and power allocation among branches. It is uncertain if an institutional plaintiff's injury is personalized if legislative remedies are available. Institutional standing requires a concrete and personalized injury for an institutional plaintiff. A congressional institution challenging President Obama's recess appointments would face a rigorous standing inquiry due to separation of powers issues. The plaintiff would argue that the President's actions interfered with the Senate's duty to provide \"Advice and Consent,\" establishing a specific injury. Senate authorization may be needed for the institutional plaintiff to sue, but it is unclear if the Raines and Campbell standard applies to institutional plaintiffs. Institutional standing for plaintiffs challenging President's recess appointments hinges on proving a concrete injury. The Senate's alleged injury impacts its authority within the governmental scheme. If institutional plaintiffs can establish standing, the court may still dismiss aspects of the case as a nonjusticiable political question. The political question doctrine encourages judicial self-restraint in cases deemed inappropriate for judicial review due to their political nature, preserving the limited role of the judicial branch. Originating from Marbury v. Madison, the doctrine has expanded to apply beyond challenges to executive action, often invoked to bar judicial review in cases involving disputes between the executive branch. The political question doctrine, originating from Marbury v. Madison, discourages judicial review in cases involving disputes between the executive and legislative branches. The Supreme Court's criteria in Baker v. Carr for determining political questions are considered insufficient by many commentators. The political question doctrine, based on Marbury v. Madison, discourages judicial review in cases involving disputes between branches of government. The Supreme Court's Baker v. Carr criteria for political questions are seen as limited, leading to uncertainty in predicting judicial review outcomes. The Recess Appointments Clause has been subject to judicial review despite uncertainties in predicting outcomes due to the Baker criteria. Lower federal courts have considered challenges to presidential appointments under the Clause, addressing interpretive controversies such as vacancy timing and the applicability of the Clause to different recess types. This demonstrates courts' willingness to closely examine constitutional text and interpret its boundaries. The courts have shown a willingness to closely examine the constitutional text and interpret the President's recess appointment power. However, challenges to such appointments may be viewed as political questions by the courts, as seen in a previous case where the court dismissed a claim that the President lacked deference to the Senate's advice-and-consent role. This raises questions about how much deference the President should show to the Senate when making recess appointments. The unique circumstances of President Obama's recess appointments may lead to questions about the Senate's pro forma sessions and the President's recess appointment power. A reviewing court may hesitate to consider these questions due to the Senate's independence in establishing its own rules and procedures. The Senate has the authority to establish its own rules and procedures, which may lead to challenges regarding the question of whether the Senate is in session or in recess. The Supreme Court has the power to review Senate rules that may violate the Constitution. Reviewing courts may be hesitant to establish a minimum duration of a recess triggering the President's recess appointment power. The Senate's authority to establish its own rules and procedures may lead to challenges on determining if it is in session or recess. The Supreme Court can review Senate rules that may violate the Constitution, but courts may be hesitant to set a minimum duration for the President's recess appointment power. The length of a recess necessary for the President to assert his appointment authority lacks a clear standard, leaving the decision to the political branches. The President and Congress define the scope of the Clause, not the courts. Courts can establish their own standards from the Adjournment Clause or precedent. Even if questions on pro forma sessions and recess duration are nonjusticiable, courts can still assess appointment merits. If a court finds a challenge to appointments justiciable, it can proceed to review the suit. The main issue is whether the appointments were valid. The primary issue is whether the appointments were made in compliance with the Recess Appointments Clause, which allows the President to fill vacancies during Senate recesses. The unique factual circumstances involve pro forma sessions scheduled by the Senate, where no business was conducted. On January 4, 2012, the President announced his intent to appoint Cordray as the first CFPB Director and members to the NLRB during an intrasession recess of the Senate. The length of the recess is crucial in determining if the appointments were made in compliance with the Recess Appointments Clause. The President made recess appointments during a 20-day recess, which some argue is consistent with historical precedent, while others claim that pro forma sessions should interrupt the recess. This raises unresolved constitutional questions about the use of pro forma sessions to interrupt recesses. The Senate began using pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments by the President, raising constitutional questions about the duration of intrasession recesses and the minimum days required for a recess appointment. During the first session of the 112th Congress, the Senate held pro forma sessions every three days to prevent recess appointments by the President. The lawfulness of recess appointments made by President Obama would depend on the length of the recess and whether pro forma sessions interrupt the recess. The legality of recess appointments made by President Obama during the first session of the 112th Congress depends on whether pro forma sessions interrupt the recess, determining if they constitute standard sessions for the Recess Appointment Clause. A reviewing court could consider three potential approaches to evaluate the status of pro forma sessions as standard sessions. A court could determine that a pro forma session is a standard session as long as the Senate can conduct business. If so, all pro forma sessions would break up a long recess, potentially affecting the legality of recess appointments made during such sessions. The legality of recess appointments made during pro forma sessions depends on whether they constitute standard sessions where business is conducted. Recent pro forma sessions have generally not conducted any business, as explicitly stated in unanimous consent agreements. For example, during the January 3, 2012, pro forma session, the Senate convened for only one minute. The Senate convened briefly during pro forma sessions in January 2012, with no business conducted. The legality of recess appointments made during these sessions depends on whether they are considered standard sessions where business can be conducted. The Senate's capacity to conduct business during pro forma sessions may impact the validity of appointments made. During pro forma sessions, the Senate conducted business by unanimous consent on two occasions in the 112th Congress, approving legislation and confirming nominees. This suggests that pro forma sessions may be considered standard sessions for conducting business. A court may consider pro forma sessions as standard sessions for the Recess Appointments Clause, potentially allowing the President to make appointments during a short recess. The legality of such appointments would depend on the definition of a \"Recess\" and the minimum duration required for the President to exercise his authority. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to make appointments during both inter- and intrasession recesses of the Senate. The Constitution does not specify a minimum length for a recess, leaving it open to interpretation by the courts. The legality of appointments made during pro forma sessions may also be considered. The Adjournment Clause historically provides context to the ambiguous nature of the Recess Appointments Clause, suggesting a recess must be longer than three days for the President to make appointments. Since the late 19th century, Presidents have utilized intrasession recesses for appointments, a practice that increased after 1857. Attorney General Daugherty affirmed this authority in 1921. In 1921, Attorney General Daugherty affirmed the President's authority to make recess appointments during an intrasession recess of 29 days. However, he also suggested that the recess must be longer than 2 days to constitute the recess intended by the Constitution. The Office of Legal Counsel advised against a recess appointment over a six-day intrasession recess in 1979, citing Daugherty's opinion. The Department of Justice has supported a link between the Adjournment Clause and Recess Appointments Clause in litigation. The DOJ's brief in the case Mackie v. Clinton addressed the issue of the President's authority to make recess appointments during a 13-day recess. The brief stated that no Attorney General or court has found the President lacking this authority, but noted that a recess of three days or less could raise a closer question. The DOJ has maintained this view in subsequent briefs and oral arguments before the Supreme Court. The Deputy Solicitor General, Neil Katyal, argued before the Supreme Court in New Process Steel v. National Labor Relations Board that the recess appointment power requires a recess longer than 3 days. Historical practice and the Adjournment Clause may inform the meaning of \"Recess\" for recess appointments. The executive branch has acknowledged a link between intrasession recess appointments and the founding period. A court may conclude that recess appointments can only be made during intrasession recesses of more than three days. Pro forma sessions could break up a continuous recess, potentially affecting the President's appointment powers. Arguments exist regarding the constitutional basis for linking the Adjournment Clause to the Recess Appointments Clause. The Adjournment Clause and the Recess Appointments Clause do not directly correlate in terms of terminology or constitutional authority. The Adjournment Clause pertains to internal rulemaking authorities of the houses in Article I, while the Recess Appointments Clause relates to the President's powers in Article II. Therefore, a court may not find a constitutional basis for linking the two clauses in interpreting the President's recess appointment powers. The Senate's ability to exercise its advice and consent prerogative may be undermined without a time requirement for defining a \"Recess\" for purposes of the Clause. A court may rely on descriptive criteria, as seen in a 1905 Senate Committee report, to determine the length of a recess for the President's recess appointment powers. The Senate report on recess appointments clarifies that the term \"recess\" should be interpreted in its common and popular sense, meaning a period when the Senate is not in session and its members are not obligated to attend. This definition emphasizes that a recess should be a real, not imaginary, break from regular or extraordinary sessions. The Senate report on recess appointments defines \"recess\" as a period when the Senate is not in session, allowing the President to make appointments. Attorneys General opinions support this interpretation, stating that a temporary adjournment preventing the Senate from advising and consenting to nominations qualifies as a recess. Without a specific time requirement, a court may consider the Senate's absence to determine the validity of recess appointments. The Senate report and Attorney General opinions define \"recess\" as a period when the Senate is not in session, allowing the President to make appointments. A court may consider the Senate's absence to determine the validity of recess appointments, without a specific time requirement. The OLC emphasized the practical purpose of the recess appointment power, stating that a \"Recess\" exists when the Senate is not available to give its advice and consent to executive nominations. This standard would determine if the President could rely on his recess appointment power for the January 4 appointments. The length of the recess may not be a decisive factor in this determination. A reviewing court could evaluate the effect pro forma sessions have on a recess from different perspectives. If the Senate is unable to receive communications from the President or participate in making appointments, the President may rely on his recess appointment power. Alternatively, if the Senate can conduct business and advise on executive nominations by unanimous consent, the President's ability to make recess appointments may be limited. A reviewing court may consider the impact of pro forma sessions on the President's recess appointment power. If pro forma sessions are deemed standard sessions that prevent a \"Recess,\" the Senate could block the President from making recess appointments, raising separation of powers concerns. This could lead to a complete abrogation of the President's recess appointment power during lengthy intrasession recesses, potentially violating the separation of powers doctrine. The separation of powers doctrine aims to allocate political functions among governmental branches to prevent domination. The Constitution's checks and balances structure prevents branch aggrandizement. The Appointments Clause involves roles for the President and Senate, while the Recess Appointments Clause allows temporary unilateral appointments by the President during Senate absence. Congressional actions limiting the President's Appointments Clause powers could violate separation of powers. The Supreme Court scrutinizes separation of powers cases using formalism and functionalism analytical frameworks, which differ in their views on the scope of separation of powers and branch self-aggrandizement concerns. Senate actions limiting the President's Recess Appointments Clause powers could raise separation of powers issues. The Supreme Court uses formalism and functionalism to analyze separation of powers cases. The President's recess appointment power is conditional and triggered only during a Senate recess. Pro forma sessions could prevent the occurrence of a recess, limiting the President's appointment power. The President's recess appointment power is conditional and triggered only during a Senate recess. The DOJ has acknowledged that pro forma sessions could prevent the occurrence of a recess, thus limiting the President's appointment power. The use of pro forma sessions may not give rise to separation of powers concerns, but a functionalist approach may consider if it interferes with the President's ability to maintain administrative continuity under the Recess Appointments Clause. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to maintain administrative continuity by filling vacancies. Practical considerations have led to a broad interpretation of when a vacancy may exist. The Constitution aims for government offices to always be filled to ensure smooth operations. Any tactic that hinders the President's ability to use recess appointment power effectively may be challenged in court. President Obama's use of recess appointment power could be unconstitutional as it may enhance legislative power over the executive branch. The Senate's pro forma sessions could undermine the President's powers. The legality of Obama's January 4 appointments depends on whether there was a Senate recess. The unique situation raises unresolved constitutional issues that a court may need to address. The Adjournment Clause may define \"Recess\" as longer than three days for the President's authority. A court could establish a definition of \"Recess\" based on Senate activity to determine if the President can make recess appointments. The use of pro forma sessions may impact the continuity of a recess. The President's recess appointments could be considered valid during a single intrasession recess of at least 20 days, unless the Senate's pro forma sessions are deemed meaningful to prevent such appointments. Prolonged use of pro forma sessions may raise separation of powers concerns and require a re-evaluation of each branch's role in recess appointments. Questions remain regarding the constitutionality of the President's appointment of Richard Cordray. The Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFP Act) raises questions about Cordray's powers and the impact of the President's recess appointment on CFPB authorities. The CFPB, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, consolidates regulatory authority and grants the authority to prescribe regulations to implement federal consumer laws. The CFPB has the authority to implement federal consumer laws such as TILA and RESPA. The Bureau is headed by a single Director appointed by the President with Senate consent. The Secretary can perform some of the Bureau's functions until a Director is appointed, as stated in CFP Act section 1066. The Secretary's authority under section 1066 is limited to the functions of the Bureau under subtitle F of the CFP Act. This includes transferred powers or authorities from seven transferor agencies. The Bureau's newly established powers are those outside of subtitle F. The Dodd-Frank Act granted enhanced consumer protection authorities to federal regulators, including the supervision of non-depository financial institutions. The Secretary's authority lasts until the Director of the CFPB is confirmed by the Senate. The standard advice and consent language used to establish positions does not explicitly mention the President's recess appointment powers. However, there have been instances where positions have been filled by recess appointees without challenge. If Richard Cordray had been confirmed as the first CFPB Director, the Secretary's power would have ended, and Cordray would have assumed full authority. Cordray's recess appointment raises questions about Congress's intent to restrict the powers of a recess-appointed CFPB Director. A reviewing court could interpret section 1066 in two ways regarding the powers of a recess-appointed CFPB Director. One interpretation suggests Cordray holds all powers of the CFPB, while the other implies he only assumes newly established powers. The phrase \"until a Director is confirmed by the Senate\" must be considered in conjunction with \"in accordance with section 1011.\" Section 1066 may be interpreted as allowing a recess-appointed CFPB Director to exercise full powers, in line with the principle that recess appointees have the same authority as Senate-confirmed appointees. The reference to section 1011 could be seen as an alternative way of appointing advice and consent positions. Courts may interpret section 1066 as a legislative delegation allowing a recess-appointed CFPB Director to exercise full powers, as recess appointees possess the same legal authority as Senate-confirmed appointees. Congress is presumed to be aware of established law and intends for new statutes to be consistent with established interpretations of law unless clearly indicated otherwise. A court could reason that if Congress intended to restrict the authority of a recess-appointed Director, it would have done so explicitly. This could have been achieved by delineating the powers of a recess appointee versus a Senate-confirmed appointee. In essence, section 1066 could be seen as delegating certain CFPB functions to the Secretary until a Director is appointed through the standard methods provided by the Constitution. The interpretation of section 1066 regarding the appointment of a CFPB Director can be viewed in two ways: one where a Senate-confirmed Director or a recess-appointed Director assumes full authorities, and another where the Secretary's interim authority ends only upon the appointment of a Senate-confirmed Director. This hinges on the strict interpretation of the language \"until the Director of the Bureau is confirmed by the Senate.\" The interpretation of section 1066 regarding the appointment of a CFPB Director likely relies on two common canons of statutory interpretation. The rule of surplusage suggests giving effect to every clause and word of a statute, implying Congress's intention in the language used. Another canon states that intentional inclusion or exclusion of language by Congress carries significance. If Congress intended to reiterate the standard advice and consent language, it could have used the same language as in section 1011. The interpretation of section 1066 suggests that the Secretary retains authority until a CFPB Director is confirmed by the Senate. Using the phrase \"shall be appointed\" instead of \"until confirmed by the Senate\" could provide clarity. This contrasts with the idea that a recess-appointed Director like Cordray can only directly exercise the Bureau's powers. The interpretation of section 1066 raises concerns about disparate treatment between recess appointees and Senate-confirmed appointees, potentially interfering with the President's recess appointment power. This could lead to separation of powers issues that a court may seek to avoid. The Supreme Court may construe the statute to avoid constitutional problems unless it goes against Congress' intent. The doctrine of \"constitutional avoidance\" suggests that a court will likely interpret section 1066 to avoid constitutional issues. This means that a reviewing court may consider that limiting a recess appointee's authority could raise constitutional concerns, as it may interfere with the President's power to fill vacancies. The constitutionality of congressional restrictions on the authority of a recess appointee, like those in section 1066, would be a novel issue for the courts. If section 1066 limits Cordray's powers, it must be determined if this provision actually restricts his authority. The constitutionality of congressional restrictions on the authority of a recess appointee, like those in section 1066, would be a novel issue for the courts. It is unclear if section 1066 limits the President's constitutional authority to make recess appointments or restricts the Director's powers after a recess appointment is made. The provision may act to restrict the Director rather than the President. Section 1066 defines the powers of the Office of the Director of the CFPB, with Congress having the authority to delegate powers to the officer. The delegation of authority is limited by Congress, requiring Senate confirmation for the Director to exercise transferred powers. This could be seen as a restricted delegation of authority to the Director, rather than a limitation on the President's ability to make appointments. Interpretation two could be seen as indirectly interfering with the President's recess appointment power by restricting the authorities of a recess appointee, giving them lesser constitutional standing compared to a Senate-confirmed officer. However, lower federal courts have clarified that recess appointees have the same constitutional authority as Senate-confirmed appointees. The Recess Appointments Clause was not intended as a lesser method of appointment. The executive branch believes that a recess appointee should have the same authority as a Senate-confirmed appointee. If a provision like section 1066 limits a recess appointee's powers, it could hinder the effectiveness of presidential recess appointments. While this interpretation may indirectly restrict the President's power, it does not completely prohibit recess appointments. The provision does not completely prohibit recess appointments but may infringe on the President's constitutional authority. Lower federal court cases have rejected attempts to restrict the President's power in making recess appointments, emphasizing deference to the President in the appointment process. The appeals court noted that when the President acts under the authority of the Constitution, there is a presumption of constitutionality. The court emphasized deference to the President in the appointment process, considering the President's active role in appointing officers. A constitutional analysis would assess if restricting the powers of a recess appointee infringes on the President's authority, potentially violating the separation of powers doctrine. The outcome of a challenge depends on the nature and extent of the infringement on the President's essential powers. The Supreme Court uses formalism and functionalism to evaluate separation of powers cases, with formalism focusing on definitional boundaries and functionalism on the effect of power. A formalist approach is more likely to find congressional restrictions on the President's recess appointment authority unconstitutional. This is because the President's authority is seen as deriving from a clear constitutional commitment, making any attempt to limit it a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The President's recess appointment power is considered a clear constitutional commitment, and any attempt by Congress to limit it could be seen as an unconstitutional encroachment on executive authority. This principle has been applied to other executive powers, such as the President's authority to grant reprieves and pardons, which are not subject to legislative control. The President's authority to negotiate treaties is exclusive and cannot be intruded upon by the Senate or Congress. The Recess Appointments Clause operates as a separate authority of the President, excluding the Senate from participation. The President's recess appointment power may face separation of powers concerns, but the Supreme Court has recognized few presidential powers as entirely excluded from congressional influence. Reasonable congressional intrusions may be allowed as long as they do not prevent the President from fulfilling constitutionally assigned functions. The President's appointment and removal powers are subject to congressional influence. While the Constitution grants the President the power to appoint officers, Congress can impose qualifications and rules for appointees. The President's power to oversee executive officers through removal is also subject to reasonable congressional regulation. The application of a functionalist analysis considers whether certain statutory constructs undermine the President's core functions. The President's recess appointment power may not excessively interfere with filling vacancies, and separation of powers concerns could be less significant. Interpreting restrictions on a recess appointee could raise constitutional concerns, with a possibility of a court adopting an interpretation that avoids constitutional conflicts. It is unlikely that a reviewing court would adopt interpretation two of section 1066, which could restrict the powers of a recess appointed director. Without clear legislative intent, a court may be hesitant to alter the balance of power between branches. If Cordray's appointment was valid, he is likely free to exercise his full authorities. The legal uncertainty surrounding the President's recess appointments of Cordray, Flynn, Block, and Griffin Jr. raises questions about the validity of decisions made by the CFPB and NLRB under their direction. If a court deems their appointments unconstitutional, the de facto officer doctrine may come into play. The de facto officer doctrine validates acts performed by individuals in official roles, even if their appointment is later found to be invalid. It aims to maintain stability, prevent disruptions, and ensure government functions smoothly despite technical defects. The Supreme Court applies this doctrine mostly in cases with minor statutory issues, rather than constitutional challenges. Courts have declined to apply the de facto officer doctrine in cases involving constitutional challenges, such as those concerning the CFPB and NLRB recess appointments. Challenges to these appointments are likely to raise significant constitutional questions related to separation of powers and the interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause. This case falls under the Court's statement in Ryder v. United States that a timely challenge to the constitutional validity of an appointment warrants a decision on the merits of the question. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court invalidated appointments to the Federal Election Commission made by Congress, finding a violation of the Appointments Clause. The Court granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the plaintiffs without relying on the de facto officer doctrine. Similarly, in New Process Steel v. NLRB, the Court vacated and remanded adjudication due to the NLRB lacking authority with only two Board members. The NLRB granted relief by vacating and remanding its adjudication. The Court did not address the validity of decisions made by the two-member Board in New Process Steel. Uncertainties remain regarding the consequences of invalidating CFPB and NLRB appointees. The President's recess appointments raise unresolved constitutional questions. The scope of the Recess Appointments Clause is ambiguous, with a lack of judicial precedent to clarify it. If the President's recess appointments are challenged, potential plaintiffs could be individuals or associations affected by actions of the CFPB or NLRB. The key question would be whether the appointments were made \"during a recess of the Senate,\" which may depend on the Senate's pro forma sessions. The constitutionality of recess appointments hinges on defining a \"Recess\" for the Recess Appointments Clause. These unresolved issues involve complex legal interpretations. The Appointments Clause raises potential separation of powers issues and questions best left to the President and Congress. Even if recess appointments are valid, concerns may arise regarding Director Cordray's authority under the CFP Act. Courts may avoid limiting Cordray's powers as a recess appointee compared to a Senate-confirmed appointee due to constitutional implications."
