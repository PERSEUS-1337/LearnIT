    "content": "The Act titled \"Southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas, Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Care Improvement Act of 2011\" aims to establish a Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center or Network Site for veterans in the mentioned region. The Act aims to establish a Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center or Network Site for veterans in the southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas region, where the military population has significantly increased due to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fort Bliss is expected to see a growth in Armed Forces members, with traumatic brain injury being a common issue among veterans. The high occurrence of traumatic brain injury among veterans returning to the El Paso, Texas, and southern New Mexico region from overseas service in Iraq and Afghanistan is a significant concern. A recent RAND Corporation study estimates that 20 percent of these veterans have a traumatic brain injury, requiring ongoing care. The Department of Veterans Affairs recommends that all veterans with polytraumatic injuries be referred for treatment. The Department of Veterans Affairs recommends that veterans with polytraumatic injuries in the El Paso, Texas, and southern New Mexico region be referred to a polytrauma rehabilitation center or network site. Currently, there are no such facilities within 300 miles of Fort Bliss, White Sands Missile Range, or Holloman Air Force Base. A new polytrauma rehabilitation center or network site is needed to address the significant hardships faced by veterans in this region. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to submit a report within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must submit a report to Congress on the feasibility of establishing a polytrauma rehabilitation center in southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas, within a reasonable distance of military bases. The report will assess existing facilities and compare their effectiveness. The report will assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs for traumatic brain injuries in urban vs. rural areas, the impact of stress on therapy outcomes in urban settings, and the cost of living on veterans' recovery and their families. The Secretary will evaluate potential locations for a new polytrauma rehabilitation center, including Fort Bayard Medical Center in New Mexico. Consultation with State and local government agencies in southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas, is required."
