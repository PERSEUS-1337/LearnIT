    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Infrastructure Banks for Schools Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that $10.42 billion was spent on education infrastructure in 1995, with an average new high school cost of $15.4 million. $127 billion is needed for school repair and construction. 14 million students attend schools needing extensive repairs. Poor school conditions affect student achievement. Students in schools with poor conditions fall behind by 10.9 percentage points compared to those in excellent buildings. Moving students to new facilities can lead to a 20% increase in test scores. The Government Accounting Office reports that 52% of schools lack technology elements, affecting 21.3 million students. Local educational agencies struggle to secure funding for school improvements. Collaboration is needed from all levels of government and community sectors to address challenges in public schools and libraries. The deplorable state of collections in America's public school libraries has increased demands on public libraries, with public libraries often substituting for school libraries. Research shows that 50 percent of a child's intellectual development occurs before age 4, highlighting the critical role that public and school libraries play in early childhood development by providing a wealth of books and educational resources. Public and school libraries play a critical role in early childhood development by offering a variety of books and resources to give every child a head start in life and learning. The State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, may establish State infrastructure banks and multistate infrastructure banks to provide loans for building or repairing schools and public libraries. Congress grants consent for interstate compacts between States for this purpose. The Secretary of the Treasury can establish multistate infrastructure banks through an interstate compact for funding loans to local educational agencies and public libraries. Grants will be provided for initial capital, and repayments will be used to make additional loans. Each State must meet infrastructure bank requirements to participate. Each State establishing an infrastructure bank must contribute 25% of the capitalization grant from non-Federal sources, identify an operating entity to manage funds, allow funds to be used as reserves for debt issued by the State, and ensure investment income is credited to the account for providing loans. The infrastructure bank must ensure that funds are available for loans to eligible projects, invested in approved instruments to earn interest, and that loans bear interest at or below the lowest rates for tax-exempt bonds. Repayment of loans must start within a year of project completion, and the repayment term should be reasonable. The infrastructure bank must ensure funds for loans, invest in approved instruments, and keep loan interest rates low. Loans must be repaid within 30 years, and the bank must report annually to the Secretary. The bank can provide loans for eligible projects to local educational agencies or public libraries. Loan applications must include project details. The infrastructure bank requires detailed information on renovation projects, including descriptions of deficiencies, corrective actions, improvements, cost estimates, energy conservation plans, and any other requested information. Final action on loan applications must be taken within 90 days. The infrastructure bank considers applications for loans based on fiscal capacity, safety concerns for students, and demonstrated need for construction or renovation projects. Loan applications must be acted upon within 90 days. The infrastructure bank considers loan applications for construction, renovation, or repair projects for educational facilities based on fiscal capacity, safety concerns, and demonstrated need. Eligible projects include new school construction, classroom repairs, safety enhancements, and facility upgrades. The infrastructure bank considers loan applications for projects to enhance educational facilities, including addressing environmental hazards, providing infrastructure for educational technology, and ensuring compliance with environmental and safety regulations. The infrastructure bank considers loan applications for projects to enhance educational facilities, including addressing environmental hazards, providing infrastructure for educational technology, and ensuring compliance with environmental and safety regulations. This includes work related to hazardous waste disposal, energy efficiency, asbestos hazard detection, and construction or repair of public library facilities. The wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act apply to these projects. The Davis-Bacon Act applies to individuals employed on infrastructure bank projects. Loans must supplement, not replace, other funds. Repayment of loans cannot count towards non-Federal project costs. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish guidelines for the infrastructure bank. Federal funds do not create obligations. The infrastructure bank established under this section does not create obligations for the United States. Federal funds contributed are not a commitment or guarantee. Management of funds and program administration have specific guidelines. Authorization of Appropriations: $500,000,000 is authorized for grants to States for infrastructure banks for fiscal year 2002 and the next 4 years. The Secretary of the Treasury will review the financial condition of each bank and report to Congress within 90 days. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
