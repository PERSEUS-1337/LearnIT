    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Ag Science Center Act of 2006\". Congress finds that the State of California is a leading producer of over 350 agricultural commodities, including a significant portion of tomatoes, grapes, almonds, dates, figs, olives, cling peaches, prunes, raisins, and milk consumed in the United States. California also leads in agricultural exports, shipping over $7 billion worth of commodities annually. The economic impact of the state's 78,500 farms is substantial. The investment by the 78,500 farms in California is significant. The state must focus on the needs of agricultural producers to maintain a strong industry. Agricultural land has been rapidly disappearing since 1945 due to various factors, threatening the state's ability to supply food for its population and export to the rest of the world. Educating young people about the importance of agriculture in the United States is crucial for future benefits. Public understanding and appreciation of agriculture are needed to ensure a secure future with domestically produced healthy food. Citizens, especially youth, must actively participate in shaping the future of agriculture in the state. The proposed National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California aims to educate future generations about preserving agricultural land and the importance of agriculture. Its mission is to provide engaging agricultural learning opportunities for young people to understand the necessity of a vibrant agricultural economy for society. The proposed National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California aims to educate young people for career opportunities in agriculture. According to findings, the Center would create new jobs, economic activity, and labor income through construction and ongoing operations. The Yosemite Community College District Board approved a 3.5-acre site for the National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California on September 14, 2005. The Center's establishment is deemed to be in the national interest as it would support the economy of the State and the United States by ensuring a healthy and profitable place for agriculture in future generations. Assistance is provided for the establishment of the National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture will provide grants to the Ag Science Center, Inc. in Stanislaus County, California, covering up to 33% of the total costs for establishing the National Ag Science Center. Ag Science Center, Inc. must submit a detailed grant proposal outlining plans for design and construction to receive the grant. The grant proposal for the National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California includes plans for design, construction, furnishing, equipping, and expansion. $10,000,000 is authorized for grants under this proposal."
