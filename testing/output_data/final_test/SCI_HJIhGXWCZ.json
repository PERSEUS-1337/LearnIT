    "content": "In this work, a new framework is introduced for temporal predictions under uncertainty. The method involves disentangling predictable and unpredictable components of the future state, encoding the unpredictable parts into a low-dimensional latent variable, and using a simple supervised training objective. The approach is evaluated in video prediction tasks across multiple datasets, demonstrating the ability to generate diverse predictions efficiently. Generative Adversarial Networks have been introduced as a framework for handling the multi-modal nature of time series predictions by formulating the problem as a minimax game between a predictor function and a trainable discriminator network. This approach allows for handling multiple output modes efficiently. In this work, a novel architecture is introduced to address mode collapsing in conditional generation, particularly in time series data. The architecture allows for robust multimodal conditional predictions, overcoming challenges such as added complexity and increased computational cost associated with existing techniques. The architecture introduced addresses mode collapsing in conditional generation for time series data by separating future states into deterministic and stochastic components. This Error Encoding Network (EEN) model consists of three function mappings at each timestep. The Error Encoding Network (EEN) model separates future states into deterministic and non-deterministic components, with mappings from current state to future state based on a latent vector. The training involves all mappings, while the inference phase focuses on the latent vector. The method is applied to various video datasets and can produce multimodal predictions of future video frames. The EEN model addresses mode collapsing in conditional generation for time series data. The method discussed focuses on video data but can be applied to any continuous-valued time series. Dealing with uncertainty through latent variables is a natural approach, especially when targets depend on unpredictable factors. For instance, using a set of consecutive video frames as inputs and predicting the following frame. Traditional latent variable models like k-means or mixtures of Gaussians are trained by minimizing loss alternately. The method focuses on training models like k-means or mixtures of Gaussians by minimizing loss with respect to latent variables and model parameters. In the case of neural network models, continuous latent variables can be optimized using gradient descent. The approach is based on the idea that latent variables should represent what is not explainable by the input data, and should be optimized as a continuous function of the input and target variables. The method involves training two functions to predict targets: a deterministic model g(x) and a latent variable model f(x, z). The deterministic model g is trained first to extract information from the input data, with unpredictable elements captured in the residual error. A low-dimensional latent variable z is then generated to encode the mode identity for more accurate predictions by f. After training the deterministic model g(x), a low-dimensional latent variable z is extracted to encode mode identity for accurate predictions by f(x, z). This prevents the network from learning a trivial solution and allows for generating different predictions by computing f(x, z) with z sampled from the training set. The model architecture involves non-parametric estimation of the distribution over z, with f and g having similar architectures. Training is sped up by initializing f with the parameters of g. This approach differs from VAEs by not pushing z towards a predefined distribution. In recent years, works have explored video prediction by training models to predict future frames for learning representations and action-conditional forward models. Our work makes different predictions by conditioning on latent variables extracted in an unsupervised manner from videos. Several works have used adversarial losses in video prediction. The work utilized a multiscale architecture and various losses to predict future frames in videos, improving image quality by reducing blur effects. The generator learned to ignore noise, similar to a deterministic model. Other approaches involve inferring latent variables for video prediction, with a model incorporating a discrete latent variable for selecting different networks to predict future video frames. This offers more flexibility compared to purely deterministic models. Our model infers continuous latent variables through a learned parametric function, allowing for more flexibility in future modes. This approach differs from using discrete latent variables like in previous work. The generative model is learned by jointly learning representations in a latent space and decoder model parameters, leading to easier training compared to adversarial networks. Our model infers continuous latent variables through a learned parametric function, allowing for more flexibility in future modes. This is related to our method, where we compute latent variables through a learned function of the deterministic network's prediction error. Our model differs from other models by passing the compressed error signal from the deterministic network backwards in time to serve as input to the latent variable network at the previous timestep. Our method uses a latent variable z at training time, derived from input x and target y. It utilizes a pretrained deterministic model to compute the residual error of z and for network initialization. The non-parametric sampling procedure eliminates the need for prior assumptions on z distribution. Tested on various video datasets, including games and robot manipulation, our model predicts the next 4 frames based on the previous 4 frames. Our model predicts the next 4 frames based on the previous 4 frames using different models like CNN, CNN + noise, AE, cVAE, and GAN. The models have the same architecture but differ in loss function and sampling procedure for z variables. The architecture includes a 3-layer convolutional network and a 3-layer deconvolutional network with 64 feature maps at each layer and batch normalization. Code for training and video generations is available at url. The models used in the study have the same architecture, with strided convolutions instead of pooling. The \u03c6 network has a 3-layer convolutional structure with 64 feature maps and two fully-connected layers. Different loss functions were used for training, with the 1 loss giving better results for the Robot dataset. The goal was to evaluate the model's ability to capture multimodal structures. The study evaluated models' ability to capture multimodal structures using various optimization techniques and learning rates. Different models were trained with specific parameters, such as the number of latent variables and learning rates for each task. The GAN experiments utilized 64 latent variables and specific learning rates for the generator and discriminator. The video datasets used included Atari Games, where a pretrained A2C agent was used to generate gameplay episodes. We used a pretrained A2C agent to generate gameplay episodes for Atari Games and Flappy Bird. The forward model was trained to predict the next 4 frames using the previous 4 frames as input. Additionally, we utilized a dataset of 240x240 pixel color images of objects before and after manipulation by a robot. The model was trained to predict the next image by poking objects with a robot in a simulated environment. Another experiment involved training the model to predict 4 frames in a driving simulation. The goal was to generate realistic predictions from video sequences. The authors quantitatively evaluated multimodal predictions using a fixed number of generated samples to report the best score. Generating more samples can improve the score if the model can cover several modes with its latent variables. The text discusses the evaluation of multimodal predictions using a fixed number of generated samples to determine the best score. It mentions that generating more samples may not improve the loss if the test sample mode is already captured. The text also highlights that the metric used can detect mode collapse but may not identify when the model generates samples from modes not present in the testing data. Additionally, it mentions that GAN results were not included in the plots due to significant differences in loss optimization compared to other models. The EEN and AE show improved performance with more generated samples, while the CNN + noise and cVAE models perform similarly to the baseline CNN model, indicating they ignore their latent variables. This behavior, known as \"posterior collapse,\" occurs when the model learns a deterministic function of the conditioning variable x to lower the KL term in the loss. Various strategies have been proposed to address this issue. The EEN and AE can generate diverse predictions without modifications or additional hyperparameters, showing improved performance with more generated samples. AE performance is consistently lower than EEN, except for TORCS where it is comparable or slightly better. Qualitative results include visualizations and videos for better understanding. The autoencoder model can generate diverse predictions but may contain artifacts, as seen in the second set of frames in Atari Breakout. The model's uncertainty is reflected in the diffusing image of the paddle over time, while the residual shows the movement of the ball and paddle that the deterministic model cannot predict. Sampling different latent variables z produces different movement sequences of the paddle from its initial location. The EEN model generates predictions with artifacts in Flappy Bird, showing different pipe heights based on latent variables. In contrast, the autoencoder predicts unrealistic outcomes like different colored pipes. The z variable in EEN limits information by subtracting predictable input data. The Robot dataset involves unpredictable actions like random direction and force. The EEN model can produce diverse predictions in various scenarios, such as moving objects to different locations. Autoencoder predictions were similar but scored lower. Evaluations on the TORCS driving simulator showed changes in road stripes and frame translations. No significant qualitative differences were observed between EEN and AE generations. In this work, a new framework for temporal prediction in the presence of uncertainty has been introduced. The method disentangles predictable and non-predictable components of the future state, without the need for adversarial networks or additional tuning to prevent mode collapse. The approach is applicable to various data types and architectures, with potential for further improvements in sampling strategies. Our model can quickly extract latent variables from unseen data, making it useful for actions extraction and imitation learning from large datasets. It can also be applied to planning by unrolling different possible futures."
