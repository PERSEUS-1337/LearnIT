    "content": "SECTION 1. EXPEDITED HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION PROCEDURES. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior are required to conduct projects to reduce hazardous fuels in accordance with a 10-year Comprehensive Strategy. Priority is given to wildland urban interface areas, municipal watersheds, and forested or rangeland areas affected by disease or insects. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior will implement projects to reduce hazardous fuels in federal land areas affected by disease, insect activity, or wind throw. An aggregate area of 3.75 million acres will be treated, and a collaborative process with interested parties will be developed for project selection. Projects under this section will not be subject to appeal requirements. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior may promulgate regulations to implement hazardous fuels reduction actions, which are categorically excluded from further analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act unless there are extraordinary circumstances. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior can categorically exclude proposed hazardous fuels reduction actions from environmental impact statements or assessments if they meet specific criteria, such as removing a limited amount of wood products and ensuring regeneration of harvested areas. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior can categorically exclude proposed hazardous fuels reduction actions from environmental impact statements or assessments if they meet specific criteria. Scoping is required for all proposed actions. A conclusive presumption applies only to projects in condition class 3 areas within specified locations. Extraordinary circumstances require following agency procedures for categorical exclusions. To reduce fire risk, the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior must focus on projects that do not involve new road construction, maintain old and large trees, and deposit generated revenues to the Treasury. Hazardous fuels reduction activities should prioritize high priority areas. The Forest Service and the Department of the Interior must focus on hazardous fuels reduction activities in high priority areas to address human safety and property loss. Ten percent of funds should benefit businesses in economically disadvantaged communities. A commission will assess the impacts of projects implemented under this Act. The commission, consisting of 12 to 15 members, will represent conservation, local communities, and commodity interests. They will submit a report to Congress within 24 months. A multiparty monitoring process will be established by the Secretaries to assess projects, with funds coming from hazardous fuels reduction funds. Interested individuals or organizations can participate in the monitoring and evaluation process."
