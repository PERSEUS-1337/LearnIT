    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Economic Growth and Development Act\". Congress finds that sustainable economic growth is crucial for addressing development challenges and lifting people out of poverty. Private sector investment and economic growth have been successful in reducing poverty in the past 50 years. There is a need for a new approach to official development assistance due to changes in capital flows to the developing world. The majority of capital flowing to developing countries now comes from the private sector, compared to public sector foreign assistance 40 years ago. To promote sustainable economic development, the US Government should involve US businesses in development planning. Many countries that received US foreign assistance are now major importers of US goods and services, showing the success of economic growth through private sector investment. The US Government lacks a streamlined interagency mechanism for coordinating with the private sector, making it difficult for US businesses to partner with agencies involved in foreign assistance and investment promotion. Despite efforts by development agencies to improve private sector coordination, there is no integrated strategy for engaging the private sector effectively. The US Government lacks a streamlined interagency mechanism for coordinating with the private sector, hindering partnerships with US businesses in foreign assistance and investment promotion. Development programs could benefit from private sector perspectives and market data to attract investment and promote public-private partnerships in key sectors. The Millennium Challenge Corporation and Partnership for Growth analyze constraints on growth. Partnership for Growth and the Millennium Challenge Corporation analyze constraints on growth to inform and guide development programs effectively. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that provides definitions for terms used in the document. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms such as Administrator, Appropriate congressional committees, Private sector, Secretary, and United States development agencies. The term \"United States development agencies\" includes the Department of State, United States Agency for International Development, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Trade and Development Agency, Inter-American Foundation, and African Development Foundation. The purpose of this Act is to enhance coordination between United States development agencies, the private sector, and private sector investment activities. It aims to integrate private sector input into planning processes, analyze constraints on growth and investment, ensure accountability for coordination, and promote private sector investment. The Sense of Congress on United States development assistance is highlighted in Section 5 of the Act, emphasizing the importance of coordination between development agencies, the private sector, and investment activities. The sense of Congress emphasizes the need for US development assistance to focus on building civic institutions, promoting public accountability, and fostering democratic social contracts. Government policies should be guided by clear benchmarks for partner country commitment to development priorities. Programs should have a unified strategy, ambitious targets, and robust monitoring and evaluation plans. The United States development assistance should help partner countries increase revenues, improve budget transparency, promote domestic investment, and combat illicit capital flows. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda emphasizes economic growth and the commitment of domestic resources towards development goals. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda emphasizes the importance of domestic resource commitments for sustainable development, accountability, and economic growth. It highlights the need for alignment of incentives among stakeholders and the building of strong social contracts between people and their governments. The United States development finance programs should prioritize domestic capacity and responsibility for outcomes, aiming for true country ownership and sustainability. These programs are expected to surpass traditional grant-based assistance in total capital investments, showing the potential of development finance for driving economic growth. It is crucial for these programs to focus on development purposes, complement private capital, and operate without political agendas. The United States development finance programs, such as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, have the ability to drive economic growth by surpassing traditional grant-based assistance and focusing on development purposes. However, there is a need to enhance these programs by providing additional development finance tools and resources to maximize their impact. The United States development finance programs, like the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, can boost economic growth by going beyond traditional grant-based aid and focusing on development goals. Enhancing these programs with more tools and resources is crucial to maximize their impact. The effectiveness of these programs is hindered by uncertainty around legal authorities, and a multi-year authorization and reformulation of fund usage is recommended. Additionally, US development assistance should prioritize resources that support enhanced trade capacity and promote fairer and more sustainable trade with partner countries. SEC. 6. INTERAGENCY STRATEGY TO COORDINATE US DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT. The President will establish a primary interagency mechanism to assist the private sector in coordinating US development programs with private sector investment activities. This mechanism will streamline and integrate private sector liaison, coordination, and investment promotion functions, facilitate the use of development and finance tools to attract more private sector participation, and establish a single point of contact for partnership opportunities with US development agencies. The President will submit an annual strategy to Congress for coordinating private sector investments for development. This strategy will include targets for investment, roles of government agencies, and responsibilities within US missions abroad. The annual strategy submitted to Congress by the President includes targets for private sector investments, roles of government agencies, and responsibilities within US missions abroad, as well as a plan for monitoring, evaluation, and public accountability. SEC. 7 directs policy teams to include private sector coordination in development strategies. SEC. 8 focuses on analyzing constraints on growth and investment in foreign countries and sectors. The Secretary, Administrator, and relevant Federal agencies must ensure rigorous analysis of constraints on growth and investment guides economic development strategies. This includes identifying infrastructure, legal, tax, and regulatory obstacles in recipient countries, and key economic sectors like agriculture, transportation, energy, and finance. Results of these analyses must be integrated into US development agencies' strategies. The United States development agencies must ensure that their strategies are informed by rigorous analysis of constraints on growth and investment, including infrastructure, legal, tax, and regulatory obstacles in recipient countries and key economic sectors. The strategies should be made available to the public and stakeholders for comment before finalization. The President must submit a report to the Senate and House committees within a year of this Act's enactment, detailing the implementation measures and intended outcomes."
