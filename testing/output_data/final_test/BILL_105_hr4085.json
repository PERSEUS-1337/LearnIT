Congress aims to ensure that these rules align with the intent of the enacted laws and are approved through established procedures. The \"Significant Regulation Oversight Act of 1998\" mandates that significant rules must receive congressional approval before taking effect. Agencies must submit a report to Congress before a proposed significant rule can become final, including the rule's text, purpose, anticipated effects, and any cost-benefit analysis. The \"Significant Regulation Oversight Act of 1998\" requires agencies to submit a report to Congress before a proposed significant rule can become final. The report must include an explanation of whether the interpretation is required by the statute, or if not, why the agency's interpretation is preferred. Additionally, any other relevant information or requirements under other Acts and Executive orders must be included. Upon receipt of the report, each House of Congress must provide a copy to the relevant committee members. (c) If Congress does not approve a proposed significant rule, no inference can be drawn from Congress's actions or inactions regarding the rule or related statutes. Congressional approval procedure for significant rules is outlined in Section 4. The majority leader of each House of Congress must introduce a joint resolution containing the text of a proposed significant rule within a specific timeframe. The resolution is then referred to the appropriate committee for consideration and may be reported with or without recommendation, or the committee may choose not to report it. The joint resolution must be reported by the committee within 45 session days in the Senate or 45 legislative days in the House. If not reported, the committee is automatically discharged. A final vote on the resolution must be taken within 90 session days in the Senate or 90 legislative days in the House after its introduction. The House of Representatives has specific rules for considering joint resolutions, including privileged motion, limited debate time, and restrictions on amendments and reconsideration of votes. Appeals related to the application of House rules are also addressed. The Rules of the House of Representatives apply to joint resolutions without debate. In the Senate, a motion to consider a joint resolution is privileged and not debatable, with limited debate time of 10 hours. Amendments to the motion are not allowed, and reconsideration of the vote is prohibited. Debate in the Senate on any debatable motion or appeal in connection with a joint resolution under this section is limited to 1 hour, divided between the mover and the manager of the resolution. Additional time can be allotted by the leaders. A motion to further limit debate on a joint resolution is not debatable. Under this section, a joint resolution's resolution is not debatable, and no amendments are allowed in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. If the other House has passed a joint resolution with the same text, the procedure remains the same. The joint resolution process outlined in this section is non-debatable and does not allow for amendments in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. The resolution must match that of the other House for the procedure to proceed. This section is enacted by Congress as an exercise of rulemaking power, recognizing the constitutional right of each House to change rules related to their procedures.
