    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Advancement in Pediatric Autism Research Act\". The Congress finds that infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental diseases causing severe language and communication impairments. Estimates show 1 in 500 children born today will be diagnosed with autism. Limited data on prevalence in the US exists, with no national studies conducted. Recent international studies suggest similar trends. Recent studies in Canada, Europe, and Japan indicate a higher prevalence of classic autism. Three-quarters of those with infantile autism end up in institutions by age 13. The cost of caring for individuals with autism is estimated at $13.3 billion per year. Advancements in biomedical science suggest that effective treatments and a cure for autism are possible with appropriate coordination of research efforts. Recent research suggests that environmental factors may contribute to autism, potentially making contributing causes preventable. Understanding the prevalence and incidence of autism is crucial for discovering effective treatments and a cure. Finding the causes of autism may also help researchers understand other developmental disorders. More knowledge is needed on the underlying causes, treatment, and prevention of autism spectrum disorders, as well as the epidemiology, risk factors, and early diagnosis methods for infantile autism. The National Institutes of Health announced a program of research on autism and autism spectrum disorders in 1998, aiming to identify subtypes, disseminate relevant biomedical data, and assess costs for educating and caring for individuals with these disorders. Adequate funding is crucial for these efforts. Adequate funding is crucial for carrying out the program on autism and autism spectrum disorders. SEC. 3. Expansion, intensification, and coordination of activities of National Institutes of Health with respect to research on autism. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on autism. The Director of NIH is required to expand and coordinate research activities on autism. Grants and contracts will be awarded to establish centers of excellence for autism research. The Director of NIH is required to expand and coordinate research activities on autism by providing operating support for centers of excellence. These centers conduct basic and clinical research into the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of autism, including research in developmental neurobiology, genetics, and psychopharmacology. Additionally, the centers may offer services to make individuals aware of research opportunities and provide health care and referrals for participants. The Director of NIH coordinates information among centers for autism research, ensuring regular communication and reports on activities. Each center uses facilities of a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director determines the number of centers and duration of support based on available funding. The Director of NIH coordinates information among centers for autism research, ensuring regular communication and reports on activities. The Director shall establish not less than five centers for a period of up to 5 years, extendable for additional periods if recommended by a peer review group. A program for research on autism includes the donation, collection, preservation, and availability of tissues and genetic materials. The program for autism research includes standards for sample donation, collection, and preservation. The Director of NIH will provide public information and receive comments on NIH programs related to autism. $33,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2000, with additional funding for 2001-2004. The Secretary will establish a program to provide information and education on autism to health professionals and the public, including advances in diagnosis and treatment. Stipends may be provided for health professionals in training programs. $6,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. The Secretary will establish the \"Autism Coordinating Committee\" to coordinate efforts within the Department of Health and Human Services regarding autism. The Committee will consist of ex officio members, including the Directors of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Mental Health. The Autism Coordinating Committee will include the Directors of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Mental Health, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with appointed members including research scientists and representatives of national organizations focused on autism research. The Autism Coordinating Committee includes representatives from national organizations focused on autism research, clinicians specializing in autism treatment, and parents or legal guardians of individuals with autism or other developmental disabilities, appointed by the Secretary in consultation with relevant institutions. The Autism Coordinating Committee members are appointed by the Secretary in consultation with relevant institutions and national organizations. The Committee receives administrative support from the Department of Health and Human Services, with members serving for 3-year terms and meeting at least twice a year. Members do not receive additional compensation but may be reimbursed for expenses. The Autism Coordinating Committee members may be reimbursed for appropriate and additional expenses incurred through service on the Committee. SEC. 6. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2000, and annually thereafter, regarding the implementation of this Act and its amendments."
