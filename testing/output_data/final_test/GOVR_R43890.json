    "content": "Asset forfeiture has a long history in Anglo-Saxon law, evolving into federal statutes in the United States. It involves confiscating property or money due to being illegal, proceeds of a crime, or used in a crime. There are two forms: civil and criminal, each with its own rules. In civil forfeiture, the government targets the property, not the owner, in an in rem proceeding. The guilt of the owner is not questioned, and criminal prosecution may not be involved. Civil asset forfeiture involves confiscating property connected to a federal crime through civil proceedings, without the same constitutional safeguards as criminal cases. Criminal forfeiture, on the other hand, follows a criminal prosecution and requires a conviction for property forfeiture. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 was enacted after concerns of overreach in the War on Drugs era, marking a significant overhaul in federal forfeiture law. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 was the first major overhaul in federal forfeiture law in 200 years, bringing significant reform to federal forfeiture policy. Some question if the law went far enough to rein in overzealous police tactics, while others question the legitimacy of civil forfeiture. The Department of Justice asserts asset forfeiture plays a critical role in disrupting illegal enterprises and deterring crime. Concerns about misuse of federal forfeiture laws have led to new reform proposals, including the FAIR Act introduced in the 114th Congress. The FAIR Act (S. 255 and H.R. 540) and the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 5212) were introduced in the 113th Congress. This report will discuss legal issues and reforms related to asset forfeiture, including burden of proof, innocent owner defense, access to counsel, allocation of profits from confiscated assets, and DOJ's equitable sharing program. Asset forfeiture comes in civil and criminal forms, with the most significant legal distinction being the principle surrounding civil asset forfeiture. The legal distinction in civil asset forfeiture is that the defendant is considered property, not a person. This allows the government to seize property without bringing charges against individuals. This practice has roots in English law and was adopted in American customs laws. Civil asset forfeiture has been a major part of federal law enforcement policy since the War on Drugs in 1970. It allows the government to confiscate substances and conveyances used in drug crimes, as well as money and property connected to illegal transactions. This practice extends beyond drug crimes to other areas as well. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act addressed complaints about procedural rules favoring the government in civil asset forfeiture laws. Government only needed probable cause to confiscate property, shifting burden to owner to prove innocence. Congress reformed the system in the 1990s after years of debate. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 made changes to the asset forfeiture system, including shifting the burden of proof to the government, creating an innocent owner defense, eliminating the bond requirement, and imposing stricter filing deadlines. The civil forfeiture process starts with the government seizing property connected to a crime and providing notice to interested parties. If no one claims the property, it can be forfeited through an administrative process. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 changed the asset forfeiture system, shifting the burden of proof to the government and creating an innocent owner defense. If no one claims the property, it can be forfeited through an administrative process without a court case. If a claim is made or the property doesn't meet the criteria for administrative forfeiture, it must go through a judicial forfeiture proceeding. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 changed the asset forfeiture system, shifting the burden of proof to the government and creating an innocent owner defense. Under CAFRA, the government can use administrative forfeiture for property under $500,000, vehicles involved in drug crimes, and monetary instruments. Real property like homes or businesses is not subject to administrative forfeiture. CAFRA also introduced time restrictions for filing forfeiture claims. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 introduced time restrictions for filing forfeiture claims, requiring the government to provide written notice within 60 days of seizure. In adoptive forfeiture cases, the time limit is extended to 90 days. Failure to meet these deadlines may result in the property being returned to the owner without prejudice to the government's right to initiate forfeiture proceedings later. If the Department of Justice misses the deadline, it can still start forfeiture proceedings without returning the property. Interested parties have 35 days after receiving notice to file a claim, or 30 days after the final publication of the seizure notice if they did not receive the letter. Claiming the property requires identifying it, stating the claimant's interest, and making the claim under oath. If no claim is made within the specified time, the government can declare forfeiture and sell the property at auction. Under Section 983(e) of CAFRA, a property owner can file a motion in district court to set aside an administrative forfeiture if they were not provided notice. This is the exclusive remedy and must be filed within five years of the seizure. If the court sets aside the forfeiture, the government can initiate a new forfeiture proceeding within 60 days. The government has specific timeframes for initiating forfeiture proceedings, with deadlines for filing administrative and judicial actions. If a claim is filed, the case is referred to the U.S. attorney's office for judicial forfeiture proceedings. Claimants have a limited time to file a claim and answer the government's complaint, with the burden of proof on the government to show the property is forfeitable. The burden of proof is on the government to prove property is forfeitable by a preponderance of the evidence. Claimants have a constitutional right to a jury trial for any factual issues. Criminal forfeitures are in personam actions against the defendant's property only. The government can confiscate property owned by the defendant in criminal forfeiture cases, expanding from just RICO and CCE statutes to cover all federal drug crimes. A \"bridge statute\" allows for property confiscation in criminal proceedings that is forfeitable under civil forfeiture provisions. The government's first task is to secure the property subject to confiscation, and they can seek a pretrial restraining order. The government can seek a pretrial restraining order by alleging that the property would be subject to forfeiture upon conviction. The Supreme Court has determined that probable cause is the appropriate standard for such orders, which can be made by the grand jury. If the government seeks the order before obtaining an indictment, it must show a \"substantial probability\" of prevailing on forfeiture, the risk of property destruction or removal, and the need to preserve the property outweighing the owner's hardship. Alternatively, the government can request a warrant for property seizure under Section 853(f). To issue a warrant for property seizure, the court must find probable cause for forfeiture and that a pretrial restraining order would be insufficient. The government must notify the defendant about the forfeiture. Rule 32.2 was amended in 2000 to require only a general notice of forfeiture without specifying the property. The defendant can request a bill of particulars from the prosecutor to list the property subject to forfeiture instead of listing it in the indictment. Courts disagree on when and how the government should disclose this information. During the guilt phase of the trial, the elements of the offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, the court will proceed to the forfeiture phase, where the majority of courts use the preponderance standard of proof. For federal narcotics crimes, property is presumed forfeitable if acquired around the time of the violation without a lawful source. In civil forfeiture cases, the government can issue a preliminary order of forfeiture if there is no lawful source for the property. Legal standing is crucial for a claimant to challenge the forfeiture, requiring constitutional, statutory, and prudential standing. Congress can adjust statutory requirements but not constitutional standing. Standing is a significant issue in asset forfeiture cases. Standing is crucial in asset forfeiture cases, especially when cash is involved. Federal courts have specific rules to determine if a claimant has the right to challenge asset forfeiture. The claimant must prove standing by showing a legal interest in the property. This can be done by demonstrating ownership, possessory, or security interest in the property. Failure to establish standing means there is no case. Statutory standing requires compliance with asset forfeiture laws, while prudential standing is based on the claimant's legal interest. In forfeiture cases involving cash, prudential standing is crucial, requiring the claimant's legal interest to align with the zone of interests protected by forfeiture statutes. The issue of standing often arises when ownership of cash is disputed, with lower courts agreeing that mere possession is insufficient for standing. Cases like United States v. $119,030.00 in U.S. Currency illustrate how this standing requirement is applied in cash confiscation cases. Hamilton and passengers traveled from Virginia to Texas for a rap concert and music video shoot in a rental car. A trooper stopped them due to the short timeframe for the trip. Despite denying ownership of $119,030 found in the car, Hamilton later claimed it was a gift. The case highlights the importance of prudential standing in cash forfeiture cases. Hamilton received a DEA forfeiture notice for $119,030 found in a rental car during a trip to Texas for a rap concert. He claimed the money was a gift from a family friend, held by his mother until his 30th birthday. The court ruled it was not a valid gift due to conditions, and Hamilton lacked ownership or possessory interest, leading to a lack of standing to contest the forfeiture. The court rejected the theory that Hamilton's mother owned the money, finding she did not prove a valid oral trust. In a similar case, a patrolman found a large amount of money in a van during a traffic stop. The driver refused to answer questions, and the passenger claimed ownership. The passenger, Richard Harold, claimed he was unaware of money in the van and later filed a claim for it. The court ruled he lacked standing to claim the cash as it was not found on him or owned by him. His argument of inheritance was dismissed for lack of evidence. The debate on civil asset forfeiture reform focuses on the burden of proof standard. Civil asset forfeiture reform has historically focused on the burden of proof standard. CAFRA shifted the burden to the government based on a preponderance of evidence, but there are calls to raise it to \"clear and convincing evidence\" or even \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Prior to CAFRA, the government only needed to prove probable cause of a connection to criminal activity. The government needed to establish probable cause of a connection between seized property and criminal activity, with a low evidentiary threshold. Hearsay evidence could be used, and it was not necessary to prove a specific drug transaction. Once the government met its burden, the property owner had to rebut the evidence. The claimant had to rebut the government's evidence to show the property seized was not used in the crime or that he did not consent to it, known as the innocent owner's defense. If unsuccessful, the property was subject to forfeiture. Some judges expressed concerns about the fairness of placing the burden of proof on the claimant. The burden of proof on the claimant in property forfeiture cases was criticized as a denial of due process, creating a risk of erroneous deprivation. The allocation of burdens and standards of proof determines who must present evidence and bear the risk of loss. In civil forfeiture cases, claimants must go forward with evidence and prove their property by a preponderance of the evidence, bearing all risks. The government can seize property based on hearsay and flimsy evidence, which Judge Kozinski criticized as a constitutional anomaly. The burden of proof reflects society's importance on legal decisions, with high stakes involved. The importance society places on legal decisions, especially in civil asset forfeiture cases, is highlighted by the high stakes involved. The debate over the standard of proof, whether it should be raised to clear and convincing evidence or remain at preponderance of the evidence, was a contentious issue during the legislative process. Representative Hyde introduced bills in Congress proposing different standards, with the House Judiciary Committee ultimately supporting the clear and convincing standard. The House Judiciary Committee supported raising the standard of proof in civil asset forfeiture cases to clear and convincing evidence, but the final law settled on the preponderance standard. This means the government must prove the property is subject to forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. Courts apply a totality-of-the-circumstances approach to determine the connection between property and crime for forfeiture cases. Property does not need to be used in the crime, only intended for use. CAFRA shifted burden of proof to the government, but claimant's failure to explain legitimate money source is still seen as evidence of illegal activity. Government must show a \"substantial connection\" for forfeiture under drug laws. Section 983(c)(3) requires a \"substantial connection\" between seized property and the offense, resolving a split in circuit courts. Factors like cash amounts, inconsistent statements, and drug odor can establish this connection. Courts have upheld forfeitures even when no money or drugs were present, as long as the property was linked to criminal activity. Some courts have stricter requirements for the connection between seized property and a crime. For example, a court rejected forfeiture of cash found with drugs due to lack of specificity on the theory of reliance. Possession of money and a drug dog alert alone may not be enough to establish a substantial connection to drug activity. Observers suggest a clear and convincing standard for civil forfeiture cases. The clear and convincing standard would be the appropriate burden of proof in civil forfeiture cases, as proposed by reform bills in Congress. These bills aim to raise the burden of proof on the government and add elements to the government's case-in-chief in facilitating theory cases. Some argue for a heightened standard beyond the current preponderance standard. Some argue that a heightened standard beyond the current preponderance standard is constitutionally compelled in civil forfeiture cases. District Court Judge Jack Weinstein of the Southern District of New York expressed doubts about shifting the burden of proof to leaseholders in quasi-criminal proceedings, suggesting that the government should bear the entire burden to establish forfeiture with a higher standard than preponderance. This view aligns with proposed reform bills in Congress advocating for a clear and convincing standard in civil forfeiture cases. Judge Weinstein argued that a higher standard may be constitutionally mandated for civil asset forfeiture proceedings, especially when a person's home is involved. The DOJ, however, advocated for maintaining the preponderance standard, expressing concerns about the impact of raising the burden of proof to clear and convincing evidence on the government's ability to establish forfeitability in complex cases. One commentator suggests different burdens of proof for various types of seized property: contraband under probable cause, criminal proceeds under preponderance, and facilitating property under reasonable doubt. He argues that forcing forfeiture of facilitating property is severe as it involves taking legally acquired assets. The innocent owner defense under CAFRA provides property owners with the opportunity to defend against forfeiture if they had no knowledge of illegal activity or tried to prevent it. Some suggest shifting the burden to the government to prove owner's knowledge or consent. Prior to CAFRA, various federal statutes included innocent owner defenses. Under federal statutes, innocent owner defenses protect property from forfeiture if the owner can prove lack of knowledge or consent to illegal activity. Courts debated whether both elements must be shown or if either suffices. The burden of proof lies with the claimant to demonstrate either lack of knowledge or consent by a preponderance of evidence. Under federal statutes, innocent owner defenses protect property from forfeiture if the owner can prove lack of knowledge or consent to illegal activity. The burden of proof lies with the claimant to demonstrate either lack of knowledge or consent by a preponderance of evidence. CAFRA created a uniform innocent owner defense stating that an innocent owner's interest in property shall not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute. The defense requires the claimant to prove innocence by a preponderance of the evidence, with different rules for property interests existing before or after the offense was committed. The innocent owner defense under federal statutes allows property to be protected from forfeiture if the owner can prove lack of knowledge or consent to illegal activity. Claimants must demonstrate lack of knowledge or consent by a preponderance of evidence. CAFRA established a uniform innocent owner defense, requiring claimants to prove innocence by showing lack of knowledge or taking reasonable actions to terminate illegal use of the property. The innocent owner defense under federal statutes protects property from forfeiture if the owner can prove lack of knowledge or consent to illegal activity. Claimants must demonstrate this by a preponderance of evidence and take steps to terminate illegal use of the property. An \"innocent owner\" is defined as someone who was a bona fide purchaser or seller for value and did not know or have reason to believe the property was subject to forfeiture. There are exceptions for residences obtained through marriage, divorce, or inheritance if certain criteria are met. The innocent owner defense under federal statutes protects property from forfeiture if the owner can prove lack of knowledge or consent to illegal activity. Claimants must demonstrate this by a preponderance of evidence and take steps to terminate illegal use of the property. While CAFRA extended the innocent owner defense to most civil forfeitures, it has been critiqued mainly for leaving the burden on the alleged innocent owner. Reform proposals in Congress aimed to amend the innocent owner provision, shifting the burden of proof to the government in forfeiture cases. The term \"prima facie case\" raised interpretative issues, with courts requiring probable cause for belief of guilt. The Eleventh Circuit questioned the meaning of \"prima facie proof\" in the context of forfeiture cases, noting that it may only require probable cause instead of the traditional civil standard. However, the court ultimately dismissed this interpretation as an unfortunate misuse of legal terminology with no significance. H.R. 5212 aimed to establish a burden shifting scheme for forfeiture cases, where the claimant must show initial evidence for the defense without needing to prove it by a preponderance of the evidence. The government would then have to prove that the claimant knew or reasonably should have known about the illegal activity involving the property. This differed from the prior innocent owner defense standard, which had some disagreement in lower courts regarding the willful blindness standard. H.R. 5212 proposed a burden shifting scheme for forfeiture cases, requiring the claimant to show initial evidence for the defense. The government would need to prove that the claimant knew or reasonably should have known about the illegal activity involving the property, using an objective, negligence approach. Section 983(d)(2)(B) outlines the evidence claimants can offer to demonstrate efforts to prevent illegal use of the property. H.R. 5212 proposed burden shifting in forfeiture cases, requiring claimants to show initial evidence for defense. The government would need to prove claimant's knowledge of illegal activity involving the property. Section 983(d)(2)(B) outlines evidence claimants can offer to prevent illegal use of the property. The bill would amend subsection (B) to allow the government to show property owner's lack of knowledge of criminal activity. H.R. 5212 proposed burden shifting in forfeiture cases, requiring claimants to show initial evidence for defense. The bill would amend subsection (B) to allow the government to show property owner's lack of knowledge of criminal activity. The bill would shift the burden in forfeiture cases, making the owner defense an element of the government's case-in-chief. It requires clear and convincing evidence of a substantial connection between the property and the offense, and that the owner knowingly consented to or facilitated the offense. It would not apply to after-acquired interests. The issue of property owners' access to counsel in asset forfeiture cases has been a recurring concern. In criminal forfeiture cases, assets can be frozen pretrial, hindering the defendant's ability to pay for legal representation. In civil asset forfeitures, indigent property owners may struggle to contest the government's confiscation of their property. The federal criminal forfeiture statute allows the government to freeze assets pending trial if they will be forfeitable upon conviction. Constitutional protections for property owners in these cases have been the subject of Supreme Court and lower court rulings. The Supreme Court and lower courts have addressed the constitutional protections for defendants whose property is subject to restraint. In the recent case Kaley v. United States, it was determined that defendants are not entitled to an independent judicial evaluation of probable cause for a restraining order under Section 853(e). Prior to this, the Court ruled in Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, rejecting the claim that defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to use assets for legal fees. The Supreme Court in Kaley v. United States found that defendants do not have a Sixth Amendment right to use another person's money for legal services. In United States v. Monsanto, the Court ruled that the government can freeze assets before trial based on probable cause, without violating constitutional rights. Before a restraint of property can be effectuated, a judicial hearing is required to assess the grand jury's probable cause determination. Lower courts have held that a post-seizure, pretrial hearing is necessary to determine probable cause for the crimes and properties specified for forfeiture. These courts applied the Mathews v. Eldridge three-part balancing test to weigh the private interest, risk of erroneous deprivation, and government's interest. Unlike the Court in Kaley v. United States, these courts found that the balance favored the defendant's interest. The Second Circuit in Monsanto and the D.C. Circuit emphasized the defendant's qualified right to counsel of choice, stating that a post-indictment, pre-trial adversarial hearing is valuable in assessing the restraint of seized property. The Seventh Circuit highlighted the importance of the defendant having an attorney early on for effective representation. The courts found that there were sufficient procedural mechanisms in place to address the government's interest in grand jury secrecy, while also upholding defendants' constitutional rights to due process and counsel. The Eleventh Circuit allows for a case-by-case decision on the need for a pre-trial hearing, where defendants can challenge the connection between seized assets and the charged crime. The Supreme Court granted review in Kaley to address whether criminally accused individuals are entitled to judicial review of a grand jury's probable cause determination before full restraint of their property. The government obtained an indictment against Kerry Kaley and her husband Brian for transporting stolen medical devices and money laundering. The government sought a restraining order to freeze their assets, including a $500,000 certificate of deposit intended for legal fees. The district court denied the Kaleys' request for a hearing to challenge the indictment. The Supreme Court addressed whether accused individuals have the right to challenge a grand jury's probable cause determination before their assets are restrained. The Kaleys argued for judicial review, but the Court upheld the grand jury's role in making probable cause findings. The Supreme Court upheld the grand jury's role in making probable cause findings, stating that it should also support temporarily freezing a defendant's assets to avoid conflicting conclusions between the grand jury and judge. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, dissented. Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, dissented, arguing against the government's ability to deprive a defendant of their chosen counsel without a hearing. Roberts questioned the majority's argument on the importance of temporary liberty versus avoiding imprisonment after trial. He also refuted the idea that differing probable cause determinations would create legal dissonance. The dissenters disagreed with the majority's decision in the Kaley case, arguing that the Mathews test should be applied to the pretrial deprivation of property issue. They believed a pretrial hearing should be allowed, and if Congress were to respond legislatively, the focus would be on determining the procedures and standards for such a hearing. There are no current legislative proposals for this type of hearing, but pre-Kaley circuit decisions could provide guidance on what would be required to initiate it. The defendant's lack of assets triggers a full adversarial hearing before the district court. The Tenth Circuit requires a prima facie showing of a reason to believe the restrained assets were not linked to criminal activity. The Second Circuit in Monsanto justified the absence of a pre-restraining order hearing to protect potentially forfeitable property. The D.C. Circuit agreed with this reasoning. The government may have rights in the property at issue, requiring immediate protective measures to prevent asset dissipation before trial. A proposal suggests initial seizure with a post-restraint hearing, addressing concerns about jeopardizing the government's case and trial strategy. The Second Circuit's Monsanto ruling could alleviate fears by allowing hearsay evidence and in camera review. The proposal suggests allowing hearsay evidence and in camera review to address concerns about jeopardizing the government's trial strategy. The burden of proof issue is debated, with different circuits placing it on either the government or the defendant. The Tenth Circuit placed the burden on the defendant to prove the government seized untainted assets without probable cause and that they are needed to hire counsel. The government must then demonstrate probable cause if the defendant shows the grand jury erred. The Seventh Circuit suggested exempting reasonable attorneys' fees from forfeiture, while the Second Circuit proposed forgoing restraint and obtaining forfeiture after conviction. The government can obtain forfeiture after conviction, with a proposal to limit seized assets for attorney fees. Access to counsel in civil forfeitures is a concern, with federal law providing for appointment of counsel for indigent claimants. In civil forfeiture cases, claimants are entitled to counsel, with the United States liable for attorney fees if the claimant substantially prevails. Proposed bills aim to expand access to indigent counsel in any civil proceeding where a claimant has standing to contest forfeiture. H.R. 5212 proposes court-appointed counsel for civil forfeiture cases and addresses issues like revenue allocation and equitable sharing in asset forfeiture programs. The Institute for Justice criticized civil asset forfeiture laws for the profit incentive they create for law enforcement agencies, leading to concerns about misuse of funds and prioritization of forfeiture over other law enforcement goals. Some federal courts have also raised concerns about corrupting incentives. The Treasury Department argues that allowing agencies to keep forfeiture profits helps cover property management costs. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 diverted forfeited assets into the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund, creating a profit motive for law enforcement agencies. Funds are deposited into the fund through various statutes, with no cap on excess amounts since 1986. This helps cover property management costs and strengthens law enforcement by redirecting forfeited value back into societal purposes. Section 524(c)(4) of Title 28 and Section 881(e) of Title 21 mandate that proceeds from forfeited property and funds from the federal equitable sharing program be deposited into the Assets Forfeiture Fund. Money in the fund can be used for forfeiture-related expenses, informant payments, awards for information leading to forfeitures, payment of liens or mortgages on forfeited property, and other related expenses. The Assets Forfeiture Fund can be used for various expenses related to forfeiture, including equipping vehicles, vessels, or aircraft, purchasing equipment for seizure or forfeiture, paying real estate taxes on forfeited property, covering law enforcement costs, and federal correctional construction costs. The Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, established in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, receives deposits from forfeitures under Treasury or Coast Guard laws and outlines how the funds can be used. Some suggest removing the profit motive from forfeiture cases by depositing confiscated funds back into the Treasury's General Fund, eliminating provisions allowing transfers to law enforcement agencies. Congress may allocate funds for specific programs, as seen in debates on asset forfeiture reform in the 1990s. Some states divert funds to specific programs like substance abuse or public education. Concerns have been raised about the \"equitable sharing\" program, allowing law enforcement agencies to bypass local laws. DOJ supports equitable sharing for promoting cooperation among different law enforcement agencies. The \"equitable sharing\" program promotes cooperation among law enforcement agencies by allowing the federal government to provide resources to local police. Attorney General Holder issued guidelines in 2015 to address concerns about \"adoptive seizures.\" This program is authorized by federal statutes, such as Section 881(e)(1)(A) of Title 21, which allows the transfer of forfeited property to state or local law enforcement agencies involved in the seizure. The federal government promotes cooperation among law enforcement agencies through the \"equitable sharing\" program, allowing the transfer of forfeited property to state or local law enforcement agencies involved in the seizure. This program is authorized by federal statutes to encourage further cooperation between agencies. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General have the authority to transfer forfeited property to state or local law enforcement agencies involved in the seizure. Guidelines regulate the equitable sharing program, allowing agencies to participate through joint investigations. The new DOJ guidelines impact two methods of asset forfeiture sharing: joint investigations with federal, state, or local agencies, and adoptive forfeitures, which are now restricted. The new order restricts federal adoption of property seized by state or local law enforcement, except for items related to public safety concerns. Exceptions include seizures in joint task forces, joint investigations, and federal seizure warrants. The recent bills addressing asset forfeiture would amend equitable sharing provisions, potentially ending adoptive forfeitures and joint investigation forfeitures. H.R. 5212 aims to prevent federal forfeiture laws from bypassing state or local laws on civil forfeiture. Asset forfeiture, including equitable sharing, will remain a focus in the 114th Congress, as indicated by comments from incoming Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley and other lawmakers."
