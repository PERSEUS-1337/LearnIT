Section 24 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act is amended to include a new subsection (d) regarding the registration of Canadian pesticides by states. The term 'Canadian pesticide' is defined as a pesticide registered for use in Canada, identical or similar in composition to a pesticide registered under section 3, and registered by the registrant of a comparable domestic pesticide or an affiliated entity. The term 'comparable domestic pesticide' refers to a pesticide registered under section 3, not facing cancellation or suspension, used for comparison in determinations, and labeled for the same site or crop as the pesticide seeking registration. \"A State may register a Canadian pesticide for distribution and use if approved by the Administrator, consistent with the Act. The registration by a State is considered a registration under section 3, allowing distribution to other states.\" To distribute a Canadian pesticide registered by a State, it must be used in that State and cannot be transported or used in another State unless consistent with the original registration. The registering State is considered the registrant of the pesticide under the Act. States must determine if the Canadian pesticide is identical or substantially similar to register it. The State must determine if a Canadian pesticide is identical or substantially similar to a domestic pesticide before submitting the registration to the Administrator. For each authorized food or feed use, the State must also check for tolerances or exemptions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The pesticide submission must include a label specifying required information, identifying itself as the only valid label, stating the approved use and directions for use, and indicating the State where the product may be used. The submission for registration of a Canadian pesticide must include a description of the proposed registration, determinations made, proposed labeling, and supporting documentation. The Administrator will approve the registration. The Administrator will approve the registration of a Canadian pesticide by a State if it aligns with the Act. Approval is contingent on written notice from the Administrator. Upon approval, distribution of the Canadian pesticide can commence. When a State receives approval for a Canadian pesticide, they must provide approved labels for distribution. The pesticide can only be used in the State with the approved label. Containers must bear the approved label at all times during transportation and distribution. When a State registers a Canadian pesticide, a report must be provided to the State identifying the recipient and quantity of the pesticide. Affixing labels to the pesticide is not considered production. States registering Canadian pesticides must prepare annual reports. Canadian pesticides registered in a State require an annual report identifying the pesticides, users, and quantity used. The State must provide this report to the Administrator upon request. If necessary, the Administrator can request a recall of a Canadian pesticide in a State. The Administrator may suspend a State's authority to register Canadian pesticides if they are not capable of ensuring compliance with regulations. The Administrator can suspend a State's authority to register Canadian pesticides if compliance with regulations is not ensured. Before suspending, the Administrator must notify the State and provide an opportunity to respond. The Administrator can also disclose necessary information to the State for registering Canadian pesticides. The State must certify to the Administrator that it can maintain confidentiality of trade secrets and information provided by the Administrator for registering Canadian pesticides. If a registrant of a comparable domestic pesticide fails to provide necessary information to the State, the Administrator may take action. The Administrator may suspend pesticide registrations without a hearing if determinations required by paragraph (3) are not met. Title 35, United States Code, does not apply to Canadian pesticides registered by a State under this subsection. Submissions by a State under this section are not considered applications under section 3(c)(1)(F). A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. The section outlines the registration process for Canadian pesticides by States, including definitions, authority, requirements, approval, labeling, reports, recalls, and disclosure of information. The effective date for this section and its amendments is 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
