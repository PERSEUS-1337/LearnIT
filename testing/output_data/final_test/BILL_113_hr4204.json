    "content": "The Act titled \"Jobs and Opportunity Bonus Tax Credit Act of 2014\" or \"JOB Tax Credit Act\" introduces the Jobs and Opportunity Bonus Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Jobs and Opportunity Bonus Credit provides eligible employers with a credit equal to 50% of job training program expenses for eligible employees, up to $5,000. Eligible employers are those with not more than 500 full-time employees. Job training program expenses include amounts paid for participation in a qualified training program. The Jobs and Opportunity Bonus Credit offers a 50% credit for job training expenses, up to $5,000, for eligible employers with up to 500 full-time employees. Expenses include participation in a qualified training program, which can be an apprenticeship program, a program licensed by a workforce board or apprenticeship agency, or a program offered by a vocational school or labor organization. The term 'eligible employee' refers to any employee of the employer who participates in a job skills training program and works an average of at least 40 hours per week. The program must conform to apprentice training programs developed by an employer trade group, be industry-sponsored, or commonly recognized. If an employee leaves the job, the employer may recapture the credit. If an eligible employee's employment is terminated by the employer before the 2-year period of study or training, the taxpayer's tax will increase by the decrease in credits for prior years multiplied by the inclusion ratio. The inclusion ratio is a specific ratio for this purpose. The inclusion ratio is the ratio used to calculate the tax increase if an eligible employee's employment is terminated before the 2-year period. Controlled groups are treated as a single employer for this purpose. Amounts paid after December 31, 2017, are not applicable. The tax code is amended to include a new paragraph for the jobs and opportunity bonus credit. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The tax code is amended to include a new section for the Jobs and Opportunity Bonus Credit, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2014."
