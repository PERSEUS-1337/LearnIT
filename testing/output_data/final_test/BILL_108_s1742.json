    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Higher Education Loan Plan Act of 2003\" and addresses interest rates on student loans. The Higher Education Loan Plan Act of 2003 amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding interest rates for new loans made between October 1, 1998, and before the enactment of the Act. The Higher Education Loan Plan Act of 2003 sets the interest rate for new loans made between October 1, 1998, and before the Act's enactment. The rate is determined based on the bond equivalent rate of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned before June 1, plus 2.3 percent, capped at 8.25 percent. The interest rates for certain types of loans under the Higher Education Loan Plan Act of 2003 are adjusted. For PLUS loans, the rate is changed to 3.1 percent from 2.3 percent, and for consolidation loans, the rate is set at 9.0 percent instead of 8.25 percent. The interest rates for consolidation loans under the Higher Education Loan Plan Act of 2003 are adjusted. The applicable rate of interest shall be the lesser of the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans consolidated or 8.25 percent. The Secretary determines the rate after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. The Higher Education Loan Plan Act of 2003 adjusts interest rates for new loans, with the rate determined based on the bond equivalent rate of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned prior to June 1 each year. The Higher Education Loan Plan Act of 2003 sets interest rates for new loans based on the bond equivalent rate of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned before June 1, not exceeding 7.75 percent. The Higher Education Loan Plan Act of 2003 adjusts interest rates for different types of loans, such as PLUS and consolidation loans, by substituting specific percentages for existing ones. The applicable rate of interest for a 12-month period is determined based on the bond equivalent rate of 91-day Treasury bills plus 2.3 percent, not exceeding 7.75 percent. Amendments are made to the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding interest rates and loan provisions. Amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 change the date references to align with the Higher Education Loan Plan Act of 2003."
