    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting Access to Safe Mortgages Act\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that American families will be severely harmed by an unprecedented wave of potential foreclosures due to adjustable rate subprime mortgages resetting to higher interest rates. Preventing foreclosures and facilitating refinancing of at-risk borrowers into safe prime loans will require additional capacity from government-sponsored enterprises. There is a lack of liquidity in financial markets for mortgage-backed securities, threatening financing for all mortgages. The National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, along with their affiliates, are in a unique position to provide financing to prevent the upcoming wave of foreclosures and support liquidity in US markets. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, the definitions include the Director as the head of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the term \"enterprise\" referring to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Fannie Mae Consent Decree as an order from May 23, 2006, and the Freddie Mac Letter as a communication from July 31, 2006. The term \"OFHEO\" refers to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight, as stated in a letter dated July 31, 2006, from the Chairman and CEO of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to the Director.

During the 1-year period after the Protecting Access to Safe Mortgages Act is enacted, the limitations on property sizes for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans will be increased in areas where the median price exceeds the current limits, up to 150 percent of the existing limitation or the median price in that area.
