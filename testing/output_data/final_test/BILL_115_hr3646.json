    "content": "The \"Water Quality Conservation Act of 2017\" aims to promote innovative conservation practices, apply targeted soil and water conservation measures, increase producer adoption of conservation practices, and collect data on the impact of precision conservation practices on soil health and water quality through a Precision Conservation Pilot Program. The \"Water Quality Conservation Act of 2017\" establishes a Precision Conservation Pilot Program to provide grants to 10 States for projects that enhance soil health, reduce erosion, and improve water quality. States must submit applications to be eligible for grants. The Secretary may require States to collaborate with various entities to carry out precision conservation pilot programs and give priority to assisting producers in critical areas. A State awarded a grant under this subsection must provide matching funds in cash or in-kind contributions equal to the grant amount. The grant funds can only be used for educating and recruiting agricultural producers, providing technical and financial assistance for precision conservation plans, and monitoring their effectiveness. The text discusses the importance of precision conservation plans and the use of precision agriculture technology to achieve conservation benefits. It also emphasizes the confidentiality of information provided by producers or states for the development and reporting of aggregate data. The text emphasizes the confidentiality of information provided by producers for aggregate data reporting, ensuring the identity of the producer is not discernible. The paragraph does not limit producers from sharing information provided for reporting. States must provide reports to producers on the effectiveness of precision conservation plans annually for five years. States also need to submit annual reports to the Secretary after receiving grants. After receiving grant funds, the State must submit annual reports to the Secretary for 3 years, including data on precision conservation plans. Additionally, a 5-year report analyzing the effectiveness of grant funds in improving soil health is required. The Secretary will establish a public soil nutrient retention database using data from precision conservation plans to improve soil health and water quality. The Secretary may reserve funds for a database compiling effective conservation practices for nutrient management and may allocate funding for a precision conservation pilot program. In fiscal years 2018 through 2022, 5 percent of funds for program payments will be targeted for the precision conservation pilot program."
