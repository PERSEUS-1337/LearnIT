    "content": "The Act titled \"Collaborative Academic Research Efforts for Tourette Syndrome Act of 2017\" amends the Public Health Service Act to expand, intensify, and coordinate activities related to Tourette Syndrome under the National Institutes of Health programs. The Secretary, through the Director of NIH, will expand and coordinate research programs on Tourette syndrome. Data collection will include epidemiologic information on the incidence, prevalence, and impact of Tourette syndrome in the US, as well as data on comorbid conditions. The Secretary will award grants for Collaborative Research Centers for Tourette Syndrome to conduct basic and clinical research into the syndrome, including data collection on services availability and disaggregation by population and region. Research centers for Tourette syndrome conduct basic and clinical research into the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the syndrome. Research areas include developmental neurobiology, neuroscience, genetics, psychology, and pharmacology. Centers may also raise awareness about research opportunities for individuals to participate as subjects. Research centers for Tourette syndrome may provide referrals for health services and patient care costs for research subjects. The availability and access to clinical services are considered in awarding grants and contracts. Centers can collaborate and use facilities for research. Research centers for Tourette syndrome may use facilities from a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions and patient advocacy groups to maximize services and coverage. Eligibility requirements must be met to participate. The Secretary will determine the number of centers and duration of support based on available appropriations. The Secretary will establish 4-6 Tourette syndrome research centers in different regions of the United States, encouraging consortium formation for broader coverage. Support duration for these centers will be determined based on available appropriations. The Secretary will establish Tourette syndrome research centers in the US for up to 5 years, extendable for additional 5-year periods based on peer review. Research grants will focus on symptomology and treatment efficacy. The Secretary will designate funding for Tourette syndrome research programs at the National Institutes of Health to improve treatment options for specific patient groups."
