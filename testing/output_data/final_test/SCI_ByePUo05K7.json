    "content": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were inspired by human vision and achieve comparable performance to human object recognition. A study found a fundamental difference between human vision and CNNs: humans rely on shape analysis for object recognition, while CNNs do not have a shape-bias. The model trained on modified images with non-shape features did not show bias towards selecting shapes, instead relying on features for best prediction. Object recognition in humans heavily relies on analyzing shape compared to other features like size, color, or texture. Psychological experiments show that shape plays a crucial role in object recognition. For instance, studies have shown that even when color is a diagnostic feature, replacing colored photographs with line drawings does not significantly affect recognition performance, indicating the importance of shape-based representations. Patients with visual agnosia rely heavily on shape for object recognition, with surface color playing a minimal role unless the object's shape is ambiguous. Shape information is automatically extracted within 100ms of stimulus onset, even when it may hinder task performance. Developmental psychology experiments show that shape is prioritized early in life and strengthens with age, as seen in children and adults weighting shape more than size or texture when generalizing object names. The weight placed on shape increases from childhood to adulthood, known as a \"shape bias\". It is uncertain if shape plays a privileged role in how CNNs categorize objects, as they often rely on nonshape attributes for classification. The study explores the impact of non-shape features on CNN's object categorization performance using CIFAR-10 images. Non-shape features, such as altered colors or random pixel patterns, can lead to misclassification and reduced performance in CNNs. This suggests that shape may not play a privileged role in object categorization by CNNs. The study investigates how non-shape features affect CNN's object categorization performance using CIFAR-10 images. CNNs tend to rely on non-shape features that are highly diagnostic of object categories, even when shape information is not emphasized. This contrasts with humans, who prioritize shape in recognition tasks. The study explores how non-shape features impact CNN's object categorization performance on CIFAR-10 images. Humans prioritize shape in recognition tasks, unlike CNNs which rely on non-shape features. Additional machinery may be needed in networks to prioritize learning shape-based representations for better performance and robustness against non-shape noise. The study investigated the impact of non-shape features on CNN's object categorization performance using different types of noise masks on CIFAR-10 images. The masks altered image pixels to include salt-and-pepper noise or additive uniform noise, affecting shape-related and non-shape features. These modified images contained predictive features for image categorization. The study explored the influence of non-shape features on CNN's object categorization performance by using various noise masks on CIFAR-10 images. The masks introduced salt-and-pepper noise or additive uniform noise, impacting shape-related and non-shape features. These modified images contained predictive features for image categorization, and the model was tested under different conditions to assess its performance. The study investigated how non-shape features affect CNN object categorization performance using noise masks on CIFAR-10 images. Different conditions were tested to evaluate the model's reliance on shape-based and non-shape features, with simulations conducted on VGG-16 and ResNet-101 networks trained on ImageNet categories. The study tested the impact of noise masks on CNN object categorization performance using VGG-16 and ResNet-101 networks trained on ImageNet categories. Different noise mask conditions were applied to evaluate the model's reliance on shape-based and non-shape features. The experiments showed that when noise masks in test and training images matched, the model classified images accurately. However, when masks were swapped or removed, accuracy dropped. This pattern was consistent across VGG and ResNet networks, indicating the model relied on noise-like features rather than shape-related information. Regularization methods may help address this reliance on statistically relevant features. Regularization methods like Batch Normalization, Weight Decay, or Dropout did not significantly improve the reliance of CNNs on noise-like features over shape-related features. Humans, on the other hand, rely on past experience to categorize objects, allowing them to generalize from previous knowledge when faced with noise. The network was tested to see if it could generalize from one subset to another by training on two subsets of images with and without category-correlated pixels. The network was tested to see if it could generalize features from one subset to another subset of images. The model achieved nearly 90% accuracy on images without added pixels but struggled with images containing added pixels, showing dependency on pixel location and color. The network did not generalize well to categories with diagnostic pixels. The study involved training a VGG network on images without noise masks in a 'before' phase, then training it on images with a single diagnostic pixel in an 'after' phase. This setup mimics human learning processes where prior knowledge is used for new tasks. The network struggled with images containing added pixels, showing dependency on pixel location and color. The study trained a VGG network on images without noise masks in a 'before' phase and then on images with a single diagnostic pixel in an 'after' phase. The network heavily relied on the predictive pixel for categorization, leading to a drastic drop in accuracy when the pixel was removed. This phenomenon, known as catastrophic forgetting, highlights a challenge in neural networks compared to human learning processes.

This phenomenon, known as catastrophic forgetting, highlights a challenge in neural networks compared to human learning processes. Networks BID12 contrast with how humans transfer knowledge between tasks. Non-shape features used in experiments are invariant within a category, selected for their strong predictive signal, suppressing shape-based features. Increasing variability of non-shape features did not lead the model to rely more on shape-based features for categorization. The study introduced noise masks independently sampled for each image category to make them diagnostic of the category. Parameters of the distribution correlated with the category, affecting the probability of pixel changes. Masks varied within categories but were category-dependent. For single diagnostic pixels, the location varied, generated from a Gaussian distribution with a mean based on the category. The study introduced noise masks sampled for each image category, affecting pixel color and location based on category. Performance dropped when noise masks were removed, with minor changes in behavior for different mask types. The study found that when the noise mask was removed, the model performed worse compared to images with different noise masks. The model relies on the presence of noise to make accurate inferences. Additionally, the model's behavior changed when only a subset of images contained a diagnostic non-shape feature, specifically a single diagnostic pixel. The accuracy decreased as the probability of the pixel being present in a training image decreased. The study observed that as the probability of a diagnostic pixel being present in a training image decreases, the model's accuracy also decreases. This suggests that the model relies on this pixel for accurate predictions, but as its predictive power diminishes, the model starts using other features to categorize the output. The model's accuracy decreases as the probability of a diagnostic pixel in training images decreases. Adding a single pixel to 70% of images reduces performance by more than 10%. This could be due to the network mistaking a pixel value or having to learn from a subset of images. The network's performance decreases when a diagnostic pixel is added to training images, potentially due to mistaking pixel values or learning from a smaller dataset. L2 regularization worsened performance when a diagnostic pixel was inserted. The model could classify images based solely on the location of a single pixel, even with the same color for all categories. Further testing is needed to determine the exact cause of the performance reduction. The network was able to classify images with a diagnostic pixel accurately, representing its location surprisingly well. In the final experiment, the network's ability to categorize was tested by shifting the pixel's location in the test set compared to the training set. The training dataset was modified so that the pixel color was consistent but its location varied by category. The network was tested for its ability to classify images with a diagnostic pixel accurately by shifting the pixel's location in the test set. Performance degraded significantly when the test pixel was shifted by sixteen pixels or more, indicating the network's robustness to location shifts. The study found that the network classified images based on the location of a diagnostic pixel, with boundaries between categories being discrete. Unlike previous work, the model was trained with uncorrupted images and did not systematically search for adversarial pixels. The study found that CNNs do not categorize based on shape but on pixel values that are highly correlated with output categories. CNNs are not as robust as humans to different types of noise, with training for one type of noise not making them robust to others. The study suggests introducing a shape-bias to CNNs to improve robustness to various forms of noise. In simulations, VGG networks trained on CIFAR-10 images often relied on noise-like masks for categorization, performing poorly when the noise was removed. This highlights the challenge of training CNNs to be robust to all possible forms of noise. Our dataset was engineered to include non-shape features, highlighting biases in popular datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet. CNNs may rely too heavily on non-shape features, leading to susceptibility to biases and idiosyncratic behaviors. Introducing shape biases to CNNs could improve their performance to mirror human object recognition. Introducing shape biases to CNNs could improve their performance to mirror human object recognition. The method used to transform images from the CIFAR-10 dataset involved rescaling images to 224x224 pixels and applying various transformations using the Pillow fork of the Python Imaging Library. The greyscale images were adjusted to 80% contrast by scaling pixel values. A salt-and-pepper mask was created with black or white pixels based on a probability. The additive uniform noise mask added values sampled from a distribution to the greyscale image. The noise mask sampling process involved fixed and variable masks. For fixed masks, the same mask was added to each image per category. For variable masks, the mask was sampled independently for each image. The single pixel mask was created by changing the color of a pixel at a random location on the image. When fixed, the pixel color remained constant within a category but varied between categories. When variable, the pixel location and color varied for each image. The study used a pre-trained VGG network from Pytorch, replacing its fully-connected layers with three layers and training it on a modified dataset using RMSProp optimization algorithm. The study experimented with different model architectures, including a six-layer convolutional neural network with dropout after every convolutional layer. This network achieved 70% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a learning rate of 1e\u22125 and a momentum of 0.9. Input images were 3-channel RGB, with noise-like masks inserted for testing. The study experimented with different model architectures, achieving 70% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Different noise-like masks were inserted for testing, affecting the network's sensitivity to category-correlated pixels. Switching off learning in convolution layers after pre-training helps networks generalize between tasks. The study found that freezing convolution layers significantly impacts network performance, with accuracy dropping to 40% when a single diagnostic pixel is present. Even with learning switched off in convolution layers, the model learns to rely on noise-like masks."
