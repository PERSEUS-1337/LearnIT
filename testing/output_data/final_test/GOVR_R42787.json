    "content": "In September 2008, financial turmoil led to a panic with institutions failing and markets falling. The government responded with lending programs like the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to boost confidence and liquidity in the banking system. TLGP had two parts: Debt Guarantee Program (DGP) and Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) program, with TAG providing unlimited deposit insurance for $1.4 trillion in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. The establishment of TAG provided unlimited deposit insurance for $1.4 trillion in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (NIBTAs), boosting depositors' confidence in banks during the financial panic. Deposit insurance ensures stability in the banking sector by protecting depositors' funds in case of bank failure. Deposit insurance reduces the incentive for depositors to monitor their banks and can create moral hazard by neutralizing market mechanisms that penalize banks for taking on additional risk. Policymakers reassessed the tradeoff between stability and moral hazard during the financial crisis, with an upper limit on insured amounts to minimize market discipline loss. Extending deposit insurance through TAG may have strengthened the banking system by discouraging deposit withdrawals during financial stress. The St. Louis Federal Reserve Financial Stress Index shows elevated financial stress in 2012 compared to 2006 and 2007, but lower than the peak of the 2008 financial crisis. The TAG program, established by the FDIC and later replaced by the Dodd-Frank Act, provided unlimited deposit insurance to NIBTAs with some differences between the two programs. The Dodd-Frank Act created the TAG program, which automatically registered eligible financial institutions unless they opted out. It temporarily changed the definition of insured deposits to include noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. The amount of deposits insured by TAG increased over time, reaching $722 billion in 2008. When the FDIC extended TAG in 2009, many large banks opted out, causing a drop in insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act's change to the definition of insured deposits took effect in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act's change to the definition of insured deposits became effective, covering all eligible NIBTAs and increasing insured deposits by TAG to around $1.4 trillion. The changes are temporary and set to expire on January 1, 2013, returning to the standard $250,000 maximum deposit insurance amount. The FDIC has authority under section 1105 of Dodd-Frank to institute emergency assistance programs in liquidity crisis situations. The FDIC has authority under section 1105 of Dodd-Frank to institute emergency assistance programs in liquidity crisis situations, limited to guaranteeing debt obligations. Changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act may prevent the FDIC from extending the TAG program, requiring congressional action for an extension. Senator Harry Reid introduced a bill to temporarily extend TAG for two years on November 26, 2012. NIBTAs are cash management tools used by various entities. NIBTAs are management tools used by businesses, non-profits, governments, and other entities for easy access to money. If TAG expires, depositors may reassess safety and allocation of funds in the financial system. Factors like safety, liquidity, and yield influence depositors' decisions on where to place their money. If TAG expires, depositors may choose between leaving their money in insured banks or moving it out of the traditional banking sector, based on their preferences for safety, liquidity, and yield. Certificates of deposit offer higher interest rates but have withdrawal restrictions, impacting how depositors allocate their funds. If TAG expires, depositors may opt to keep their money as uninsured deposits in existing banks, potentially increasing the risk of Non-Interest-Bearing Transaction Accounts (NIBTAs). NIBTAs have grown significantly since 2008, and their appeal may not solely be due to the TAG guarantee. Despite the expiration of unlimited insurance, the high liquidity of NIBTAs could still attract some borrowers. Safety-conscious depositors may spread their uninsured deposits across multiple insured accounts to minimize risk. If TAG expires, depositors may shift deposits to safer banks perceived as less likely to fail, potentially increasing transaction costs. Some may move accounts to larger banks believed to be \"too big to fail\" (TBTF). TBTF banks are those policymakers judge as causing unacceptable disruptions if they fail. If TAG expires, depositors may shift deposits to safer banks perceived as less likely to fail, potentially increasing transaction costs. Approximately 75% of TAG funds are in the 19 banks with more than $100 billion in assets, though those 19 banks account for 61% of total assets in the insured banking system. The expiration of TAG may increase the concentration of deposits in the largest banks. The original TAG program established by the FDIC was optional, with banks given the ability to opt out. When the program expired, 31% of banks with assets over $10 billion were still participating, compared to 75% of banks with less than $10 billion in assets. Smaller banks had a higher participation rate, possibly indicating a greater need for the program to attract funds. Since the end of 2010, banks may have changed their views on the value of the program due to regulatory changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act. Some market participants may view the steps taken by the Dodd-Frank Act to remove TBTF status as credible, leading uninsured depositors to potentially move their TAG deposits away from large institutions. Uninsured depositors may move their TAG deposits from large institutions to smaller banks. Depositors have alternative options to traditional banking, such as money market funds, U.S. Treasuries, and other short-term investments. Money market funds are popular among financial professionals and invest in short-term financial instruments. Money market securities are short-term financial instruments with high liquidities and short maturities. Examples include CDs, U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper, and repos. Money market funds act as intermediaries between shareholders and borrowers, aiming to maintain a stable NAV of $1.00. If the NAV falls below $1.00, the fund is at risk of \"breaking the buck.\" Breaking the buck is a rare event where a money market fund's NAV falls below $1.00, putting investors' principal at risk. This occurred in September 2008, leading to a shift of funds from money market funds to bank deposits. Non-financial businesses have increased checkable deposits since the financial crisis, possibly due to higher yields than money market funds. The expiration of TAG could reverse this trend, but with money market funds currently earning low returns, the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing deposits is reduced. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has identified vulnerabilities in money market funds that could impact financial stability. Uncertainty remains about future regulation of money market funds by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Concerns have been raised about the potential impact of extending the Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) program on the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). TAG insurance, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, operates as part of FDIC's traditional insurance system. FDIC institutions pay premiums based on their risk level to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). If a member institution fails, DIF funds are used to protect insured depositors. Accurate forecasting of future risk is crucial for setting insurance premiums. Underestimating future losses can lead to DIF depletion, requiring borrowing from the Treasury to safeguard depositors. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates TAG insurance as part of the FDIC's traditional insurance system. DIF may need to borrow from the Treasury to protect depositors if it becomes depleted. The FDIC estimates that TAG deposits accounted for 3% of deposits on average for banks that failed in 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, resulting in an estimated TAG cost of about $270 million over five quarters. The number of bank failures has decreased since 2010. The number of bank failures has decreased since 2010, but the number of institutions on the FDIC's \"problem list\" remains high. Most recent bank failures have been smaller banks with few TAG deposits. Extending TAG may incur additional costs but could prevent future bank failures and maintain confidence in the banking system. The costs and benefits of extending TAG are uncertain. Extending TAG may lead to moral hazard in deposit insurance, increasing banks' risk-taking behavior and reducing depositor and shareholder monitoring. This could raise the likelihood of bank failures and impact credit decisions. Moral hazard can be mitigated through various channels. Moral hazard in deposit insurance can be minimized through creditor monitoring and regulatory actions. Senator Harry Reid introduced a bill to extend the TAG program until December 31, 2014, with assessments to cover expected losses. Senator Harry Reid introduced a bill to extend the TAG program until December 31, 2014, with assessments to cover expected losses by September 30 of each calendar year."
