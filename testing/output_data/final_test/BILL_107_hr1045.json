    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Energy Self-Sufficiency Act for the 21st Century\" and includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that greater deployment of distributed energy resources can improve energy production and delivery, enhance power quality, and promote environmentally responsible energy sources. The United States must rapidly adopt new power generation technologies to meet increasing electricity demands while focusing on energy efficiency and pollution reduction. The country is positioned to lead in distributed energy resources technology development despite existing regulatory challenges. The current regulatory environment hinders the deployment of distributed energy resources due to inconsistent policies and tax treatment. The Federal Government needs a coordinated program for research and development in this area. The Act aims to lower energy costs, increase reliability, and promote energy efficiency through the rapid development of distributed energy resources. SEC. 101. INTERCONNECTION OF LOCAL DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. Section 210 of the Federal Power Act is amended to include a special rule for distributed generation, defining terms like utility distribution company, local utility distribution facilities, and distributed generation facility. The Federal Power Act's Section 210 is amended to include a special rule for distributed generation facilities, which are designed to serve retail electric consumers at or near the facility site and interconnect with local utility distribution facilities. Utility distribution companies must interconnect with and provide service to these facilities if owners comply with regulations and cover related costs determined by the Commission. Interconnection and service terms must be just, reasonable, and non-discriminatory. The Commission will establish safety, reliability, and power quality standards for distributed generation facilities within one year of enactment. An advisory committee of experts will make recommendations to the Commission for developing these standards. Tax incentives will be provided for distributed energy resources under Title II. Tax incentives for distributed energy resources under Title II include amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to define energy property to include distributed power property and combined heat and power system property. Distributed power property is defined as property that meets specific requirements. The \"power property\" refers to property used for electricity generation in nonresidential real estate, industrial manufacturing, or plant activities. It may also produce thermal energy or mechanical power for heating or cooling applications, with at least 40% of the energy produced being electrical power. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for assets related to electrical power and energy used in industrial manufacturing processes. It specifies that the electricity produced should not be primarily sold to unrelated persons and should not be used for fuel transportation or energy distribution. Additionally, it mentions combined heat and power system property. The curr_chunk defines combined heat and power system property as a system that uses the same energy source for generating electrical power, mechanical shaft power, and useful thermal energy. It must have an electrical capacity of over 50 kilowatts or a mechanical energy capacity of over 67 horsepower. A combined heat and power system must produce at least 20% of its energy as thermal energy and 20% as electrical or mechanical power. The energy efficiency percentage must exceed 60% (70% for systems with high capacities). The energy efficiency percentage of a combined heat and power system is determined by the total useful power produced divided by the lower heating value of the primary fuel source. The energy efficiency percentage and percentages under subparagraph (A)(iii) are determined on a Btu basis. The term 'combined heat and power system property' excludes property used for energy source transportation or distribution. Public utility property accounting rules apply if the system property is public utility property. The taxpayer may claim the credit under subsection 46(f)(5) if using a normalization method of accounting. An exception applies to combined heat and power system property. No carryback of energy credit before effective date. Subsection (d) of section 39 is amended to disallow carryback of energy credit before the effective date. Depreciation rules are also updated to include distributed power property and combined heat and power system property. The amendments made by this title apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2000. Research and development of new distributed energy resource technologies is addressed in Title III. The Secretary of Energy will develop a research program for Distributed Energy Resources (DER) to ensure reliability, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The program includes Advanced Energy Technologies Development, Advanced Energy Systems Development, Advanced Grid Reliability Technologies development, and Technology Transfer and Education. The purposes are to ensure long-term safety, reliability, and service for DER, expand DER's capability to connect to the electric grid, and improve non-renewable technologies. The Secretary of Energy will consider research and development on Distributed Energy Resources (DER) to improve non-renewable technologies, minimize environmental impact, enhance grid reliability, and develop integration techniques for performance enhancement. Areas of focus include efficiency advancements for Distributed Power Prime Movers and thermally activated technologies. The program focuses on various areas including interconnection standards, microturbines, fuel cells, combined heat and power systems, advanced internal combustion engine generators, natural gas turbines, energy storage devices, and ancillary equipment for dispatch and control. The Secretary of Energy will designate a point of contact for coordinating research and development programs. The Department of Energy will appoint a point of contact to oversee the research program, while the Environmental Protection Agency will designate a point of contact for coordinating their input into the program. The Department of Energy will appoint a point of contact to oversee research, development, and field evaluation related to the Clean Air Act. Within 120 days, the Secretary of Energy will submit a 6-year program plan to Congress in consultation with industry representatives. The Secretary will seek advice from various entities for project proposals and create cost-sharing programs with private entities to ensure technology adoption. A report to Congress will be submitted every two years to track progress and identify additional resources needed. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out the rapid development and deployment of DER, with $236,000,000 authorized annually for each fiscal year from 2002 through 2007."
