    "title": "SB 745",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The commission is required to develop and administer the California Advanced Services Fund program to promote high-quality advanced communications services for all Californians. The goal is to approve funding for infrastructure projects by December 31, 2015, to provide broadband access to at least 98% of California households. The commission prioritizes infrastructure projects for last-mile broadband access to unserved households. Applicants can demonstrate actual broadband service levels in the project area. Accounts within the fund include Broadband Infrastructure Grant, Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant, Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan, and Broadband Public Housing. The California Advanced Services Fund receives moneys collected from a surcharge authorized by the commission. Funds are allocated to different accounts, including the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account, Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account, and Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account. Interest earned on the fund is also deposited back into the fund. The commission can collect up to $315 million by imposing a surcharge, with a limit of $100 million before January 1, 2011, and an additional $215 million after that date. The collection of the additional sum is capped at $25 million per year from 2011 to 2020, unless a higher amount is deemed necessary. All funds in the California Advanced Services Fund are available to the commission for the program, including development and administration costs, upon legislative appropriation. The California Advanced Services Fund allows eligible entities to apply for matching funds under the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Incumbent local exchange carriers can recover California infrastructure investment for broadband and voice services not covered by grant funds. An entity that is not a telephone corporation can apply to provide broadband access to unserved or underserved households under the program administered by the commission. Projects must offer last-mile broadband access to households without existing providers and only receive funding for unserved or underserved areas. The commission requires existing providers to demonstrate upgrades before approving funding for broadband access projects. Applicants must show actual service levels in the project area. Local governmental agencies can receive infrastructure grants for unserved areas after an open application process. The commission establishes a service list for interested parties to be notified of California Advanced Services Fund applications. Moneys in the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account are available for grants to eligible consortia for broadband deployment activities, excluding capital costs. Eligible consortia can include representatives from various organizations and are not required to have a specific lead fiscal agent. The Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account provides financing for broadband facilities not funded by grants. The commission sets interest rates based on market surveys. Terms like \"publicly subsidized\" are defined as receiving financial assistance from HUD or other sources for low-income housing developments. (B) \u201cPublicly supported community\u201d refers to a publicly subsidized multifamily housing development owned by a public housing agency chartered by the state or a nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Residents must have low or very low income according to federal poverty guidelines. The Broadband Public Housing Account allows for grants and loans to publicly supported communities for broadband network projects. Up to $20 million is available for this purpose, with eligibility contingent on not denying access to broadband providers. The commission awards grants to unserved housing developments for broadband Internet service. Up to $5 million is available for broadband adoption programs in publicly supported communities with access to broadband services. The commission awards grants for broadband Internet service to unserved housing developments. Publicly supported communities can contract with other agencies for broadband adoption programs. Projects for funding from the Broadband Public Housing Account should reflect statewide distribution. When reviewing project applications for broadband funding, the commission considers various factors such as availability of other funding sources, financial contributions from providers, existing adoption or deployment programs, and applicant's efforts to seek funding elsewhere. The commission may require match funding but will not deny funding solely based on receiving funds from another source. The commission will transfer $20 million from the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account and $5 million from the Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account to the Broadband Public Housing Account for funding purposes. Any unawarded funds in the Broadband Public Housing Account by December 31, 2020, will be transferred back to the respective accounts. This transfer will only occur if the commission is authorized to collect funds exceeding the total amount authorized in subdivision (d). Section 914.7 of the Public Utilities Code is being amended. The commission must provide an annual report to the Legislature by April 1, detailing the funds spent from the California Advanced Services Fund, recipients, geographic regions affected, expected benefits, and project statuses. The annual report to the Legislature includes details on broadband adoption levels, funds used to match federal funds, efforts to leverage non-California Advanced Services Fund funds, remaining unserved and underserved households, the California Advanced Services Fund balance, and projected funding through 2020. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2022."
