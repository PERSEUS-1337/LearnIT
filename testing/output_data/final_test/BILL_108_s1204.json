    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hunting Heritage Protection Act\". It includes findings related to hunting. Congress finds that recreational hunting is a traditional activity with 13,000,000 participants in the US. Hunters support wildlife management and conservation, assist enforcement officers, and contribute billions to conservation efforts through licenses and taxes. Effective wildlife management aims to reduce conflicts between people and wildlife, provide incentives for conservation of wildlife and habitats, and ensure each state has an agency with trained personnel to manage wildlife. Recreational hunting is considered an environmentally acceptable activity on federal public land without adverse effects on other land uses. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"agency head\" refers to the head of a Federal agency managing natural resources or Federal public land. \"Federal public land\" includes publicly accessible land owned by the US and managed for conservation, excluding land held in trust for Indian tribes. \"Hunting\" is defined as lawful hunting activities. \"Hunting\" in this context refers to the lawful pursuit, trapping, shooting, capture, collection, or killing of wildlife, or the attempt to do so. SEC. 4. RECREATIONAL HUNTING. Federal public land is generally open for recreational hunting, with limitations for reasons like national security, public safety, or other authorized closures. Each agency head must manage the land to support and enhance hunting opportunities, following applicable state laws. Federal public land management decisions should aim to maintain the same amount of land available for hunting opportunities, as much as possible, following both State and Federal laws. Each agency head must submit an annual report on closed hunting areas on Federal public land. The agency head must report closures and openings of Federal public land for recreational hunting to compensate for closures. Closures of 5,000 or more acres require submission to specific committees before taking effect. The Act does not mandate the opening of national parks or monuments for recreational hunting. Federal agencies are not required to prioritize hunting over other land uses or management priorities. States retain authority to manage fish and wildlife on both state and federal public land. Federal licenses for hunting are not authorized by this Act. The Act does not require federal agencies to issue licenses for hunting on public land in states. States have the right to take legal action against agencies that fail to comply with the Act, including seeking injunctions. If the district court grants an injunction or rules in favor of the State, it must award the State reasonable costs, including attorney's fees, for bringing the civil action."
