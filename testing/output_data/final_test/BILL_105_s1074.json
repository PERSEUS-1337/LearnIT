    "content": "The \"Child Support Reform Act of 1997\" includes provisions for a National Child Support Guidelines Commission, Centralized Child Support Enforcement, and Effective Dates. Congress finds that an increasing number of children are raised in single-parent families, which are more likely to be poor. Noncustodial parents failing to pay child support contributes to poverty among single-parent families. In 1990, there was a $33.7 billion gap in child support payments, and in 1991, the deficit was $5.8 billion. Only 54% of custodial parents received child support awards as of spring 1992. Increasing numbers of families are turning to the child support program for assistance due to a significant increase in the caseload under that program from 1991 to 1995. Approximately half of custodial parents due child support received full payment, while the other half were divided between those receiving partial payment and those receiving nothing. The collection rate under the title IV-D child support program slightly decreased from 19.3% to 18.9%. The Internal Revenue Service improved its performance in intercepting Federal income tax refunds, increasing from 992,000 cases in 1992 to 1,200,000 cases in 1996. About one-third of cases with collections involve a Federal tax refund intercept, with an average collection amount of $827 in 1995. The Federal tax refund intercept method collected $827 for families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children and $847 for other families. State-by-State child support guidelines vary significantly, resulting in low awards and inequities for children. The purpose of the Act is to review State child support guidelines, increase economic security for children, improve enforcement through a centralized system, and place responsibility for enforcement with the Internal Revenue Service. The National Child Support Guidelines Commission is established under Title I. The National Child Support Guidelines Commission is established to study and evaluate child support guidelines, identify their benefits and deficiencies, and recommend improvements. The Commission considers matters such as the relationship between guideline amounts and the actual costs of raising children, and how to define income for support orders. The National Child Support Guidelines Commission evaluates child support guidelines, including imputing income, financial obligations to multiple families, child care expenses, health care expenses, and duration of support by parents. The National Child Support Guidelines Commission evaluates child support guidelines, including support for post-secondary education, disabled adult children, adjusting support orders periodically based on economic changes, and determining support levels for shared custody or extended visitation cases. The Commission is composed of 12 individuals appointed jointly by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Congress. The National Child Support Guidelines Commission consists of 12 members appointed by Health and Human Services and Congress, with specific qualifications required for members. The National Child Support Guidelines Commission consists of 12 members appointed by Health and Human Services and Congress. Members must have expertise in child support guidelines, with representation from advocacy groups for custodial and noncustodial parents, as well as a State program director. Each member serves a 2-year term, and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Commission has specific powers, compensation, access to information, and supervision outlined in the legislation. The National Child Support Guidelines Commission will submit a final assessment of how States are serving custodial parents and children within 2 years of appointment. The Commission will terminate 6 months after submitting the report. Establishment of the Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Centralized Child Support Enforcement under Title II. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish an Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Centralized Child Support Enforcement within the IRS to locate absent parents and enforce child support obligations. Coordination regulations will be issued to facilitate activities among relevant entities. The use of the Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders and National Directory of New Hires will be implemented. Section 453(j)(2) of the Social Security Act is amended to require the Secretary to compare information in the National Directory of New Hires with support case abstracts in the Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders every 2 business days to locate individuals in paternity establishment cases or cases involving support orders. Matching information must be reported within 2 business days. The Division of Enforcement is notified by the Secretary of cases involving child support payments. The Division then directs employers to send payments to the IRS, records and disburses the payments promptly. The Division of Enforcement directs employers to send child support payments to the IRS for prompt disbursement to the custodial parent, following specific guidelines outlined in the assignment of rights under section 408(a)(3). SEC. 203. DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT. The Division of Enforcement is responsible for enforcing child support orders referred to them under specific sections of the Social Security Act. They also enforce medical support provisions of child support orders. The Division of Enforcement enforces child support orders and medical support provisions. They can use various means to enforce orders, including intercepting federal income tax refunds. If an individual fails to pay the full amount required by the due date, the Division can assess and collect the unpaid amount similar to a tax under the Internal Revenue Code. The Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Centralized Child Support Enforcement can utilize federal courts to enforce child support orders against absent parents if it is deemed a reasonable method. Some sections of the law are repealed to streamline the enforcement process. SEC. 204 amends the Social Security Act to require states to cooperate with the Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Centralized Child Support Enforcement. SEC. 205 clarifies that terms used in this title have the same meaning as in part D of the Social Security Act. TITLE III--EFFECTIVE DATES\n\nSEC. 301. EFFECTIVE DATES.\n\n    The amendments made by this Act take effect on the date of enactment, with a special rule for States needing legislation to comply."
