    "content": "Crime is typically governed by the laws of the place where it occurs, but American criminal law can apply outside the United States under certain circumstances. While there are federal statutes with extraterritorial reach, prosecutions are rare due to practical, legal, and diplomatic challenges. The Constitution allows for both congressional and state laws to apply internationally, and permits the prosecution of crimes committed abroad. The Constitution grants powers with limits, including extraterritoriality. Courts have held that Congress has discretion over extraterritorial matters, with due process concerns over notice and vague statutes. The discretion of Congress in granting extraterritorial application to statutory provisions is not constitutionally suspect. The extent of a statute's application outside the US is typically a matter of statutory construction, with general rules guiding interpretation. One rule is that a statute without explicit mention of extraterritorial application is presumed to apply domestically unless there is clear intent otherwise. Another rule considers the nature and purpose of a statute to determine if it extends beyond US borders. The Supreme Court's endorsement of the domestic presumption in civil cases raised doubts about the vitality of the rule established in United States v. Bowman. In RJR Nabisco, the Court seemed to challenge Bowman without explicitly mentioning it, leading to uncertainty about the rule's current status. The final rule states that Congress is presumed to have acted in accordance with international law unless a contrary intent is clear, with international law supporting decisions on the overseas application of American law. The courts interpret legislation with the presumption that Congress intends its laws to be applied within the bounds of international law, unless indicated otherwise. Congress often allows for the extraterritorial application of federal criminal law, particularly within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. International treaties and agreements also influence federal criminal statutes. The United States applies federal criminal statutes extraterritorially, with some statutes explicitly stating their overseas application while others rely on jurisdictional circumstances. The Supreme Court allows for implied extraterritoriality in certain cases. Investigating and prosecuting federal crimes committed abroad pose legal, practical, and diplomatic challenges. The Third Restatement of Foreign Relations Law highlights diplomatic concerns regarding state sovereignty and the limitations on law enforcement officers from one state operating in another state without consent. Failure to comply can lead to diplomatic protests, reparations, and potential criminal prosecution. Congress supports multinational cooperative law enforcement through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties and Agreements. The United States has over 70 mutual legal assistance treaties in force, facilitating multinational cooperative law enforcement activities. American law enforcement officials have utilized various methods overseas to investigate and prosecute extraterritorial offenses. In recent decades, the US has increased personnel overseas to enhance cooperative efforts in law enforcement. Overseas cooperative law enforcement assistance occasionally has Fourth Amendment implications, as clarified by the Supreme Court's United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez decision. The Fourth Amendment does not apply to the search of overseas property of foreign nationals unless there are significant voluntary connections with the United States. The application of the Fourth Amendment abroad to U.S. citizens and foreign nationals with connections to the U.S. is less clear. Prior to this decision, the Fourth Amendment and its exclusionary rule were not considered applicable to foreign searches and seizures conducted by foreign law enforcement officials, except in cases that \"shocked the conscience of the court\" or involved deep involvement of U.S. law enforcement officials. The Fourth Amendment does not typically apply to searches or seizures of U.S. citizens by foreign officials in other countries, but exceptions exist for \"joint ventures\" or cases that \"shocked the conscience.\" However, the reasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment does apply to U.S. officials conducting searches of U.S. citizens in foreign countries. Foreign searches must comply with foreign law and can be upheld under the good faith exception if U.S. officials reasonably rely on foreign law representations. Officials can rely on foreign officials' representations of foreign law. The Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause and Miranda warning requirements do not apply to statements made overseas to foreign officials, but do apply to custodial interrogations conducted overseas by American officials. Confessions or incriminating statements must be freely made to be admissible at trial in the U.S. The statute of limitations for federal crimes is typically five years, with exceptions for certain offenses. The statute of limitations for federal crimes is typically five years, with exceptions for offenses like federal sex offenses and violent federal terrorist offenses, which can be prosecuted at any time. Nonviolent federal terrorism offenses must be prosecuted within eight years. Extradition treaties allow for the surrender of fugitives between countries for prosecution or serving sentences. The United States has bilateral extradition treaties with about two-thirds of the world's nations. Extradition treaties allow for the surrender of fugitives between countries for prosecution or serving sentences. Agreements may require extradition regardless of where the offense occurs, or where the extraterritorial laws of the two nations are compatible. Recent treaties address complications like the nationality exception, political offense exception, and limiting extradition to specific offenses. In some cases, foreign authorities may expel or deport suspects instead of extraditing them. In the absence of a specific treaty provision, the defendant being abducted overseas and brought to the US for trial does not deprive the federal court of jurisdiction. Federal crimes committed within the US must be tried where they occur, while crimes committed outside the US are tried where Congress has provided. Congress has enacted venue statutes for extraterritorial offenses, allowing trial in the district where the offender is first brought or arrested, or in the district of their last known residence. Venue for joint offenders is proper wherever venue for one of their number is proper. Federal courts may subpoena U.S. residents abroad to appear before them, but generally cannot subpoena foreign nationals in foreign countries. Mutual legal assistance treaties can facilitate the transfer of custody of foreign witnesses imprisoned overseas or encourage them to testify voluntarily in the US. Federal courts may authorize depositions to be taken abroad under exceptional circumstances and in the interests of justice, and may admit them into evidence in a criminal trial. The courts prefer the defendant to be present, allow cross-examination, take the deposition under oath, create a verbatim transcript, and capture it on videotape. Depositions can be admitted into evidence in subsequent criminal trials in the US, even if optimal conditions are not met. This can be done through treaties with nations that may not require or permit depositions under US law. National Security Concerns: In cases where witnesses and evidence are located abroad, conflicts may arise between a defendant's rights and the government's need for secrecy due to diplomatic and national security reasons. The defendant is entitled to disclosure of their statements under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, but the prosecution's case may have evolved from foreign intelligence gathering. Providing a witness who is also a terrorist suspect and in federal custody may impact their value as an intelligence source. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to confront witnesses against them, even if they present classified information. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) allows for prosecution-prepared summaries of classified information to be disclosed to the defendant and used as evidence in court, ensuring the defendant's right to a fair trial is upheld despite national security concerns."
