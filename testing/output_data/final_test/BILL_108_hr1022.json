    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Urban and Rural Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Act of 2003\". Congressional findings are also included. The Congress finds that in 1999, 61 percent of adults in the United States were overweight or obese, with all age, racial, and ethnic groups affected. Approximately 300,000 deaths are associated with obesity each year, along with various health conditions. The economic cost of obesity in the US was $117 billion in 2000. It is recommended that American adults accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity daily, while children should aim for 60 minutes. Physical activity is crucial for preventing weight gain, losing weight, and maintaining weight loss. However, only a small percentage of American adults meet the recommended levels of physical activity. Lack of leisure-time physical activity is prevalent, with 40 percent of adults in the US not participating. Engaging in physical activity, combined with healthy eating, is effective in managing weight. The use of public recreational facilities and services is directly related to the level of physical activity in individuals and communities. Research shows a positive link between active recreation and disease prevention, promoting general wellness. Grant and loan program established for indoor disease prevention and health promotion centers. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may provide grants and loans for indoor centers for disease prevention and health promotion, which are indoor recreational facilities offering services for disease prevention and health promotion. The eligible entity receiving the grant or loan must own or control the facility, provide services to residents free of charge or at a minimal fee, and adhere to legally binding commitments for 25 years. The Secretary may waive these commitments under certain circumstances. The Secretary may waive commitments if environmental conditions reduce public value or access to the facility, or if the facility deteriorates and an agreement is made for a replacement facility.

Eligible uses of assistance are outlined in the Act.

Any contract for activities at an indoor center for disease prevention and health promotion funded under this Act must ensure that architects, engineers, technicians, laborers, and mechanics are paid wages determined by the Secretary of Labor.
