Congress finds that the United States is falling behind in the global economy due to a lack of well-trained individuals in mathematics, science, and technology. The country is producing fewer graduates in these fields compared to other nations like China and Japan. In the United States, only 32 percent of undergraduates receive degrees in science and engineering. US students lag behind other countries in math and science assessments, ranking 21st out of 40 in general knowledge and 28th out of 40 in math literacy. Each state in the US has its own set of standards. In the United States, each State has its own standards and curriculum for math and science education in K-12, with varying proficiency levels. Less than 40% of 4th graders and 17% of 12th graders reach national math proficiency. About 1/3 of 4th and 8th graders, and nearly 1/2 of 12th graders, do not reach basic science levels according to recent assessments. The National Academy of Sciences recommends actions to improve America's economic future. The National Academy of Sciences recommends creating a national curriculum for K-12 education to ensure students have the skills to compete in the global economy. Develop a voluntary national curriculum for mathematics and science education in kindergarten through grade 12. The Secretary of Education will convene a panel to create national expectations for math and science education from kindergarten to grade 12. Panel members include professionals from the National Academy of Sciences, psychometricians, state-level education officials, National Board certified teachers, recipients of Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, representatives of the National Science Foundation, and representatives of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The panel convened by the Secretary of Education will identify core ideas in mathematics and science common to all states and develop a minimum comprehensive set of voluntary national expectations for math and science education. Panel members include professionals from various organizations and entities determined necessary by the Secretary. The National Science Teacher Association and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics have developed standards for math and science education. The panel will create a national curriculum based on these standards, provide sample assessment questions, and establish professional development criteria for teachers. The panel members will receive compensation based on their level of government employment and travel expenses for their duties. The panel members will receive compensation based on their level of government employment and allowed travel expenses, including per diem, while away from their homes for the panel's services. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. SEC. 4. GRANTS TO STATE EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. The Secretary of Education awards grants to State educational agencies for developing instructional materials based on the national curriculum for mathematics and science. This includes contracting with educational material publishers and providing online access to teachers for free. The Secretary of Education awards grants to State educational agencies for training mathematics and science teachers in K-12 to effectively use instructional materials and assessment questions. Eligible agencies must submit an application describing the activities to be carried out through the grant. A report must be submitted within 60 days after the grant period ends. The eligible State educational agency must submit a report on the grant results within 60 days after the grant period. The agency must agree to implement national expectations and curriculum for math and science education in K-12. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 for this section. The Secretary of Education is required to study the impact of national math and science standards on student achievement and submit an annual report to Congress."
