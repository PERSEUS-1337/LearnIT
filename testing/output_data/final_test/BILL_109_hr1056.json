    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act of 2005\" and includes restrictions on importation. The Controlled Substances Import and Export Act is amended to include ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine in the list of restricted substances. Additionally, import restrictions are imposed on distributors who fail to cooperate in providing information on the foreign chain of distribution. The Attorney General may request information from foreign-chain distributors on the distribution of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine to prevent their illicit use in methamphetamine production. Refusal to cooperate may result in enforcement action. The Attorney General can issue an order to prohibit the importation of certain chemicals if a distributor is part of the distribution chain. A notice must be published in the Federal Register 60 days before the order is issued, during which imports may not be restricted. SEC. 3. METHWATCH PROGRAM; INFORMATION FOR PERSONS SELLING AT RETAIL. The Attorney General will provide information to retailers on preventing the sale of precursor products for illicit methamphetamine production and establishing a reporting system for suspicious purchases. The Attorney General will designate the MethWatch program to provide technical assistance to retailers selling precursor products. Retailers are defined as those authorized to sell ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine at retail. Precursor products are products containing these substances. The program aims to prevent direct customer access to these products. SEC. 4. REVOCATION OF REGISTRATION. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include procedures for revoking registration if a person repeatedly violates the Act regarding certain chemicals. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include procedures for revoking registration if a person repeatedly violates the Act regarding certain chemicals, such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine. The Attorney General will initiate proceedings to revoke a person's authority if they repeatedly violate the Controlled Substances Act regarding specific chemicals like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine. Restrictions on sales of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are outlined in Section 5. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to restrict the sale of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, limiting the quantity that can be sold in a single transaction. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to restrict the sale of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, limiting the quantity that can be sold in a single transaction to prevent unauthorized sales and direct shipment to purchasers. SEC. 6 amends the Controlled Substances Act to restrict possession of pseudoephedrine exceeding 24.0 grams without proper registration. SEC. 7 provides additional funding for research on medical alternatives to pseudoephedrine. Additional funding is authorized for research on medical alternatives to pseudoephedrine through the National Institutes of Health. This funding is in addition to other appropriations available for this purpose. The Attorney General must submit an annual report to Congress on preventing precursor products from being used in methamphetamine production, with recommendations for legislative or administrative changes. Within one year of the Act's enactment, a report evaluating state programs on preventing precursor product misuse must also be submitted. The State of Oregon maintains a database of transactions related to the illicit production of methamphetamine. An evaluation is needed to determine if similar Federal programs should be established. Additionally, foreign countries manufacturing precursor products should be assessed for appropriate regulations to prevent misuse."
