    "content": "The Act titled \"Commercial Truck Fuel Savings Demonstration Act of 2008\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that diesel fuel prices have increased over 50% between May 2007 and May 2008, leading to heavy vehicles diverting onto smaller roads with higher weight limits, causing increased fuel costs and travel time. Trucks carrying hazardous material and fuel oil could save significantly on transportation costs by traveling on Interstate System highways during high fuel prices in the United States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Commissioner\" as the Commissioner of Transportation of a State, \"Covered Interstate System highway\" as a designated route on the Interstate System excluding certain portions, and \"Interstate System\" as defined in section 101(a) of title 23, United States Code. SEC. 4. WAIVER OF HIGHWAY FUNDING REDUCTION RELATED TO VEHICLE WEIGHT ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS. Prohibition on reducing funds to a State under section 104(b)(1) of title 23 if the State allows certain vehicles over 80,000 pounds on Interstate highways. The section applies when the price of retail number 2 diesel is $3.50 or more per gallon. It will not be in effect after 2 years from the enactment of the Act or if the Secretary of Transportation determines adverse safety effects on highways. The Secretary of Transportation can terminate a section if a Commissioner fails to use the highway safety committee or collect required data. The Secretary must consult with the highway safety committee before making this determination. The Comptroller General will study the impact of the program on highway safety in participating states. States have responsibilities outlined in section 6. For section 4 compliance, a State must submit a plan to the Secretary of Transportation and establish a highway safety committee with various representatives. The Comptroller General will assess the program's impact on highway safety in participating states. The organization collects data on the safety effects of commercial trucks on Interstate highways, including collision rates."
