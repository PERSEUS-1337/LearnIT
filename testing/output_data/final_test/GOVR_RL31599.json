    "content": "Relations between the United States and Nepal have been friendly, with U.S. policy objectives including supporting democratic institutions, economic liberalization, peace and stability in South Asia, Nepalese independence, and poverty alleviation. The U.S. has been Nepal's first bilateral aid donor since 1951, contributing over $1.4 billion. American foreign policy interests aim to strengthen democracy, prevent Nepal's collapse to avoid becoming a base for terrorists, promote civil society, and provide developmental assistance. Political instability and insurgency-related violence have been challenges in Nepal. Political instability and insurgency-related violence in Nepal have affected the country's economy. U.S. officials warn that further deterioration could destabilize the region, create tensions between India and China, and potentially lead to a new terrorist haven in South Asia. In 2006, mounting popular resistance led King Gyanendra to hand over power to the Seven Party Alliance, promoting a more democratic Nepal. The alliance worked to end political conflict and armed struggle with the Maoists, leading to a coalition government and a peace agreement with the Maoists in November 2006. In November 2006, the Seven Party Alliance and the Maoists reached a peace agreement to end a decade-long insurgency in Nepal. The Maoists agreed to disarm and postpone decisions on the monarchy's future until after electing a constituent assembly. Constituent assembly elections were delayed from June to November 2007. The Nepali Congress Party supports a ceremonial role for the monarchy, while the Maoists advocate for its removal. Girija Prasad Koirala of the Nepali Congress Party is the current Prime Minister. The Seven Party Alliance in Nepal includes various political parties, with the Maoists being the most organized force. The alliance has a history of internal conflicts, which could be exploited by both the Maoists and royalists. Despite significant progress towards peace and democracy, challenges remain due to ongoing protests and political divisions. The significant moves towards peace and democracy in Nepal over the past year have been hindered by a poor security situation, particularly in rural areas, which has affected voter registration for the constituent assembly election. Unrest in the Terai region and demands for greater political representation remain unresolved. The Maoists have expressed dissatisfaction with the delay in the election, leading to concerns about their participation in the government. Additionally, a commission has recommended expanding the number of constituencies from 425 to 496. The Nepali Congress and CPN (UML) assumed seats as per the peace agreement. Maoists show commitment to democratic power. Prachanda calls for Nepal to become a republic. Concerns over constituent assembly elections delay. Poll shows divided opinions on monarchy in Nepal. Under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of November 2006, Maoists agreed to retire to cantonments and secure their arms. The U.N. has expressed concern over Maoists attacking political gatherings and interfering with voter lists. The Election Commission stated that the voter list for the upcoming Constituent Assembly election has expanded by 15%. Groups representing Madhesis in southern Nepal pose a threat to political stability. Groups representing Madhesis in southern Nepal, culturally close to northern India, allege Hindu radicals' involvement in violence. Maoist splinter groups incite violence in the Terai, while other unrelated groups resort to violent means like blockades and strikes to address their grievances of underrepresentation and economic discrimination. Madhesis seek autonomy from Pahadis in northern Nepal. The United Nations provided formal assistance to Nepal in 2006, dispatching a pre-assessment mission to help resolve differences on arms management between the seven party alliance and the Maoists. The UN monitored cantonment of combatants and arms caching as per the peace agreement, establishing the UN Political Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) through Resolution 1740 in January 2007. UNMIN's tasks include monitoring arms management, assisting in implementing agreements, monitoring ceasefires, supporting election preparations, and providing election monitors. The UN will send 186 unarmed military observers to Nepal to monitor the election of a Constituent Assembly. Nepal is in a political struggle between monarchists, political parties, and Maoists, with the Madhesis of the Terai adding a new dimension. The Maoists are now seeking power through a constituent assembly after setting aside the military path. King Gyanendra seized power in 2005 but made little progress against the Maoists. The king's attempt to seize control and defeat the Maoists in Nepal was aimed at asserting his power over democrats. Despite promising to reinstate a constitutional democracy within 100 days, he failed to do so and imposed restrictions on civil liberties. The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights team was established in Nepal in April 2005 to monitor human rights. The king's actions against democrats strengthened the Maoists. Almost half of the RNA was occupied with palace security and civil administration. The king's legitimacy was weakened due to how he assumed the throne and poor perceptions of his son. Maoists blockaded major highways in reaction to the king's actions, leading to clashes with the RNA. The Maoists blockaded major highways in Nepal, leading to clashes with the RNA and disrupting trade with India and China. The blockade increased food prices and fuel rationing, putting pressure on the king's government. The security situation deteriorated after the ceasefire collapsed in 2003, with the Maoists pushing for a new constitution abolishing the monarchy. The king assumed powers, arrested opposition, and tried to defeat the Maoists alone, threatening programs associated with the United States in Nepal. Despite Maoist reassurances, the U.S. government froze their assets in 2003, citing them as a threat to American national security. Nepal, a Hindu kingdom since 1768, transitioned from strict rule by the king to a constitutional monarchy in 1959. In 1960, the king established a partyless system of rule, leading to continued agitation for constitutional democracy. In 1990, the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy was launched by student groups and political parties. In April 1990, after a deadly crackdown on demonstrators, King Birendra transferred power to an interim government in Nepal. The new constitution established Nepal as a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarch. In June 2001, Crown Prince Dipendra killed his parents and other royals before taking his own life, leading to King Gyanendra's ascension to the throne. In June 2001, Crown Prince Dipendra killed his parents and other royals before taking his own life, leading to King Gyanendra's ascension to the throne. Following the assassination, a commission was appointed to investigate. In July 2001, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala stepped down due to fears of instability and government failure to address the Maoist insurgency. He was replaced by NC leader Sher Bahadur Deuba, who faced a constitutional crisis in the summer of 2002 when King Gyanendra dissolved parliament and declared emergency rule. In May 2002, Prime Minister Deuba's emergency rule extension plan was rejected by his party, leading to early elections in November. Despite legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the dissolution of parliament. The Nepali Congress split into factions, with Deuba expelled and Koirala leading one faction. In mid-June, Prime Minister Deuba called an NC convention that elected him as NC president, overturning his expulsion. Supporters of Koirala argued the convention was invalid. In September, Nepal's Election Commission ruled Koirala as the NC president, allowing his faction to use the party's name and emblems in the November elections. The Deuba-led faction registered as the Nepali Congress (Democratic) party. The split in the ruling party may benefit the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist. The ruling party split may benefit the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) party. The government considered measures to prevent Maoist disruption of the elections, including imposing a partial state of emergency. Opposition parties opposed emergency rule, suggesting dialogue with the Maoists instead. The government decided to hold elections in six stages over two months to ensure security for voters and candidates. In October 3, Nepal's cabinet asked King Gyanendra to postpone national elections for one year due to security concerns. The next day, the king dismissed the prime minister, disbanded the cabinet, and assumed executive powers. In February 1996, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) launched a \"People's War\" to establish a one-party Communist regime, fueled by government corruption and failure to improve citizens' quality of life. The Maoists ran a parallel government, implementing their own tax system and redistributing seized property and food to the poor in 45 districts. The Nepali Maoists waged insurgency through torture, killings, and bombings targeting police and officials. They became one of the wealthiest rebel groups in Asia with up to $128 million in net receipts. Peace talks broke down over the Maoists' demand to eliminate the monarchy, leading to a cease-fire breach and a state of emergency declared by King Gyanendra. The Royal Nepal Army joined the police in fighting the insurgents. The state of emergency in Nepal was extended multiple times in 2002 due to increasing Maoist violence. After the emergency expired in August, the Maoists intensified their attacks, leading to over 300 deaths in September. A general strike and clashes in November resulted in more casualties, including security personnel. The Maoists in Nepal intensified their attacks in 2002, leading to over 300 deaths in September, including security personnel. Reports indicated Nepali army units received anti-terrorist training in India, while Maoists may have established a presence in Indian states like Bihar. A cease-fire was reached in January 2003, but fighting resumed in August as the agreement collapsed. The Maoists' Chief Negotiator once threatened the United States with \"another Vietnam\" if aid to Nepal expanded. The U.S. Ambassador in Kathmandu received a letter calling for the U.S. to stop interfering in Nepal's internal affairs. The U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Nepal highlighted abuses by security forces and Maoists in 2006. Amnesty International expressed concern about unrest in the Terai region in early 2007, particularly regarding possible excessive force by police against Madhesi protesters demanding proportional representation. Amnesty International called for an investigation into protestors attacking busses, lorries, and journalists in Nepal. Human rights groups warned of a deepening human rights crisis after the king's takeover in 2005, with arbitrary arrests and censorship. There are hopes for improvement in the human rights situation since the king handed over power. Nepal is a poor country heavily reliant on agriculture, with limited arable land and crops like rice, wheat, and maize. Subsistence farming could keep Nepal impoverished for years. Nepal's economy relies on subsistence farming, with limited industrial base. Key revenue sources include textiles, tourism, and remittances from Gurkha soldiers. Challenges to foreign trade and investment include political instability, lack of infrastructure, and natural disasters. Hydroelectric potential is a major asset for investors, with joint projects with India and a hydropower policy allowing private investment. Nepal's hydropower potential is hindered by various factors, leaving only 15% of the population with electricity access. Efforts to boost the tourist industry include opening more mountain peaks and easing visa procedures. Nepal's geopolitical status as a buffer state between India and China limits its foreign policy options. Despite historically closer ties with India, recent moves by the king have strained relations with New Delhi and opened the prospect of closer relations with China. Nepal heavily depends on India for imports, exports, and access to the sea through Calcutta. The Himalayan mountain range limits access to China, while the open southern border with India is strategic for both countries. India supports Nepal against Maoist guerrillas, viewing Nepali instability as a potential threat to its own northeastern states. Nepal's success against Maoists could also impact India's Maoist problem. Maoist success in Nepal could negatively impact India's Maoist problem. Nepal has sought to establish a more independent foreign policy, including seeking support from China to counterbalance Indian influence. China has provided economic aid and political support to Nepal, viewing its stability as important as a buffer between China and India. The United States has focused on assisting Nepal with issues related to the Maoist insurgency. The United States has provided Nepal with military assistance to combat the Maoist insurgency, while also focusing on non-military aid to strengthen democratic institutions and governance. Assistance includes Economic Support Funds, Development Assistance, and programs to enhance stability, security, and human rights. IMET programs aim to improve Nepal's military operations while upholding international standards. U.S. aid will continue despite the Maoists being part of the interim government. The United States has viewed the Maoists' plans as undermining regional stability, democracy, and development for Nepal."
