    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that certain landowners within forest reserves transferred their lands to the United States in exchange for other Federal lands, known as \"lieu lands,\" as part of an in lieu selection process. This provision was repealed by the Act of March 3, 1905. The Act of March 3, 1905 repealed the in lieu selection provisions of the Act of June 4, 1897, terminated the right to select lieu lands, but preserved the rights of landowners with pending applications. The Act of July 6, 1960 established a procedure to compensate those affected by the Acts. The Act of July 6, 1960 provided compensation for those affected by prior legislation, stating that lands not previously disposed of by the United States would become part of national forests or parks. Without further legislation, resolving land title disputes under this Act would require lengthy and costly litigation. The purpose of this Act is to clarify the title status of base lands impacted by previous legislation. SEC. 2. Identification and quitclaim of federal interest in base lands. The United States quitclaims its interest in base lands to owners or entrymen, as specified in a final list. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture must prepare initial lists of base lands relinquished to the US under a previous Act within six months of this Act's enactment. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture must prepare initial lists of base lands relinquished to the US under a previous Act within six months of this Act's enactment. The lists will be based on information in their possession and will be open for public review and potential additions for 180 days after publication. During the preparation or revision of initial lists of base lands relinquished to the US, the Secretary will identify lands within conservation units or designated for specific management. The term \"conservation system unit\" refers to various national systems like parks, wildlife refuges, rivers, trails, and wilderness areas. The Secretary will identify lands within conservation units or designated for specific management, such as national parks, wildlife refuges, rivers, trails, and wilderness areas. Any lands identified by the Secretary will not be subject to certain provisions, and any rights not previously vested in the United States will be confirmed to the United States. The Secretary will publish and distribute an identification of all lands in the same manner as the initial list. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall publish a final list of lands not identified in the initial list within 24 months. If no final list is published, the initial list will be deemed final, and no lands will be excluded thereafter. After the publication of a final list, any land arbitrarily excluded from the initial list shall be deemed included unless it is within a conservation unit or designated area. Instruments issuance is subject to specific provisions. The Secretary concerned must issue deed documents confirming the quitclaim of all US rights to listed lands within 6 months of publishing the final list. These documents estop the US from claiming any interest in the lands. The United States must file and record a confirmatory deed document of disclaimer of interest for listed lands, allowing determination of land title according to state law. The US cannot be sued for ownership disputes over base lands. Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture are not obligated to inspect or disclose information about listed lands. The Act requires the United States to file a confirmatory deed document of disclaimer of interest for listed lands. The term \"document of disclaimer of interest\" refers to a memorandum or document referencing the quitclaim made in the Act. Any person waives certain claims against the United States. Any person or entity accepting benefits under this Act or failing to seek such benefits within the specified time frame waives any claims against the United States, its agents, or contractors regarding base lands or revenues received prior to the Act's enactment. Non-Federal third-party rights granted by the US for base lands remain in effect, and the US may reserve rights-of-way currently used for Government purposes. SEC. 3. OTHER CLAIMS. The United States Claims Court has exclusive jurisdiction over claims for compensation related to land vested in the United States. Claims must be filed within 1 year of the final list publication. No other court can hear claims regarding the vesting of land rights under this Act. The United States Claims Court has exclusive jurisdiction over claims for compensation related to land vested in the United States, with limitations, defenses, and awards outlined in the Act to preserve existing rights and interests. No party is entitled to compensation from the United States, but defenses and claims are allowed, subject to certain conditions. The United States Claims Court has jurisdiction over compensation claims related to land vested in the United States. Compensation can be paid from the permanent judgment appropriation or through a negotiated settlement agreement with the Attorney General. This Act does not cover selection rights required to be recorded under a previous Act, regardless of compensation received. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Sums may be appropriated as necessary for this Act."
