    "content": "Title I of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended to include a new section on the remediation of contaminated sediments. The Administrator must establish final numerical sediment quality criteria for 10 toxic substances by January 1, 2001, and review the list every 3 years to add or remove substances based on risks to human health and the environment. The Administrator must revise the hazard ranking system within 30 months to accurately assess risks from contaminated sediments at aquatic sites. The hazard ranking system will be revised to assess health and environmental risks at aquatic sites with contaminated sediments. The assessment will not consider response action costs or require identification of the release source. The current hazard ranking system will remain in effect until the revised system is implemented. The Administrator may use up to $300,000,000 from the Hazardous Substance Superfund for response actions at facilities with contaminated sediments. Priority will be given to facilities in watersheds where releases have or could harm human health or the environment. Facilities in watersheds with programs reducing toxic substance deposition may receive funding if a government contributes 25% of costs. The Hazard Ranking System Scoring Package identifies 20 facilities with contaminated sediments likely to harm human health and the environment, not previously addressed by Federal or State actions. The Administrator will prepare a scoring package for each of the 20 identified facilities under the hazard ranking system within 3 years of enactment. The results will be reported to Congress. The criteria for determining priorities among releases under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Act are amended to exclude basing priorities on identifying responsible parties or specific sources of a release. Additionally, reports on monitoring aquatic sediment quality must now include information on facilities with contaminated sediments listed on the National Priorities List. The Hazard Ranking System under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Act will be assessed by the Administrator in a report to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment. The report will evaluate the effectiveness of the system in identifying and ranking aquatic facilities based on the level of risk they pose to human health. The Hazard Ranking System will evaluate aquatic facilities based on the risk they pose to human health and the environment."
