    "content": "The Resource Efficient Appliance Incentives Act of 2005, also known as the Energy Efficient Appliance Credit, provides a credit for energy-efficient appliances under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit allows for a credit amount determined for each type of qualified energy efficient appliance produced in the United States during the taxable year. The credit amount is based on the applicable amount determined under subsection (b) multiplied by the number of appliances produced. The applicable amount determined under subsection (a) is based on a table. The table shows the applicable amounts for energy-efficient appliances produced in specific calendar years. Clothes washers with a minimum MEF of 1.42 in 2005 qualify for $50, while those meeting Energy Star levels in 2005-2007 or 2008-2010 can receive $100 or $150 respectively. Dishwashers and refrigerators with specified energy efficiency levels in various years are eligible for $75, $100, or $150 incentives. In 2010, a refrigerator consuming at least 25% less kilowatt hours per year than the 2001 energy conservation standard qualifies for a $150 incentive. The eligible production of energy-efficient appliances is determined by the excess of the number of appliances meeting energy efficiency standards produced in a calendar year over the average number meeting those standards. For appliances not listed in the table, the applicable amount is zero. The eligible production of energy-efficient appliances is determined by the excess of appliances meeting energy efficiency standards produced in a calendar year over the average number meeting those standards. Special rules apply for 2005 production. The aggregate credit amount allowed under subsection (a) for a taxpayer is limited to $75,000,000, reduced by any prior year credits. Special rules apply for certain appliances. The aggregate credit amount allowed under subsection (a) for a taxpayer is limited to $35,000,000 for all taxable years, reduced by prior year credits. Appliances eligible for the credit include clothes washers with a 1.42 MEF and refrigerators consuming 15% less kilowatt hours than energy standards. The tax credit for energy-efficient appliances is limited to 2% of the taxpayer's average annual gross receipts for the previous 3 years. Qualified appliances are listed in a table in subsection (b)(1). The terms defined for energy-efficient appliances include clothes washer, refrigerator, dishwasher, MEF, and energy factor as per Department of Energy standards. Federal energy conservation standards include the definition of \"produced\" as including manufactured items and the 2001 energy conservation standard set by the Department of Energy. Special rules apply, treating certain groups as single producers. The text discusses the application of section 1563 without considering a specific subsection, and the verification requirement for claiming a credit under subsection (a). Additionally, a new energy efficient appliance credit is added to the Internal Revenue Code. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new item under section 45J(a). The amendments made by section 45J apply to appliances produced after December 31, 2004, in taxable years ending after that date."
