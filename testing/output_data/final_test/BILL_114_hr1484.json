    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Honor the Nevada Enabling Act of 1864 Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the Federal Government controls over 80 percent of the land in Nevada, limiting the state's economy. The government promised to dispose of federally controlled lands in new states, but has failed to do so in several states including Nevada. The United States Supreme Court has declared statehood enabling Act contracts as \"solemn compacts\" with enforceable rights and obligations. Nevada could generate significant revenue by managing an expanded State-controlled land portfolio. A transfer of federally administered land to Nevada can be done in phases. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS IN THIS ACT. The term \"identified Federal lands\" in this Act refers to lands in Nevada owned, managed, or controlled by the Federal Government, excluding specific areas like National Wilderness Preservation System components and National Monuments designated under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for lands under their administration and the Secretary of the Interior for lands under their administration. The term \"select beneficiaries\" includes lands allocated for Wild Horses and Burros, lands reserved for the Department of Defense or Department of Energy, federally recognized Indian reservations, lands held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Bureau of Reclamation lands not identified as surplus. The term \"select beneficiaries\" refers to various entities including public education, health services, social services, and political subdivisions in Nevada for specific purposes. The term \"State\" refers specifically to the State of Nevada. SEC. 4. CONVEYANCE OF IDENTIFIED FEDERAL LANDS TO THE STATE OF NEVADA. The Secretary shall convey identified Federal lands to Nevada without consideration for the State to use in support of select beneficiaries. Conveyances are subject to the condition that the State holds the lands in trust, with the option to sell or lease for management costs. Nevada can choose the lands to be conveyed, with conveyances subject to valid existing rights. The conveyed Federal lands in Nevada shall be subject to valid existing rights, uses, permits, and public access as per State law. Title to both surface and subsurface estate, along with federally held water rights, will pass to the State. The initial conveyance phase involves transferring title to both surface and subsurface estate, along with federally held water rights, of the conveyed Federal lands in Nevada to the State. The Secretary concerned must convey identified Federal lands to the State, selected from various categories including lands suitable for disposal in reports or land use plans. The Secretary must convey Federal lands to the State, selected from categories such as lands under the Bureau of Land Management, Solar Energy Zones, leased lands, rights-of-way, split estate lands, disposal lands designated by Congress, and other lands under Bureau of Land Management administration. The State is authorized to select at least 7,200,000 acres of Federal lands, including those within the original Central Pacific Railroad corridor in Northern Nevada, for conveyance. SEC. 6. SUBSEQUENT CONVEYANCE PHASES. The Secretary will establish a process to convey remaining Federal lands to the State after the initial phase. Requests for conveyance can be made by the State or political subdivisions within 10 years. The State will manage the conveyed lands for revenue generation and environmental sustainability.\n\nSEC. 7. STATE PAYMENTS TO POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS. The State must make payments to political subdivisions using revenues from Federal lands conveyed under this Act to replace lost revenues from reduced Federal payments and royalties that would have been shared if the lands remained in Federal ownership."
