    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"American Opportunity Tax Credit Extension Act of 2010\" and increases in Hope Scholarship Credit made permanent. The American Opportunity Tax Credit Extension Act of 2010 makes amendments to the Hope Scholarship Credit, increasing the credit allowed for the first 4 years of post-secondary education. Qualified tuition and related expenses are now defined to include required expenses. The American Opportunity Tax Credit Extension Act of 2010 expands the Hope Scholarship Credit to include required course materials and increases the AGI limits for the credit. The adjusted gross income limits for the Lifetime Learning Credit are $80,000 ($160,000 for joint returns) and $10,000 ($20,000 for joint returns). The Lifetime Learning Credit income limits have been adjusted to $40,000 ($80,000 for joint returns) and $10,000 ($20,000 for joint returns) for the year 2010. Amendments to inflation adjustments include increasing the credit amount from $1,000 to $2,000. The Hope scholarship credit for taxable years after 2010 increases the $80,000 and $160,000 amounts by a cost-of-living adjustment. The Lifetime Learning Credit under section 25A(h)(2) of the tax code is amended by substituting 'calendar year 2009' for 'calendar year 1992'. Subparagraph (B) is also amended to change the heading to 'Lifetime Learning Credit' and adjust the reference to subsection (d)(2) to subsection (d)(2)(B). Additionally, rounding rules are updated in subparagraph (C) to include reference to subparagraph (B). The amendments to section 25A of the tax code allow for changes in the Hope Scholarship Credit and its applicability against the minimum tax. These changes include redesignating paragraphs, updating references, and making a portion of the credit refundable. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2010."
