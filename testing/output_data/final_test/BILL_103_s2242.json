    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Institute for the Environment Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. Congress finds that a comprehensive scientific understanding of various environmental issues is crucial for finding effective solutions. Currently, there is no lead Federal agency for environmental research and information, leading to a lack of coherence in addressing environmental problems. The United States needs to enhance the scientific basis for decision-making on environmental issues. Many future environmental issues are not adequately studied under current Federal research programs, hindering well-informed decision-making by governments and private sector entities. Existing Federal environmental research programs lack integration across different disciplines. To strengthen decision-making on environmental issues, there is a need for ongoing study and communication of existing knowledge. Easy access to environmental information is crucial for effective research and communication. More education and training in environmental sciences are necessary to address complex problems in the United States. The purpose of this Act is to establish an independent organization to enhance the scientific basis for environmental decision-making through research, knowledge assessments, data activities, and education. The National Institute for the Environment is established as an independent establishment with the mission to improve the scientific basis for decision-making on environmental issues. The Institute's duties include increasing scientific understanding of environmental issues through research and programs, as well as providing assessments to assist decision-making on environmental issues. Financial assistance may be provided for research and programs. The Institute's duties involve conducting assessments on environmental issues, including summarizing knowledge, assessing implications, identifying research needs, analyzing constraints, and communicating results to decision-makers and the public. The Institute's role is to provide access to current and credible environmental information to government decision-makers, researchers, educators, and the general public through an electronic network. Establishing an electronic network using existing telecommunications infrastructures to provide access to environmental information, including collections from libraries, data centers, and repositories. Identifying and promoting the use of state-of-the-art information technologies for environmental knowledge. Providing long-term stewardship of environmental information. The curr_chunk discusses the long-term stewardship of environmental information resources in the United States, promoting policies and standards for access to information, supporting research and development, and sponsoring higher education and training in environmental fields to ensure a scientifically educated workforce. The curr_chunk outlines the objectives of promoting scholarships, curriculum development, and diversity in environmental studies, as well as supporting the development of technologies to minimize environmental impact and evaluating the status of environmental sciences and fields. The curr_chunk highlights the goals of promoting scientific information exchange, addressing emerging environmental issues, setting research priorities, and considering global, national, and regional environmental problems. The curr_chunk focuses on the governing board. The Governing Board for the Institute, referred to as the \"Board,\" establishes policies and priorities. It consists of 18 members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, representing diverse groups and entities including scientists, users of scientific information, States, academic institutions, businesses, environmental groups, citizens groups, and other organizations. The Board consists of 18 members appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate. Members should have a distinguished record of service and represent diverse scientific fields studying the environment. The President should aim for representation of women, minority groups, and individuals recommended by scientific organizations. Members initially serve for a 2-year term. The Board consists of 18 members appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate, representing diverse scientific fields studying the environment. Members initially serve for a 2-year term, with subsequent terms lasting 6 years with a maximum of 2 consecutive terms. Members may receive travel expenses in accordance with regulations. The Board, consisting of 18 members appointed by the President, includes individuals from various scientific fields. Members serve initially for 2 years, followed by 6-year terms with a maximum of 2 consecutive terms. The Chairperson, designated by the President, serves for 6 years and the Board meets at least 4 times a year. Reports on environmental policy matters are periodically submitted to the President. Members who are federal employees or Members of Congress cannot receive additional compensation for their service on the Board. The Board may establish advisory committees as necessary to carry out the Act, and the President shall transmit any reports to Congress in a timely fashion. SEC. 6. STAFF. The Director of the Institute is appointed by the President with Senate approval and has the authority to exercise powers delegated by the Board. The Director formulates programs in consultation with the Board and advisory committees, receives pay at the level II of the Executive Schedule, and serves a term of office. The Director of the National Institute for the Environment is appointed by the President with Senate approval, receives pay at the rate provided for level II of the Executive Schedule, and serves for a term of 6 years. The President may appoint assistant Directors as necessary to carry out the Act. SEC. 7. INTERAGENCY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. Establishment of an Interagency Advisory Committee to ensure coordination of environmental efforts among the Institute and other Federal agencies. The Committee's duties include providing recommendations to the Board on research priorities, knowledge assessment activities, database integration, and educational programs. The Interagency Advisory Committee established under subsection (a) includes directors of research from Federal agencies conducting environmental research. Members come from agencies like the EPA, NOAA, NSF, DOE, DOI, and USDA, with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy as an ex officio member. The Interagency Advisory Committee includes ex officio members from the Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Environmental Quality. The duration of the Committee is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 8. FUNDING. The Institute has the authority to provide financial assistance, including grants, to scientists, engineers, and researchers. Funding can also be received from other Federal agencies and private sector persons for specific projects, subject to Board approval. Funds received for specific projects under this Act will be deposited in the Treasury and made available to the Institute as per appropriations Acts. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
