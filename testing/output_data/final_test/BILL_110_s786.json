    "content": "Chapter 5 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 is amended to include a new section on spot market purchases of livestock by packers. In this section, a \"covered packer\" is defined as a packer required to report daily livestock purchase information to the Secretary, excluding those owning only one processing plant. A \"nonaffiliated producer\" is a livestock producer selling to a packer with minimal equity interest and no shared ownership or personnel. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for a packer to be considered a \"nonaffiliated producer,\" including having no officers, directors, employees, or owners that are affiliated with the packer, no fiduciary responsibility to the packer, and no equity interest from the packer. It also defines a \"spot market sale\" as a purchase and sale of livestock with a firm base price and slaughter within 7 days. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for a reasonable competitive bidding opportunity when entering into an agreement for slaughtering livestock within 7 days. This includes no preclusion of soliciting bids from other packers and no existing circumstances that hinder competitive bidding. The curr_chunk outlines the requirement for covered packers to slaughter a certain percentage of livestock through spot market sales from nonaffiliated producers. The applicable percentage is generally set at 25%, with exceptions specified. The applicable percentage for covered packers to slaughter livestock through spot market sales is generally 25%. Exceptions apply for packers with a high percentage of captive supply livestock, with increasing requirements over time. This section does not preempt any state or local requirements. The section does not preempt state or local requirements for covered packers to purchase a greater percentage of livestock on the spot market. It also clarifies that it does not affect the interpretation of other provisions in the Act."
