    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges that Corinthian Colleges, Inc. faced enforcement actions due to harm to students, leading to debt relief programs by the Department of Education for affected students. Corinthian Colleges students affected by fraud can apply for debt relief under borrower defense to repayment. The Department of Education found that Corinthian Colleges misrepresented job placement rates and is establishing a process for federal loan discharge. Students can request loan forbearance while their claims are reviewed. The United States Department of Education approved 6,838 closed school loan discharge claims and 2,048 borrower defense to repayment loan forgiveness claims. Over 350,000 students are eligible to file these claims. According to testimony at a meeting, Corinthian Colleges students need help with loan discharge and forgiveness. The Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education had limited staff to assist California students with these processes. Without help, only a small number of eligible students will file claims. The Student Tuition Recovery Fund exists to assist students with economic losses from violations or institutional closure. It aims to help Corinthian Colleges students with loan discharge and financial aid relief. Restitution funds from lawsuits involving Corinthian Colleges will be used to repay student assistance. Section 69433.61 of the Education Code allows students who were enrolled at Heald College in 2013-14 or 2014-15 and were unable to complete their program due to the campus closure in 2015 to have their Cal Grant award years restored for eligibility, up to a maximum of two years. Eligibility criteria include enrollment at Heald College on April 27, 2015, or withdrawal between July 1, 2014, and April 27, 2015. The Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education will provide enrollment information to confirm eligibility. An eligible student must notify the commission before July 1, 2018, of their intent to use the restoration of Cal Grant award years and enroll in an eligible institution. Section 69999.19 is added to the Education Code for this purpose. Section 69999.19 of the Education Code allows students who received a California National Guard Education Assistance Award at Heald College in 2013-14 or 2014-15, but were unable to complete their program due to the campus closure in 2015, to have their award years restored for eligibility. This restoration is limited to a maximum of two years. An eligible student who was enrolled at Heald College on April 27, 2015, or withdrew between July 1, 2014, and April 27, 2015, can have their award years restored if they notify the commission before July 1, 2018, of their intent to use the restoration and enroll in an eligible institution for California National Guard Education Assistance Awards. Section 94051 of the Education Code allows state agencies to consider granting licensure to students of Corinthian Colleges, Inc. who were unable to obtain licensure due to the institution's closure. The agencies may require additional coursework or an ethics examination. Section 94926.5 of the Education Code establishes grant funds from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to assist eligible students affected by the closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc. The funds are to be used for federal and private loan discharge and financial aid relief, with students referred to the bureau for claim processing assistance. Nonprofit community service organizations can use grant funds to screen student requests for assistance and provide outreach, education, legal services, and referrals. Eligible organizations must be 501(c)(3) tax-exempt and compliant with laws. The organization provides free legal services to eligible students of Corinthian Colleges in California for student loan and tuition recovery-related matters. Eligible students are determined by a nonprofit community service organization for debt relief. The bureau must notify the Attorney General of any unlawful closures of Corinthian Colleges within 15 days. The notification should include school name, location, programs, and number of affected students. Additional information requested by the Attorney General must be provided by the bureau. The Attorney General must solicit grant applications from eligible nonprofit organizations within 90 days of receiving notification of unlawful closures of Corinthian Colleges. Selected organizations will be notified of grant funds available and may enter into a contract with another entity to perform duties. Within 30 days of selection, a nonprofit organization must enter into a grant agreement with the Attorney General or a qualified entity. Grant funds must be used exclusively for specified purposes, with unused funds returned unless approved for assisting affected students. The agreement can be terminated for material breach by the Attorney General or a contracted entity. The grant agreement can be terminated for material breach by the Attorney General or a qualified entity, with repayment of funds required. The grantee must be given written notice of the breach and a minimum of 30 days to resolve it. An eligible nonprofit community service organization receiving a grant may prioritize low-income students if demand exceeds funds. Otherwise, assistance can be provided regardless of income level. The organization must report quarterly to the Attorney General on the number of students served, services provided, Student Tuition Recovery Fund claims, and federal loan forgiveness claims. The nonprofit community service organization must report on the number of students screened for debt relief assistance, reasons for ineligibility, services provided, and any other relevant information as deemed appropriate. The reports will be made available to the Legislature and the bureau upon request. Additionally, a final report summarizing the information must be provided promptly after all funds are expended or by January 1, 2019. Funds will be distributed to preapproved nonprofit organizations for assistance to students. Funds will be distributed to preapproved nonprofit community service organizations in three installments: 50% upon entering a grant agreement, 25% after the second quarterly report, and 25% after the third quarterly report. Regulations adopted under this section are considered emergencies for public health and safety. The Legislature intends to provide grant funds from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to assist former Corinthian Colleges, Inc. students in obtaining loan discharge and financial aid relief. The amount of funds available will be based on the number of enrolled students at the time of closure. Organizations receiving grants must maximize the number of California students receiving loan discharge and tuition recovery. The sum of $1,300,000 is appropriated from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to the Attorney General for grants and administrative costs related to assisting students affected by the closure of Corinthian Colleges. This act is urgent for immediate relief to affected students."
