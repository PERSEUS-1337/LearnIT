    "content": "LIMITATIONS OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. The Congress finds that millions of US citizens face difficulties obtaining health coverage due to preexisting medical conditions, while Members of Congress have access to health plans without restrictions based on health status. Members of Congress have portable health care coverage that cannot be canceled or denied renewal. They can also continue to receive health care through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program after leaving Congress. Legislation should be passed to ensure health insurance portability for all US citizens. The contract for a health plan under this chapter allows carriers to impose preexisting condition exclusions, exclude individuals based on health status, and refuse to renew plans for individuals with preexisting conditions. This applies to family members as well. The subsection outlines that individuals with preexisting conditions, including Members of Congress and annuitants, will have health coverage guaranteed under certain conditions. The subsection will end once specific criteria are met regarding portable health coverage, availability of insurance, and renewability. The subsection ensures health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions, including Members of Congress, as long as premiums are paid. It will take effect 30 days after enactment and eliminates coverage for departing Members of Congress who retire. The subsection ensures health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions, including Members of Congress, as long as premiums are paid. It will cease when the Director of the Office of Personnel Management receives certification from the Secretary of Labor that certain health coverage guarantees have been enacted into law."
