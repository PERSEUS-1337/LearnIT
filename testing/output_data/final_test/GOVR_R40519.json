    "content": "The America COMPETES Act addresses concerns about U.S. industrial competitiveness and technological leadership by increasing funding for science and engineering research, STEM education, and workforce development. It authorizes funding boosts for NSF, NIST, DOE SC, ARPA-E, and Discovery Science Institutes. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs at DOE, ED, and NSF, and increases authorization levels for existing NSF STEM education programs. Funding for new programs and higher authorization levels depends on subsequent appropriations. The act was passed after much of the FY2008 appropriations process had already taken place. Despite not being funded at their authorized levels, some programs like ED's Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow and NIST's Technology Improvement Program were established. The America COMPETES Act funded various R&D and STEM education programs in FY2009 through the Omnibus Appropriations Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Some programs were funded at or above authorized levels, including NIST's STRS and Construction, DOE's Office of Science, and NSF's Research and Related Activities. Other programs were funded below authorized levels or not funded, leading to the establishment of DOE's ARPA-E and NSF's PSM program. The America COMPETES Act funded DOE's ARPA-E and NSF's PSM program, along with other initiatives like Summer Institutes and Early Career Awards for researchers. President Obama's FY2010 budget request includes funding for various research and STEM education programs, such as Scientist and Engineer Award programs, Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes, and Protecting America's Competitive Edge Graduate Fellowship Program. Table 1 provides a comparison of the budget request, America COMPETES Act authorization levels, and congressional actions. President Obama's FY2010 budget request aimed to double funding for the NSF, NIST laboratories, and DOE SC between 2006 and 2016, aligning with the American Competitiveness Initiative. The proposed plan had a slower doubling path compared to the America COMPETES Act, with the NSF's Research and Related Activities budget falling $667.8 million below the authorized level of $6,401.0 million. The President also requested funding at the authorized level for the NSF Faculty Early Career Development program. The President's FY2010 budget request included funding for NSF's EPSCoR and GRF programs, with some levels above authorized amounts. No funding was requested for NSF's PSM program. President Obama also requested funding for DOE SC and ARPA-E, with amounts below authorization levels. President Obama's FY2010 budget request included funding for NIST STRS, TIP program, MEP, and NIST construction and maintenance account. The requested amounts were below authorization levels for most programs. No funding was requested for new STEM education programs authorized in the America COMPETES Act. The President's FY2010 budget request included funding for STEM education programs at ED and NSF, with some programs funded at authorized levels and others below. No funding was requested for new STEM education programs authorized in the America COMPETES Act. The President proposed a new DOE-NSF initiative called \"REgaining our ENERGY Science and Engineering Edge\" (RE-ENERGYSE) to encourage American students to pursue STEM careers in clean energy, requesting DOE funding of $115.0 million. The total FY2010 authorization level for all DOE STEM education programs authorized in the America COMPETES Act was $117.5 million. Some analysts noted that the total funds appropriated in FY2008 and FY2009, and requested for FY2010 by the President for NSF and NIST laboratories and construction accounts, exceed the aggregate funding authorized for these agencies/accounts during this period under the America COMPETES Act. The America COMPETES Act authorized funding for DOE SC, NSF, and NIST accounts. NSF and NIST received funding above the authorized levels, while DOE SC received slightly less. The President's FY2010 budget request for NSF was below the Act's authorization. The FY2010 budget request for NSF was below the America COMPETES Act authorization level, while the NIST STRS/Construction request was slightly above. Congress passed a budget resolution setting spending amounts for each category, but specific program allocations are not determined. Large increases would be needed in FY2011 to maintain the doubling path for research funding. In April 2009, the House and Senate agreed to the concurrent budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 13) emphasizing the importance of investing in education, innovation, and economic growth. The resolution highlighted funding for scientific research and education in various sectors, urging Congress to continue supporting policies promoting American innovation and competitiveness. The Congress should pursue policies to ensure American leadership in innovation, research, and technology. This resolution emphasizes the importance of investments and tax policies that promote research and development for American economic competitiveness. Funding for programs under the America COMPETES Act is divided among multiple appropriations subcommittees, making it complex for Congress to address these programs as a single initiative. Table 1 summarizes the FY2010 appropriations status of the America COMPETES Act. The FY2010 appropriations status of the America COMPETES Act programs is summarized in Table 1. Appropriations for these programs are included in three regular appropriations bills: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS), Energy and Water Development (Energy-Water), and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS-Education). The House and Senate review the President's budget request and provide funding recommendations. The House approved the CJS Act (H.R. 2847) on June 18, 2009, and the Senate Committee on Appropriations CJS subcommittee made its report (S.Rept. 111-34) on June 24, 2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the bill on June 25, 2009, and regular appropriations for FY2010 for activities funded in the CJS Appropriations Act were included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117) signed into law on December 16, 2009. P.L. 111-117 includes $515.0 million for the NIST STRS account for FY2010, $43.0 million above the FY2009 regular appropriation, and $147.0 million for the NIST Construction and Maintenance account for FY2010. In FY2010, NIST's Technology Innovation Program received $69.9 million, equal to the President's request. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership program was funded at $124.7 million, meeting the President's request. The NSF's Research and Related Activities received $5,617.9 million for FY2010, $115.3 million below the President's request. The FY2009 regular appropriation was $783.1 million below the America COMPETES Act FY2010 authorization level. Several programs included in the President's budget were not funded in P.L. 111-117, such as Faculty Early Career Development and Research Experiences for Undergraduates. The Major Research Instrumentation program did not receive funding in FY2010. The House report stated that funding for this program would resume in FY2011. The NSF did not receive funding in FY2009 due to new solicitations totaling $400 million, but expects to resume funding in FY2011. The Senate report emphasized fully funding scientific research facilities and instruments. EPSCOR funding is provided at $147.1 million, equal to the authorized level. The President did not request funds for the Professional Science Master's Degree Program. The Graduate Research Fellowship program is not included in the funding. The Committee encourages support for the PSM program and recommends incorporating funding requests in future budgets. Funding for the Graduate Research Fellowship program is not included in P.L. 111-117. The House report provided an additional $14.0 million for NSF to select and support 2,000 new fellows in FY2010. P.L. 111-117 provides $872.8 million for the NSF Education and Human Resources account, which is $72.5 million above the FY2009 regular appropriation. This is $231.2 million less than the America COMPETES Act FY2010 authorization level. The Act provided appropriations authorizations for six EHR programs, with specific funding mentioned only for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. The conference report (H.Rept. 111-366) fully funds the President's request for various education programs, including the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, at specified levels. Additionally, P.L. 111-117 provides funding for the NSF MREFC account, which is below the FY2009 appropriation and the America COMPETES Act authorization level. P.L. 111-117 provides funding for the NSF Agency Operation and Award Management, National Science Board, and Inspector General accounts, with amounts varying from the FY2009 regular appropriation and the America COMPETES Act authorization levels. P.L. 111-85, the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, provides funding for the Office of Science and Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E). The Office of Science receives $4,903.7 million, slightly above the FY2009 appropriation and below the President's request. ARPA-E does not receive funding in FY2010. The ARPA-E will fund its first round of awards in FY2010 with regular appropriation and ARRA funding. The decision not to provide additional funding for ARPA-E in FY2010 does not indicate a lack of commitment. Twelve new DOE research and education programs authorized under the America COMPETES Act have not been funded in previous years and are not included in the FY2010 budget. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding for various programs in nuclear science, hydrocarbon systems science, early career awards, innovation institutes, fellowship programs, and distinguished scientist program. Total authorized funding exceeds $200 million for FY2010. These programs are similar to existing ones supported in the President's budget. The Labor-HHS Act was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117) was signed into law on December 16, 2009, providing funding for Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Programs, Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow, and other Department of Education programs authorized under the America COMPETES Act. The funding levels for these programs were in line with the President's requests and FY2009 levels. The America COMPETES Act authorized several education programs, but P.L. 111-117 did not provide funding for five new programs. These programs include Math Now, Summer Term Education Programs, Math Skills for Secondary School Students, Advancing America Through Foreign Language Partnership Program, and Mathematics and Science Partnership Bonus Grants. Another program, P-16 Alignment of Secondary School Graduation Requirements with the Demands of 21st Century Postsecondary Endeavors and Support for P-16 Education Data Systems, has ambiguous funding. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding for various education programs, including Math Skills for Secondary School Students. Congress is deliberating on the funding levels for these programs, with some new programs yet to receive funding. Authorization levels are provided only through FY2010."
