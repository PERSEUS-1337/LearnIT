    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Clean, Low-Emission, Affordable, New Transportation Efficiency Act\" and amends the United States Code by adding a new chapter on transportation alternatives. The chapter defines key terms such as Administrator, Charrette, Fund, and Intercity passenger rail service. A Charrette is a collaborative design session to produce feasible Plans. The Fund refers to the Low Greenhouse Gas Transportation Fund. The term 'intercity passenger rail service' includes high-speed rail service and is defined as rail service for intercity transportation. MPO refers to a metropolitan planning organization representing over 200,000 individuals. A 'Plan' is a transportation greenhouse gas reduction plan covering at least 10 years, and 'scenario analysis' involves projecting different trends to develop a range of scenarios. The Low Greenhouse Gas Transportation Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to improve mobility and reduce vehicle miles traveled, use of petroleum-derived transportation fuel, and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. The Fund consists of deposited amounts and allows for expenditures upon request by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers necessary amounts from the Fund for projects under Plans developed under section 6308(b). Up to 10% of the Fund is available for administrative expenses. Transfers to the Fund are made monthly based on Treasury estimates, with adjustments as needed. The Administrator is required to auction 10 percent of emission allowances for each calendar year from 2012 to 2050. The auctions must be conducted over at least 4 sessions, with proceeds deposited into the Fund. Each State and MPO must establish a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector over 10 years by increasing mobility options, reducing vehicle miles traveled, and using petroleum-derived fuel. They are required to develop transportation greenhouse gas reduction plans integrated into long-range transportation plans, prioritizing projects to support the goal. New transit projects eligible for assistance under chapter 53, including the expansion of existing transit service, and intercity passenger rail projects for equipment, track improvements, facility construction, and grade crossing improvements. The curr_chunk discusses various aspects of intercity passenger rail service improvements, including highway-rail grade crossing improvements, security, environmental impact mitigation, communication and signalization improvements, relocation assistance, acquisition of replacement housing sites, and rehabilitation of replacement housing. Additionally, it mentions rehabilitating, remanufacturing, or overhauling rail rolling stock and facilities used primarily in intercity passenger rail service, as well as costs associated with developing State rail plans. The curr_chunk discusses various transportation improvements such as sidewalks, bicycle paths, freight rail capacity, carpool projects, and updates to zoning regulations to encourage pedestrian and bike travel. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for transportation plans to coordinate with local, regional, and state plans, support specific types of development, improve data collection and travel models for measuring greenhouse gas emissions, and implement transportation control measures. Plans must be submitted to the Secretary within 2 years of enactment and updated every 4 years with an analysis of goal achievement. The curr_chunk discusses the certification process for transportation plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring compliance with goals and regulations. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for developing transportation plans, including public involvement, coordination between MPOs and states, and consultation with various agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the incorporation of MPO plans into state plans and a study to maximize greenhouse gas emission reductions in the transportation sector. The curr_chunk discusses establishing technical standards for transportation data collection, monitoring, planning, and modeling to assess greenhouse gas emissions and develop plans to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. The Secretary must update these standards every 5 years before certifying any plan under section 6304(d). The curr_chunk discusses reporting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the transportation sector, the impact of federal policies, potential changes to federal law, and planned regulatory changes to improve transportation Plans. The Secretary will allocate funds from the Fund to support the development, updating, and implementation of Plans under section 6304. 5 percent of funds will be used for plan development, while 10 percent will support plan implementation and necessary projects. A formula for fund distribution will be established to reflect per capita reduction expectations. The allocation of funds from the Fund will prioritize Plans certified under section 6304(d) developed by MPOs, focusing on transportation options for low-income individuals, minorities, the elderly, zero-car households, and the disabled. Additionally, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions achieved by States and MPOs under these Plans will be considered during the first 5 years after enactment. The Federal share of a project under Plans certified under section 6304(d) shall be 80 percent. Chapter 63 outlines transportation alternatives including definitions, funding, auctioning, plans, study, technical standards, and reporting requirements."
