    "content": "The United States plays a significant security role in the Southwest Pacific, relying on Australia and New Zealand for assistance in promoting development and maintaining political stability. Some view the U.S. role as one of \"benign neglect\" or transient, responding to global security changes rather than long-term regional development needs. Key areas of U.S. engagement include its territories, Freely Associated States, military bases, and limited aid and economic programs in the Pacific. The United States has security, political, economic, and environmental interests in the Pacific, including providing security and promoting economic development in the Freely Associated States and U.S. territories, maintaining military bases, preventing transnational crime, and working with Australia and New Zealand. The Pacific Islands can be divided into four spheres of influence: American, Australian, New Zealander, and French. The American sphere includes parts of Micronesia and Polynesia, Australia focuses on islands south of the equator, and New Zealand has ties with Tokelau and Samoa. New Zealand has ties with Tokelau, Samoa, Cook Islands, and Niue. The country has a large Polynesian population, and other Pacific Islanders. China has been increasing its influence in the region. The United States is obligated to defend the Freely Associated States. Australia and New Zealand provide development assistance and security to the region. Since World War II, the United States has focused on preventing potential adversaries from gaining a strategic foothold in the South Pacific. This has involved administering territories, entering Compacts of Free Association in Micronesia, and maintaining military bases in Guam and Kwajalein atoll. Despite strong engagement in Micronesia post-Cold War, U.S. officials have shown less direct concern for issues in other areas of the region. USAID withdrew from the Pacific in the mid-1990s, and the U.S. government has supported Australia's increasing leadership role in the region. The Bush Administration signaled a move towards greater involvement in the Southwest Pacific in 2007. Australia led a peacekeeping mission in the Solomon Islands in 2003 to prevent transnational crime and terrorism. Papua New Guinea was warned of possible collapse in 2004 due to weak government and border controls. The study highlighted Papua New Guinea's weak government, border controls, and policing, allowing criminal groups to enter the country. It recommended increased foreign aid to address political stability, economic development, and counter China's influence. Unregulated foreign aid from China and Taiwan could worsen underlying issues. The United States has relied on Australia and New Zealand for involvement in domestic crises in the region. In 2006, political and civil unrest erupted in Pacific Island countries, including a military coup in Fiji and riots in Tonga and the Solomon Islands. Australia and New Zealand deployed peacekeeping troops to Tonga and the Solomon Islands to help quell the unrest. Indigenous rioters in Tonga and the Solomon Islands targeted business property owned by ethnic Chinese. Australia and New Zealand already had troops stationed in the Solomons as part of a 2003 peacekeeping mission. Peacekeeping forces from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Vanuatu are also assisting in Papua New Guinea. In Guinea, peacekeeping forces from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Vanuatu are helping enforce a truce brokered in 1998 between the PNG government and an armed secessionist group on Bougainville. Pacific Island leaders have viewed Australia's past and present leadership role with resentment. In May 2007, the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders gathered in Washington, DC, attended by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The Bush Administration declared 2007 the \"Year of the Pacific\" and pledged to \"re-engage\" with the region. Topics discussed included expanding public diplomacy efforts through a new office in Fiji. The U.S. is expanding public diplomacy efforts in the Pacific region, strengthening commercial ties, addressing Pacific fisheries management, and discussing the impact of U.S. military expansion in Guam. Other proposals include enhancing educational and cultural exchanges, increasing foreign aid grants for democracy-building, and creating more welcoming business environments. Analysts suggest that the renewed U.S. interest in the Pacific is a response to growing Chinese influence. The region covers 20 million square miles of ocean and 117,000 square miles of land area. The Pacific Island nations cover 20 million square miles of ocean and 117,000 square miles of land area, with a population of nearly 8 million among 14 independent states. The total GDP of these islands is approximately $24 billion in 2006. The region is predominantly populated by indigenous peoples - Polynesians, Melanesians, and Micronesians, with historical differences in geography, language, culture, and physical characteristics. PINs were among the last to regain independence after World War II, with territories like Guam remaining under control. The Pacific Island nations regained independence following World War II. Territories include Guam, the Mariana Islands, American Samoa, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Tokelau, and Easter Island. The 14 sovereign states are formal democracies with limited political violence, respect for human rights, and mostly \"free and fair\" elections. Eight countries are rated as \"free\" and four as \"partly free.\" Fiji's rating dropped after a military coup in 2006. Most countries have limited resources for sustained development. Many small Pacific Island nations face challenges such as weak resource bases, lack of economies of scale, and remoteness from international markets. The Asian Development Bank categorizes these nations based on their natural resource endowments and development potential. Melanesian nations like Papua New Guinea have abundant resources and large populations, while atoll nations like Kiribati have limited resources and little development potential. The Asian Development Bank recommends establishing trust funds for atoll nations like Nauru, Tuvalu, and Kiribati to address poverty and government capacity-building concerns. The Freely Associated States, including Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, are crucial for the defense of the United States and serve as a strategic buffer zone in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. is strengthening its military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on Guam to deter security threats. The Compact of Free Association maintains economic and security commitments with the Micronesian archipelagoes. The Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, and the Northern Mariana Islands were part of the U.S.-administered United Nations Trust Territory. In 1978, the Northern Mariana Islands entered a commonwealth arrangement with the U.S., while the Marshall Islands and Micronesia became sovereign states through Compacts of Free Association in 1986. The Compact agreements were approved by plebiscites and the U.S. Congress in 1985. Economic terms were renegotiated in 2003, with grant assistance totaling approximately $1 billion for the RMI and $1.5 billion for the FSM. In 2003, President Bush signed P.L. 108 - 188 into law, extending grant assistance for 20 years to the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. The U.S. grant assistance to the RMI (2004-2023) is $629 million, while grants to the FSM are $1.4 billion. Palau entered a 50-year Compact of Free Association with the U.S. in 1995, receiving over $450 million in economic assistance between 1995 and 2009. The Palau trust fund had a value of approximately $166 million in 2007. The United States supports the Freely Associated States (FAS) economically to make them self-sufficient. FAS citizens can reside and work in the U.S., volunteer for the armed forces, and join the \"coalition of the willing\" in Iraq. The U.S. is obligated to defend the FAS and has a \"defense veto\" over their policies. The United States has the prerogative to reject military access to the Freely Associated States (FAS) by third countries, known as the \"right of strategic denial.\" This provision was invoked in 2001 when the U.S. rejected the Marshall Islands' decision to allow Taiwan naval vessels to stop in the RMI. The U.S. can also establish military facilities in the FAS under the Compact of Free Association, with a military presence only in the Marshall Islands. The United States operates military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, conducting missile defense tests and space surveillance activities. The site is considered critical in the missile defense program, and a petition was submitted for additional compensation related to U.S. nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands during the 1940s and 1950s. The United States spent over $500 million on nuclear test compensation and related assistance in the Marshall Islands between 1954 and 2004. A petition for additional compensation was based on \"changed circumstances\" citing new information on radioactive fallout and radiation protection standards. In 2004, the U.S. Department of State released a report concluding there was no legal basis for the petition. The House and Senate Committees held hearings on the effects of the U.S. nuclear testing program on the Marshall Islands. The House of Representatives passed a resolution commending the Marshall Islands for their contributions. Lawsuits were filed seeking compensation for damages related to the nuclear testing program. The U.S. government is being sued in the Court of Federal Claims for compensation related to nuclear testing worth $561 million and $384 million. Australia, EU-25, Japan, and New Zealand are major trading partners with Pacific Island nations. PINs benefit from trade preference programs, including the Cotonou Agreement and SPARTECA. In 2001, Pacific Islands Forum members signed PACER to establish free trade agreements. In 2006, 22% of U.S. imports from Pacific Island countries received duty-free treatment. The region receives high levels of foreign aid, with approximately $886 million in 2004. Per capita aid varies among countries, with the FAS being among the highest recipients. The Pacific Islands receive high levels of foreign aid, with Australia, the United States, and Japan being the largest donors. Other major providers include New Zealand and the United Kingdom. China is also a significant aid provider in the region, but its assistance differs in purpose from traditional donors. China's aid in the Pacific Islands differs from traditional donors like Australia and New Zealand in purpose and transparency. While Australia and New Zealand focus on sustainable development, China's aid often consists of loans and infrastructure projects benefiting governments rather than local communities. China does not disclose foreign aid data, unlike other major donors. Total aid from Australia to the Pacific is estimated at $574 million for 2006-07. Japan and the EU have increased aid to the Pacific region to counter Chinese influence. Japan pledged $410 million in regional aid in 2006 and $38 million in bilateral aid for 2006-2007. The EU's European Development Fund supports programs worth $235 million, with an additional $159 million allocated for development projects in Papua New Guinea starting in 2008. In 2006, the Asian Development Bank approved loans, grants, and technical assistance totaling $110 million for Papua New Guinea over a six-year period. The United States provides little development assistance to the Pacific region, excluding treaty obligations to the Freely Associated States. The last U.S. bilateral development aid programs in the region ended in 1996 due to shifting strategic priorities and budget constraints. In 2006, the United States funded military assistance and Peace Corps programs worth $9.6 million to seven Pacific Island countries. Other major U.S. foreign aid programs in the region include the Pacific Island Fund, South Pacific Fisheries, HIV/AIDS programs in Papua New Guinea, and environmental programs. U.S. tuna fishing vessels gain access to fishing zones in the Southwest Pacific under the Multilateral Treaty on Fisheries in exchange for licensing fees and economic assistance to the Pacific Island countries. The Southwest Pacific supplies one third of the world's tuna. U.S. foreign aid to the region includes a $65 million aid agreement with Vanuatu focusing on transportation infrastructure. The Millennium Challenge Account rewards countries for good governance and investment in health and education. Vanuatu, East Timor, and Mongolia are eligible for full MCA assistance. U.S. Peace Corps missions in the Pacific Islands region decreased by 50% between 1995 and 2003. Peace Corps operations in Cook Islands, Fiji, Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu were terminated. The Peace Corps operations in the Cook Islands, Fiji, Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu were terminated due to budget constraints, while missions in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Niue were closed for safety reasons. USAID provided aid after a tsunami in the Solomon Islands, and has supported disaster management training in the Pacific Islands. The Joint Commercial Commission (JCC) was proposed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 to promote commercial and economic relations between the United States and Pacific island countries. The JCC has a rotating chairmanship and has been criticized for lacking a permanent bureaucracy and forceful agenda. Efforts to reinvigorate JCC with the United States have been discussed due to the growing influence of the People's Republic of China in the Southwest Pacific. China has expanded its diplomatic and commercial presence in the Southwest Pacific to gain political and economic influence, becoming a major source of foreign aid in the region. Concerns have been raised about China's long-term intentions, as it competes with the United States and Taiwan in the region. China has expanded its diplomatic and commercial presence in the Southwest Pacific to gain political and economic influence. The PRC has opened diplomatic missions in all Pacific countries with which it has relations, provided bilateral assistance, and hosted receptions for Pacific Island leaders. China and Taiwan are major sources of trade, investment, immigration, and tourism in the region, developing coordinated diplomatic and economic strategies in the Pacific. In 2006, PRC Premier Wen Jiabao held a summit in Fiji with members of the Pacific Islands Forum, signing agreements with several PIF countries. In 2006, China and several Pacific Island Countries signed an economic development framework with $375 million in assistance and low-interest loans pledged by China. Taiwan also held a summit with its Pacific allies, signing agreements on various cooperative projects. Taiwan's achievements in political democratization were recognized in the \"Palau Declaration,\" supporting its bid to join international organizations. China and Taiwan use aid as leverage for diplomatic recognition and support of their objectives in the Pacific. China requires countries to adhere to the \"one-China\" policy, cut ties with Taiwan, and oppose U.N. resolutions critical of China's human rights record. Taiwan's allies in the Pacific back resolutions endorsing its international organization memberships. Concerns exist that \"dollar diplomacy\" could lead to political instability and corruption in recipient countries. Financial benefits from Beijing and Taipei may unduly influence Pacific Island leaders with limited budgets. In response to military and economic sanctions by Western countries, Fiji's new leadership has sought to strengthen relationships with China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. Accusations have been made against both the PRC and Taiwan for meddling in the domestic politics of Pacific Islands countries like Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Despite denials from Beijing and Taipei, many Pacific Island nations have welcomed aid and economic support from both countries, with some countries switching diplomatic alliances in response to assistance offers. Some Pacific Island leaders have switched diplomatic alliances in response to offers of assistance from China and Taiwan. Over 3,000 Chinese enterprises are present in the Pacific, with investments estimated between $600 million and $1 billion. Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands have welcomed Chinese investment as part of their foreign policies. In 2006, the Solomon Islands saw a 26% and 29% increase in wood exports to China. The PRC has investments in PNG, including the Ramu nickel mine, logging, gas production, and tuna processing. Chinese demand for timber has led to illegal logging in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. China also operates a tuna fishing fleet in Fijian waters and is involved in developing a hydro power plant in the country. Despite growing economic assistance from China and Taiwan, the Freely Associated States remain under strong U.S. economic and strategic influence. Some citizens in the FAS are concerned about the influence of China and Taiwan. Despite strong U.S.-FAS relationships, the Trust Territory districts also have good relations with Japan, China, and Taiwan based on foreign assistance and commerce. The Compact allows diplomatic relations with any country. Micronesia has ties with China since 1989, while the Marshall Islands and Palau recognize Taiwan for economic reasons. China provides significant foreign assistance to the RMI, including loans, grants, and infrastructure projects. Micronesia also hosts a Chinese tuna fishing fleet. Taiwan is a major source of foreign aid for the Marshall Islands, providing $10 million annually and pledging $40 million over 20 years. Taiwanese citizens own over 50% of large businesses in the Marshall Islands, causing concern among the native business community. Taiwan has diplomatic relations with Palau since 1999 and has a significant economic presence in the region. Taiwan's economic influence in Palau is significant, with estimates of $100 million in aid and loans causing some resentment among locals. Taiwan and Japan are major aid donors and top sources of tourists for Palau. China's objectives in the Southwest Pacific include countering Taiwan's influence and taking advantage of waning U.S. interest in the region. China has been increasing its presence in the Pacific Island region through various strategies, including emigration. The ethnic Chinese population in the Pacific Island region is economically influential but remains relatively small numerically, estimated between 80,000 to over 200,000, or 1% to 3% of the total population. There are reports of Chinese influx in Papua New Guinea and Fiji, with an estimated 20,000 Chinese in each country, along with concerns of illegal immigration and involvement in organized criminal activities. However, experts suggest that the PRC government does not have a systematic policy to populate the islands for influence. Chinese immigrants in Pacific Island communities complicate PRC relations by creating resentment among indigenous citizens. The ethnic Chinese population in the region includes individuals from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, as well as Pacific Islanders of Chinese descent. PRC and Taiwanese engagement, along with ethnic-Chinese economic presence, has led to some resentment among indigenous peoples, with instances of anti-ethnic-Chinese activity, such as the 2006 riots in Tonga. In 2006, riots erupted in Tonga's capital, Nuku'alofa, resulting in eight deaths and extensive destruction of the commercial district, including 30 Chinese-owned businesses. The unrest was triggered by frustration over slow political reforms after the death of King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV. Australia and New Zealand deployed troops and police to restore order and enforce martial law. Tongan opposition groups criticized the foreign intervention. In April 2006, political demonstrators clashed with police in Honiara, Solomon Islands, accusing the government of corruption and ties to Chinese business interests. Ethnic Chinese community in the country estimated at a few thousand, with about 2,000 in Honiara. Most are from Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia or are naturalized third or fourth generation Solomon Islanders. Taiwan, with diplomatic relations with the Solomon Islands, provides $11 million in annual assistance and has been accused of exacerbating corruption. The PRC evacuated 300 Chinese nationals during political upheaval in 2006. Australia and New Zealand, with troops stationed in the country since 2003, sent additional personnel to help quell ethnic violence. The Southwest Pacific is of vital importance to these nations. Analysts and practitioners rely on Australia and New Zealand to lead in promoting peace, stability, and development in the South Pacific. They share U.S. strategic concerns and maintain good relations with China. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Glyn Davies emphasized the strong alliance with Australia. Australia is concerned about instability in the region to its north. Australia has been actively involved in promoting peace, stability, and development in the region to its north, including the Southwest Pacific and archipelagic Southeast Asia. Despite some improvements in places like Aceh, ongoing instability persists in areas such as East Timor, West Papua, Bougainville, and the Solomon Islands. Australian defense cooperation aims to enhance maritime resource use and regional security in Pacific Island countries. Canberra has also worked closely with Papua New Guinea on law enforcement, border security, and economic management. Since 2001, Australia has taken a more assertive role in the region to prevent further destabilization and combat international crime and terrorism. Australian Prime Minister John Howard emphasizes the importance of a stable and economically viable region free from crime and terrorism. Australia has provided support to Pacific Island nations through patrol boats and military assistance. Canberra has also deployed troops and police officers to East Timor, the Solomon Islands, and Tonga to promote stability, with ongoing commitments in East Timor and the Solomons. Australia plays an active role in the Pacific Islands Forum, with Greg Urwin serving as Secretary General. Australia, under Prime Minister John Howard, is a strong ally of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region. The ANZUS Alliance, established in 1951, solidified the partnership between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Australia invoked the alliance after 9/11 and sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite New Zealand's anti-nuclear policies leading to a suspension of defense obligations, Australia maintains a close military relationship with the United States. The ANZUS alliance between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand remains strong, with a focus on bilateral ties. The Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement has enhanced trade relations, with China becoming Australia's second largest trading partner. Trade between Australia and China has grown significantly, leading to ongoing Free Trade Agreement negotiations. Australia values its strategic partnership with the United States but also recognizes China as a key economic partner. There are concerns about potential tensions if relations between the U.S. and China worsen. Australia does not support containment of China but is wary of a significant increase in Chinese influence in the South Pacific. New Zealand is seen as a key partner in the Pacific region for cooperation in various areas. New Zealand, a small country with close ties to Pacific nations, plays a key role in the region. It is known for its contributions in non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, and peacekeeping. New Zealand's Polynesian Maori and Pacific Islander communities help define it as a Pacific nation. The country is viewed as a natural regional partner due to its reputation as an honest broker. Key policy issues in the Pacific for New Zealand include diplomatic ties, trade relations, security promotion, disaster assistance, and environmental concerns. New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji after the 2006 coup to support democracy. Defense and sporting ties were cut, but trade, investment, and tourism were unaffected. Concerns were raised about regional stability. New Zealand promotes regional trade through agreements like SPARTECA, PACER, and PICTA. The country works to promote stability in various Pacific nations. The Biketawa Declaration of 2000 provides a regional security framework for collective action in times of crisis in the Solomon Islands, Fiji, and Tonga. New Zealand, along with Australia and France, provides disaster assistance to Pacific Island states through the FRANZ arrangement. New Zealand also plays a leading role in safeguarding fisheries, addressing climate change, and environmental concerns in the Southwest Pacific region. Additionally, New Zealand has agreed to accept Tuvalu's entire population if rising sea levels inundate the island within the next 50 years. New Zealand opposes nuclear material shipment and supports reducing whaling. The U.S. and New Zealand collaborate on climate change. China is a significant trade partner, with negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement initiated in 2004. High-level exchanges between leaders have strengthened the relationship. PRC Premier Wen Jiabao and New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters pledged cooperation in engaging the Pacific. The legacy of French colonization in the Pacific is evident in the administration of French Polynesia and New Caledonia. French Polynesia has 118 islands, with a population of over 270,000, and a per capita GNP of $17,500. The territory has enhanced self-government since 1984, with political parties ranging from centrist to pro-independence. France ceased nuclear testing in French Polynesia in 1996. New Caledonia, with a population of 230,000, is mainly inhabited by native Melanesians. New Caledonia, with a population of 230,000, is largely comprised of native Melanesians and descendants of French settlers. France annexed the islands in 1853, establishing a penal colony that closed in 1896. The territory has significant mineral wealth, being the world's third-largest producer of nickel. Pro-independence sentiment grew in the 1970s, leading to the establishment of the Kanak National Socialist Liberation Front (FLNKS) in 1984. Violence between Kanaks and French settlers was addressed by the 1988 Matignon Accords, allowing greater autonomy for New Caledonia. The Noumea Accord of 1998 committed France to transfer additional responsibilities to New Caledonia's government, with a future vote between 2014 and 2018 to determine independence. France's relations with New Zealand and other South Pacific nations were strained after the sinking of the Green Peace ship Rainbow Warrior in 1985. The Pacific Community, formerly the South Pacific Commission, was established in 1948 by Australia, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the UK, and the US. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) provides technical assistance to its 26 member states. The SPC has divisions for land, marine, and social resources. The Pacific Islands Forum, previously the South Pacific Forum, has a more limited membership but higher international political profile. The Pacific Islands Forum, established in 1971 by independent states in the region, makes decisions by consensus and focuses on issues such as regional fisheries, climate variability, and security. It supported the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and has increasingly focused on regional trade and good governance."
