FINDINGS.\" \"Protection of environmental and ecological qualities of Federal lands is important. Reviewing environmental impact of proposed transmission facilities is vital and should be done thoroughly and timely. Currently, there is no requirement for timely completion of environmental reviews for these facilities, leading to varying completion times up to ten years.\" The Federal Government owns a significant portion of land in the United States, including large percentages in Western States like Nevada and Arizona. Due to this ownership, transmission facilities often need to be built on Federal lands. To ensure reliable electricity supply, the electricity transmission grid must be expanded. It is recommended to appoint a lead agency to coordinate environmental reviews among Federal agencies for more thorough and timely assessments. The act is based on Congress's Constitutional authority to regulate territory and property of the United States. It also involves coordination between Federal and State agencies for permitting transmission facilities. The Department of Energy (DOE) can act as the lead agency for coordinating Federal authorization and environmental reviews for electricity transmission or distribution facilities upon request. Federal authorization includes permits, certifications, and approvals required by Federal or State agencies. Coordination with Indian tribes, multi-State entities, and State agencies is encouraged. The Department of Energy, as the lead agency, has the authority to set deadlines for the review and authorization decisions of proposed facilities. They will establish prompt milestones and ultimate deadlines in consultation with other Federal agencies, Indian tribes, multi-State entities, and State agencies willing to coordinate their permitting and environmental reviews. Once an application is submitted with necessary data, the Secretary of Energy will ensure timely permit decisions and environmental reviews. The Department of Energy will set deadlines for permit decisions and environmental reviews under Federal laws within 1 year. A pre-application mechanism will be provided for prospective applicants to determine approval likelihood and key concerns within 60 days. A single environmental review document will be prepared as the basis for all project decisions under Federal law. The Department of Energy will streamline the review and permitting of transmission and distribution facilities within designated corridors. Appeals can be filed with the Secretary of Energy for denied authorizations or pending applications. The Secretary of Energy will issue a decision on pending applications within 90 days. Regulations to implement these provisions must be issued within 18 months. Memoranda of Agreement will be established within 1 year to ensure timely review of electricity facilities. The Secretary of Energy will issue decisions on pending applications within 90 days. Federal authorizations for electricity transmission or distribution facilities will be issued for a duration determined by the Secretary of Energy, with appropriate authority to manage right-of-way for reliability and environmental protection. Renewals will be reviewed considering the importance of the infrastructure for public health, safety, and economic welfare. The Secretary of Energy will consult with FERC and other organizations to improve the national grid for reliability and electricity delivery."
