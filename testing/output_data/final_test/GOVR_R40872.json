    "content": "The report discusses the precise terminology used to describe different types of fossil fuels and the importance of using accurate terms to avoid errors in estimating energy availability. It also provides a summary of the United States' fossil fuel endowment and its comparison with other nations. Fossil fuels are categorized based on various variables, and it is crucial to consider the wide range of concentration and quality in naturally occurring deposits. The resource pyramid illustrates the varying quality and accessibility of fossil fuel deposits. High-quality, easily accessible deposits are at the top, like those in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. As you move down the pyramid, deposits become lower quality and harder to access, making production more challenging and costly. Deposits at the bottom may be extensive but of poor quality or diffuse. The resource pyramid shows the varying quality and accessibility of fossil fuel deposits. Deposits at the bottom, like oil shale and methane hydrates, contain massive amounts of oil and gas but are difficult to produce economically due to poor accessibility and difficult recovery. The economic threshold for production at lower levels of the pyramid is influenced by commodity prices and new extraction technologies. Many high-quality, easy-to-find deposits in the U.S. have already been produced, with current proved reserves including deposits that are challenging to produce. The resource pyramid illustrates the varying quality and accessibility of fossil fuel deposits. Lower quality deposits like oil shale and methane hydrates contain significant amounts of oil and gas but are challenging to produce economically. Current proved reserves include deposits that are difficult to access but still viable under current market conditions. The production of these lower-level deposits depends on factors such as oil prices, production costs, and technological advancements. Similar relationships exist for natural gas and coal. Energy statistics reveal various terms used to describe fossil fuel amounts, each with precise definitions. The vocabulary of terms developed over the decades to describe fossil fuel deposits includes Proved reserves, Probable reserves, Possible reserves, Unproved reserves, Demonstrated reserve base, Undiscovered resources, Probable resources, Possible resources, Speculative resources, Potential resources, Technically recoverable resources, and Economically recoverable resources. Definitions for these terms can be found in the Appendix. The key distinctions in statistical reporting of oil and natural gas are between proved reserves and undiscovered resources, as well as between conventional and unconventional deposits. Proved reserves are the confirmed amounts of fossil fuels, while undiscovered resources are potential reserves. Understanding these terms is crucial for accurate statistical energy data. Proved reserves are defined as discovered and economically recoverable amounts of oil, natural gas, or coal, confirmed by drilling or other measures. These reserves are reported to the Energy Information Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission by private companies in the United States. The proportion of oil qualifying as proved reserves increases with high prices and decreases with low prices. The term \"undiscovered resources\" refers to estimated amounts of oil and gas in unexplored areas based on geologic characteristics. Price increases can make previously sub-economic oil reserves economically viable, leading to an increase in total proved reserves. The term \"undiscovered technically recoverable resources\" (UTRR) estimates potential oil and gas reserves based on geologic studies and current technology, without considering cost. These estimates are further refined to determine economically recoverable resources for an area. Undiscovered resources assessments are conducted on land and offshore by regulatory agencies. The precision and accuracy of reported statistics vary based on data availability. Estimates are based on current production practices and are reported as undiscovered technically recoverable resources. Another term used is \"in-place\" resources, representing all oil, gas, or coal in a formation without considering recoverability. Research in the 1980s and 1990s revealed a significant amount of hydrocarbons in the Williston Basin, with estimates of 271 to 503 billion barrels of oil. However, these numbers only represent \"in-place\" oil, highlighting the discrepancy between in-place resources and technically recoverable amounts. The Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin contains 3.65 billion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and 1.85 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered technically recoverable natural gas. Production in the area is increasing due to new production technologies. The gap between in-place oil estimates and technically recoverable oil highlights the importance of accurate resource assessments. The importance of knowing the numbers representing oil and technically recoverable oil is highlighted by the discovery of oil and gas deposits in porous reservoirs capped by impervious rock traps. Conventional deposits, containing natural gas, oil, and water in layered arrangements within a reservoir, have historically provided most of the produced oil and natural gas. Geologists have also found significant volumes of oil and natural gas outside conventional reservoirs in sedimentary rocks. Unconventional oil and gas deposits are found in sedimentary rocks outside conventional reservoirs. These deposits are widespread but not in discrete reservoirs, making recovery difficult and costly. Examples include oil sands, requiring special technologies for extraction, and coalbed methane, where gas is distributed throughout coal pores. Unconventional natural gas deposits, such as coalbed methane and shale gas, are found in sedimentary rocks and can be economically recoverable. Coalbed methane production accounted for approximately 8% of total U.S. natural gas production in 2009. There is no direct correlation between the economic recoverability of a deposit and whether it is conventional or unconventional. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) was created in response to the energy crises of the 1970s, with the statutory responsibility of monitoring and reporting U.S. energy reserves and production. The Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 mandated the creation of the FEA to collect and disseminate energy-related information. The FEA was created by laws to collect and analyze energy information, provide projections to the government and public, and assess oil and gas resources. The USGS is responsible for assessing onshore oil and gas resources in the US. The USGS updates assessments of oil and gas resources regularly, while the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management handles offshore resources. Various expert groups also provide perspectives on different fuels and geographic areas. The National Research Council, professional societies like AAPG or SPE, provide expertise in assessing oil and gas reserves. Clear methodology explanations are crucial for accurate estimates. The BP Statistical Review compiles data from authoritative sources globally. The World Energy compilation provides data on oil, natural gas, coal, and other energy sources. U.S. proved reserves of crude oil total 22.3 billion barrels as of the end of 2009. The process of compiling oil reserves involves significant changes in individual components each year due to exploration, production, and business processes. The U.S. proved reserves of dry natural gas totaled 272.5 tcf in 2009, excluding the increases from shale gas in 2010 and 2011. The compilation of gas reserves involves tracking various production and adjustments, including onshore and offshore reserves. The USGS and BOEMRE assess undiscovered technically recoverable resources of oil and natural gas, using different methodologies. Geologic data availability may be limited, especially for offshore areas. Estimates are complementary and tabulated in Table 1 and Table 2. The USGS and BOEMRE provide estimates for undiscovered oil and natural gas resources, with USGS distinguishing between conventional and unconventional resources. The total technically recoverable oil and gas for the United States is calculated by combining proved reserves from EIA with undiscovered resources from USGS and MMS. The total technically recoverable natural gas does not include much of the emerging shale gas being explored in the US. The total \"future supply\" of natural gas in the United States is 2,074 tcf, including substantial volumes of shale gas. Oil shale is the most abundant fossil fuel after coal, but production is not yet commercially viable due to high costs and unique chemical composition of the liquids produced. Oil shale primarily serves as a source for jet fuel or diesel oil, which are in high demand nationally. Efforts to aid in the development of oil shale are focused on pilot projects to test alternative technologies of production. Estimates suggest approximately 1.38 trillion barrels of shale oil are potentially recoverable from federal oil shale resources. Shale gas is an emerging type of natural gas deposit, with estimates of 800 billion barrels potentially recoverable from federal oil shale resources. Production methods are improving, including horizontal drilling and hydrofracturing to release the gas from low-permeability shale formations. Environmental concerns have been raised due to the injection of large amounts of fluids during hydrofracturing. Shale gas development raises environmental concerns such as water injection, chemical composition, disposal of production fluids, and potential seismic activity. Industry officials believe these concerns can be managed through careful practices. Shale gas reserves are increasing in the U.S., but exact figures are hard to determine due to the evolving nature of the sector. Energy Information Administration notes that estimates of recoverable shale gas will change with new drilling and production data. Estimates of technically and economically recoverable shale gas resources in the United States have increased significantly over the past decade due to advancements in drilling technology. The Potential Gas Committee estimates that the U.S. has 616 tcf of potential natural gas resources in shale formations. However, the actual production of this resource will depend on further exploration and development. The EIA has increased projections for shale gas production in its 2011 Annual Energy Outlook. Methane hydrate, a potential fossil fuel resource, is being investigated by the DOE and USGS. Methane hydrate is a crystalline solid composed of methane and water found in specific conditions in offshore sediments or rocks. Methane hydrates, once considered a scientific oddity, are now known to exist in numerous locations worldwide, with total resources estimated to be massive. Efforts by various countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, and India, are focused on developing technologies to exploit this abundant natural gas source. The US alone has an estimated 320,000 tcf of gas hydrate resources, with significant portions offshore Alaska and beneath the continental margins. The USGS also estimates 85 tcf of undiscovered gas resources in northern Alaska within gas hydrates. Improved technology and understanding of recoverable gas resources in gas hydrates in northern Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico may make methane hydrates a viable future natural gas source. Heavy oil deposits in Canada and Venezuela, such as the Athabasca and Orinoco oil sands, contain substantial amounts of oil, with Canada's oil sands alone estimated to hold 173 billion barrels of recoverable oil. The United States has approximately 270 billion barrels of technically recoverable extra heavy oil, mainly found in California, Alaska, and Wyoming. Production of heavy oil in the US is declining due to production costs. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is the main source for coal reserves and resources data in the US, compiling information from state and federal sources, including the US Geological Survey (USGS). The primary statistic reported by EIA for coal is the demonstrated reserve base (DRB). The US demonstrated reserve base (DRB) for coal in 2009 was 486 billion short tons, providing potentially hundreds of years' supply. However, due to ground disturbance and other factors, only 261 billion short tons are actually available for mining. Availability studies by the USGS have shown limitations in recoverable coal amounts. The USGS availability studies have shown that the economically recoverable coal may be significantly less than the technically recoverable amount due to various restrictions, such as technical constraints and societal/environmental limitations. Regional mine planning and economic studies are necessary to estimate coal reserves accurately. In one specific case in Wyoming, only 47% of the in-place coal is technically recoverable. In Wyoming, only about 6% of the in-place coal is economically recoverable, with proportions varying between 5% and 20% in different coal-mining areas. Converting different types of fossil fuels for comparison is common, with oil measured in barrels, natural gas in cubic feet, and coal in short tons. The availability of economically recoverable coal is often less than technically recoverable due to various constraints. Converting different types of fossil fuels for comparison is common, with varying heat content making calculations slightly problematic. Rule-of-thumb measures are used for conversions, such as EIA's tool assuming specific heat contents. These conversions allow expressing natural gas and coal units in barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). The values presented in Table 4 for U.S. energy reserves are approximations due to the variability in heat content and availability of reliable data. Undiscovered resources outside the United States are limited and data may not be accurate due to lack of good geologic data. Different methods and terminology used in each country make it difficult to collect uniform data. Reliable estimates of undiscovered oil and natural gas resources internationally are lacking since 2000. The U.S. Geological Survey completed its World Petroleum Assessment in 2000, providing reliable data on proved reserves and production in all countries. The International Energy Agency gathers production statistics for OPEC and OECD countries, while the EIA relies on industry publications like Oil & Gas Journal and World Oil for international oil and gas reserves information. OGJ compiles estimates of proved reserves from official sources, including government agencies and ministries. The curr_chunk discusses the sources of data used by World Oil for their tables, including governmental agencies and operating companies with drilling programs. The survey is not scientifically randomized, and proxies like rig counts are used when countries do not respond. BP Statistical Review of World Energy is a commonly used global oil and gas information source. The BP Statistical Review of World Energy estimates proved reserves using data from various official sources and organizations like OPEC, Cedigaz, and World Oil. This approach includes field condensate, natural gas liquids, and Canadian oil sands 'under active development' as proxies for proved reserves. The Review also uses data from the World Energy Council for coal reserves. The WEC estimates oil and natural gas reserves for different countries, aligning closely with other sources like the Oil & Gas Journal and World Oil. The U.S. Energy Association (USEA) serves as the WEC national committee for the United States, relying on EIA sources for estimates. Users should be aware of the data sources when using international fossil fuel statistics. Comparing total fossil fuel endowments across nations, the United States ranks high in proved reserves of all fossil fuels combined. The United States ranks high in proved reserves of all fossil fuels combined, with over 92% of its reserves being coal. Estimates for technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources have greater uncertainty, but adding undiscovered resources provides a more complete estimate of total endowment. Undiscovered coal resources data is inconsistent across nations. The United States has significant coal reserves, with estimates of potentially massive undiscovered coal deposits in northwestern Alaska. These inaccessible deposits are estimated to be over 3,200 billion short tons. This suggests that there may be other undiscovered fossil fuel deposits worldwide. The U.S. fossil energy endowment is primarily coal, but this proportion may change with the identification of new tight oil and shale gas deposits. Comparing fossil fuel endowments among nations would include these factors. The comparison of fossil fuel endowments among nations includes important deposits of oil, natural gas, and coal that may be exploited in the future. However, the uncertainty in estimating these deposits makes meaningful comparisons difficult. The United States has significant fossil fuel reserves, both conventional and unconventional, but other nations likely have similar deposits without comprehensive assessments. The comparison of global fossil fuel resources among nations is challenging due to differences in definitions, data collection, and transparency. Estimates should be viewed as rough approximations based on available data, and an absence of data can lead to imprecise and inaccurate estimates. As data becomes available through exploration and development, rankings of national endowments may change. Estimates of fossil fuel resources can vary based on available data from exploration and development. The United States, being well-studied, may have larger estimates compared to less explored regions. Rankings of national endowments can change over time as different areas are explored. Production and consumption data for oil, natural gas, and coal in the United States are provided in Table 7. For a more detailed overview of U.S. energy supply and demand, refer to CRS Report R40187. Proved reserves are quantities of hydrocarbons estimated to be commercially recoverable from known accumulations under current economic conditions. Reserves are anticipated quantities of hydrocarbon resources to be recovered from known accumulations. Reserves appreciation is the observed incremental increase in estimates over time. The curr_chunk discusses reserves appreciation, resources, undiscovered resources, undiscovered technically recoverable resources (UTRR), and undiscovered economically recoverable resources (UERR). It explains the incremental increase in estimates of reserves over time and the potential for discovering and recovering oil and gas outside of known fields. The curr_chunk explains unproved reserves as quantities of hydrocarbon resources assessed based on geologic and engineering information, with uncertainty preventing classification as proved reserves. Key terms used in oil and natural gas statistics are also discussed."
