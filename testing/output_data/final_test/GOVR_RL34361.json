    "content": "Automated political calls are used to provide information about candidates, urge voters to go to the polls, announce events, and solicit campaign volunteers. They are cost-effective for reaching a large number of voters quickly, playing a crucial role in get-out-the-vote efforts. Critics argue that the calls are intrusive, convey negative information, and lack transparency in terms of identifying those responsible. Regulations do not require detailed reporting on these calls, and there is limited scholarly attention on campaign tactics and political consulting. Automated political calls are a prominent campaign tactic, but receive limited scholarly attention. Legislation on the issue has been quieter in the 111th Congress compared to the 110th Congress. Concerns surround how the calls are used rather than the calls themselves. Automated political calls are a significant campaign tactic, with Congress having various options for addressing them. These options include maintaining the status quo, gathering more data, encouraging voluntary changes, requiring policy changes such as adding calls to the do not call list, or imposing disclosure requirements. The focus is on how these calls are used during campaigns. Automated political calls are used during campaigns for various purposes, including announcing meetings, gathering constituent input, and providing information on federal programs. Members of Congress find official automated calls useful, but there is a desire to limit unwanted campaign calls while preserving official ones. Automated political calls are subject to little federal regulation, with approximately 20 states restricting or banning such calls. FCC and FEC regulations differ in their restrictions on automated political calls. FEC regulations apply to political committees engaged in express advocacy, while FCC regulations apply to all prerecorded or automated calls. Both agencies require identifying information in automated political calls. The FTC's National Do Not Call Registry exempts political calls, allowing individuals on the registry to still receive them. FECA does not specifically address automated political calls. The FEC has determined that various requirements related to political advertising apply to automated political calls. Messages from telephone banks paid for by authorized political committees must contain a disclaimer stating the committee paid for the communication. Messages not authorized by candidate committees must clearly state that a candidate committee is not responsible for the call and provide the full contact information of the person who paid for the communication. The FEC requires disclaimers on automated political calls, including those paid for by political committees, to identify the sponsor. Other entities engaging in express advocacy or fundraising related to federal candidates may also need disclaimers. Non-political committee entities not engaging in such activities may not fall under FEC jurisdiction. Automated political calls proposing election or defeat of federal candidates require disclaimers identifying the sponsor. However, FEC disclaimer requirements may not apply to calls not sponsored by political committees or not engaging in express advocacy or fundraising for federal candidates. FEC also requires political committees to report spending details, including disbursements over $200 to a single source. Political committees are not required to use specific terminology when itemizing expenditures, as long as descriptions are specific enough. FEC guidance does not specify how automated political calls should be described in expenditure reports, giving committees freedom to characterize their expenditures. FEC reports may not indicate the amount spent on automated calls or whether they were purchased at all. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) prohibits automated calls to certain phone lines, including cell phones and residential lines with prerecorded messages, except for non-commercial purposes like political campaigns. The TCPA prohibits automated calls with prerecorded messages to certain phone lines, except for non-commercial purposes like political campaigns. Prerecorded calls must identify the caller and provide a contact number without additional fees. Time restrictions for telephone solicitations do not apply to certain calls. Automated calls by tax-exempt non-profit organizations, including political committees, are exempt from certain time restrictions and technical requirements. These calls can be used strategically in political campaigns to mobilize voters, solicit input, and encourage grassroots engagement. Automated calls are a cost-effective way to reach voters quickly, but there are concerns about their impact due to a saturation of calls before elections. Campaign strategists and telemarketing firms are typically involved in the decision-making and implementation of these calls. Professional political consultants also specialize in automated calls, but tracking the profession is challenging due to the diverse titles and self-employment nature of consultants. Tracking the profession of automated political calls is difficult due to diverse titles and self-employment nature of consultants. A legislative working group identified 129 firms, with only 10-20 being professional political consulting firms. Voter contact is a small subset of the political consulting industry. Automated political calls are a small subset of the political consulting industry, with limited specialized firms. Computer technology is making it easier for non-specialists to enter the field, but technical issues may arise due to lack of professional knowledge. The total cost of automated political calls is publicly unavailable, but estimates suggest significant spending by congressional campaign committees. FEC data on spending is often unclear, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and other committees being potential sources for examining expenditures. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and other party committees do not publicize detailed information about their spending on automated political calls. FEC reports lack clarity on the amount spent on such calls, with no specific mention of terms like \"automated calls\" or \"robo calls.\" Approximately $8.6 million was spent on activities labeled as \"telemarketing,\" but it is uncertain how much of this was allocated to automated calls. The DCCC accounted for a significant portion of these expenses, indicating a lack of transparency from other committees. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and other party committees do not provide detailed information on their spending for automated political calls. FEC reports do not specify the amount spent on such calls, with approximately $8.6 million labeled as \"telemarketing.\" The DCCC accounted for a significant portion of these expenses, indicating a lack of transparency from other committees. Automated political calls spending data is elusive, with party committees providing some insight. Despite limitations, automated calls are on the rise as a campaign tactic, with 44% of voters receiving robo-calls in states with primaries. Limited data from the 2008 cycle shows their significant role. Automated political calls usage increased during the 2008 primary election cycle, with over 40% of voters receiving robo-calls in Iowa and New Hampshire. In the 2006 campaign, 64% of registered voters received automated political calls, making it the second-most-common voter contact method. Automated political calls are prevalent among voters, with Republicans slightly more likely than Democrats to receive them. However, data lacks specifics on the purpose of these calls, such as increasing turnout or swaying undecided voters. There is little systematic information on voter reactions to these calls, but anecdotal evidence suggests strong public disdain for them. Anecdotal accounts show public frustration with automated political calls, with some voters receiving up to 20 calls in a day during the 2006 elections. In Missouri, the Attorney General received over 600 complaints about these calls. Citizens for Civil Discourse established a National Political Do Not Contact Registry in response to public aggravation. Automated political calls, particularly robo calls, have minimal effect on voter turnout according to research by political scientists Donald P. Green and Alan S. Gerber. Despite anecdotal examples, experiments have not been able to distinguish their effects from zero. Additional research is needed to understand the impact of negative information in calls on turnout and other forms of campaign engagement. The FEC enforces FECA requirements but campaigns often respond to misconduct with political advertising or media scrutiny instead of formal enforcement. Few complaints are received about automated political calls, and enforcement cases are limited. The FEC closed 8 enforcement cases on automated political calls out of 476 Matters Under Review between October 2003 and February 2008. The number of MURs related to automated calls did not significantly increase during the 2008 election cycle. The AAPC, a professional trade association, could also take enforcement action on automated political calls. The AAPC does not explicitly address automated political calls but condemns false or misleading attacks on opponents and encourages documenting criticisms. Enforcement cases are rare and minimally effective, with details unavailable. Legislation in Congress could affect automated political calls. Congress received a floor vote on bills related to regulating automated political calls, with options including adding calls to the do not call list, revising disclosure requirements, or regulating calls generally. The Committee on House Administration discussed the topic in a hearing, considering constitutional restrictions and the value of official automated calls for town hall meetings. Automated calls for telephone-based town hall meetings were discussed in a Senate hearing on S. 2624 in 2008. The possibility of regulating these calls was debated, but no substantial action was taken during the 111th Congress. Congress could choose to regulate automated political calls or not, with various options and considerations to weigh. Some believe the benefits of automated calls outweigh the negatives and may prefer no additional regulation. Automated political calls provide important information to voters and are used for last-minute attacks and official communications. Congress may choose to maintain the status quo, allowing states to regulate further. Limited information is available on the frequency, cost, impact, and legality of these calls, with gaps in data from the 2008 election cycle. The use of automated calls during the 2008 election cycle lacks information, hindering the ability to address policy issues. Federal agencies like the FCC and FEC do not maintain statistics on consumer complaints about these calls. Congress could request agencies to collect and release data on automated-calls complaints and encourage more research on public reactions. Encouraging more research on public reactions to automated political calls could provide clarity on whether they are a significant policy concern. Lawmakers may feel additional research is unnecessary due to their involvement in campaigns. Gathering more information could lead to a more precise policy response, although it may be a lengthy process if data is requested over a long period by Congress. If Congress determines that concerns about automated political calls are more about their usage than the calls themselves, they could encourage voluntary changes without the need for legislative action. This approach could involve practitioners releasing more information about their calls, limiting the number or timing of calls, or reducing criticism of opponents. There is no clear standard for objectionable content or call frequency, making it challenging to address subjective concerns precisely. Congress may avoid legislation by encouraging practitioners to voluntarily change their behavior regarding automated political calls. Existing norms among political consultants do not necessarily address this issue, and professional enforcement cases are rare. Without legislative or regulatory action, there are few incentives for change. If Congress chooses to encourage voluntary changes, it must carefully consider which behaviors to address. Congress could require political committees to report more information about how automated political calls are used in campaigns, as current FEC regulations lack detail on these expenses. Legislative action or FEC rulemaking would be needed to mandate specific terms or categories for reporting. In 2006, the FEC reconsidered its regulations on this matter. The FEC considered requiring more detailed reporting on phone bank services in 2006 but ultimately decided against it. Congress could push for more specificity on reporting automated political calls by amending FECA or encouraging the FEC to revisit its regulations. This would enhance transparency on campaign spending. Requiring detailed information about automated political calls could enhance transparency in campaign spending, but it may conflict with current regulations. Congress could extend disclosure requirements to non-political committees to ensure all organizations responsible for the calls are included. Additional enforcement measures or increased disclaimer requirements for automated political calls could also be considered. Additional disclaimer requirements for automated political calls may not necessarily ensure truthful information from those intent on breaking the law. Congress could consider requiring additional disclaimers for \"outside groups\" or individuals sponsoring calls that do not explicitly call for election or defeat of federal candidates. Congress could potentially expand disclaimer requirements for automated political calls by amending the definition of \"political committee\" in FECA or imposing additional regulations on all entities making automated calls. This could raise broader issues regarding campaign finance regulation and distinguishing between campaign speech and policy-oriented speech. Some bills have proposed adding political calls to the national do not call list to allow consumers to opt out, without necessarily affecting the content of the calls. Adding political calls to the national do not call list could be a quick solution, avoiding complications with other policy options. However, constitutional questions may arise, and this approach would not address concerns about the content of the calls. Congress could also consider limiting the hours of automated political calls or restricting the number of calls to a single recipient. Several states have already implemented similar restrictions. The AAPC recommends limiting the number of automated political calls to a single recipient and placing restrictions on the number of calls made in a day. This could reduce the volume of calls voters receive, but challenges include determining acceptable call limits and hours. However, this may not decrease call frequency in competitive campaign states. The AAPC recommends limiting automated political calls to a single recipient and placing restrictions on the number of calls made in a day. Constitutional considerations regarding speech issues are discussed, emphasizing that political calls are protected under the First Amendment and must pass strict scrutiny to be considered constitutional. Regulations banning automated political calls must serve a compelling government interest and be the least restrictive alternative. The First Amendment protects a speaker's right to advocate their cause using the most effective means of political discourse. Laws restricting political speech, such as bans on automated dialing systems or prerecorded messages, are subject to strict scrutiny and must serve a compelling government interest. Accordingly, a ban on automated dialing systems for political calls may be considered an impermissible burden on free speech rights. Governments can impose reasonable restrictions on speech as long as they are content-neutral, narrowly tailored, serve a significant government interest, and provide alternative channels for communication. Laws that shift the time, place, or manner of speech are likely to be upheld if alternative channels for communication are available. Restrictions on the use of automated telephone dialers or prerecorded messages must be content-neutral to qualify for less strict scrutiny. A ban that only targets political calls could be seen as content-based and subject to strict scrutiny. Little case law exists on this issue, with one federal court upholding a ban on automated dialing systems in Indiana. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's decision on a statute banning automated dialing systems, finding it constitutional as a content-neutral restriction on speech. The court held that the statute did not violate the First Amendment and should have abstained from deciding the case due to important state interests. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed a district court decision on a statute banning automated dialing systems, deeming it constitutional as a content-neutral speech restriction. The court found that the statute did not violate the First Amendment and should have deferred to state courts due to important state interests. The case is now pending in Brown County Circuit Court, Indiana, regarding the application of Indiana's Auto-Dialer Law to all calls, including political ones. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the statute applies to all autodialer calls but did not address its constitutionality under the First Amendment. Automated political calls reach a majority of American voters, are common during federal campaigns, and involve significant spending by political committees. The FEC has received few complaints about automated political calls since 2003, despite public disdain. Congress has considered bills to regulate these calls, with options including maintaining the status quo, gathering more data, encouraging voluntary changes, or adding political calls to the do not call framework. The report discusses potential policy changes for regulating automated political calls, including adding them to the do not call framework, restricting timing or number of calls, and requiring additional disclosure. Limited data and scholarly literature on automated political calls pose challenges for regulation. Limited academic research exists on automated political calls, with a focus on campaign strategists rather than technical service vendors. The CRS employed a broad research strategy to gather information, consulting with various political entities and conducting keyword searches in databases. The CRS conducted research on automated political calls by consulting political entities, analyzing FEC data, and conducting interviews with political consultants. Internet research revealed blog references to unethical campaign practices, but this information was not included in the analysis."
