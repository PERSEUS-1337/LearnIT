    "content": "The Act titled \"Keep American Jobs from Going Down the Drain Act\" requires the use of American materials in public water systems. Section 1452(a) of the Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to require the use of American materials in public water system projects funded by State loan funds. Waivers can be granted by the Administrator in consultation with the State Governor. The Administrator can waive the requirement for American materials in public water system projects if it is against the public interest, if the materials are not sufficiently produced in the US, or if their inclusion would increase project costs by over 25%. Waivers require public notification and written justification. The Administrator must provide public notice and opportunity to comment before waiving the requirement for American materials in public water system projects. A detailed written justification must be published in the Federal Register upon issuing such waiver. The paragraph must be applied consistently with international agreements. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT FOR USE OF AMERICAN MATERIALS IN TREATMENT WORKS. Title VI Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include a new section 607 mandating the use of American materials. The Administrator must provide public notice and justification before waiving this requirement for public water system projects. The funds from a State water pollution control revolving fund cannot be used for treatment works construction unless the steel, iron, and goods used are made in the US. Waivers can be granted if it's in the public interest, or if US-made goods are not available at a reasonable cost. The cost of a project in the United States will increase by more than 25 percent if US-made steel, iron, and goods are required. Waivers for using non-US goods can be granted with public notification and written justification. The section must align with US international agreements."
