This credit is outlined in section 45N of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The excessive fuel cost credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim the excess fuel cost paid for creditable fuel used in their trade or business.

The excessive fuel cost credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim the excess fuel cost paid for creditable fuel used in their trade or business. The applicable Labor Day 2004 price for fuel is determined by the Secretary and adjusted for inflation using data from the Energy Information Agency. The inflation adjustment is based on the monthly Consumer Price Index to reflect current inflation more accurately. Eligible taxpayers are defined for this purpose. The term 'eligible taxpayer' refers to individuals engaged in farming, commercial fishing, or small businesses with up to 50 employees. 'Creditable fuel' includes gasoline and diesel fuel. The text discusses eligible taxpayers who can elect a standard mileage allowance instead of a fuel credit for gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, and natural gas. The standard mileage rate is set at 60 cents per mile traveled. The section applies to fuels purchased within a 2-year period. The credit is part of the general business credit.
