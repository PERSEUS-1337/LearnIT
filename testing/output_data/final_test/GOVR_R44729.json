    "content": "The House of Representatives adopted an amendment to House Rule XII requiring Members to state the constitutional basis for proposed legislation. The Constitutional Authority Statement rule has been in place for nine years and continues to be a topic of debate. This report provides an overview of Congress's powers and its role in interpreting the Constitution, specifically addressing House Rule XII, clause 7(c). The report discusses House Rule XII, clause 7(c), its requirements, legal effects, and value debate. It also covers trends in recent CAS practices and provides considerations for drafting CASs. Tables 1 and 2 list commonly cited constitutional provisions and suggested authorities for legislation. Understanding the CAS rule requires knowledge of Congress's constitutional powers and role in interpretation to prevent tyranny. The federal Constitution divides government power among three branches to prevent the accumulation of power in one branch. Congress exercises legislative power, the President executive power, and federal courts judicial power. Congress must not give up its legislative power or attempt to take on executive or judicial powers. All branches' powers are limited by the Constitution. The Constitution vests legislative powers in Congress, limited to enumerated powers. Congress's powers are primarily found in Section 8 of Article I, including the power to impose taxes, regulate commerce, and provide for the common defense and general welfare. The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce, establish laws on naturalization and bankruptcy, regulate currency, promote science and arts, establish a judicial system, and make decisions on wartime and military matters. Additionally, Congress has the authority to declare war, provide for an Army and Navy, and regulate state public acts and records. The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce, establish laws on naturalization and bankruptcy, regulate currency, promote science and arts, establish a judicial system, and make decisions on wartime and military matters. Article V authorizes Congress to propose amendments to the Constitution, with some amendments explicitly restricting Congress's power while others empower Congress to enforce provisions such as prohibiting slavery and protecting civil rights. The Necessary and Proper Clause in Article I, Section 8 supplements Congress's enumerated powers by allowing the adoption of measures to assist in achieving legislative goals. The Necessary and Proper Clause in Article I, Section 8 grants Congress broad power to adopt laws necessary for executing its enumerated powers, providing flexibility in choosing means to achieve legislative goals. The Supreme Court has upheld legislation like criminalizing perjury and witness tampering under this clause. The Supreme Court has upheld legislation criminalizing perjury and witness tampering as an extension of Congress's power to constitute federal tribunals. Legislation prohibiting bribery of officials who receive federal funds is also upheld as an extension of Congress's power to appropriate federal moneys for the general welfare. The Necessary and Proper Clause does not grant Congress independent power but allows it to use all means necessary to carry out specifically granted powers. The Necessary and Proper Clause authorizes Congress to rely on its Article I, \u00a7 8 powers or other powers vested in the Constitution to legislate. Congress can enact laws to support the execution of powers given to other branches of the federal government. The Constitution imposes limitations on Congress's powers through enumerated powers and internal limits. The Supreme Court interprets Congress's powers as restricted by the terms of their express grant, such as in United States v. Lopez where limits to the Commerce Clause were determined. Congress cannot enact legislation prohibiting possession of guns near a school without a connection to commercial activity. The Court also requires \"congruence and proportionality\" in the Fourteenth Amendment's Enforcement Clause. In City of Boerne v. Flores, the Supreme Court found that Congress exceeded its enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment by enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which invalidated state laws imposing a substantial burden on religious practices. The Court concluded that RFRA intruded on states' traditional authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens. The Supreme Court found in City of Boerne v. Flores that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) exceeded Congress's enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court concluded that RFRA intruded on states' traditional authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens. Additionally, the Constitution imposes external constraints on congressional action, such as specific prohibitions listed in Article I, Section 9. The Constitution imposes constraints on Congress's powers, including federalism, separation of powers, and individual rights. Federalism limits the federal government's jurisdiction to preserve states' prerogatives. The Tenth Amendment prevents the federal government from commandeering state officials. The Constitution imposes constraints on Congress's powers, including federalism and separation of powers. Federalism limits the federal government's jurisdiction to preserve states' prerogatives, preventing commandeering of state officials. Separation of powers ensures proper allocation of authority among the three branches of government, preventing one branch from aggrandizing its power. For example, the President has the authority to appoint principal officers with the Senate's advice and consent. The Supreme Court has struck down laws that violate the Appointments Clause and individual rights, including the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech. In United States v. Alvarez, a law criminalizing false claims of military honors was deemed unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has invalidated laws infringing on individual rights, such as the First Amendment's freedom of speech, including a law criminalizing false claims of military honors. The Court has emphasized its role in interpreting the Constitution and overturning unconstitutional acts of other branches of government. The Marbury case established the judiciary's role in interpreting the Constitution and striking down incompatible laws. However, it did not explicitly state that the judiciary has the final say in defining the federal government's powers and limits. Throughout U.S. history, all branches of government have been involved in constitutional interpretation, with Congress and the Executive challenging the Supreme Court's rulings. The Marbury case affirmed the judiciary's power to interpret the Constitution in specific cases. Congress and the President were not hindered in their interpretation of the Constitution. In the early days of the United States, there was debate over the constitutional limitations on legislation. However, in the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court began asserting judicial supremacy in interpreting the Constitution. The Supreme Court asserted judicial supremacy, claiming to be the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, with interpretations by other branches lacking the same authority. This view promotes stability and uniformity in constitutional interpretation. The Court's decision in Cooper supports judicial supremacy in constitutional interpretation, elevating the Court's role above that of Congress. While some argue for a more robust role for Congress in interpretation, the Court's views on the Constitution have gained prominence in modern times. In recent decades, legal scholars and government officials have criticized judicial supremacy in constitutional interpretation, advocating for Congress and others outside the judicial branch to have the authority to interpret the Constitution. This is supported by the requirement for Members of Congress to understand and interpret the Constitution in their work, as well as the presumption of constitutionality given to laws passed by Congress. The CAS rule, part of House rules since 2011, requires Members of Congress to engage in constitutional interpretation during the legislative process to prevent a vacuum in constitutional dialogue. This is important as government officials must adhere to the Constitution and its meaning. The CAS rule, adopted in 2011, requires Members of Congress to include a statement citing the specific powers granted to Congress in the Constitution when introducing a bill or joint resolution. This statement accompanies the legislation and must be submitted at the time of introduction. The CAS rule, adopted in 2011, requires Members of Congress to include a statement citing specific powers granted by the Constitution when introducing a bill or joint resolution. The rule does not specify a format or level of detail for these statements, but the House Committee on Rules provided guidance with five examples of citations to constitutional authority. The CAS rule, adopted in 2011, requires Members of Congress to include a statement citing specific powers granted by the Constitution when introducing a bill or joint resolution. The guidance suggests that compliant CASs should discuss the constitutional authority empowering Congress to enact legislation, without needing to address external constraints on Congress's powers. For example, a compliant CAS for a bill could cite the Commerce Clause or Amendment X of the United States Constitution. The Rules Committee guidance allows Members of Congress significant discretion in determining compliance with the CAS rule, which requires citing specific constitutional powers when introducing a bill. Members may cite the Commerce Clause or Amendment X, but even citing the Tenth Amendment could suffice. Ultimately, it is the bill sponsor's responsibility to choose the authorities to cite. The Rules Committee guidance gives Members of Congress discretion in complying with the CAS rule, which requires citing constitutional powers when introducing a bill. Studies show Members have leeway in crafting CASs, with the House clerk verifying justifications rather than judging their adequacy. In 2011, Professor Volokh found that some CASs provided detailed explanations of constitutional ramifications, while others were less specific in identifying Congress's powers. A study of CASs from January 2011 to January 2012 showed similar findings, with 15% relying solely on Article I, Section 8. The House clerk verifies CAS justifications without judging their adequacy. In 2017 and 2019, CRS analyzed statements from the 114th and 115th Congresses, respectively. Most CASs cited specific clauses in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. Some CASs referenced Supreme Court case law to support bills. In 2016 and 2018, CRS found that statements accompanying legislation often cited constitutional provisions that constrain Congress, with few explaining how they empower it. The most common citation was to Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The House Republican Study Committee and Volokh studies of the 112th Congress found that recently submitted Rule XII statements frequently cited specific clauses of the Constitution, raising questions about historical interpretations and court rulings. Many statements referenced Article I of the Constitution, indicating a potential divergence from traditional understandings. Recent CASs frequently cite specific clauses of the Constitution, such as the Necessary and Proper Clause, which allows Congress to make laws necessary for executing enumerated powers. This trend raises questions about historical interpretations and court rulings. The Necessary and Proper Clause is not seen as a general source of power for Congress, but rather authorizes actions incidental to enumerated powers. The General Welfare Clause allows Congress to levy taxes and spend money for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. The Taxing and Spending Clause, also known as the \"General Welfare Clause,\" empowers Congress to spend money collected from taxation to promote the general welfare. This power is tied to spending legislation and is not a general source of power for Congress. The Military Regulation Clause in recent CASs is often cited, but some bills attached to it do not regulate the armed forces specifically. This misinterpretation stems from isolating the clause's first phrase, which is inconsistent with traditional views that it pertains solely to Congress's power over the military. The Military Regulation Clause is often misinterpreted in recent CASs, with some bills not specifically regulating the armed forces. This misinterpretation stems from isolating the clause's first phrase, potentially transforming it into an open-ended police power, contrary to the Framers' intentions. The Appropriations Clause, cited in several CASs, allows Congress to provide money for projects but does not grant any affirmative power. The Appropriations Clause functions as a restriction on the federal government's powers, ensuring that spending is authorized by statute and making Congress's control over the purse exclusive. The Bill of Rights is occasionally cited to support Congress's legislative power, although it does not grant any affirmative authority. The Bill of Rights consists of \"negative rights\" protecting individuals from government conduct, often prohibiting congressional action. To support individual liberties, Congress can rely on affirmative powers in Article I, Section 8 or the enforcement power of the Fourteenth Amendment. The House Rules Committee suggests citing provisions explicitly granting power to Congress. A CAS can be used to identify constitutional principles in proposed legislation, but it has limited legal significance as it is not formally part of a bill. It is a statement by the sponsor and does not require approval by both houses of Congress or the President. CASs are a type of legislative history material that describe a single Member's initial thoughts on Congress's power to enact a bill. While they can be used to identify constitutional principles in proposed legislation, CASs have limited legal significance and are not formally part of a bill. Courts generally view CASs as weak forms of legislative history and have independently evaluated the constitutionality of legislation, disregarding the CAS in their decisions. Critics have argued for the repeal of the CAS rule, stating that it is symbolic and has little impact on congressional debate about Congress's authority under the Constitution. Some believe that Congress lacks the capacity to interpret the Constitution effectively, as evidenced by the limited use and significance of CASs in legal decisions. The CAS rule is seen as a means for Congress to engage in constitutional interpretation, with proponents highlighting benefits such as self-monitoring and a limited form of constitutional interpretation. Critics argue that the administrative costs outweigh the benefits, and some believe Congress lacks the capacity for effective constitutional interpretation. House Rule XII serves as a self-monitoring mechanism to prevent Congress from overstepping its constitutional powers. Proponents argue that it promotes constitutional dialogue and literacy among Members, encouraging deeper understanding of constitutional interpretation. This rule aims to establish Congress as a co-equal branch of government with a strong grasp of constitutional principles. The House Rule XII aims to establish Congress as a co-equal interpreter of the federal Constitution, enhancing its institutional credibility and reputation by requiring Members to take constitutionality more seriously. This rule addresses concerns about Congress not debating in good faith and abdicating its responsibility to consider constitutionality, serving as a step towards ensuring Members fulfill their obligation to uphold the Constitution. Enhancing the Content of CASs: Suggestions have been made to improve the constitutional dialogue surrounding CASs by requiring more formal and robust debate over the constitutionality of proposed legislation. This includes setting aside time for formal debate on the House floor and requiring more expansive statements that discuss the relationship between the cited provision of the Constitution and the bill itself. Several commentators advocate for the CAS rule to require in-depth discussion of relevant precedents and potential limitations on Congress's power. Supporters argue that Members should ensure CASs comply with both the letter and spirit of the requirement. A proposed version of the CAS rule in the 111th Congress aimed to prevent general citations to clauses like the \"common defense clause\" from being considered sufficient. The proposal to amend the CAS rule in the House aimed to address concerns about the general welfare clause and necessary and proper clause not meeting the specificity requirement. It suggested allowing a Member to challenge the adequacy of a CAS, with the Clerk evaluating the content and adding a note if it did not comply. Additionally, it proposed changes to the CAS process to allow for a special motion to recommit a bill if it failed to follow the rule. Some proponents argue that the CAS rule should apply throughout the legislative process to allow for broader constitutional debate. Currently, only the Member introducing a bill assesses its constitutionality, but there are suggestions to ensure all Members consider constitutional implications before voting on a bill. The CAS rule may be modified to include constitutional objections in the text of a bill, allowing more Members to weigh in on the bill's constitutionality during the legislative process. This approach could formalize the role of the CAS but may raise new concerns about robust discussions on the constitutionality of legislation. The CAS rule may be modified to include constitutional objections in the text of a bill, allowing more Members to weigh in on the bill's constitutionality during the legislative process. This could amplify criticisms about the resources needed for compliance. Additional content requirements for CASs without changes to enforcement could be ignored. Members and staff can use available resources to interpret the Constitution and consider potential constitutional bases for legislation. The Constitution and its amendments contain about 7,500 words. Congress provides pocket versions for Members and staff. Historical documents like Farrand's Records, The Federalist Papers, and Founder's Constitution are available. ConSource offers primary sources related to the creation, ratification, and amendment of the US Constitution. Secondary sources like CONAN and Commentaries on the Constitution provide further explanations and interpretations of the Constitution's clauses. The Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States by Justice Joseph Story, the Interactive Constitution by the National Constitution Center, The Heritage Foundation's Guide to the Constitution, and the American Constitution Society's Keeping Faith With the Constitution offer in-depth analyses and interpretations of the US Constitution. The American Constitution Society's Keeping Faith With the Constitution analyzes the Constitution's text and history to understand how its principles have been interpreted in U.S. history. Table 2 provides suggested citations for CAS drafters to use in legislation submissions. It is important to consider whether the CAS cites a specific clause of the Constitution, as recent CASs have cited entire Articles or sections, but the customary practice is to cite specific clauses. The prevailing customary practice is to cite specific clauses of the Constitution in CASs. While many CASs only cite the Necessary and Proper Clause, it may be beneficial to also cite other enumerated powers for support. CASs should cite clauses that affirmatively empower Congress to take action, such as those in Article I, Section 9 or the Bill of Rights. Table 2 provides helpful resources for drafting legislation submissions. The Bill of Rights outlines limitations on federal government powers, suggesting a broader interpretation of clauses. Members should cite clauses granting Congress affirmative powers, like those in Article I, Section 8. It is important to cite constitutional provisions related to the legislation's subject matter, such as the General Welfare Clause or Military Regulation Clause. Provisions like the General Welfare Clause and Military Regulation Clause may have limitations despite the language of the Constitution. CRS attorneys can provide advice on specific CAS citations. House Rule XII, clause 7(c), requires a statement on legislation's constitutionality when introduced. CAS serves as a starting point for constitutional dialogue on bills. Customarily, CASs provide a short citation to the Constitution granting Congress authority. Further discussions on constitutional issues are not prohibited. Members of Congress can cite sources beyond the text of the Constitution, like Supreme Court case law, to discuss potential restraints on enacting legislation. They can request formal floor debates on constitutionality, engage in dialogue during voting, committee hearings, and reports, and utilize various resources for constitutional debate. Members of Congress have access to resources such as expert witnesses, legal advice from CRS, and constitutional experts to help them participate in constitutional debates and interpret the Constitution. This includes receiving suggestions for legislation or formal opinions on its constitutionality. Members and their staff can engage in ongoing debates over the interpretation of the Constitution, starting with the Congressional Advisory Service."
