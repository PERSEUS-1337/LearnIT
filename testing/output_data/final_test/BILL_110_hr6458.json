    "content": "The Act may be known as the \"Gasoline Savings and Speed Limit Reduction Act of 2008\" and establishes national maximum speed limits. The \"Gasoline Savings and Speed Limit Reduction Act of 2008\" establishes national maximum speed limits, with restrictions on speed limits exceeding 60 mph on highways and 65 mph on the National Highway System outside urbanized areas. The Secretary will not approve projects in states that do not meet these requirements. The \"Gasoline Savings and Speed Limit Reduction Act of 2008\" sets national speed limits, with exceptions for special permits and temporary hazards on highways. Each state must certify compliance with the Act. Each state must certify to the Secretary that it enforces all speed limits on public highways according to the \"Gasoline Savings and Speed Limit Reduction Act of 2008.\" Data on speed limit violations must be submitted to support this certification. The Secretary shall establish criteria for data submitted on maximum speed limit highways, including citations and travel speed data. Criteria will consider speedometer variability and vehicle speeds. The Secretary will issue regulations to ensure uniform monitoring programs by states for data collection on maximum speed limit highways. Devices and equipment will be placed scientifically randomly based on relative risk of accidents, considering highway classes and vehicle speeds. The Secretary will determine the necessary form for data submission under this section. If a State's data shows a higher percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit on highways than allowed, a penalty will be imposed by transferring Federal-aid highway funds to State safety projects. For fiscal years 2009 and 2010, if the percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit on highways in a State is above certain thresholds, the Secretary can transfer Federal-aid highway funds to State safety projects. For fiscal years 2011 and 2012, if the percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit on maximum speed highways in a State is above specific thresholds, the Secretary can transfer up to 5 percent of Federal-aid highway funds to State safety projects. For fiscal years 2011 and 2012, if the percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit on maximum speed highways in a State is above specific thresholds, the Secretary can transfer up to 5 percent of Federal-aid highway funds to State safety projects. In 2012 and 2013, if the percentage exceeds 40% and 30% respectively, up to 10% of funds can be transferred for safety projects. In fiscal years 2011 and 2012, the Secretary can transfer up to 5% of Federal-aid highway funds to State safety projects if the percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit on maximum speed highways in a State is above specific thresholds. In subsequent years, if the percentage exceeds 30%, up to 10% of funds can be transferred for safety projects. In accordance with criteria set by the Secretary, a hardship exemption may defer fund transfers for State safety projects if deemed necessary. Definitions include \"motor vehicle\" as any vehicle for public highway use and \"maximum speed limit highway\" as highways with specific speed limits. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a safety project and mandates a study on the benefits of lowered speeds due to an Act, as well as the effectiveness of state enforcement. The curr_chunk discusses the effectiveness of state enforcement in deterring speed limit violations on highways, with a report to be submitted to Congress within 12 months. The curr_chunk amends the analysis for chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code by inserting a new item after section 149. The curr_chunk introduces a national maximum speed limit after section 149 in title 23 of the United States Code."
