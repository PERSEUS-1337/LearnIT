    "content": "On June 15, 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) introduced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) for certain individuals brought to the US as children without lawful immigration status. DACA allows relief from removal for two years, with the possibility of renewal. USCIS began accepting DACA requests on August 15, 2012, with over 580,000 approvals by June 2014. Individuals granted DACA can request renewal for another two years. The DACA initiative, introduced in 2012, allows relief from removal for individuals brought to the US as children without lawful immigration status. Eligibility criteria include being under age 31 in 2012, continuously residing in the US since 2007, and not having certain criminal convictions. The DACA initiative, introduced in 2012, allows relief from removal for individuals brought to the US as children without lawful immigration status. Eligibility criteria include being under age 31 in 2012, continuously residing in the US since 2007, and not having certain criminal convictions. USCIS's decision on a DACA request is discretionary, with about 96% of requests approved. DACA recipients are not granted lawful immigration status or put on a pathway to it. During deferred action, DACA recipients are considered lawfully present and may receive work authorization. There is no deadline for DACA requests, but individuals must meet specific criteria and file three forms with DHS/USCIS. The DACA process requires individuals to submit three forms to DHS/USCIS along with evidence of meeting eligibility requirements. The total fees amount to $465, consisting of a $380 filing fee and an $85 biometric services fee. DACA and the DREAM Act target unauthorized individuals who entered the US as children, with similar eligibility requirements but offering different forms of immigration relief. The DACA initiative grants temporary protection from removal to individuals without lawful immigration status. In contrast, the DREAM Act legislation aims to provide eligible individuals with lawful permanent resident status. DREAM Act provisions have been introduced in Congress but have not been enacted, with some bills seeing legislative action in the past. The Modernization Act (H.R. 744) includes DREAM Act language in its legalization provisions. No legislation on DACA has been passed, but a DACA-related bill (H.R. 5272) was approved by the House of Representatives in August 2014. DACA recipients must meet specific criteria, including continuous residence in the U.S. since their last approved DACA application. To request a renewal of deferred action under DACA, an individual must file three forms with DHS/USCIS: Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765WS. The forms are available on the USCIS website. No need to resubmit previously provided documents, but new documents related to removal proceedings or criminal history must be submitted if applicable. To request a renewal of deferred action under DACA, individuals must file three forms with USCIS and provide additional documentation if needed. Those initially granted deferred action by ICE should submit documentation to prove eligibility for DACA renewal. The total fee for renewal is $465, with specific breakdowns for filing and biometric services fees. It is advised to request renewal 120 days before the current period expires. DACA recipients should request renewal 120 days before their current deferred action period expires. USCIS makes renewal decisions on a case-by-case basis, and it does not grant lawful immigration status. Individuals may be considered unlawfully present during the renewal process. If USCIS is delayed in processing a request for deferred action and employment authorization, they may provide short-term authorization while completing processing."
