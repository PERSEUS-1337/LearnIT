    "content": "Section 3092 of Title 50, U.S. Code mandates that the congressional intelligence committees must be kept informed of all intelligence activities, excluding covert actions, by the Director of National Intelligence and component organizations. Notifications must be in writing and detail the circumstances and significance. Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 112 outlines that component organizations determine reportable activities, including significant intelligence failures impacting national security. ICD 112 also addresses anticipated activities that may require notification beforehand. Intelligence activities that pose significant risks or impact national security interests are briefed to congressional committees, with some exceptions for less sensitive activities. Notifications, known as Gang of Four briefings, are provided to select members in certain circumstances. Gang of Four notifications are a practice accepted by intelligence committee leadership for sensitive non-covert intelligence activities. Covert actions are informed to congressional committees as per Title 50, U.S. Code. The United States requires written findings to support foreign policy objectives and national security, to be reported to congressional intelligence committees before covert actions start. Findings must be made in writing unless immediate action is needed, with a deadline of 48 hours for producing a written finding if time constraints exist. Findings cannot authorize actions that have already occurred or violate the Constitution or U.S. statutes. Specific departments or agencies are authorized to fund covert actions. The DNI and responsible component of the intelligence community must specify U.S. government entities involved in funding covert actions and inform congressional intelligence committees of any significant changes. The President can limit access to covert action findings in extraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States. The President can limit notification of covert action findings to a select group known as the Gang of Eight. After 180 days, all members of the intelligence committees must be provided access to the finding or an explanation for limited access. Gang of Four and Gang of Eight notifications differ in their statutory basis. The Gang of Four notifications procedure is informal and accepted by intelligence committee leadership, while the Gang of Eight procedure is statutory and imposes obligations on the executive branch. The President must justify limiting notification to the Gang of Eight by stating vital U.S. interests are at stake. Gang of Four notifications are generally limited to non-covert action intelligence activities. The Gang of Four notifications are limited to non-covert action intelligence activities, while the Gang of Eight notifications are for particularly sensitive covert action programs. There are no statutory restrictions on how committee members can share information from these notifications with others. Critics argue for broader intelligence notification to Congress. Critics of restricted intelligence notifications like the Gang of Eight procedures argue that they hinder effective oversight as members are limited in their ability to discuss issues with colleagues. Some critics believe these notifications are overused and question their legality. Supporters of Gang of Eight notifications maintain they are necessary to protect sensitive intelligence activities. Members receiving these notifications are restricted in sharing details with other committee members and staff. Supporters argue that Members receiving restricted intelligence notifications can raise concerns directly with the President and congressional leadership. They also have legislative remedies available, such as using the appropriations process to withhold funding. Congressional defense committees oversee sensitive Department of Defense activities, which differ from covert actions as they are conducted under military authority. The Department of Defense's notification requirements for sensitive military activities differ from those of the intelligence community. The integration of military and intelligence activities poses challenges in determining the authority under which they fall. Prior notification is not always required for sensitive DOD activities conducted in support of larger military operations. Traditional military activities are not clearly defined in statute. Traditional military activities, under the direction of a US military commander, can be conducted covertly or clandestinely in support of military operations. These activities, exempt from covert action notification requirements, may warrant greater oversight due to their potential influence on foreign conditions. Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE) is defined by the Department of Defense. Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE) is defined in DOD doctrine as activities in potential areas of operations to shape the operational environment, often involving U.S. Special Operations Forces in counterterrorism operations. OPE includes close-target reconnaissance, infrastructure development, and is not subject to congressional notification as covert action. Congress is concerned about potential oversight circumvention by the military through OPE operations. Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE) involves activities in potential areas of operations to shape the environment, including clandestine intelligence collection. Routine support to military activities includes logistic support, while other-than-routine support involves activities abroad. These activities do not require separate congressional notification as covert action. Other-than-routine support to traditional military activities involves covert activities abroad that support U.S. military objectives and may influence political, economic, or military conditions in other countries. This support requires congressional notification for covert action under specific sections of the U.S. Code. The Defense Clandestine Service, under the Defense Intelligence Agency, is responsible for providing dedicated clandestine support. The Defense Clandestine Service, subordinate to the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides covert support to meet strategic military intelligence priorities. The Secretary of Defense must brief congressional committees on deployments and collection activities quarterly. Monthly briefings are also required on DOD counterterrorism operations, including updates on global activities, legal issues, interagency initiatives, and other relevant matters. Section 130k of Title 10 of the U.S. Code outlines notification requirements for cyber capabilities intended for use as a weapon, excluding covert actions. The Secretary of Defense must notify congressional defense committees within specific timeframes for approved cyber weapon use, development, and unauthorized disclosure. Offensive cyberspace operations project power through force, while defensive operations preserve cyberspace utilization abilities. Sensitive Military Operations in cyberspace are defined as kill or capture operations conducted outside active armed conflict theaters or by foreign partners targeting specific individuals. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to provide quarterly briefings to congressional defense committees on offensive and significant defensive military operations in cyberspace, including legal authorities and commands involved. The Secretary of Defense is required to provide written notice to congressional defense committees within 48 hours of sensitive military operations conducted by the U.S. Armed Forces targeting specific individuals or conducted outside active armed conflict theaters in self-defense or defense of foreign partners. This includes support to covert actions under Title 50 authority and briefings on personnel and equipment assigned to such operations. Sensitive military cyber operations, a subset of sensitive military operations, are defined by Section 130j(c) of Title 10 of the U.S. Code as operations by the U.S. Armed Forces intended to cause cyber effects outside areas of hostilities. The Secretary of Defense must notify congressional defense committees within 48 hours of such operations and immediately after any unauthorized disclosure."
