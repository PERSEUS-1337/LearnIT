Grants may be provided to State veterans agencies for outreach activities and to improve coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs.

State veterans agencies can receive grants to assist in developing and submitting claims for veterans' benefits. The grants can be used to award local governments for veterans outreach services based on the number of veterans in their jurisdiction and to help establish new outreach programs. The funds allocated must not exceed 50% of the total cost of state and local government activities and should be used to expand existing outreach programs, not replace current funding. Grants are distributed to states based on their veteran population. If a local government lacks a veteran services program, funds from grants can be utilized. Funds from grants under this subsection can be used to establish veteran services programs. State veterans agencies can use funds to provide outreach services for local governments without programs. Funds not used by states with existing programs will be reallocated to states with programs seeking grants. Grants can be used for education and training for state and local government programs.

Additionally, $25,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for carrying out these outreach activities. The budget authorizes $25,000,000 for outreach activities in fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008. A new section on outreach activities is added to the chapter, including coordination, cooperative activities with States, grants for outreach improvement, funding, and definition.
