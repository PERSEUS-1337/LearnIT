This study reveals that individual units in these networks respond selectively to specific language elements, such as morphemes, words, and phrases. A concept alignment method is proposed to quantitatively analyze this behavior, shedding light on how deep models understand natural language in various tasks. The study shows that units in deep CNNs for NLP tasks can act as concept detectors without needing additional data or re-training. A concept alignment method is used to identify aligned concepts for each unit, based on unit selectivity and sentence activation. Different methods like replicating concepts, including them in sentences, or using random sampling are employed for analysis. The study demonstrates that units in deep CNNs for NLP tasks can function as concept detectors without requiring extra data or re-training. A concept alignment method is utilized to pinpoint aligned concepts for each unit, determined by unit selectivity and sentence activation. Results indicate that individual units are selectively responsive to specific natural language concepts, with the highest selectivity seen in the replicate set, followed by the inclusion set, and the lowest in the random set. This supports the success of the method in aligning concepts where units respond selectively. Qualcomm has signed a licensing agreement with Microsoft, while Peoplesoft encourages customers to upgrade software for efficiency. RealNetworks modified software for iPods, and Apple lost to Microsoft by not licensing its Mac. Apple lost to Microsoft by not licensing its Mac, market-leading iPod. CNN units in NLP tasks respond selectively to specific natural language concepts, serving as detectors. Sweet Tomatoes is a great restaurant with friendly service and fantastic margaritas. Love this place!"
