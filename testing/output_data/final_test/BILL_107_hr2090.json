    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Help Organ Procurement Expand Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that 13 people die daily waiting for a transplant, over 67,000 people are currently on the waiting list, and between 10,000 and 12,000 medically suitable organ donors die annually. Only 5,200 people donate their organs each year, despite one donor being able to help more than 50 people. Current programs lack economic incentives for organ donors. Current debates in Congress and the Administration focus on organ allocation rather than the root cause of the problem - a lack of available transplant organs. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR ORGAN DONATION. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on organ donation. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows a $2,500 tax credit for qualified organ donations, including kidneys, livers, hearts, pancreas, lung, or intestine. Exceptions to this credit include donations from individuals killed with physician assistance or those who have authorized withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Exceptions to the $2,500 tax credit for organ donations include cases where the donor has committed suicide, legal consent was not obtained, the donor is a victim of a felony or misdemeanor offense, or the donor is an unborn child from an abortion. The term \"qualified person\" in organ donation refers to the organ donor themselves or the designated beneficiary, estate, or class of beneficiaries in the case of a deceased organ donor. This definition excludes donors who face unacceptable medical risks. The deceased organ donor died intestate. The credit amount under subsection (a) will be divided among beneficiaries on a pro rata basis unless specified otherwise in the donor's will or agreed upon by the beneficiaries. Any excess credit can be carried forward to the next taxable year. The deceased organ donor's credit under subsection (a) will be divided among beneficiaries on a pro rata basis unless specified otherwise. Excess credit can be carried forward to the next taxable year. Credits are treated on a first-in first-out basis. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments regarding organ donation in Section 25B apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act."
