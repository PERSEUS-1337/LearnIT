    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Broadband Deployment Act of 2001\". Congress finds that the Internet has greatly contributed to the economic expansion of the United States. Increasing Internet speed is crucial for continued growth. Many residential users, especially in low-income areas, have limited access to information due to slow internet speeds. Small businesses in these areas also lack full information access. The disparity in broadband access between low-income and high-income areas is hindering economic growth. Congress should take action to address this issue. The purpose of this Act is to accelerate broadband access deployment in low-income areas to narrow the current disparity. SEC. 3. BROADBAND CREDIT. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section for broadband credit. The new section for broadband credit in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for a 10 percent credit on qualified expenditures for equipment offering broadband services to underserved subscribers. Qualified expenditures are taken into account in the first taxable year broadband services are offered to subscribers. Special allocation rules apply if equipment serves both underserved and other subscribers. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 offers a 10 percent credit on qualified expenditures for equipment providing broadband services to underserved areas. The numerator of the credit calculation is the potential subscriber population in underserved areas served by the equipment, while the denominator is the total potential subscriber population in the area served. Definitions include \"antenna\" as a signal transmitting device, \"broadband service\" as signal transmission at specific rates, and \"cable operator\" as defined in the Communications Act. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to telecommunications, such as commercial mobile service carrier, nonresidential subscriber, open video system operator, and other wireless carrier, as defined in the Communications Act of 1934. The curr_chunk defines terms related to broadband services, including 'carrier', 'packet switching', and 'qualified equipment'. 'Carrier' refers to a provider of broadband service through radio transmission. 'Packet switching' involves controlling digitized transmission signals in packets. 'Qualified equipment' is capable of providing broadband services to subscribers. The curr_chunk discusses the extent to which certain telecommunications equipment can be considered under subparagraph (A). It includes details about the location of equipment in relation to units, buildings, dwellings, or offices owned or leased by subscribers of telecommunications carriers and commercial mobile service carriers. The curr_chunk specifies the location of telecommunications equipment in relation to units, buildings, dwellings, or offices owned or leased by subscribers of cable operators, open video system operators, satellite carriers, or other wireless carriers. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for packet switching equipment to be considered under certain circumstances for broadband services. It defines a \"qualified expenditure\" as any amount chargeable to capital account. The curr_chunk defines a \"qualified expenditure\" as any amount chargeable to capital account for the purchase and installation of qualified equipment eligible for depreciation. It excludes expenditures related to launching satellite equipment. Additionally, it defines \"residential subscriber\" as an individual purchasing broadband services for their dwelling, and \"satellite carrier\" as a person using licensed satellite facilities for Fixed-Satellite Service operations. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a \"subscriber\" as someone who purchases broadband services and a \"telecommunications carrier\" as defined by the Communications Act of 1934. It also mentions the ownership or leasing of satellite capacity for point-to-multipoint distribution. The curr_chunk defines terms related to broadband services, including \"total potential subscriber population\" and \"underserved subscriber.\" It clarifies the criteria for residential and nonresidential subscribers in underserved areas. The curr_chunk defines an underserved area as a census tract with a poverty level of at least 30 percent and a median family income below a certain threshold. The curr_chunk discusses the designation of census tracts meeting specific criteria for underserved areas, including those in empowerment zones or enterprise communities. The Secretary must designate these tracts within 90 days of enactment, and they will remain designated until December 31, 2006. The curr_chunk introduces amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to investment credit and a special rule for mutual or cooperative telephone companies. The curr_chunk introduces a special rule for mutual or cooperative telephone companies regarding income from certain sources, limited to not exceeding the credit for qualified expenditures under section 48A of the Internal Revenue Code. The section introduces a special rule for mutual or cooperative telephone companies regarding income limitations to not exceed the credit for qualified expenditures under section 48A of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, it prohibits Federal or State agencies from adopting regulations that would confiscate or undermine the purpose of the Act. The Sense of Congress is that the credit under section 48A of the Internal Revenue Code should be administered to ensure equal financial incentives for broadband carriers. The Secretary of the Treasury must study the credit's impact on carrier competitiveness and propose any necessary legislative or regulatory changes to maintain competitive neutrality."
