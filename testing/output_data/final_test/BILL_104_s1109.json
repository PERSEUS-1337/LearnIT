The Act defines \"Districts\" as the Ute Water Conservancy District and the Collbran Conservancy District, \"Federal reclamation laws\" as the Act of June 17, 1902 and related Acts, and \"Project\" as the Collbran Reclamation Project under the Act of July 3, 1952, including Vega Dam and Reservoir. The curr_chunk lists various assets and facilities owned by the United States or the State of Colorado, including dams, canals, pipelines, power plants, substations, switchyards, and easements related to access and use of the property on the Grand Mesa. The curr_chunk outlines the transfer of property and assets on US lands, including rights-of-way, permits, equipment, and data related to the Project. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The curr_chunk states \"SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE.\" The Secretary will transfer ownership of the Project to the Districts within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Districts must pay $11,147,000 to the United States before or at the time of the transfer, with $10,747,000 going to the general fund and $400,000 to a special account for the United States Fish and Wildlife. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, region 6, is allocated funds for Colorado operations and capital expenditures related to the Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin. Funds for this purpose cannot come from the issuance or sale of tax-exempt bonds. The Project will be operated by the Districts for 40 years after the enactment of the Act. The Districts must submit an annual plan to the Secretary for the operation of the Project, certifying compliance with engineering practices for maintaining Project facilities. The Project's electric power must be provided to and marketed by the Western Area Power Administration. The conveyance of the Project is subject to agreements between the United States and the State of Colorado for recreational facilities at Vega Reservoir. SEC. 3. OPERATION. The Project's power component and facilities must operate similarly to historic operations. The Districts are bound by existing agreements for power marketing until they expire or are terminated. After existing agreements expire or are terminated, the Districts must provide all power from the Project to the Western Area Power Administration at a rate that covers debt service, capital costs, and operation expenses, following the Administration's power repayment study principles. The Districts may sell power to entities other than the Western Area Power Administration if the Administration declines to market the power at a rate that covers costs, as granted by a license under the Federal Power Act. The Project is licensed under the Federal Power Act for 40 years, with the possibility of renewal after that period. The conveyance of the Project does not trigger NEPA regulations. Upon conveyance to the Districts, prior agreements and Federal reclamation laws will no longer apply. Liabilities will be addressed. The Districts will be liable for all acts or omissions related to the Project after conveyance. The United States will retain liability for latent defects in the Project under any law."
