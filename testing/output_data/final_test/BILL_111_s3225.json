    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Travel Regional Investment Partnership Act\". The importance of travel and tourism is highlighted by Congress, with approximately 8.3 million domestic jobs depending on the industry. The United States travel and tourism industry generates over $691 billion annually in direct spending, contributing significantly to the nation's GDP. Domestic employment in this industry cannot be outsourced. The economic downturn has severely impacted the domestic travel and tourism industry, with revenues dropping by nearly $130 billion in 2009. Domestic tourism has fallen by 4.5%, outpacing the overall economy. Spending and employment in the industry have been declining since 2008. Public-private partnerships are underutilized in promoting travel and tourism. The promotion of travel and tourism is a dynamic tool in creating new domestic tourism markets and promoting regional tourism growth. The Domestic Regional Tourism Grant Program is established under SEC. 3. This program aims to promote regional tourism growth and create new domestic tourism markets. The Secretary of Commerce establishes a grant program to promote domestic regional tourism growth. Grants range from $100,000 to $1,000,000 and are available to state tourism offices, local convention and visitors bureaus, and partnerships between government and tourism entities. Priority may be given to regions with low contributions to tourism marketing. The grant program aims to promote domestic regional tourism growth by providing funds to eligible entities. Priority is given to regions with low contributions to tourism marketing, maintaining regional diversity, and benefiting rural destinations. Grants can be used to promote tourism growth and create new markets. Eligible entities must submit an application with required information to the Secretary for consideration.
