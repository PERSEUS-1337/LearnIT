    "title": "SB 307",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 136.2 of the Penal Code is amended to allow courts to issue orders to protect victims or witnesses from harm or intimidation. This includes orders restricting communication with specified individuals. An order may be issued for a hearing to determine if protection should be provided by a law enforcement agency for a victim, witness, or their immediate family members residing nearby. The order requires consent from the agency, except in cases of clear danger, and immediate family members include spouse, children, or parents. An order can be issued to protect a victim or witness of violent crime from contact by the defendant with the intent to annoy, harass, threaten, or commit acts of violence. The court must transmit orders to law enforcement within one business day, and ensure that modification, extension, or termination orders are sent to the same agency that entered the original protective order. If a court does not issue a protective order in a domestic violence case, it may consider doing so if harm or intimidation to a victim or witness is likely. The order prohibits the defendant from owning or purchasing firearms, and they must relinquish any firearms they own. Violating the order is punishable by law. An order issued by a court in a domestic violence case must be on approved forms, but not using approved forms does not automatically invalidate the order. A protective order may include electronic monitoring for the defendant if authorized by the local government. The defendant may be required to pay for the monitoring unless deemed unable to do so, in which case the local government may cover the cost. Electronic monitoring duration is limited to one year and is only in effect while the protective order is active. A minor present during domestic violence is considered a witness and deemed to have suffered harm. Violating a protective order can result in punishment for a substantive offense or contempt of court. Contempt does not prevent prosecution for the offense, but credit may be given for punishment served. An emergency protective order takes precedence over other restraining orders if it is issued to protect individuals already covered by another order, restrains the individual named in the other order, and has stricter provisions. An emergency protective order with stricter provisions takes precedence over other restraining orders, except for a no-contact order. A person under this order is prohibited from owning or purchasing firearms, and must relinquish any firearms they own or possess. A person under a protective order is prohibited from owning or purchasing firearms. The court must consider issuing such orders in cases involving domestic violence or certain crimes. A protective order issued by the criminal court in cases involving domestic violence or certain crimes takes precedence over a civil court order against the defendant. Custody and visitation orders for the defendant and their minor children may be issued by family or juvenile court, following a protocol. If ordered after a criminal protective order, the custody order must reference and acknowledge the precedence of the criminal protective order. The Judicial Council will modify court forms by July 1, 2014 to comply with this requirement. The Judicial Council must create a protocol by January 1, 2003, for local courts to coordinate orders involving the same defendant and victim. The protocol should facilitate communication between criminal, family, and juvenile courts. Family or juvenile court orders can coexist with criminal court protective orders under certain conditions. The court prioritizes safety in child transfers and updates protective order forms. In cases of domestic violence charges, the court considers the nature of the offense in issuing orders. In cases involving charges of Section 261, 261.5, or 262 violations, the court may consider factors such as the nature of the offense, the defendant's relationship to the victim, likelihood of harm to the victim, existing restraining orders, and the defendant's criminal history when determining if good cause exists to issue an order. At sentencing for domestic violence crimes or certain other offenses, the court may issue a restraining order against the defendant, regardless of the type of sentence imposed, for up to 10 years based on the seriousness of the case. The court may issue a restraining order against the defendant for up to 10 years based on the seriousness of the case, future violations probability, and victim's safety. The court may issue a restraining order against the defendant for up to 10 years based on the seriousness of the case, future violations probability, and victim's safety. An order may include electronic monitoring if the local government adopts a policy authorizing it, with payment determined by the defendant's ability to pay or by the local government. The duration of electronic monitoring shall not exceed one year."
