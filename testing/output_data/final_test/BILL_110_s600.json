    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"School-Based Health Clinic Establishment Act of 2007\". Congress finds that over 8 million children in the US lack health insurance, leading to untreated conditions and unnecessary diseases. Adolescents aged 13-18 have poor health indicators, with 70% of children needing psychiatric treatment not receiving it. Children in poor health or facing abuse, poverty, malnutrition, alcohol, and drug abuse are at risk for academic and social failure. School-based health clinics are effective in helping at-risk children improve academic performance. The Act aims to fund school-based health clinics to provide comprehensive primary health care services to underserved children, improve their physical and emotional well-being, and collaborate with schools to enhance academic performance. The Act aims to fund school-based health clinics to provide comprehensive primary health care services to underserved children and families; and work in collaboration with the school to integrate health into the overall school environment. The Act aims to fund school-based health clinics to provide comprehensive primary health care services to underserved children and families, working in collaboration with schools to integrate health into the overall school environment. Additionally, Section 399Z-1 of the Public Health Service Act amends Part Q of title III to include provisions for school-based health clinics. In this section, \"community\" includes parents, consumers, local leaders, and organizations. \"Comprehensive primary health services\" offered by school-based health clinics include physical and mental health assessments, treatment of medical conditions, crisis intervention, counseling, and referrals to specialty care. The curr_chunk discusses psychiatric care, community support programs, inpatient and outpatient programs, and optional services like oral health and education. It defines medically underserved children and adolescents as those residing in areas with shortages of health services and infrastructure. The curr_chunk outlines criteria for providing personal health services to medically underserved children and adolescents, considering input from state officials and factors like health status, affordability, accessibility, and availability of healthcare professionals. The curr_chunk defines a school-based health clinic as a facility near a school that offers comprehensive primary health services to children and adolescents during school hours. A sponsoring facility, which can be a community-based organization like a hospital, administers the clinic. The Secretary awards grants for the operation of school-based health clinics (SBHCs) located in hospitals, public health departments, community health centers, nonprofit health care agencies, or schools. Entities must meet SBHC criteria and demonstrate local need to be eligible for grants. The SBHC must ensure services are provided to children with parental consent, collaborate with other healthcare providers, and offer on-site access during the academic day. The School-Based Health Center (SBHC) provides 24-hour coverage through an on-call system and backup health providers, integrates into the school environment, coordinates health services with school personnel and community providers, and the sponsoring facility assumes administration responsibility. The School-Based Health Center (SBHC) assumes responsibility for administration, operations, and oversight. The Secretary may give preference to applicants serving communities with barriers to primary health care, low health indicator scores, high uninsured rates, and historically difficult access to health services for children and adolescents. The Secretary has the authority to waive requirements for School-Based Health Centers (SBHC) under certain circumstances and use funds for acquiring buildings and equipment. The Secretary may award grants for expanding and modernizing existing buildings for School-Based Health Centers (SBHC), with the amount determined based on financial need, funding provided, and other factors. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) to help them meet requirements. This assistance may include fiscal and program management training, operational support, and information on available resources. Additionally, the Secretary will evaluate and monitor the quality performance of SBHCs receiving awards. Authorization of appropriations totaling $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and additional funds as needed for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 are authorized for evaluating and monitoring the quality performance of School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) receiving awards under this section."
