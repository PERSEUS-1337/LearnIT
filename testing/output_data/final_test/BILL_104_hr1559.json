    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom From Toll Fraud Act\". It includes findings related to toll fraud. The Congress acknowledges that reforms from the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992 have improved the pay-per-call industry's reputation and reduced misleading practices. However, some interstate pay-per-call businesses are exploiting loopholes to engage in deceptive practices, which goes against the Act's intent. Congress clarifies that charges for information provided during a call to a toll-free number shall not be assessed unless the calling party agrees to be billed according to a written subscription agreement. SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 includes changes to section 228(c) regarding billing for information conveyed during calls. Subscription agreements are required for billing for information provided via toll-free calls. The written subscription agreement must include the rate, provider's name, address, telephone number, and notification of rate changes. The subscription agreement must include the rate, provider's contact information, subscriber's signature, and payment method choice. If paying by phone bill, the agreement must clarify charges for calls and include a disclaimer on the phone bill. The subscription agreement must include the rate, provider's contact information, subscriber's signature, and payment method choice. If paying by phone bill, the agreement must clarify charges for calls and include a disclaimer on the phone bill. Additionally, the agreement should provide a personal identification number for access to information services and list the 800 number dialed on the phone bill. The agreement for services provided does not require a written agreement if approved by the Commission or State commission, or for purchases of goods or services that are not information services. A carrier can terminate service to an information provider without a written agreement. The paragraph discusses the requirements for charging by credit or calling card for information services, including the need for an introductory disclosure message with specific information. The Federal Communications Commission will revise regulations regarding charging by credit or calling card for information services, including the need for an introductory disclosure message with specific information. The term 'calling card' is defined as an identifying number or code unique to the individual, issued by a common carrier, enabling charges to be billed through a phone bill. The Federal Communications Commission must update its regulations to comply with the amendment within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act is amended to include pay-per-call services and similar services providing audio information or entertainment susceptible to unfair practices."
