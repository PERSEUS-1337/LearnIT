    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Alaska Mental Health Trust Land Exchange Act of 2016\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The \"Alaska Mental Health Trust Land Exchange Act of 2016\" authorizes the exchange of land between the Alaska Mental Health Trust and the Secretary of Agriculture to preserve scenic backdrops, create economic opportunities, protect natural values, and contribute to timber management in the Tongass National Forest. The Alaska Mental Health Trust Land Exchange Act of 2016 authorizes the exchange of land between the Alaska Mental Health Trust and the Secretary of Agriculture. Key terms defined in the Act include Alaska Mental Health Trust, Federal land, non-Federal land, and Secretary. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, and the term \"State\" refers to the State of Alaska. SEC. 4. LAND EXCHANGE. The Alaska Mental Health Trust may convey its rights in non-Federal land to the Secretary, who will then convey Federal land rights back. Before the exchange, necessary surveys and clearances must be completed by the Secretary. The Alaska Mental Health Trust must complete land surveys and clearances for threatened species, cultural resources, wetlands, and hazardous materials before exchanging non-Federal land with the Secretary. The conveyed land must meet the Secretary's approval standards and conform to the Attorney General's title approval standards. Appraisals must be conducted promptly after the Act's enactment. After the enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the Alaska Mental Health Trust will select an appraiser to conduct appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land. The appraisals must adhere to national appraisal standards for Federal land acquisitions and professional appraisal practice. After the Secretary approves the appraised values of Federal and non-Federal land, no reappraisal or updates will be required. An exchange agreement between the Alaska Mental Health Trust and the Secretary also eliminates the need for reappraisal or updates to the approved values. Before carrying out the land exchange, the Secretary must make the appraisals of the Federal and non-Federal land available for public review. The value of the land to be exchanged must be equal or equalized. If the final appraised value of the Federal land exceeds the non-Federal land, the Alaska Mental Health Trust must convey additional non-Federal land. The Alaska Mental Health Trust must convey additional non-Federal land, make a cash payment, or use a combination of both methods to the Secretary for a land exchange. The Secretary can accept a payment exceeding 25 percent of the total value of the Federal land or interests conveyed. The Alaska Mental Health Trust must cover all costs associated with the land exchange authorized by Congress, with a deadline of 1 year for completion. Surplus non-Federal land may be excluded to ensure an equal value exchange. SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT OF NON-FEDERAL LAND: Upon acquisition by the Secretary, non-Federal land becomes part of Tongass National Forest and is administered under National Forest System laws. Boundaries of the forest are adjusted to include the acquired land. Land and Water Conservation Fund considerations are based on the modified boundaries. SEC. 6. WITHDRAWAL. SEC. 6. WITHDRAWAL. Non-Federal land acquired by the Secretary is withdrawn from various forms of public laws, mining laws, and mineral leasing laws. Any public land order withdrawing Federal land from appropriation or disposal under public land laws will be revoked to allow conveyance of the land. If the Federal land or interest to be exchanged is not withdrawn from public land laws, it will be withdrawn without further action by the Secretary. The withdrawal of Federal land from appropriation or disposal under public land laws will be revoked to allow conveyance of the land. If the land is not withdrawn, it will be terminated upon completion of the land exchange or if the Alaska Mental Health Trust elects to withdraw from the exchange. The Secretary may correct minor errors in maps, estimates, or descriptions of land conveyed under the Act. In case of conflict, the map controls unless mutually agreed otherwise. Maps must be filed for public inspection in the Tongass National Forest office."
