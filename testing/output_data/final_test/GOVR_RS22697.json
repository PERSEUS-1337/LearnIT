    "content": "Parking privileges for individuals with disabilities are separate from the physical accessibility of parking spaces. The federal government enforces ADA standards for accessible design in parking facilities, but does not require reserved spaces or special permits for individuals with disabilities. Federal action on parking privileges is distinct from ADA regulations. The federal government considered action on parking privileges for individuals with disabilities in the 1980s due to complaints about states not honoring parking placards from other states. Early bills proposed federal guidelines and penalties for non-compliance, such as reduced highway funding. However, these proposals were not advanced. Congress later enacted legislation in 1988 to establish guidelines for parking privileges. The Department of Transportation created federal guidelines for parking privileges for people with disabilities in 1988. While Congress required the creation of a \"Uniform System,\" states are not mandated to comply with these guidelines, as the federal law is advisory rather than punitive. States ultimately have the responsibility for developing their own parking privileges for individuals with disabilities. The Uniform System for Parking for Persons with Disabilities provides guidelines for states to establish a uniform system, including model definitions and rules for eligibility, application procedures, and issuance of special license plates and placards. It also offers information on developing reciprocal parking privileges systems. The system does not include enforcement rules or specifications for renewal periods, encouraging states to incorporate its basic definitions and samples into their own detailed systems. The Uniform System for Parking for Persons with Disabilities defines eligible individuals as those with impairments limiting the ability to walk, requiring a licensed physician's determination. Individuals with disabilities limiting their ability to walk can apply for special license plates or a windshield placard under the Uniform System's guidelines. A physician's certification is required for the initial application. States cannot charge higher fees for special license plates compared to regular ones. Special license plates and placards are the only recognized means for parking in reserved spaces for individuals with walking impairments. Two types of windshield placards are available: removable and temporary removable. The Uniform System provides samples of removable and temporary removable windshield placards for individuals with disabilities limiting their ability to walk. The placards display the \"International Symbol of Access\" and include spaces for issuing authorities and expiration dates. The Uniform System includes a model rule addressing reciprocity for parking privileges for individuals with disabilities. Most states have adopted parts of the Uniform System and recognize placards issued by other states. States vary in their eligibility criteria for parking privileges. Most states have adopted parts of the Uniform System's definition for parking privileges for individuals with disabilities, but have modified or expanded it. States vary in their reciprocity provisions, with some recognizing out-of-state placards and others extending conditional privileges to out-of-state visitors. States have varying reciprocity provisions for parking privileges for individuals with disabilities. For example, North Dakota only extends privileges to visitors from states that also offer privileges to North Dakotans. Iowa requires placards to be displayed only when disabled individuals are using reserved parking spaces. Most states have similar application procedures for special license plates and windshield placards, requiring certification by a physician. However, laws differ among states regarding certain criteria. The Department of Transportation's Uniform System has increased uniformity in state laws regarding parking privileges for individuals with disabilities. Many states use uniform sample placards and have reciprocal privileges for individuals from other states. However, state laws differ in various administrative aspects of parking privilege administration, such as the duration of validity for removable windshield placards."
