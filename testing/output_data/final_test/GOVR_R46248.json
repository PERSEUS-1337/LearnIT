    "content": "Eligibility requirements and payment limits for U.S. farm programs are crucial as they determine who receives federal payments and how much. These requirements are controversial as they impact the size of farms supported and generate congressional interest due to their regional and commodity-specific effects. Policymakers debate the optimal limit for annual payments and whether it should be specific to each program or cumulative across all programs. Annual U.S. farm program payments, including federal crop insurance subsidies, have averaged $17.6 billion per year from 1996 through 2018. This report discusses eligibility factors and restrictions that affect farmers' access to benefits under current farm programs. Key information is summarized in Table A-1. The report provides a history of legislative changes in income eligibility thresholds and annual payment limits for major commodity programs. It also discusses farm program payment limits and eligibility requirements, which vary by program and legal entity type. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is responsible for collecting and maintaining data for eligibility and payment limit determinations for USDA farm programs. The NRCS administers conservation programs with evolving payment limits since the 1970 farm bill. Congress determines eligibility and payment amounts for farm payments, focusing on attributing payments directly to active farmers and capping individual recipient amounts. Congressional debates also center on excluding high-income farming entities from receiving payments. The eligibility requirements and payment limits for federal farm programs are determined by Congress, with a focus on directing payments to active farmers and capping individual recipient amounts. There are debates on excluding high-income farming entities from receiving payments, which can have various consequences for U.S. agriculture such as farm management structure, crop choices, and farm size. Program eligibility rules have evolved over time, expanding to more programs and including limitations. Cross-cutting methods like AGI thresholds are relatively new. Eligibility begins with participant identification, foreign ownership, AEF criteria, means tests, and conservation requirements. Every person or legal entity must provide a name and address to receive farm program payments. To receive farm program payments, participants must provide a name, address, and either a Social Security number (SSN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or Employee Identification Number (EIN). Each person or entity with ownership interests must declare their share using USDA forms CCC-901 and CCC-902. Participants must declare their ownership stake in the farming operation using USDA forms CCC-901 and CCC-902. This information is crucial for determining active engagement in the operation and for eligibility for farm program payments. Changes to the operation, such as adding new family members or altering capital contributions, must be updated on the forms. The eligibility of farm program participants is determined by the type of farm operation they are part of. There are three main categories: sole proprietorship or family farm, joint operation, and partnership. Sole proprietorships or family farms make up 86% of U.S. farm operations in 2017, with each qualifying family member subject to an individual payment limit. Joint operations treat each member separately for eligibility and payment limits. The payment limit for farm program participants is based on the number of qualifying members and individual payment limits. Corporations, including family-held ones, make up a significant portion of U.S. farm operations. Federal regulations also cover eligibility and payment limits for spouses, minor children, marketing cooperatives, trusts, and other entities. The USDA's 2017 Census of Agriculture shows that institutional arrangements account for a small share of U.S. farm operations. Special rules outline eligibility and payment limits in case of a previously eligible person's death. To qualify for farm program benefits, individuals and legal entities must meet AEF requirements, which apply to U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and foreign entities. The specific requirements for each type of legal entity - person, partnership, or corporation - to be considered \"actively engaged in farming\" are briefly reviewed. Family farms receive special treatment under the 2018 farm bill, where every adult member is deemed to meet the AEF requirements. The definition of family member has been extended to include first cousins, nieces, and nephews. Special treatment also applies to spouses, where if one spouse is actively engaged in farming, the other spouse is also considered to have met the requirement. The spousal exception under the 2018 farm bill applies to individual producers and those in partnerships. Landowners can be in compliance with AEF requirements if they receive income from the farm without providing labor or management. In a general partnership, each member must contribute active labor or management to be eligible for farm programs. Each partner's contribution must be separate and distinct. Failure to meet AEF criteria makes a partner ineligible for farm programs. A corporation in the farm program is treated as a single person for eligibility. Each member must contribute personal labor or management to the operation, separate from others. Failure to meet these criteria results in reduced program benefits. Recent farm bills have amended the criteria for active personal labor or management in farm programs to prevent passive investors from receiving payments without actively contributing to the farming operation. Recent farm bills have amended the criteria for active personal labor or management in farm programs to prevent passive investors from receiving payments without actively contributing to the farming operation. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to specify the role nonfamily producers must play to qualify for farm program benefits, with limits on the number of nonfamily members who can qualify as farm managers. Foreign persons can participate if they meet eligibility requirements, with exceptions for permanent residents. Foreign persons can become eligible for most farm program benefits if they have a U.S. taxpayer ID and meet the necessary criteria. As of December 31, 2018, foreign individuals held an interest in 31.8 million acres of U.S. agricultural land, accounting for 2.5% of privately held agricultural land in the country. Foreign entities without AEF criteria can receive payments based on U.S. shareholders' ownership. No specific restrictions exist for foreign entities in crop and livestock insurance subsidies. The Dairy Margin Coverage program is open to all dairy operations in the U.S. regardless of citizenship. Sugar processors and producers under the U.S. sugar program have no citizenship requirements. The sugar program price guarantees require sugarcane and sugar beets of U.S. origin. Means testing determines eligibility for certain commodity programs based on income levels. The 2002 farm bill established the first means test, using average AGI over a three-year period. Means testing now affects payment limits rather than just eligibility. Disaster assistance in 2018 and 2019 also considers average AGI over three years for determining total assistance. The 2019 farm bill uses a three-year average AGI to determine payment limits based on farming income. Most U.S. farms are taxed under individual income tax, with AGI measuring net income after expenses. The debate now focuses on which programs are covered by means testing and the appropriate income threshold. For incorporated businesses, a measure comparable to AGI is used to determine income. Farm and nonfarm income are combined for federal income tax purposes for farm households, with most tax paid attributed to nonfarm income. Farm operations often report operating losses for tax purposes, with a significant portion of capital investment expensed in the first year contributing to large loss reporting. Program participants must annually consent to IRS verification of compliance with AGI limit provisions using a specific USDA form (CCC-941). The 2002 farm bill set an initial AGI threshold for program eligibility at $2.5 million, with an exemption if 75% of AGI was from farming. The 2008 farm bill replaced this with three separate AGI limits for farm and nonfarm income. Nonfarm AGI limit was $500,000 for certain program benefits, while a farm-specific AGI limit of $750,000 applied to direct payments. Failure to provide consent for IRS verification of compliance with AGI limits results in ineligibility for program payments and refund of any received payments. The 2008 farm bill introduced new AGI limits for program eligibility, with a farm-specific limit of $750,000 for direct payments and a nonfarm limit of $1 million for conservation benefits. The AGI limit could be waived on a case-by-case basis for protecting environmentally sensitive land. A provision for married individuals allowed joint AGI to be allocated as if filed separately, potentially reducing the number of farms affected by the cap. The 2014 farm bill set a $900,000 AGI limit for individuals and businesses, with provisions for married couples and partnerships. The 2018 farm bill maintained these AGI limits and added a waiver for conservation programs. USDA introduced the Market Facilitation Program in response to retaliatory tariffs. The Market Facilitation Program (MFP) provides direct payments to producers of selected commodities in response to retaliatory tariffs. To qualify for MFP payments, producers must meet AEF, AGI, and conservation compliance criteria. The AGI criterion for 2018 MFP payments was amended to use tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015, allowing eligibility for AGI over $900,000 if at least 75% came from farming, ranching, or forestry-related activities. The USDA announced 2019 MFP payments, requiring recipients to meet AEF, AGI, and conservation compliance criteria using tax years 2015-2017. Conservation compliance includes maintaining conservation on highly erodible land and not converting wetlands for production. Conservation compliance, in effect since the 1985 farm bill, requires participants to meet conservation requirements to receive farm program payments, loans, and disaster assistance. The 2014 and 2018 farm bills extended this requirement to federal crop insurance premium subsidies. Conservation compliance is a key environmentally based requirement for program participation in U.S. farm policy. \"Direct attribution\" tracks payments through various legal entities, with different types of entities eligible for farm program payments. Legal entities, including joint operations, partnerships, and corporations, may qualify for farm program payments. These entities are defined as those owning land or producing agricultural commodities. Ownership shares are tracked through SSN or EIN, with payments flowing down to individual recipients. Congressional definitions encompass various multiperson legal entities like family farm operations and joint ventures. Direct attribution of farm program payments to individuals is crucial for monitoring payments against annual limits. Payments made to an individual associated with a farming operation are combined with payments from other operations they are involved in. This accumulation of payments is tracked through multiple levels of ownership in legal entities and is subject to an annual limit. Ownership shares in legal entities can affect farm program payment limits. If an individual reaches their payment limit at the first level of attribution, payments to lower-level entities are reduced accordingly. Payment limits vary among programs and legal entity types, with some exceptions and expansions based on participation. Explicit payment limits have been in place since the 1970s, but are not universal. The major categories of farm program support and the applicability of annual payment limits are briefly discussed. Title I commodity program payment limits have evolved since 1970. ARC and PLC are two revenue-support programs subject to annual payment limits. Title I commodity programs have annual payment limits, with ARC and PLC subject to a $125,000 limit for individuals. Peanuts have their own limit. The LFP program also has a $125,000 limit per person, while NAP is available for crops without insurance, with limits of $125,000 for catastrophic coverage and $300,000 for buy-up coverage. The Secretary of Agriculture can make ad hoc payments to support U.S. agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture can make ad hoc payments to support U.S. agriculture, which may be ad hoc or part of a temporary program with or without payment limits. Three programs initiated since 2016 have annual payment limits, including the Cotton Ginning Cost Share Program with a $40,000 limit, and the 2018 MFP program with a $125,000 limit per person for offsetting trade losses with China. In July 2019, USDA established a second round of Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments with higher payment limits of $250,000 per commodity category and an overall cap of $500,000 per person. The three eligible categories were non-specialty crops, specialty crops, and livestock. If farm program benefits exceed the annual limits for a given year, the individual is no longer eligible for further benefits and must refund any payments received. Under the 2018 farm bill, family farms can qualify for multiple payment limits based on the number of immediate and extended family members, including first cousins, nieces, and nephews. For example, a farm with a single active operator and extended family members could potentially be eligible for up to 12 individual payment limits. The farm operation may qualify for 12 individual payment limits, with potential total program payments of $1.5 million. Partnerships can have additional payment limits based on the number of members, with each member needing to meet criteria and income limits. The total payment limit for a partnership is reduced by the share of members who have reached their limits on other farm operations. Corporations are treated as single entities for eligibility and payment limit purposes if they meet criteria. In FY2018 and FY2019, Congress provided supplemental appropriations for production losses from natural disasters not covered by NAP or crop insurance. USDA administered funding through programs like WHIP and WHIP+ for losses in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Additionally, USDA implemented ad hoc programs like On-Farm Storage Loss Program and Milk Loss Program, along with block grants with states. Payment limits were established for WHIP. Payment limits for WHIP and WHIP+ in 2017 are based on an individual's or entity's average AGI over a three-year period, depending on farming income. Producers are assumed to be in the lowest payment limit category unless an exception is filed with documentation showing at least 75% of AGI is from farm income. Verification of payment limit exceptions is not submitted to the IRS for WHIP programs. Limits on conservation programs have existed before farm support program limits. Conservation programs in the 2018 farm bill have payment limits. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has limits on annual rental, cost-share, and incentive payments. Payments are based on contract type and county rental rates, with a maximum of $50,000 per year. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) has payment limits for contracts entered into between FY2019 and FY2023. Total cost-share and incentive payments are capped at $450,000. Additional limits apply to select payments, including incentive contract payments limited to $200,000, payments for organic production practices limited to $140,000, and eligible water management entity payments limited to $900,000. The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) also has payment limits, with a total cap of $200,000 for all contracts between FY2019 and FY2023, and a limit of $400,000 for joint operation contracts. The payment limits for joint operations under certain farm programs are $400,000 over the contract period. Exceptions include the CSP Grassland Conservation Initiative with annual payments capped at $18 per acre, and certain programs like Marketing Assistance Loan, sugar program, dairy program, and disaster assistance programs are not subject to annual payment limits. Additionally, if the principal operator or major partner dies, benefits can be transferred to another operator without limits. The payment limits for joint operations under certain farm programs are $400,000 over the contract period. Exceptions include the CSP Grassland Conservation Initiative with annual payments capped at $18 per acre. Benefits from crop insurance premium subsidies, indemnity payments, and Emergency Watershed Protection Program are not subject to any limits. The MAL program offers benefits such as loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, and gains under forfeiture or commodity certificate exchanges. All MAL benefits are now excluded from payment limits according to the 2018 farm bill. The U.S. sugar program does not have payment limits. The U.S. sugar program provides indirect price support to producers of sugar beets and sugarcane through marketing assistance loans. Congress limits sugar supply for food use to support market prices without federal budget outlays. Sugar processors must use U.S.-origin crops. The dairy program includes margin-based support. The U.S. dairy program, part of the 2018 farm bill, offers support through the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program. Participants receive premium subsidies and payments triggered by program prices, with no limits on participation or payments. Additionally, the 2018 farm bill includes disaster assistance programs ELAP, LIP, and TAP. Payments under disaster assistance programs in the 2018 farm bill, such as ELAP, LIP, and TAP, are exempt from payment limits. Conservation program payments are limited to the cost of specific measures. Crop and livestock insurance subsidies have no statutory limit on total payments. Premium subsidies for farmers under the federal crop insurance program are not limited and cover catastrophic and buy-up insurance. Indemnities for insurable losses have no payment limit. Eligibility criteria include being a \"person\" as defined by USDA and being at least 18 years old with an insurable interest in a crop. Payment limits may be waived in case of the principal operator's death during the crop year. A person may exceed payment limitations if ownership interest in farmland or agricultural commodities was transferred due to death, the new owner is the successor to the previous owner's contract, and all other eligibility requirements are met. This provision also applies to an ownership interest in a legal entity received by inheritance if the entity owned the land enrolled in a farm program contract at the time of the shareholder's death. The new owner cannot exceed the previous owner's payment amount, but the new payment limit is in addition to the person's own farm operation limit if all program and payment eligibility requirements are met. The provision allows a new owner inheriting farmland to receive farm program payments for one year, as long as eligibility requirements are met. This addresses concerns about payment limitations and resource commitment. Market prices are seen as the most efficient way to allocate resources in the absence of policy support. Supporters of payment limits argue that tighter limits would lead to more land being farmed based on market conditions rather than policy choices. They believe that large payments contribute to farm consolidation, higher land prices, and disadvantage smaller family farms and new farmers. Tighter limits could indirectly benefit smaller farms by reducing incentives to expand and easing upward pressure on land prices. Supporters of payment limits argue that tighter limits could reduce upward price pressure on land markets, potentially helping small and beginning farmers. Critics of payment limits believe all farms need support, especially during market price declines, and that larger farms should not be penalized for their efficiencies. They argue that farm payments help U.S. agriculture compete globally and income testing goes against federal farm policies aimed at improving competitiveness. The majority of farm payments go to large operators, with farms generating over $250,000 in revenue receiving 62% of federal farm program payments. Setting a limit on government support payments raises policy implications, as payments are often reflected in land values, disadvantaging small and beginning farmers. Critics argue that the current farm program payments system favors large farms over small ones due to higher land values disadvantaging smaller farmers. Supporters claim that larger farms are more efficient and changing the system could harm U.S. competitiveness. Tightening payment limits may impact crops unevenly, affecting those with higher production value first. The production value of major U.S. program crops like rice, peanuts, and cotton is higher, especially in regions like the Southeast, the Mississippi Delta, and western states. Payment limits can impact local economic activity, particularly in rural, agriculture-based counties. Peanuts have a separate payment limit, giving them an advantage over other program crops. The 2018 farm bill combines payments for ARC and PLC under a single limit, with separate limits for peanuts and other program crops. This could potentially double a peanut farmer's payment limits to $250,000. The bill also excluded MAL benefits from any payment limit and raised MAL rates for various program crops. The higher MAL rates increase USDA outlays and lower potential PLC program payments. Unlimited MAL benefits create equity issues compared to ARC and PLC payments. MAL program outlays count against WTO spending limits. The curr_chunk discusses how changes in eligibility requirements or payment limits in farm programs can lead to producers adjusting their behavior to optimize revenue. This could result in reorganizing farm operations, changing crop choices, or adjusting marketing practices to adapt to new policy and market conditions. These changes may also impact compliance with WTO commitments and could potentially lead to disputes under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. Changes in crop choices and land use can be influenced by payment limits per unit or base acre, which can impact producer behavior. For example, a per-unit payment limit like the 85% reduction factor applied to base acres under PLC or ARC programs aims to save costs rather than promote fairness. The 2018 farm bill retained the $900,000 AGI limit for all farm income, regardless of source. This is a change from the 2008 farm bill, which had separate limits for farm-earned and nonfarm-earned income. Analysis by USDA in 2016 showed that fewer farms are affected by the single AGI cap compared to the multiple caps in the previous bill. Only about 0.7% of farm sole proprietors and share rent landlords reported total AGI over $1 million in 2013. The 2018 farm bill consolidated the separate AGI farm and nonfarm limits into a single AGI limit of $900,000. This change restored eligibility for some farm operations that were previously disqualified from receiving farm program payments. The bill also exempted certain entities from the AGI limit, such as state and local governments, federally recognized Indian tribes, and waivers under RCPP. The focus of the farm safety net shifted towards crop insurance programs, which are not subject to the AGI cap. Federal crop insurance premium subsidies averaged $6.4 billion annually from 2011-2018. Concerns were raised about extending the AGI cap to crop insurance subsidies during the 2014 and 2018 farm bill debates. The 2018 farm bill consolidated AGI limits into a $900,000 cap. Concerns were raised about extending the cap to crop insurance subsidies, but USDA estimates minimal impact on farms and premiums."
