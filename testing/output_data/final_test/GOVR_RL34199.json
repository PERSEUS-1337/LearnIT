    "content": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in office since 2005, has strengthened diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany. She advocates for strong U.S.-European relations and increased cooperation on global security threats. Merkel seeks to establish Germany as a key partner in multilateral efforts, emphasizing shared values and the need for broad U.S.-German and U.S.-European cooperation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has strengthened diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany, emphasizing shared values and the need for broad U.S.-German and U.S-European cooperation in the face of common security challenges. Both governments have sought to increase transatlantic cooperation in various areas, although some fundamental differences remain. The prevailing negative German public opinion of U.S. foreign policy is fueled by the belief that it has failed and exacerbated global security threats. Despite this, there is strong popular support for President Obama in Germany, indicating expectations for a shift away from his predecessor's policies. Chancellor Merkel leads a center-right coalition government and observers warn of continued skepticism towards U.S. foreign policy actions perceived as unilateral. In the 2009 elections, Chancellor Merkel's CDU/CSU-FDP government holds 10 of 15 cabinet positions, with FDP leader Guido Westerwelle as vice chancellor and minister of foreign affairs. The coalition aims to revitalize the German economy after a deep recession in 2009. Merkel is expected to have more success advancing her policy priorities with the FDP than in her previous term with the SPD in a grand coalition. Germany's export-driven economy contracted by 5% of GDP in 2009, with unemployment at 8% expected to rise to over 9% in 2010. The economy is projected to grow slightly above 1% of GDP in 2010 and 2011, but concerns remain about a budget deficit increasing from 3.2% to 5.6% of GDP in 2010. Germany has set a deficit ceiling to take effect in 2016, limiting the federal deficit to 0.35% of GDP and banning individual states from deficits after 2020. Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble plans to implement deficit reduction measures in 2011, but doubts persist about cutting public spending while implementing tax cuts. The FDP's calls for deeper structural reforms to the German economy, including cuts in social welfare programs, could cause tension within the governing coalition. Merkel and Westerwelle aim to maintain strong U.S.-German relations and agree on major foreign policies, but differences may arise on issues like troop deployments in Afghanistan. Foreign Minister Westerwelle's decision to deploy additional soldiers to Afghanistan has sparked controversy. He advocates for more focus on civilian reconstruction rather than military efforts. His call for the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from German soil has drawn attention and criticism. Some analysts question his handling of sensitive security matters, while others support his commitment to multilateral diplomacy, a key aspect of German foreign policy since World War II. After World War II, German foreign policy shifted towards multilateral institutions and away from military power. The country aimed to reconcile with former enemies and gain legitimacy on the international stage through NATO and European integration. The end of the Cold War and German unification in 1990 reshaped geopolitical realities, making Germany Europe's largest country without the Soviet threat that once united it with Western allies. German leaders reaffirmed their commitment to multilateral processes and aversion to military force, despite the country's increased global weight. The EU, NATO, and the U.N. are central to Berlin's foreign policy, with German armed forces operating under constraints to avoid combat situations. The challenge lies in balancing continuity in foreign policy with a desire for a more proactive global role. Germany's foreign policy faces tensions between its traditional 'civilian power' role and the need for a more proactive global stance in the post-Cold War era. The evolving domestic debate reflects a shift in German national interests towards a more assertive approach, challenging the country's commitment to multilateral frameworks like the EU, NATO, and the U.N. West Germany maintained a low international profile within multilateral institutions like the Atlantic Alliance, European Community, and United Nations, positioning itself as an \"honest broker\" with limited interests. Despite pursuing German unification, they framed their goals within the broader East-West Cold War struggle. Post-unification, German governments continued a multilateralist foreign policy, focusing on reforming and strengthening the EU, NATO, and the United Nations to enhance multilateral responses to security challenges. Germany's foreign and security policy is characterized by a \"networked\" approach to intra- and inter-state conflict. German foreign and security policy focuses on conflict prevention, crisis intervention, counterterrorism, and WMD proliferation. It emphasizes adherence to international law and human rights, requiring parliamentary approval for troop deployments. Energy security goals are increasingly important, especially in relations with Russia and the EU. Germany plays a crucial role in EU and NATO foreign policy, emphasizing European integration and security. Chancellor Merkel advocates for a cohesive European defense policy to strengthen transatlantic partnerships with the US. Berlin supports EU-NATO cooperation while maintaining allegiance to NATO for European security. Germany's commitment to EU and NATO cooperation is balanced, aiming for a middle path between the two institutions. As a significant contributor to the United Nations, Germany supports international law, peacekeeping efforts, and sustainable development. Germany supports U.N. reform efforts to enhance peacekeeping missions, prevent humanitarian disasters, combat terrorism, and protect human rights. Despite resistance from some U.N. members, Germany sees the U.N. as crucial for international legitimacy in its foreign policy. It has expressed interest in a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council since the early 1990s. Germany has expressed interest in a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council since the early 1990s. While past leaders like Kohl and Schr\u00f6der sought international support for this, the current Merkel government has softened its tone on the issue. However, German government documents indicate readiness to assume greater responsibility, including a permanent Security Council seat. Merkel even asked former President Bush to support a German bid for permanent representation in 2007. This shift in approach comes as German leaders pursue a more proactive foreign policy in response to evolving global security threats. Since 9/11, German leaders have pursued a more proactive foreign policy, deploying 7,000 troops worldwide and playing a leading role in diplomatic initiatives. The shift in German security and defense policy has sparked a debate over national interests and the best approach to achieve them. Politicians justify increased troop deployments and assertive foreign policy by aiming to be a credible global partner and maintain alliance solidarity. Some argue that Germany's foreign policy, focused on assuming a \"fair share\" of multilateral burden and maintaining alliance solidarity, has masked a lack of domestic consensus on national interests. As German troops engage in riskier missions like in Afghanistan and Lebanon, questions arise on the worth of alliance goals versus the risks of military deployment. Calls for \"exit strategies\" and a clearer foreign policy agenda have emerged, especially from conservative circles advocating for a more defined approach. Some argue for a more proactive German foreign policy beyond multilateral obligations, while others emphasize the importance of surrendering sovereignty to international institutions. This evolving debate is likely to impact German policy within the EU, NATO, and the UN. Germany's post-World War II commitment to European integration aimed at reconciliation and development, with the EU serving as a platform for a more assertive German role on the global stage. German foreign policy in the early- to mid-1990s focused on European integration and EU enlargement to the east, driven by a desire to prevent a resurgent Germany and replicate post-World War II integration benefits in central and eastern Europe. Calls for a collective European foreign policy grew due to Europe's inaction in the Balkans conflicts. Merkel and her predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, showed a desire for a more assertive German role within the EU, with Merkel continuing this trend towards a proactive role for Germany in Europe. Germany's foreign policy under Merkel demonstrates a proactive role within Europe, advocating for deeper integration in various areas. While showing skepticism towards EU enlargement and market integration, Germany has played a significant role in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Merkel supported the EU's Lisbon Reform Treaty and used Germany's EU presidency to push for a new reform treaty. Germany's proactive foreign policy under Merkel supports deeper EU integration. Merkel advocated for the Lisbon Reform Treaty and pushed for a new reform treaty during Germany's EU presidency in 2007. Analysts note personal differences between Merkel and Sarkozy, suggesting a weakening of the Franco-German partnership, which has historically driven European integration. Germany's early support for EU enlargement post-Cold War aimed to spread democratic governance to its neighbors, but ongoing debates on the EU's \"absorption capacity\" raise concerns about further enlargement. Germany's stance on EU enlargement, particularly regarding Turkey, is a topic of debate within Merkel's CDU/CSU political group. While not ruling out future expansion, Merkel advocates for stricter requirements for new membership and proposes alternatives to full EU membership, especially for Turkey. This reflects the broader domestic discussion on Europe's borders and EU institution reform. Germany's position on Turkey's EU accession process reflects the broader domestic debate on enlargement. A 2009 survey showed that only 16% of Germans view Turkish accession positively. Merkel and the CDU/CSU members are reportedly against Turkey's entry into the EU, proposing a \"privileged partnership\" instead of full membership. The opposition SPD, however, supports Turkey's EU accession efforts and further enlargement. Germany's growing influence in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy has been welcomed in some areas like Middle East policy but has caused disagreements within the Union, especially in relations with Russia. Berlin has shown a willingness to pursue independent foreign policy interests, raising concerns about its commitment to European unity. Close German-Russian relations have prompted questions about Berlin's stance on fostering European unity in foreign and security matters. Germany's commitment to fostering European unity in foreign and security policy is evident in its close relations with Russia, dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Germany prioritizes its relationship with Russia, being its largest trading partner and relying on Russia for a significant portion of its energy needs. However, this dependence on Russian energy resources has raised concerns about broader European energy security and the EU's ability to reach consensus on energy matters. The EU's newer member states in central and eastern Europe, particularly Poland and Lithuania, criticize a German-Russian gas pipeline agreement and Russia's manipulation of gas and oil supplies to Europe in 2006, 2007, and 2009. Merkel and Foreign Minister Westerwelle aim to improve ties with Germany's eastern neighbors and reassure them that Germany's relations with Russia do not threaten European unity or security. German-Polish relations have been marked by disagreements, including Germany's close ties to Russia. Merkel advocates a \"strategic partnership\" with Russia for both Germany and the EU. Merkel's stance on a \"strategic partnership\" with Russia for Germany and the EU was evident during negotiations for a new EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in 2007. Despite facing opposition from Poland and Russian resistance, Merkel's decision to allow the negotiations to collapse was seen as a reaffirmation of her commitment to European unity in foreign policy. Her approach towards Russia is perceived as tougher than her predecessor Schr\u00f6der, possibly influenced by her East German background. Germany's governing coalition remains divided on engaging with Russia, but the strong historical, economic, and energy ties between the two countries suggest that Germany will continue seeking a balance in their relationship. Germany continues to navigate a middle path between Russia and EU member states, emphasizing a strong Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). It plays a leading role in shaping EU positions on international issues but also pursues bilateral energy agreements with Russia, showing assertiveness and frustration with EU foreign policy processes. Germany strongly supports the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) for the EU, pooling defense resources to counter security threats. This backing grew after the Balkan conflicts in the mid-1990s and intensified post-9/11, focusing on civilian crisis management and police training. Germany contributes personnel to CSDP missions in various regions, emphasizing civilian crisis management and military operations. Germany supports the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) and has committed troop support for rapid-response Battlegroups. Merkel emphasizes CSDP as a complement to NATO and advocates for formal agreements between the two organizations. The Franco-German partnership drives European integration, with both countries working closely to advance joint interests within the EU. The EU's eastward expansion has reduced Franco-German decision-making power, leading Merkel to focus on relations with Germany's eastern neighbors. Merkel aims to improve Germany's ties with newer member states, while France seeks to strengthen EU policy in the Mediterranean. France is focusing on EU policy in the Mediterranean and aims to increase Europe's global competitiveness. Merkel is concerned about Sarkozy's desire for more political governance of EU economic policy and domestic tax cuts. Both leaders are working on a common European response to the global financial crisis, advocating for enhanced international regulation of financial markets. Analysts and European diplomats see policy differences between Merkel and Sarkozy as a sign of decreasing Franco-German influence in the EU. Their focus on economic competitiveness and an outward-looking EU could improve relations with the UK. Brown, Merkel, and Sarkozy are seen as new European leaders with potential to revitalize the EU, but differences on issues like enlargement and economic liberalization may hinder progress. Germany's deployment of troops outside NATO territory for the first time since World War II has sparked debate on the rapid shift in German defense policy. Approximately 7,000 German soldiers are currently deployed in various missions, leading to questions about the grounds for this evolving defense policy. Germany's defense policy is facing challenges due to a widening gap between institutional commitments and actual military readiness. Despite political support for stronger defense capabilities, budget cuts have hindered Germany's ability to deploy troops in multilateral missions. Constitutional constraints have limited Germany's involvement in military operations, leading to a landmark court ruling in 1994. Germany's participation in NATO's 1999 air campaign in Kosovo faced domestic opposition due to historical obligations, but Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer argued that Germany's history obligated military intervention to prevent atrocities. This set a precedent for Germany's increasing involvement in humanitarian interventions globally. Germany's global threat assessments align with its EU and NATO partners, including the United States, identifying terrorism, WMD proliferation, regional conflicts, transnational crime, and other security threats. Germany emphasizes a multilateral approach and non-military means to combat these threats, diverging at times from U.S. policy. The 2006 White Paper on security policy underscores the importance of civilian involvement in defense policy. Germany views terrorism as a primary threat but does not advocate for a war on terrorism. It emphasizes addressing root causes through development and other policies. The government does not completely rule out military engagement but downplays this option. Germany's security policy highlights the importance of the transatlantic alliance and NATO expansion. It supports transforming NATO to respond to post-Cold War and post-9/11 security threats. Germany's relations with NATO allies are influenced by factors causing tension within the Alliance, including U.S. leadership and Germany's ability to undertake security reforms for \"out-of-area\" missions. Approximately 4,300 German troops are deployed to NATO missions in Afghanistan, Kosovo, and the Mediterranean Sea. German participation in ISAF has sparked domestic debate over national defense policy and tension with NATO allies. German forces are mainly involved in stability operations in northern Afghanistan, leading Regional Command North and two PRTs. They also conduct surveillance operations with Tornado aircraft. In 2010, the German parliament approved sending 850 additional troops to Afghanistan. Despite being the third-largest troop contributor, Germany has faced criticism, especially from the United States. Germany has faced criticism, particularly from the United States, for \"national caveats\" limiting their soldiers' deployment to Afghanistan's dangerous southern region. German officials cite public opposition to military engagement and emphasize the need for NATO to focus more on civilian reconstruction. They welcome the Obama Administration's regional approach to Afghanistan. The Obama Administration's regional approach to Afghanistan is welcomed by Germany, with emphasis on Pakistan and engagement with Iran. Concerns in Germany include potential U.S. troop increases leading to an \"Americanization\" of the mission, limiting allied influence. Critics argue that U.S. policy in Afghanistan shows a reluctance to view NATO as a credible collective security mechanism. The United States has been criticized for preferring to use \"coalitions of the willing\" rather than NATO for missions due to some allies lacking military capacity. Germany supports NATO efforts to enhance collective defense strategy and procurement practices. Germany's defense procurement practices need to be modernized to meet NATO commitments, including increasing defense spending to reach the 2% of GDP target. Despite calls for military modernization, German defense spending has declined since 1991, lagging behind NATO's average. The changing security environment post-Cold War and post-9/11 has highlighted the need for structural defense reform. Germany agreed to reduce troop numbers from 500,000 to under 370,000 to meet NATO and ESDP targets. The restructuring aims to include 35,000 troops for crisis intervention, 70,000 for crisis stabilization, and support forces of 147,500. This could enable Germany to deploy 14,000 troops in multiple operations simultaneously. Currently, about 7,400 troops are deployed. Observers commend Germany's intention to transform its military to meet EU, NATO, and U.N. commitments, but note substantial gaps between goals and actions. Germany's 2006 White Paper does not address funding mechanisms, with officials skeptical about increasing defense spending. Some believe realigning spending priorities and EU-wide cooperation could help achieve defense priorities. Experts argue that Germany's adherence to mandatory military service represents a significant challenge. Critics argue that mandatory military service hinders meaningful reform, advocating for a voluntary professional force to address operational deficiencies. Despite a reduction in conscripts, strong support within the CDU suggests reforms are unlikely during Merkel's term. The FPD and some opposition parties in Germany are calling for an end to conscription, signaling potential reforms. Despite differences in U.S.-German relations, both countries cooperate on foreign policy, trade, and counterterrorism under Merkel's leadership. Many Members of Congress support Merkel's commitment to NATO and transatlantic relations, confident in her ability to enhance U.S.-German and U.S.-European cooperation. Bilateral relations are strong due to economic ties and shared democratic values. Germany, the EU, and the U.S. collaborate on global security threats, including terrorism and efforts in Afghanistan and the Middle East. Germany's evolving foreign policy, focusing on international institutions, will impact U.S.-German relations. Germany's commitment to international institutions, international law, and the multilateral framework, along with its aversion to military force, could impact its foreign and security policy decisions. German politicians have questioned aspects of U.S. foreign policy and urged diplomatic engagement in the Middle East. Germany's strong commitment to international institutions and multilateral frameworks influences its foreign policy decisions. It supports a unified international front in dealing with Iran and calls for increased cooperation to address global security threats. Germany urges U.S. leaders to enhance multilateral engagement and join international treaties like the International Criminal Court and climate change agreements. Germany's commitment to international institutions and multilateral frameworks influences its foreign policy decisions. Recent developments suggest that German leaders may be hesitant to increase military engagement abroad, focusing instead on civilian components for peacekeeping missions within NATO and the EU. However, there is a notable gap between Germany's foreign policy goals and its actions, particularly in defense spending and reform. The ongoing debate on military participation in Afghanistan continues. Germany's ongoing debate on military participation in Afghanistan has revealed a lack of domestic consensus on foreign and security policy goals. Germans are cautious about linking reconstruction and development with combat operations, leading to a reevaluation of German military engagement in unstable security conditions. Calls for reassessment of military engagement rules could impact Germany's ability to partner in multilateral missions worldwide. Germany aims to find a middle path between NATO and the EU. Germany aims to find a \"middle path\" between NATO and the EU, promoting an independent European foreign and defense policy as a complement to NATO. U.S. administrations have supported European defense capability through ESDP, but also emphasized tying EU defense policy to NATO. Some Germans question U.S. commitment to NATO and prefer pursuing collective interests within the Alliance. Domestic politics and public opinion in Germany could shape U.S.-German relations. President Obama's popularity in Germany is notable. President Obama's popularity in Germany reflects a positive view of the new U.S. Administration's foreign policy. However, policy differences between the two countries persist, especially in economic stimulus measures and troop deployment in Afghanistan/Pakistan. German leaders have resisted calls for increased domestic spending and sending more than 500 additional combat troops. Germany is the largest economy in Europe and a key trade partner of the United States. Total trade between the countries in 2008 was $152 billion, with the US exporting $54.5 billion worth of goods to Germany. German exports to the US totaled $97.5 billion, with the US being the top destination for German foreign direct investment. President Obama's popularity in Germany contrasts with policy differences, including disagreements on troop deployment in Afghanistan. Germany is the largest economy in Europe and a key trade partner of the United States. U.S. firms have significant investments in Germany, employing 800,000 Germans, while 670,000 Americans work for German firms in the U.S. Despite strong economic and trade ties, differences have emerged during the global financial crisis, with U.S. officials criticizing Germany's response to the economic downturn. German officials have taken substantial action to stimulate their economy, valued at over $100 billion for 2009 and 2010. They argue that domestic spending measures will not address the root of the problem, which they see as inadequate regulation of global financial markets. U.S.-German cooperation in counterterrorism is considered close and effective, with Germany identifying radical Islamic terrorism as a primary threat to national security. Germany has identified radical Islamic terrorism as a primary threat to its national security and has implemented laws to limit terrorists' activities. In 2007, then-Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble proposed counterterrorism initiatives, including increased surveillance and domestic military deployment in case of an attack. However, his proposals were not adopted due to concerns about personal privacy and civil liberties. In 2010, Germany's highest court ruled a data-retention law unconstitutional, which would have required telecommunications companies to retain citizens' phone records. In March 2010, German authorities foiled a terrorist plot targeting Ramstein Airbase and other U.S. military locations. Three German citizens and a Turkish resident were convicted. The court ruled against a data retention law, citing personal privacy concerns. Intelligence cooperation between Germany and the U.S. was praised as the closest it has ever been. The discovery of the plot raised concerns about future attacks in Germany. In Germany, there are discussions about potential future attacks, leading to differing opinions on antiterrorism measures. Some believe attacks may pressure a withdrawal of German troops from Afghanistan. German officials are optimistic about the Obama Administration's shift from the \"Global War on Terror\" label. They emphasize multilateral cooperation and adherence to international law in combating terrorism. Germany supports a comprehensive U.N. anti-terrorism convention and welcomed the closure of Guantanamo Bay prison. The Obama Administration requested Germany to house nine Guantanamo Bay detainees, causing concern within the German government due to fears of diplomatic disputes with China and security risks. Some German officials support the decision but worry about justifying it to the public. Germany, like other European countries, supports closing Guantanamo Bay and emphasizes multilateral cooperation in combating terrorism. Germany, along with other European countries, views the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a key issue in the Middle East. Chancellor Merkel advocates for a German Middle East policy supporting Israel's right to exist, a two-state solution, EU-wide peace efforts, and U.S. engagement in the region. Germany is actively involved in international negotiations to address Iran's nuclear ambitions and has provided funding for Iraqi reconstruction. Considered one of Israel's closest allies, Germany is its second-largest trading partner. Germany, a close ally of Israel, maintains strong defense and scientific cooperation, cultural ties, and people-to-people exchanges with Israel. It is a supporter of Israel within the EU while also earning the trust of Palestinians. Germany has been a significant donor to the Palestinian Authority and facilitated a prisoner exchange between Hezbollah and Israel in 2008. Like other EU states, Germany advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Germany supports a sustainable, two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to ensure Israel's security and stability in the Middle East. German officials urge the Obama Administration to lead peace negotiations. Germany backs EU and U.S. efforts to isolate Hamas but some experts suggest engagement for progress. Germany, part of the EU-3, works to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and seeks international consensus on stricter sanctions. Germany, part of the EU-3, seeks international consensus on stricter sanctions against Iran, emphasizing the importance of Chinese and Russian support. Recent reports suggest a possible ban on gasoline exports to Iran. Merkel and Foreign Minister Westerwelle have criticized the Iranian regime and advocated for increased sanctions since her reelection. The German government opposes a military response and welcomes full U.S. participation in nuclear talks with Iran led by the EU. Germany, part of the EU-3, supports stricter sanctions against Iran and emphasizes the importance of Chinese and Russian backing. Despite being a strong critic of the Ahmadinejad government, Germany faces pressure to limit commercial ties with Iran. Trade between Germany and Iran has seen fluctuations, with exports to Iran decreasing by 17% in the current year. German exports to Iran have decreased by 17% this year. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank AG have exited the Iranian market, and export credit guarantees for companies in Iran have dropped significantly since 2005. The Merkel government is investigating Siemens for potential export control law violations, including a seizure of turbo compressors believed to aid Iran's nuclear program. This suggests increasing economic pressure on Tehran. While some see decreasing German exports to Iran as a sign of Berlin's intent to increase economic pressure on Tehran, others argue that German-Iranian trade remains strong and that Berlin is unlikely to further reduce commercial ties. Germany's contributions to ISAF in Afghanistan have been criticized for a perceived reluctance to engage in combat, with calls for more flexibility for its deployed forces. Germany has resisted sending combat troops to southern Afghanistan but plans to enhance training of Afghan National Security Forces in the north and double resources for civilian reconstruction efforts. Chancellor Angela Merkel faces low public support for the Afghan mission and aims to gradually reduce military presence over the next four years. Germany's strategy will focus on training ANSF and supporting civilian reconstruction priorities. This was announced at a January 2010 international conference on Afghanistan in London. Germany announced plans to send 500 to 850 additional troops to Afghanistan and committed \u20ac50 million to the Reintegration Fund. They aim to reduce troop presence by late 2011 and transfer security responsibility to the Afghan government by 2014. Germany currently has 4,300 troops in ISAF, focusing on stability operations in the northern region. They lead Regional Command North, operate a forward support base in Mazar-E-Sharif, and oversee two Provincial Reconstruction Teams. Additionally, Germany staffs a 200-man Quick Reaction Force for emergency combat situations. Germany plans to disband its 200-man Quick Reaction Force and deploy an additional 500 military trainers to focus on training the Afghan National Army's 209th corps. This shift is part of a larger effort to establish three ANA brigades and supplement the eight German Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams currently training ANA units. In 2009, Berlin contributed \u20ac50 million to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund. German forces in the northern sector are authorized to engage in combat operations as part of their defense strategy. German forces in the northern sector are authorized to engage in combat operations as part of their defense strategy. German commanders have shown a willingness to engage in offensive operations, but face criticism for staying within their PRTs and Forward Operating bases. A controversial NATO airstrike in 2009 led to increased scrutiny of the German military's role in Afghanistan. Germany is also focusing on enhancing training for the Afghan National Army and police forces. Germany is increasing the number of trainers in police training centers for Afghan officers. They also participate in the Focused District Development Programme and the EU police-training mission. However, the EU mission has faced personnel problems and a lack of coordination. Germany previously shared responsibility for police training with the United States. Some criticized their efforts for being too narrow in impact. Germany plans to double annual resources for reconstruction in Afghanistan from \u20ac220 to \u20ac430 million through 2013. The focus is on long-term development projects and quick-impact measures to benefit the local population, including job creation, infrastructure improvements, access to energy and water, and teacher training. Germany plans to double resources for reconstruction in Afghanistan to \u20ac430 million by 2013, focusing on long-term development projects and quick-impact measures in northern provinces."
