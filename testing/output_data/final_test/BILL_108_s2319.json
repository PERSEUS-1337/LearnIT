    "content": "The \"Tapoco Project Licensing Act of 2004\" defines key terms such as APGI, Commission, Map, Park, Project, and Secretary for the Tapoco Hydroelectric Project in Tennessee. SEC. 3. LAND EXCHANGE. Upon conveyance of title by APGI acceptable to the Secretary, the Secretary shall convey title to APGI for approximately 186 acres of land within the Park. The land to be conveyed by APGI is located northeast of United States Highway 129 and adjacent to the APGI power line. The land to be conveyed by the Secretary to APGI is approximately 110 acres within the Park. The Secretary and APGI may agree on minor adjustments to the 110 acres of land within the Park adjacent to the Chilhowee Reservoir. If the land is deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the Park, APGI can make it suitable. The Secretary will reserve a conservation easement over any land transferred to APGI. The conservation easement over land transferred to APGI prohibits development except for maintenance of the Chilhowee Reservoir, allows public access, and authorizes the National Park Service to enforce regulations. Public Law 90-401 does not apply to the land exchange. The deed from the Secretary to APGI includes a provision for reversion of land if the Chilhowee Reservoir ceases to exist or the Project is decommissioned. APGI remains responsible for complying with the Federal Power Act. The Secretary will adjust the Park boundary to include exchanged land. The Secretary will administer acquired land as part of the Park in accordance with applicable law. National park service land described in subsection (a)(3) will remain within the Park boundary. The Secretary will publish notice of any boundary revisions in the Federal Register. SEC. 4. PROJECT LICENSING. The Commission will have jurisdiction to license the Project despite the land exchange. SEC. 5. LAND ACQUISITION. The Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture may acquire land or interests in land that can be transferred to non-governmental organizations, as identified on a specific map. The Secretary of the Interior will adjust the Park's boundary to include any acquired land and administer it according to applicable laws, publishing notice of the adjustment in the Federal Register. The Secretary of Agriculture will adjust the boundary of the Cherokee National Forest to include acquired land, administer it according to laws, and evaluate managing it to retain its primitive character. Notice of the adjustment will be published in the Federal Register. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Act."
