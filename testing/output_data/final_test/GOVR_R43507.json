    "content": "As Congress debates housing finance reform, the role of the federal government in supporting affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households, particularly through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is a key issue. These government-sponsored enterprises have special privileges and responsibilities, including providing support for affordable housing. Various proposals for reform include the PATH Act, HOME Forward Act, and the Johnson-Crapo GSE Reform Proposal. While proposals like the PATH Act, HOME Forward Act, and the Johnson-Crapo GSE Reform Proposal agree on dissolving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, there is disagreement on what should replace them, particularly regarding support for affordable housing. Some argue for government support through existing programs like the FHA and HUD, while others believe a new system should not have the hybrid nature of the GSEs. The report discusses how GSEs currently support affordable housing and outlines different reform proposals. For a comprehensive overview of the housing finance system, refer to CRS Report R42995. For detailed housing finance reform proposals, see CRS Report R43219. Congress is concerned about the availability of affordable housing. The availability of affordable housing is a key concern for Congress. Affordable housing is defined as housing that costs no more than 30% of a household's income. Households that spend more than 30% or 50% of their income on housing are considered cost burdened. Low- and moderate-income households struggle the most to find affordable housing. Affordable housing is crucial for low- and moderate-income households, with different income thresholds defining low, very low, and extremely low-income households. Affordable housing can be rental or owner-occupied, with a shortage of physically adequate and affordable rental housing for the lowest income households. According to HUD, in 2011, there were 93 adequate, affordable, and available rental units for every 100 low-income households. The availability decreased for very low-income and extremely low-income households. Affordable housing can also be owner-occupied, especially for moderate-income households or in areas with limited rental housing options. Congress has established federal programs to increase the availability of affordable housing for low-income households, including rental assistance programs and block grants administered by HUD. Underserved market segments may include low- and moderate-income or minority households, those in high-poverty neighborhoods or rural areas, and those seeking non-traditional housing options. Congress has established federal programs to support affordable rental housing and homeownership, including mortgage insurance through FHA for creditworthy borrowers. FHA serves first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minority households. Additionally, FHA insures mortgages on multifamily buildings to increase the supply of affordable rental housing. The GSEs are directed by Congress to support affordable housing by purchasing single-family and multifamily mortgages for low- and moderate-income households. Their business model aims to support the mortgage market, with a focus on assisting low- and moderate-income households. The report discusses three main channels of support, primarily targeting homeownership over rental housing. The GSEs are mandated by Congress to provide support for affordable housing through affordable housing goals and a \"duty to serve\" requirement. The goals set numerical standards for focusing on low-income borrowers and underserved areas, while the duty to serve requirement focuses on assisting low-income households in manufactured housing, affordable housing preservation, and rural markets. Contributions to two initiatives were also directed by Congress in 2008. The GSEs were directed by Congress in 2008 to make contributions to affordable housing funds, but these contributions were suspended after the GSEs were placed in conservatorship. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 established affordable housing goals for the GSEs, which were later replaced by new goals under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established affordable housing goals for the GSEs, focusing on lower-income borrowers to increase homeownership rates among those less likely to own a home. The goals include the low-income home purchase goal, very low-income home purchase goal, and low-income areas home purchase subgoal. The GSEs have affordable housing goals targeting low-income households for home purchase and refinance. These goals include the low-income areas home purchase subgoal, low-income areas home purchase goal, and low-income refinance goal. The GSEs can meet these goals by either meeting a benchmark set by FHFA or ensuring the goal category's share of their business is sufficient. The GSEs have affordable housing goals for low-income households in home purchase and refinance. They can meet these goals by meeting a benchmark set by FHFA or ensuring their business share aligns with the market share. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac met the single-family housing goals in 2012 by performing above the Benchmark Level, with Fannie Mae meeting the Market Level for the low-income home purchase goal. The GSEs have multifamily goals in addition to single-family goals. The multifamily goals focus on providing affordable housing for low-income and very-low income households. Unlike the single-family goals, the multifamily goals must meet a Benchmark Level set by FHFA and do not have a Market Level compliance option. The GSEs must meet Benchmark Levels set by FHFA for multifamily housing goals. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both met the goals in 2012. Failure to meet goals may result in housing plans or penalties imposed by FHFA. GSEs also have a duty to serve requirement established by HERA. The GSEs have a duty to serve requirement under HERA, which includes providing leadership in developing loan products and flexible underwriting guidelines for underserved markets such as manufactured housing, affordable housing preservation, and rural markets. FHFA evaluates the GSEs' compliance with this requirement by considering the development of loan products, outreach to qualified borrowers, and innovative financing approaches. The FHFA evaluates the GSEs' compliance with the duty to serve requirement by assessing their outreach, financing, and investments in underserved markets. Additionally, the GSEs support affordable housing through contributions to the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund established by HERA. The Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund, established by HERA, aim to increase affordable housing for low-income households. Critics argue they may duplicate other federal programs and be used for special interests. The Housing Trust Fund provides formula funding for rental housing for very low- and extremely low-income households, while the Capital Magnet Fund focuses on increasing rental housing for the lowest income groups. The Magnet Fund, administered by the Treasury's CDFI Fund, provides competitive funding to nonprofit housing organizations for affordable housing for low-income households. It aims to leverage funds for affordable housing development. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fund the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund. Contributions are based on the unpaid principal balance of new mortgages purchased by the GSEs. The Director of FHFA can suspend contributions under certain circumstances related to the GSEs' financial situation. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by FHFA. Shortly after, FHFA directed them to suspend contributions to affordable housing funds. The Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund have received limited funding, with the latter receiving $80 million in FY2010. The Housing Trust Fund aims to increase housing opportunities for low-income renters. The Housing Trust Fund aims to increase housing opportunities for extremely low-and very low-income renters and homeowners through formula-based distribution of funds. Factors considered include the availability of affordable rental units, overcrowding, lack of basic facilities, and high housing costs relative to income. The Housing Trust Fund distributes funds to states based on factors like the number of low-income renter households spending over 50% of income on rent. States must receive a minimum grant of $3 million and can designate an entity to administer the funds. Recipients can be for-profit or nonprofit organizations with affordable housing experience, and funds must primarily be used for rental housing for low-income families. The Housing Trust Fund distributes funds to states for rental housing for low-income families. States must use at least 80% of the grant for rental housing and no more than 10% for homeownership. Funds must benefit households with very low incomes, with a focus on extremely low-income households. Administrative costs are limited to 10% of the grant amount. No funds can be used for political activities, advocacy, lobbying, counseling services, or travel expenses. The Capital Magnet Fund provides competitive funds to affordable housing organizations, leveraging private capital for investment in housing for low-income households. Funds can be used for developing, preserving, rehabilitating, or purchasing affordable housing, as well as financing economic development activities or community service facilities. Eligible organizations must be CDFIs or qualified nonprofits with affordable housing as a principal purpose. The Capital Magnet Fund provides funds for affordable housing organizations to finance economic development activities or community service facilities. Awardees must ensure that more than 50% of project costs are used for housing affordable to low-income households. The fund aims to leverage funding for affordable housing activities. The Capital Magnet Fund aims to fund projects for affordable housing activities, with costs at least 10 times the received funds. Activities funded include loan funds, loan reserves, and risk-sharing loans. Limits are set on grant usage for economic development, community service facilities, and administrative expenses. Prohibited uses include political activities, advocacy, lobbying, travel expenses, tax return advice, and counseling. The Fund received $80 million in funding through a discretionary appropriation. The CDFI Fund received $80 million in funding from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. 23 grantees in 14 states received grants ranging from $500,000 to $6 million. Nine were CDFIs, 13 were nonprofit housing organizations, and one was a tribal housing authority. The funds aimed to serve households in 38 states and the District of Columbia, with over 20% expected to benefit non-metropolitan areas. The Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund have similar goals but differ in fund distribution, target income groups, and focus on rental housing. The GSEs' support for affordable housing focuses on increasing homeownership rates for specific market segments. Some argue that this support had negative effects on the economy by causing underwriting standards to decline and increasing high-risk loans beyond market levels. The government's direction for GSEs to focus on lower-income borrowers led to an increase in risky loans, contributing to the housing bubble. This resulted in financial harm to the population they were meant to help. The role of GSEs in the financial crisis is debated, with a focus on whether their affordable housing goals led to increased lending to low-income households. The research literature suggests that GSEs' affordable housing goals had limited impact on lending to low-income households. Studies by Jaffe and Quigley, as well as Dynan and Gayer, indicate that HUD housing goals did not significantly increase homeownership among lower-income families. The GSEs' affordable housing mission had limited effects on the supply of affordable housing, according to recent analyses. Studies show little relationship between GSE secondary-market purchases and home price appreciation. Household characteristics, rather than credit barrier policies, were attributed to the increase in homeownership in the 1990s. The effects of GSE activities on homeownership rates, vacancy rates, and median house values in California showed limited evidence of improved housing market performance. Studies suggest that GSEs have not significantly impacted homeownership among low-income and underserved families. Bhutta and Bolotnyy's analyses on the Underserved Areas Goal found only a limited effect on GSE purchases and total mortgage credit flow, with Bolotnyy reporting a smaller impact on affordable housing. Levitin and Ratcliffe examined the GSEs' housing goals and the Community Reinvestment Act, finding limited effects on affordable housing support. The authors analyzed the GSEs' housing goals and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to expand credit availability in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. They suggest that these efforts have had a modest positive effect but may have qualitatively impacted credit availability in these communities. The studies on pre-HERA goals' effects on homeownership indicate that HERA goals may be more effective for low-income households. However, a 2010 CBO study notes that reducing interest rates may not be the most effective way to help low-income households. The most effective way to help low-income households with homeownership is by reducing down payment requirements. Small reductions in interest rates have only marginal effects on rates of home ownership, as down payments are a bigger obstacle for first-time buyers. Congress is considering proposals to reform the housing finance system and faces questions about affordable housing support. Should federal support for affordable housing be left to existing government programs or should a new entity be created? If a new entity is needed, what form should the support take - rental housing, homeownership, or both? Should the support target specific market segments like low-income households, certain geographic areas, or certain types of housing? Should the support be provided directly or through incentives for the private market? These questions need to be addressed when considering affordable housing support. The PATH Act proposes to wind down the GSEs and replace them with a National Mortgage Market Utility without a government guarantee. It also modifies existing government mortgage insurance programs like FHA and eliminates certain regulations hindering the mortgage recovery. The PATH Act aims to reform FHA by making it an independent agency, improving its finances, targeting its role in the mortgage market, and increasing private capital. It would repeal GSEs' affordable housing goals and contributions, redirecting support for affordable housing to existing programs like those administered by HUD. FHA would continue to support low- and moderate-income and first-time homebuyers under the PATH Act. The reformed FHA under the Johnson-Crapo GSE Reform Proposal would support low- and moderate-income and first-time homebuyers, serve underserved markets, develop new mortgage products, and ensure affordability for multifamily mortgages. The Johnson-Crapo GSE Reform Proposal aims to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC), which would provide reinsurance on eligible mortgage-backed securities with a government guarantee. The proposal includes provisions for affordable housing, such as repealing Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's affordable housing goals. The Johnson-Crapo GSE Reform Proposal aims to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC). The proposal includes repealing Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's affordable housing goals and replacing them with an annual fee on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) directed to three different funds. FMIC would allocate collected fees to HUD's Housing Trust Fund, Treasury's Capital Magnet Fund, and a newly created Market Access Fund. The Housing Trust Fund would be modified to provide funds competitively to tribes for affordable housing activities under NAHASDA. The Capital Magnet Fund would consider housing needs of tribes. A new Market Access Fund would support research and credit for affordable housing benefiting low- and moderate-income households. Grants from the Market Access Fund could be used for research, loans, and grants. The Market Access Fund offers grants and loans for research, development, and testing of mortgage innovations or consumer education. It provides credit support for eligible mortgages or mortgage-backed securities, limited to households at or below 120% of area median income. Additionally, it offers support for affordable rental and homeownership programs, including manufactured housing, to increase sustainable homeownership and affordable rental housing for low-income households. The Market Access Fund provides grants and loans for mortgage innovations and consumer education. The FMIC would report annually on funded activities and impose penalties for misuse of funds. The purpose of FMIC is to facilitate mortgage credit availability and the secondary mortgage market. The FMIC aims to facilitate mortgage credit availability and secondary mortgage market financing for eligible borrowers across various regions, localities, institutions, and property types. The Office of Consumer and Market Access within FMIC administers the Market Access Fund, monitors housing finance markets, and coordinates with federal agencies on affordable housing. It also assesses the government-guaranteed market's support for borrowers, especially those in need. The government-guaranteed portion of the market supports borrowers in underserved markets and provides recommendations to address credit availability deficiencies. OCMA will conduct a biennial study on incentives for lenders to serve underserved markets and consult with entities supporting small lenders. FMIC will identify up to eight underserved market segments lacking equitable access to the FMIC-guaranteed market, including rural and urban areas, manufactured housing, small balance loans, and low- to moderate-income creditworthy borrowers. The FMIC-guaranteed system aims to provide credit to underserved market segments such as small balance loans and low- to moderate-income creditworthy borrowers. Approved guarantors and aggregators must submit annual reports on their efforts. The multifamily system under the Johnson-Crapo GSE Reform Proposal includes affordability requirements to increase the supply of affordable rental housing, with at least 60% of units being affordable to low-income families. The FMIC-guaranteed multifamily MBS would be affordable to low-income families at the time the mortgages were originated. The FMIC may suspend or adjust the 60% level during unusual market conditions. Comparison to the GSEs' Three Channels shows the proposal repealing affordable housing goals with the only remaining target being affordability for multifamily. The FMIC aims to facilitate broad availability of mortgage credit and identify underserved market segments. The FMIC proposal aims to facilitate broad availability of mortgage credit and identify underserved market segments. It includes the establishment of the Market Access Fund and increased contributions to affordable housing funds. The HOME Forward Act would wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The HOME Forward Act would replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the National Mortgage Finance Administration (NMFA), which would provide an explicit government guarantee on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by the Mortgage Securities Cooperative (MSC). The NMFA would regulate the mortgage market and establish a new multifamily housing finance system, with provisions for affordable housing. The HOME Forward Act would repeal Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's affordable housing goals and replace them with an annual fee on MBS. The fee would be directed to three funds: 75% to the Housing Trust Fund, 15% to the Capital Magnet Fund, and 10% to the Market Access Fund. Modifications would ensure funds for rural areas and limit homeownership activities to 5% of the Housing Trust Fund. The Capital Magnet Fund remains unchanged, and the Market Access Fund aims to promote innovation. The Market Access Fund under the HOME Forward Act aims to promote innovation in housing finance and affordability by providing grants and loans for sustainable homeownership and affordable rental programs for families with incomes at or below 120% of AMI. It also includes limited credit enhancement and support for products and services to increase homeownership and affordable rental housing. Additionally, it provides grants and loans for redeveloping abandoned and foreclosed properties in areas of greatest need, while ensuring funds from the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund are not used for prohibited purposes. The NMFA bill aims to provide access to affordable mortgage credit and establish guidelines for evaluating compliance with responsibilities. The MSC would facilitate a secondary market for eligible mortgages, with penalties for non-compliance. The multifamily system would prioritize at least 60 percent of total resources. The proposal under the NMFA bill aims to ensure that at least 60 percent of financed dwelling units are affordable to households earning not more than 80 percent of the area median income. This target is similar to the GSEs' affordability levels for multifamily housing. The proposal does not include a duty to serve requirement for specific underserved markets but focuses on providing access to affordable mortgage credit. The HOME Forward proposal aims to facilitate a robust secondary market for eligible mortgages, including underserved markets. It would modify the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Market Fund, establish the Market Access Fund, and increase contributions to the funds. The total amount allocated to affordable housing funds would depend on the securitized mortgage volume. Both the Johnson-Crapo and HOME Forward proposals would raise fees to fund affordable housing. The HOME Forward Act and Johnson-Crapo proposal would increase fees for affordable housing funds to 10 basis points from 4.2. They both allocate funding to Housing Trust Fund, Capital Magnet Fund, and Market Access Fund, with varying fee structures. The Johnson-Crapo proposal and HOME Forward Act allocate funds to tribes and rural areas through the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund. Both proposals establish a Market Access Fund with similar purposes, but with differences in eligible activities. For example, HOME Forward allows funds to be used for property redevelopment, while Johnson-Crapo allows funds for housing counseling and market incentives. The Market Access Fund will be used for housing counseling and incentives for underserved areas, benefiting households with incomes up to 120% of AMI. A comparison of the Housing Trust Fund, Capital Magnet Fund, and Market Access Fund is provided in Table 3."
