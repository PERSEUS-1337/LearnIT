The Congress recognizes the significance of the Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and Preservation District as a key location in African-American history. It is the most visited historic site in Georgia and the 3rd most visited in the National Park Service. The lack of a comprehensive context for interpreting African-American history hinders understanding of America's past and future. African-American history is complex, encompassing experiences from slavery to cultural achievements. The expansion of a national museum on African-American history will help all Americans appreciate their significant contributions. The African-American Panoramic Experience Museum is also important in preserving this history. The African-American Panoramic Experience Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, is part of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Historic Site. It houses its own African-American Collection and hosts exhibitions on African-American art and culture. Adjacent to the museum, the Atlanta Fulton County African American Research Library is being constructed to serve as a primary research location for African-American studies and history in the Atlanta region. The Apex (African American Panoramic Experience) Center is undergoing rehabilitation and expansion. The Secretary authorizes a grant for the rehabilitation and expansion of The APEX in Atlanta, Georgia, to complement the Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and Preservation District. The grant aims to enhance the presentation of African-American contributions to American history and culture. The grant for The APEX in Atlanta aims to expand the facility to serve as a visitors center for the Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and Preservation District, and as an international center showcasing African-American achievements. The APEX in Atlanta offers galleries, exhibitions, multivideo presentations, and an archive collection reflecting African and African-American life. The African American Panoramic Experience Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, known as APEX, is defined in the Act. The Act authorizes $12,500,000 for the Secretary of the Interior to rehabilitate and expand The APEX in fiscal year 1994."
