Key members include the President, Vice President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of Energy. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence are advisers. The NSC staff plays a significant role in policy formulation and implementation. The National Security Council (NSC) staff and the National Security Adviser have been influential in national security policy formulation. The NSC's organization and influence have varied across different administrations, with Congress enacting statutes to shape its membership and activities. Successful national security policymaking involves careful analysis of various factors such as diplomatic, economic, intelligence, military, and morale. Government leaders aim to achieve their goals by selecting the most appropriate policy instrument, whether it be military, diplomatic, economic, intelligence services, or a combination. Senate confirmation of the National Security Adviser has been discussed but not implemented, and historically, U.S. Presidents focused more on domestic matters before World War II. In the early 1940s, the need for structured national security decision-making arose due to global war complexities and the necessity to collaborate with allies. This led to the establishment of an organizational entity to assist the President in addressing military, diplomatic, and postwar decisions. The postwar years saw the United States taking on worldwide responsibilities involving diplomacy, military forces, intelligence agencies, and economic assistance. The United States established organizational mechanisms to analyze the international environment and recommend policy options in response to evolving responsibilities involving diplomacy, military forces, intelligence agencies, and economic assistance. The end of the Cold War brought new international concerns like terrorism and drug trafficking, requiring coordination among various departments and agencies for national security policies. Congress is interested in the processes and roles in determining policies, as poor coordination can lead to calls for action. Effective coordination of national security policy is crucial to achieve policy goals with minimal losses. Historically, U.S. policy coordination centered on the President, who has broad powers in foreign affairs. The Constitution designates the President as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, with expanded powers in the 20th century. Limited foreign involvements in the early years allowed for small Armed Forces and relative geographic isolation. The Council of National Defense was established in 1916 to address the new demands of World War I, focusing on economic mobilization and coordination. It consisted of the Secretaries of War, Navy, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, with the President able to appoint an advisory commission of specialists to aid the council. The exclusion of the Secretary of State limited its coordinative scope. The Council of National Defense, established in 1916 for World War I, focused on economic mobilization. It was disbanded in 1921 but set a precedent for future coordination efforts. In 1938, Secretary of State Cordell Hull proposed a standing committee for liaison and coordination due to growing threats to national security. The Standing Liaison Committee, approved by the President, consisted of the Under Secretary of State, Chief of Staff of the Army, and Chief of Naval Operations. It focused on Latin American issues but was limited in its effectiveness and eventually replaced by other coordination methods. President Roosevelt established the National Defense Advisory Council (NDAC) in May 1940, composed of private citizens with expertise in specific economic sectors to handle economic mobilization issues during wartime. This organization succeeded the Standing Liaison Committee and was followed by other interdepartmental committees formed to address various coordination challenges. President Roosevelt established various interdepartmental committees to address coordination challenges during wartime. However, these committees faced issues with achieving coordination due to their multiplicity and indirect advisory role to the President. Roosevelt primarily ran the war through the Joint Chiefs of Staff and key advisers, evolving into a more coordinated body by 1945 with the creation of the State, War, Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC). SWNCC had its own secretariat and played a significant role in coordination efforts. The State, War, Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC) was established during World War II to aid in political-military coordination among the three departments. It operated through the end of the war and evolved into SANACC after the National Security Act of 1947. SWNCC was dissolved in 1949, superseded by the NSC, reflecting the government's recognition of the need for improved coordination. The National Security Council (NSC) was established as part of a larger restructuring of the national security apparatus after World War II. It was recognized that the previous system of informal consultations was inadequate for the complex demands of global war and the postwar world. The NSC was created to improve coordination among civilian and military efforts, including intelligence, as outlined in the National Security Act of 1947. The NSC was established as part of a larger reorganization of the national security apparatus after World War II. General George C. Marshall proposed a unified military establishment in 1943, with Congress considering the idea in 1944. The Navy opposed the idea, but President Truman favored some reorganization by 1945. Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal believed the State Department had to be included in any new national security apparatus. Ferdinand Eberstadt, a New York attorney and banker, investigated the formation of the NSC at the request of Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. Eberstadt proposed the creation of the National Security Council (NSC) and the National Security Resources Board (NSRB) to coordinate civilian and military elements for national security. Ferdinand Eberstadt recommended the creation of the National Security Council (NSC) and the National Security Resources Board (NSRB) to coordinate civilian and military elements for national security. Eberstadt also suggested the establishment of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under the NSC, which laid the groundwork for the national security apparatus. The NSC served as a negotiating point for James Forrestal with the Army, helping to build public support for foreign and military policies. War-Navy negotiations on reorganization took place throughout 1946 and 1947, with central coordination not being a contentious issue. The creation of the National Security Council (NSC) was one of the least controversial sections of the National Security Act. The major issues during debate were the mechanics of the new organization, its membership, ensuring civilian control, and approval of future NSC positions. The National Security Council (NSC) was created by the National Security Act in 1947 to advise the President on integrating domestic, foreign, and military policies for national security coordination. The National Security Council (NSC) was established in 1947 by the National Security Act to advise the President on military power, national security objectives, and policy recommendations. Members include the President, Secretaries of State and Defense, and other designated officers. The Council assesses risks and makes recommendations to the President as needed. The National Security Act of 1947 established the National Security Council (NSC) to advise the President on military power and national security objectives. The NSC included designated officers such as secretaries of executive departments and the Chairmen of the Munitions Board and Research and Development Board. The NSC was provided with a staff headed by a civilian executive secretary appointed by the President. The act also created the Central Intelligence Agency under the NSC, but the Director of Central Intelligence was not an NSC member. Additionally, the act established a National Military Establishment with three executive departments (Army, Navy, Air Force) under a Secretary of Defense, with the implicit role of ensuring the U.S. industrial base could support national security strategies. The National Security Council (NSC) was initially established to advise the President on military power and national security objectives. It included designated officers and a staff headed by a civilian executive secretary. Over time, defense mobilization and civil defense issues were transferred to other federal agencies, and the NSC's membership was limited to key officials. The NSC evolved to focus on national security policy, bringing together top diplomatic, military, and resource personnel with the President. The addition of the CIA, subordinate to the NSC, further enhanced coordination and organization. The National Security Council (NSC) evolved to advise the President on national security policy, with the addition of the CIA for intelligence support. It is a malleable organization, adapting to each President's style and wishes. The NSC's primary functions include advising on domestic, foreign, and military policies to enhance national security cooperation among government agencies. The National Security Council (NSC) advises the President on national security policy, assessing objectives, risks, and making policy recommendations. Since its establishment in 1947, the NSC has evolved into a complex system of coordination and policy formulation among government departments and agencies. The National Security Council (NSC) is the President's advisory body on national and international security matters, established in the 1947 National Security Act. The NSC's statutory members include the President, Vice President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of Energy, with other senior officials participating at the President's request. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence serve as statutory advisors. The NSC is chaired by the President and its activities are coordinated by the National Security Adviser (NSA). The National Security Council (NSC) is coordinated by the Presidentially appointed National Security Adviser (NSA) and supported by a National Security Staff (NSS). The NSC is organized into offices focusing on strategic issues and ad hoc working groups. Each President configures the NSC to address risks to U.S. global security interests. The size of the NSC staff and ratio of political appointees to detailees vary with each Administration. Congress limited the number of policy-focused individuals on the NSC staff to 200 in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The National Security Council (NSC) is supported by the National Security Staff (NSS) and decision-making committees are organized to discuss national security matters. The Principals Committee (PC) is convened by the National Security Advisor and includes heads of relevant departments or agencies. The Deputies Committee (DC) is convened by the Deputy National Security Advisor and includes deputy heads of departments involved in the subject matter. Policy Coordination Committees (PCC) manage national security matters at the Assistant Secretary level. Different Administrations have used various titles for these committees. The National Security Council system allows the President flexibility in creating a security advisory body. Congress has limited oversight over the Executive Office of the President and the NSC. Some argue that the National Security Adviser should be subject to Senate confirmation, while others believe the President should have confidential advice from immediate staff. The Trump Administration issued NSPM-4 on April 4, 2017, detailing the organization of the National Security Council and Homeland Security Council. NSPM-4 manages national security issues among relevant departments and agencies, building upon NSPM-2 from January 28, 2017. Key observations include the roles of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence at NSC and PC meetings. The Obama Administration made CJCS and DNI \"regular members\" of the Principals Committee, departing from the George W. Bush Administration's formula. The Trump Administration's reversion to the Bush formulation caused controversy, with concerns about a potential diminution of the CJCS and DNI's roles in senior national security meetings. Despite this, the CJCS maintained that he would \"remain a full participant\" in the national security interagency process. NSPM-4 reverts to the Obama Administration formula, including CJCS and DNI as regular attendees of NSC and PC meetings. The Director of the CIA is also included. The inclusion of the Chief Strategist as a regular attendee is a new development by the Trump Administration. The Trump Administration is the first to include a political adviser as a regular attendee of NSC and PC meetings, despite the law being silent on this. The Secretary of Energy was initially excluded from PC meetings but is now invited as a regular attendee. This change was made with NSPM-4. The NSC and HSC have had different approaches under various administrations. President Bush focused separately on international and domestic security, while President Obama merged them into a National Security Staff. The Trump Administration includes a political adviser in NSC and PC meetings. The Secretary of Energy is now a regular attendee at these meetings. The Trump Administration retains both an NSC and an HSC, with the National Security Advisor having authority over both entities. The NSC and HSC have had different approaches under various administrations, with President Obama merging them into a National Security Staff. The Secretary of Energy is now a regular attendee at NSC and HSC meetings. The Trump Administration has made changes to the National Security Council (NSC) and Presidential Council (PC) meetings, including inviting the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and NSC Executive Secretary as regular attendees. The Representative of the United States to the United Nations also remains a regular attendee at NSC meetings. The USUN representative was first placed on the NSC by the Clinton Administration, removed by the George W. Bush Administration, and reinstated by the Obama Administration. The 1947 National Security Act established the NSC to advise the President on integrating domestic, foreign, and military policies for national security. Presidents have flexibility in structuring and using the NSC. The NSC staff's activities now extend beyond policy advice, involving White House for precise execution of policy. The rise in transnational threats and military campaigns has led to whole-of-government responses coordinated by the NSC, increasing its involvement in complex international security crises. The NSC's expanding role has raised questions about its appropriate size and scope. Two primary schools of thought exist on necessary reforms, with one emphasizing the need for greater synchronization and integration of national power instruments at the NSC level. This view argues that policy synchronization is now primarily happening at the NSC due to insufficient interagency coordination mechanisms, leading to the NSS's growth to manage U.S. policy complexity and prevent policy \"immobilization\" in the interagency. Some believe the NSC needs legislation to right-size and coordinate executive branch departments, while others argue the enlarged NSC staff leads to inappropriate operational roles. The NSC staff has grown significantly, with some advocating for a reduction to focus on strategy formulation and implementation monitoring. During the Obama Administration, NSA Rice reduced its size by 10% to address concerns of micromanagement by junior staff. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act debates included provisions to limit the NSC staff size, with a proposed cap of 100 professional staff members. The NSC staff size is limited to 150 professional staff members, including detailees, under S. 2943 \u00a71089 (P.L. 114-328). There are debates on whether the NSA should be subject to Senate confirmation, with concerns about undermining the NSA's ability to provide confidential advice to the President. P.L. 114-328 amended Title 50, U.S.C. \u00a7 3021 to restrict the number of professional staff members. The NSC staff size is limited to 200 professional staff members, with exceptions for support and administrative positions. The NSC does not have the same relationship with Congress as member departments and agencies. The National Security Adviser is not subject to Senate confirmation. There have been numerous congressional hearings and reports on the NSC. There have been numerous congressional hearings and reports on the NSC, covering various topics such as wiretaps, unauthorized document transfers, Al Qaeda, and budget deliberations. These discussions have also focused on the size of the NSC staff and its oversight of departments. However, very few of these sessions have provided Congress with briefings on current NSC issues. The Subcommittees on Financial Services and General Government of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees handle appropriations. Congress has limited involvement in NSC matters and its relationship with the NSC. While the Senate confirms statutory NSC members, it does not approve the National Security Adviser's appointment. Congress has authority over statutory NSC membership positions and budgetary matters. Despite some legislative provisions, Congress has little direct influence on NSC organization, procedure, role, or influence. The NSC is not a primary source of national security information for Congress. The NSC is primarily a policy analysis and coordination entity within the executive branch, providing national security information through departments and agencies. It has limited oversight and legislative control by Congress, with its structure and functioning tailored to each President's preferences. The NSC rarely testifies or briefs Congress, and its role is not a primary source of national security information for lawmakers. Some observers believe the general pattern of chief executives since the George H.W. Bush Administration will continue. Table A-1 shows NSC membership from Reagan to Trump Administration, classified into Statutory Members and Statutory Advisors. The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are designated as principal advisers to the President, National Security Council, and Homeland Security Council for intelligence and military matters. Other members and regular attendees are identified in the presidential directive establishing the NSC structure. The curr_chunk discusses attendees of the National Security Council (NSC) in different administrations, including situational attendees and how the Trump Administration managed national security matters. It also compares two National Security Presidential Memorandums (NSPM-2 and NSPM-4). Table A-2 shows the membership of the PC from the George H.W. Bush Administration to the Trump Administration. Appendix B lists National Security Advisers from 1953 to the present."
