This includes the establishment of removal authority and response system, as well as specific protocols for marine emergencies. The term 'condition of enhanced danger' in the Marine Emergency Protocol and Hull Requirement Act of 2008 includes periods related to acts of terror, attacks, low visibility at sea, oil spills, and hazardous material discharge. The curr_chunk defines terms related to hazardous material, health or environmental threats, sector, and sector commander in the context of emergency protocols. The Sector Commander has direct authority over vessels in dangerous waterways during enhanced danger conditions, with the power to halt traffic, individual vessels, change course, and issue necessary orders for safe navigation. The Sector Commander has the authority to issue orders ensuring the health and safety of individuals and the environment in the sector. State authority is not limited by this part and can establish laws more stringent than those provided. Amendments to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 include the addition of a section on marine emergency protocol and state authority. Hull requirements for fuel tanks of cargo vessels carrying oil as fuel are also addressed.

The amendment to Section 3703a of title 46, US Code requires cargo vessels operating in US waters to have double hulls or equivalent containment systems in their fuel tanks to prevent oil or fuel spills. Cargo vessels of less than 5,000 gross tons or with appraised salvage value determined before June 30, 2008, may qualify for certain exemptions under the amended Section 3703a of title 46, US Code. Cargo vessels between 5,000 and 15,000 gross tons must meet age and hull requirements by specific dates after 2014.

The age and hull requirements vary depending on the year, with different thresholds for single-hulled fuel tanks and double bottoms or sides. After January 1, 2021, cargo vessels 28 years old or older with single-hulled fuel tanks, or 33 years old or older with double bottoms or double sides, must comply with regulations. Deadlines for vessels with different age and hull criteria continue through January 1, 2024.
