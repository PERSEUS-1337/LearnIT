    "content": "The FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act established The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) to provide professional education and training to eligible nations in the Western Hemisphere, promoting democratic values and cooperation among participating nations. It succeeded the U.S. Army School of the Americas and aims to prepare mid-level civilian and military personnel for various challenges. The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) was established to train mid-level civilian and military personnel from eligible countries in dealing with new transnational threats. The Secretary of Defense designates the Secretary of the Army as the executive agent for administering the Institute, located at Fort Benning, Georgia. Participants include military, civilian, and law enforcement personnel from Western Hemisphere nations, selected in consultation with the Secretary of State. The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) at Fort Benning, Georgia, includes faculty and staff from the United States military, foreign instructors, and visiting Fellows. The curriculum includes mandatory instruction on human rights, the rule of law, civilian control of the military, and other topics determined by the Secretary. Training activities cover leadership development, counterdrug operations, peace support operations, disaster relief, and other relevant areas. The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) at Fort Benning, Georgia offers professional development courses in joint military operations, course of action analysis, and decision making to senior military commanders, staff officers, and junior officers. The Institute consists of three departments: Professional Military Education (PME), Civil-Military Studies, and the Training Battalion. The Civil-Military Studies Department focuses on civil-military cooperation and includes the Human Rights/International Law Division. The Training Battalion at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation provides courses in operational planning, disaster relief, counter drug operations, and civil-military operations under the guidance of State Department experts. It offers training in military leadership and tactics to junior officers and non-commissioned officers, as well as interagency instruction in counterdrug operations and disaster relief. The Training Battalion at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation offers 16 resident courses in tactical and leadership training for military officers, noncommissioned officers, and law enforcement officers. The courses aim to enhance professionalism, improve military and interagency operations, and develop skills in interacting with civilians and neighboring military forces during multilateral operations. Congress has shown interest in foreign student military training at U.S. military installations, with controversies leading to changes in the nature and focus of training at the former U.S. Army School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia. The U.S. Army School of the Americas was disestablished in FY2001 and replaced by the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. Congress authorized the new institute to ensure training activities align with U.S. interests, policies, and values, with annual funding and reporting requirements in place. The new Institute receives funding from three sources: Operations and Maintenance Funds, International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Funds, and International Military Education and Training Funds. Tuition fees charged for attendees cannot cover fixed operating costs. The Defense Department estimates initial operating costs to be similar to the U.S. Army School of the Americas. The U.S. Army School of the Americas, now known as WHINSEC, has an estimated operating cost of $5.887 million in FY2002. The funding comes from the Army's Operation and Maintenance account and the IMET account. A Board of Visitors oversees the Institute, including members from various backgrounds such as academia, religious, and human rights communities. The Board of Visitors oversees the U.S. Army School of the Americas, now known as WHINSEC, with a focus on curriculum, instruction, fiscal affairs, and academic methods. It meets annually to review compliance with U.S. laws, policy goals towards Latin America, adherence to doctrine, and emphasis on human rights and the rule of law in the curriculum. The Board of Visitors oversees the U.S. Army School of the Americas, now known as WHINSEC, focusing on curriculum, instruction, fiscal affairs, and academic methods. It submits an annual report to the Secretary of Defense on activities and recommendations. The Institute receives routine visits from Defense Department oversight agencies to validate education and training needs for North American nations. For Latin American and Caribbean nations, the Southern Command conducts annual reviews of courses to align with SOUTHCOM objectives. The Secretary of Defense is required by law to ensure compliance with instruction on human rights, the rule of law, due process, civilian control of the military, and the role of the military in a democratic society. The Secretary of Defense must submit a detailed report on the Institute's activities to Congress by March 15 each year, in consultation with the Secretary of State."
