    "content": "The level of pay for congressional staff is a recurring question among Members of Congress, staff, and the public. Members of the House set employment terms, including job titles, duties, and pay rates. There is interest in congressional pay data for various reasons, but publicly available resources do not provide aggregated data. The most recent staff compensation report was issued in 2010, based on anonymous survey data. The compensation reports are based on official House data and provide pay information for 12 staff positions in House Members' offices. The data allows for observations over time and is sourced from the House Statement of Disbursements. The pay data for House Member staff from 2001-2015 was developed based on a random sampling of staff for each position in each year. The data includes pay information for five time periods throughout the year, with the aggregate pay of these periods equaling the annual pay of a congressional staff member. A random sample of 45 staff for each position, who did not receive pay from any other congressional employing authority, was included in the data collection. This report may show differences from stated annual salaries due to the inclusion of overtime, bonuses, or other payments in addition to base pay. The report provides pay data for House Member staff from 2001-2015 based on a random sampling of staff for each position each year.

Data for staff in Senators' offices and House and Senate committee offices are available in separate reports.
