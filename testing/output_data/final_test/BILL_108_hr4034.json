    "content": "The \"National Education Advancement (NEA) and Teacher Relief Act\" allows for a tax credit for contributions benefiting elementary and secondary schools. The \"National Education Advancement (NEA) and Teacher Relief Act\" provides a tax credit for qualified charitable contributions made by taxpayers, with the credit amounting to 75% of the contributions. The maximum credit is $500 for individuals ($1,000 for joint returns) and $100,000 for corporations. Qualified charitable contributions are defined as the deductible amount under section 170 for cash donations. The tax credit for qualified charitable contributions under the \"National Education Advancement (NEA) and Teacher Relief Act\" applies to cash donations made to school tuition organizations, school facility improvements, computer technology/equipment, and training for educators. The tax credit for qualified charitable contributions under the \"National Education Advancement (NEA) and Teacher Relief Act\" includes deductions for expenses incurred by eligible educators on books, supplies, computer equipment, and supplementary materials used in the classroom. The credit is allowed only for expenses that exceed certain exclusions for the taxable year. The term 'school tuition organization' refers to an organization that allocates 90% of its income to scholarships for elementary and secondary school students eligible for free or reduced-cost lunch. The term 'elementary and secondary school scholarship' refers to scholarships for education up to 12th grade that are excluded from gross income. An 'eligible educator' is defined as a K-12 teacher, counselor, or aide who works at least 900 hours in a school providing elementary or secondary education. The term 'school facility' excludes stadiums or athletic facilities. Special rules include not double counting amounts for deductions and limiting the credit to the excess of regular tax over other credits. The taxpayer may elect to have the credit not apply for any taxable year. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by section 3 revise the definition of school for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses, including public, private, religious, or home schools. These changes apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2003."
