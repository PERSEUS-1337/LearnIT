    "content": "Some Members of Congress have shown interest in reforming remedies for patent infringement, with bills proposed in previous sessions. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act made limited changes, but concerns over patent infringement remedies persist. Current law allows for monetary damages and injunctions in patent cases. Persistent concerns have arisen over the predictability and appropriateness of judicial remedies for patent infringement, including the determination of damages and injunctions, especially in cases where patented inventions are just one feature of complex devices. Royalty stacking and attorney fees in \"exceptional cases\" are also contentious issues. This report reviews the current state of patent remedies, including compensatory damages, attorney fees, enhanced damages, special damages for design patents, and injunctions. It also discusses the process of submitting patent applications to the USPTO and the requirements under the Patent Act of 1952. The Patent Act requires applicants to draft claims that distinctly point out their invention. Examiners assess if the invention meets patentability criteria like novelty and nonobviousness. Novelty means the invention is not fully anticipated by prior knowledge, while nonobviousness requires it to be beyond ordinary skills. If approved, the USPTO grants a patent. The USPTO grants patents to inventors, giving them exclusive rights to their inventions for twenty years. Patent owners can prevent others from using, selling, or importing the invention, and may seek legal action against infringers. This exclusivity allows inventors to profit from their discoveries by charging higher prices or licensing their inventions. Patent infringement cases are usually litigated in federal courts, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handling most patent appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court can review cases from the Federal Circuit. Remedies for patent infringers include injunctions, monetary damages, and attorney fees. Damages can be tripled for willful infringement. Unlike copyrights and trademarks, criminal sanctions do not apply to patent infringement. The Patent Act allows for damages \"adequate to compensate for the infringement.\" The Patent Act allows for damages \"adequate to compensate for the infringement,\" with patent proprietors seeking lost profits or a reasonable royalty as default. To obtain lost profit damages, the patent proprietor must demonstrate demand for the patented invention, lack of noninfringing substitutes, and the ability to exploit the invention. The Patent Act allows for damages \"adequate to compensate for the infringement,\" with patent proprietors seeking lost profits or a reasonable royalty as default. To obtain lost profit damages, the patent proprietor must demonstrate demand for the patented invention, lack of noninfringing substitutes, and the ability to exploit the invention. The patent proprietor can claim damages in the form of a reasonable royalty if unable to demonstrate entitlement to lost profits. Courts typically use the analytical approach or a hypothetical negotiation to determine the reasonable royalty amount, considering various factors such as those outlined in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. United States Plywood Corp. case. In Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. United States Plywood Corp., a fifteen-factor list is provided for determining reasonable royalty damages, including actual royalty rates, advantages of the patented invention, availability of substitutes, infringer's profits, and industry licensing practices. The \"25% Rule\" was commonly used as a baseline for reasonable royalty damages, but was rejected by the Federal Circuit in Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. in 2011. The court found that the rule did not adequately tie the royalty base to the specific case at hand. The Court of Appeals explained that starting from a flawed premise and adjusting based on case-specific considerations leads to a flawed conclusion. The Patent Act limits recovery to six years prior to filing a complaint for patent infringement. Damages may be awarded with prejudgment interest to fully compensate for harms suffered during that period. The Patent Act limits recovery to six years prior to filing a complaint for patent infringement. Damages may be awarded with prejudgment interest to fully compensate for harms suffered during that period. The availability of damages may also be limited under the \"marking\" statute, which requires patent holders to mark their products with patent information to be eligible for damages. The Patent Act allows pending patent applications to be published 18 months after filing, with exceptions for infringers with \"actual notice\" who may be liable for a reasonable royalty. Critics argue that patent damages are uncertain and excessive, with concerns about the Georgia Pacific factors and strict liability for patent infringement. The current debate surrounds the feasibility and desirability of preclearance of patents before being sued, as well as the belief that significant damages awards are necessary to uphold patent respect in the marketplace and incentivize innovation. Some stakeholders argue that limits on patent damages could hinder innovation and that judges may not be equipped to determine damages accurately. In patent litigation, determining damages can be challenging due to marketplace complexities. The \"entire market value rule\" may be applied if the patented invention drives demand for the accused product. Alternatively, \"apportionment\" principles may be used to calculate damages if sales are influenced by factors beyond the patented invention. Some believe that the entire market value rule overcompensates patentees, while others argue that apportionment devalues patents and research incentives. In the 111th Congress, the Patent Reform Act of 2009 proposed changes to patent damages provisions, aiming to ensure that a reasonable royalty is applied only to the economic value attributable to the claimed invention. \"Royalty stacking\" can occur when a single product infringes multiple patents, potentially leading to royalty demands exceeding the product's component costs. The cost of a smartphone may exceed its components due to royalty stacking for patent claims. District courts consider royalty burden from multiple patents to avoid overvaluing individual patents in infringement cases. The issue of royalty stacking has not been addressed by the Supreme Court or Federal Circuit, and no legislation has been proposed to tackle this issue. The \"American Rule\" in the United States typically requires each litigant to pay their own attorney fees, win or lose, unlike the \"English Rule\" where the losing party compensates the prevailing party's lawyers. However, in patent cases, there is an exception under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7285 where the court may award attorney fees to the prevailing party in exceptional cases. The Supreme Court's 2014 ruling in Octane Fitness, LLC v. Icon Health & Fitness Inc. defined an \"exceptional case\" as one that significantly stands out in terms of the litigating party's position or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated. Factors considered include frivolousness, motivations, objective unreasonableness, and the need for compensation. The Supreme Court's ruling in Octane Fitness v. Icon Health & Fitness defined an \"exceptional case\" as one that significantly stands out in terms of the litigant's position, motivations, objective unreasonableness, and the need for compensation. District courts should consider the \"totality of the circumstances\" and a prevailing party must prove entitlement to attorney fees by a \"preponderance of the evidence.\" The Court also ruled in Highmark v. Allcare that the Federal Circuit should review Section 285 determinations under an abuse-of-discretion standard, giving district courts greater discretion in awarding fees. This shift may lead to more frequent fee awards. Some commentators believe that recent court decisions may deter \"patent trolling\" by awarding attorney fees to accused infringers in exceptional cases, such as in Lumen View Technology, LLC v. Findthebest.com, Inc. The court found that baseless litigation and predatory strategies aimed at financial gain were evident, potentially discouraging such practices. Recent court decisions may deter \"patent trolling\" by awarding attorney fees to accused infringers in exceptional cases, aimed at reaping financial advantage from defendants' inability or unwillingness to engage in litigation against frivolous patent lawsuits. Fee shifting remains the exception following the Octane Fitness ruling, with no bill introduced in the 115th Congress concerning fee shifting in patent cases. The Innovation Act in the 114th Congress aimed to require courts to award attorney fees to prevailing parties in patent cases, with exceptions for justified positions or special circumstances. The Protecting American Talent and Entrepreneurship Act (PATENT) Act of 2015 proposed fee-shifting in patent cases, where reasonable attorney fees would be awarded to prevailing parties if the non-prevailing party's position or conduct was not objectively reasonable. Special circumstances like economic hardship could exempt parties from fee-shifting. This differed from the Innovation Act's approach to award attorney fees in patent cases. The key difference between the Innovation Act and the PATENT Act was the burden of proof for fee-shifting. Under the Innovation Act, fees would be shifted unless the nonprevailing party could prove an exception, while under the PATENT Act, the prevailing party had to demonstrate entitlement to an award. The PATENT Act also exempted lawsuits with a cause of action for patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7271(e)(2) from fee-shifting. Both acts required interested parties to join the litigation if the nonprevailing party couldn't pay the fees, addressing concerns about shell companies asserting patents. The Support Technology and Research for Our Nation's Growth (STRONG) Patents Act of 2015 did not include a fee-shifting provision, but acknowledged the impact of Supreme Court rulings on attorney fees in patent cases. Proponents argue that more liberal fee-shifting could reduce nuisance settlements and allow challenges to invalid patents, while opponents fear it may benefit wealthy corporate parties. Opponents of fee-shifting provisions are concerned that they may benefit wealthy corporate parties to the disadvantage of individual inventors. They argue that such provisions could deter patent holders from pursuing legitimate claims and protect institutional defendants with vast resources. The Supreme Court clarified in the Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc. case that enhanced damages are meant as a punitive measure for willful infringement. The Supreme Court clarified in the Halo v. Pulse case that enhanced damages are at the discretion of district judges based on various factors like intentional copying, good faith efforts to avoid infringement, and concealment of infringement. The evidentiary threshold is a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" and the Federal Circuit reviews awards under an \"abuse of discretion\" standard. The Halo v. Pulse ruling has made awards of enhanced damages easier to obtain, with earlier proposals being more restrictive. Congress had considered bills for a higher standard of proof for willful infringement but had not enacted them. For example, the Patent Reform Act of 2009 would have required clear and convincing evidence for willful infringement. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), P.L. 112-29, incorporated a provision on willful infringement, stating that failure to obtain counsel's advice cannot be used to prove willful infringement. This provision aimed to protect attorney-client privilege and reduce pressure on accused infringers. The AIA included a provision on willful infringement to protect attorney-client privilege and reduce pressure on accused infringers. The patent law's willful infringement doctrine has sparked controversy, with some believing it ensures patent rights are respected while others argue for a shift to a \"no-fault\" regime of compensatory damages. Additionally, the Patent Act of 1952 allows for design patents. Design patents can be obtained by filing an application with the USPTO for a new, original, and ornamental design for a product. The design must not be obvious and must be primarily ornamental to receive protection. Design patents allow the holder to exclude others from unauthorized manufacture, use, or sale of the article. Design patents confer the right to exclude others from unauthorized manufacture, use, or sale of the patented design. To establish infringement, the design patent proprietor must prove substantial similarity that would deceive an ordinary observer. The term of a design patent is 15 years, and damages are governed by a distinct statutory provision. Section 289 of the U.S. Code states that a design patent holder can recover total profits from an infringer, with a minimum of $250. This provision allows the patent holder to choose between lost profits or infringer's profits, without double recovery. The Supreme Court's 2016 decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. narrowed the interpretation of this provision. The Supreme Court's decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. narrowed the interpretation of Section 289 of the U.S. Code, which allows a design patent holder to recover total profits from an infringer. Apple owned design patents for its iPhone, and the Court determined that the calculation of damages under \u00a7289 involves identifying the \"article of manufacture\" to which the infringed design has been applied and calculating the infringer's total profit on that article. The Court reversed the lower courts' ruling that Samsung had infringed Apple's patents and was liable for the entire profit from its infringing smartphones, remanding the case for a new determination of damages. The Supreme Court in Samsung v. Apple clarified that the term \"article of manufacture\" in design patent cases can refer to both the end product sold to consumers and its components. Lower courts were instructed to identify the relevant article of manufacture in cases of infringement and adjust damages accordingly. Reactions to the ruling have been mixed, with some critics arguing that Apple's damages were disproportionate due to the inclusion of unrelated features in smartphones. The Supreme Court ruling in Samsung v. Apple clarified that in design patent cases, the term \"article of manufacture\" can refer to both the end product and its components. This decision has raised concerns about the value of design patents and the difficulty in assessing total profits from infringement. The Federal Circuit's interpretation of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7283 prior to the eBay v. MercExchange case was seen as requiring courts to issue injunctions to prevent patent violations. The Federal Circuit's interpretation of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7283 was seen as requiring courts to issue injunctions upon finding patent infringement, leading to concerns about patent proprietors demanding excessive royalty rates. This prompted proposals to amend the provision to consider fairness and relevant interests of the parties associated with the invention. The Supreme Court's eBay case changed the approach to issuing injunctions for patent infringement, requiring a case-by-case evaluation rather than automatic injunctions. Patent proprietors must show irreparable injury and inadequacy of monetary damages to obtain an injunction. The eBay decision changed the approach to issuing injunctions for patent infringement, requiring a case-by-case evaluation. Patent proprietors must demonstrate irreparable injury, inadequate monetary damages, balance of hardships, and public interest to warrant an injunction. This decision has had a significant impact on patent law remedies, with empirical studies showing that patent proprietors usually obtain permanent injunctions when they practice the patented invention. In contrast, non-practicing entities and firms that do not compete with the infringer typically do not receive injunctive relief. While injunction issuance is subject to equity principles in most cases, Congress has mandated injunctions in certain circumstances. In patent infringement cases under the Hatch-Waxman Act and Biologics Price Competition Act, courts are required to order an injunction for the patent holder. A new bill introduced in 2017 aims to restore patents as property rights, presuming irreparable injury and inadequate legal remedies in cases of infringement. The STRONGER Patents Act proposes a presumption that two of the four eBay factors support granting an injunction in patent infringement cases. The burden of proof would shift to the infringer to show that future infringement would not cause irreparable injury and that legal remedies would suffice. This addresses the issue of patent infringement remedies, which was previously only partially addressed in the America Invents Act. The AIA focused on willful infringement law, with subsequent opinions from the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit. Stakeholders have concerns about patent infringement remedies' fairness, predictability, and accuracy. Congressional interest in this topic is expected to remain high due to its importance in rewarding invention and promoting competition."
