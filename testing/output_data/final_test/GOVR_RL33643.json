This highlighted the use of military commissions to try terrorists and acknowledged the existence of a previously classified CIA program for detaining and questioning suspects. President Bush confirmed the existence of a CIA program for detaining and questioning suspects, stating it remains vital for US security. He mentioned the program has saved innocent lives by providing key information to prevent terrorist attacks and revealed details about al Qaeda operations. The President announced the transfer of 14 detainees to Guantanamo, stating there are now no terrorists in the CIA program. He did not disclose the locations or number of CIA detention facilities. The CIA's detention facilities, the number of suspects questioned, and the program's legal reviews were not disclosed. The program was reportedly established under a secret presidential directive in 2001 and conducted by carefully selected CIA officers. President Bush emphasized that the United States does not torture. Administration officials aimed to address media speculation by consolidating detainees at Guantanamo, but some believe this has increased interest in U.S. intelligence practices. In Europe, international organizations and human rights groups are focused on the CIA program. The President's announcement has renewed interest in ongoing investigations and future inquiries. European countries are uncovering details about the detention and transport of terrorist suspects, with high-profile cases like the abduction of an Egyptian cleric in Italy. There are concerns about past practices and potential revival of the CIA program. The controversy surrounding terror suspect transfers and differing opinions on legal regimes governing arrest and detention. The Bush Administration views arrests as wartime capture, while other states may prioritize human rights treaties over humanitarian law. Differences exist in interpreting international law provisions. This report discusses the controversy surrounding terror suspect transfers and the legal frameworks that may apply, focusing on protections under international law. It includes information on investigations conducted by the European Parliament and the Council on Europe. News stories post-9/11 addressed the capture, treatment, and transfer of suspected terrorists from U.S. custody to third countries. The Washington Post reported on a global CIA prison system established after 9/11, including secret facilities in eight countries. These \"black sites\" were used for extraordinary rendition, where terrorist suspects were covertly detained and transported for interrogation. Human Rights Watch raised concerns about this internment policy. Human Rights Watch corroborated Washington Post's allegations of CIA detention facilities in Poland and Romania. HRW's research revealed the use of airfields and military facilities for prisoner transport in 2003-2004. Amnesty International reported on three individuals detained in secret facilities in Djibouti, Afghanistan, and Eastern Europe. Speculations pointed to possible locations in the Balkans. The report suggested that CIA flights into Europe for detention in black sites triggered international inquiries and investigations by organizations like the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. The Venice Commission issued a legal opinion on member states' human rights obligations, while the U.N. Human Rights Committee recommended abolishing secret detention facilities and ensuring legal protections for detainees. Efforts mainly focused on European actions rather than U.S. actions. Inquiries into European actions regarding alleged U.S. secret prisons in Europe have not found specific evidence by the end of 2006. However, investigations into possible human rights violations continue, sparking greater European public interest in U.S. intelligence activities in Europe. International reaction, especially in Europe, to President Bush's disclosure of the CIA program was skeptical. Terry Davis of the Council of Europe called it \"just one piece of the puzzle.\" Terry Davis, Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, referred to the CIA program as \"just one piece of the truth.\" European officials are urging the United States to disclose the locations of secret sites, which the US has refused to do. European investigators are pursuing further inquiries based on the disclosed information. Some observers speculate that European governments may be hesitant to investigate CIA activities too closely to avoid revealing their cooperation with the CIA. Limited cooperation from European governments has frustrated some European investigators. Since September 11, the US and European countries have emphasized trans-Atlantic cooperation on counter-terrorism and judicial processes. U.S.-European cooperation in countering terrorism has been a consistent theme at annual U.S.-EU summits. U.S. officials emphasize the close relationship in information sharing and law enforcement efforts. Before President Bush's disclosure in September 2006, U.S. officials refrained from publicly responding to allegations on intelligence activities. Secretary of State Rice addressed U.S. conduct in the war on terror during her trip to Europe in December 2005. During her trip to Europe in December 2005, Secretary Rice discussed policy aspects related to the transfer of terrorism suspects and defended the practice of rendition. She emphasized that the United States complies with laws prohibiting torture and stated that renditions are permissible under international law and are a vital tool in combating terrorism. Media reports suggested that European officials were reassured by their discussions with Secretary Rice. During discussions with European officials, U.S. officials addressed concerns about rendition and denied mistreatment of detainees. They emphasized compliance with laws prohibiting torture and sought assurances from receiving countries. The CIA program was a topic of internal debate within the Bush administration. Media reports indicate that the CIA program was debated within the Bush Administration for two years before the transfer of detainees to Guantanamo. US officials claim to have stopped using extraordinary rendition for transporting terrorist suspects, but human rights organizations question this assertion. The arrest, transfer, detention, and treatment of individuals are governed by human rights treaties and international humanitarian law, with debates on the application of human rights law during wartime. The debate over the application of human rights law during wartime, particularly in the \"Global War on Terrorism\" (GWOT), has led to differing opinions on the arrest and detention of suspected terrorists. The Bush Administration argues that human rights law does not apply to wartime capture and internment, citing that Al Qaeda is not a party to the Geneva Conventions. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies regardless of the nature of the conflict. The Bush Administration accepted that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions covers the \"war against Al Qaeda.\" The McCain Amendment prohibits cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of persons under US detention. The House of Representatives passed the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007, urging the Administration to develop principles for the humane treatment of captured international terrorists. The legal implications of the Hamdan decision regarding humanitarian law for Al Qaeda are unclear. The global community views the Global War on Terrorism as a \"fight.\" The Global War on Terrorism is seen as a fight against terrorists, not a war, implying that law enforcement measures should be used. Suspected terrorists captured outside of conventional armed conflict are entitled to human rights protection, including a trial to determine their detention's lawfulness. Human rights treaties apply regardless of armed conflict, except for emergency derogations and provisions superseded by humanitarian law. According to international legal experts, all captives are protected by human rights law, but those picked up in armed conflict or occupation are to be treated according to humanitarian law. Regardless of the legal regime, all detainees are entitled to humane treatment, protection against torture, and fair trial rights. International agreements aim to protect individuals' liberty from unlawful government infringement, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT) all prohibit arbitrary arrest, detention, exile, and torture. They also establish guidelines for the treatment of detainees and the transfer of individuals to foreign countries to prevent torture. The ICCPR obligates states to protect individuals within its jurisdiction without discrimination based on various factors. The transferring state may still have some responsibility for ensuring proper treatment post-transfer. The ICCPR may only obligate states to protect individuals within their territory and jurisdiction, potentially limiting their liability for conduct outside their boundaries. The definition of \"territory\" and \"jurisdiction\" can impact a state's obligations under the ICCPR. Under a narrow interpretation, states may argue they have no obligations under the ICCPR to individuals held in U.S.-run prisons on foreign territory. However, commentators suggest that states have obligations regarding individuals on their territory in terms of arrest or removal without due process. If \"jurisdiction\" is seen as expanding the ICCPR's reach, states may be obligated to protect individuals within their territory and those under their jurisdiction, extending their responsibilities beyond borders. The U.N. Human Rights Committee interprets that states must ensure the rights of individuals within their jurisdiction, even if not on their territory. This includes individuals detained in U.S.-run prisons located in foreign territories. The ICCPR extends to actions taken by a state's agent on another state's territory, with or without permission. The ICJ and ECHR recognize that states have obligations to respect individuals' rights beyond their own territory in certain circumstances. The Venice Commission and the United States have differing views on the extraterritorial application of human rights treaties. The Bush Administration argued that the ICCPR does not apply to detainees at Guantanamo Bay, citing jurisdictional language and the law of war. The international law of armed conflict provides protections to individuals in the Global War on Terror. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 provide specific protections for individuals not taking part in hostilities, including rules for detention, treatment, and transfer of prisoners of war. POWs have the highest level of protection, including the right to maintain contacts with family and receive visits from the ICRC. They may only be punished for unlawful acts after a fair process. POWs must be treated humanely and can only be punished for unlawful acts after a fair trial. They may be transferred to a neutral country if wounded or sick, with the agreement of the new host country. The transferring state must ensure the host country fulfills the obligations of the Convention. The fourth Geneva Convention covers \"protected persons\" who are not entitled to POW status. The fourth Geneva Convention covers \"protected persons\" who are not entitled to POW status, including enemy aliens in a belligerent state's territory or on foreign occupied territory. Protected persons may only be interned if they pose a security threat and can only be imprisoned after a fair trial. They can be transferred to another country under certain conditions, similar to POWs. The fourth Geneva Convention covers \"protected persons\" who are not entitled to POW status and can be transferred to another country under certain conditions. Article 49 prohibits forcible transfers or deportations of protected persons from occupied territory, and article 33 prohibits punishment for offenses not personally committed and collective penalties. The Geneva Convention prohibits forcible transfers or deportations of protected persons from occupied territory, except for temporary evacuations for security or military necessity. Unlawful deportation or transfer is considered a grave breach of the convention, but relocation outside the occupied territory may be allowed if it benefits the individuals. Parties to the Geneva Conventions can also make agreements for accommodating certain classes of individuals in a neutral country. Some argue that there is a class of persons, such as terrorists or \"unlawful combatants,\" who are not entitled to POW status or civilian rights under the Geneva Conventions. U.S. military doctrine considers even hostile actors without POW status as civilians. These \"unprivileged\" combatants may be punished for acts that legitimate combatants could not. GC art. 5 addresses the treatment of \"unlawful combatants,\" with exceptions for protected persons deemed security risks. Protected persons deemed security risks may forfeit communication rights if detained in occupied territory as spies or saboteurs. They must still be treated humanely and given fair trial rights. Delegates of the Protecting Power or ICRC should have unlimited access to interview them in prisoner of war camps. The Detaining Power may restrict access to prisoner of war camps for security reasons, but only as an exceptional and temporary measure. Nationals of non-party states and neutral or co-belligerent states with normal diplomatic representation are not considered protected persons under the Geneva Conventions. Common Article 3 provides protection for individuals not covered by more favorable provisions of the Conventions in armed conflicts that are not international in nature. The authority to detain persons for security purposes is derived from the power of the sovereign in whose territory the armed conflict takes place. Non-sovereign parties may not automatically receive combatant rights and may be tried for acts of violence under domestic law. Common Article 3 prohibits violence, taking of hostages, and outrages upon personal dignity for individuals not directly participating in hostilities. The laws of war, including prohibition of treatment and torture, taking of hostages, and outrages upon personal dignity, apply to all wars, whether international or non-international. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is considered to apply to all conflicts, providing basic protections for individuals not directly participating in hostilities. The Geneva Conventions apply to all wars, providing protections for individuals not directly participating in hostilities. Additional Protocols offer further details for interpreting Common Article 3, setting minimum standards for humane treatment of persons in conflict. The Council of Europe responded to allegations of CIA-run prison sites in Europe by initiating actions, including assigning a committee to investigate and appointing Dick Marty to lead. The Council of Europe initiated an investigation led by Swiss legislator Dick Marty to address allegations of CIA-run prison sites in Europe. The Council requested information from member states and sought legal opinions on human rights obligations. While the Council can make recommendations, it lacks enforcement authority. Three reports and recommendations have been produced, with ongoing investigations by the Parliamentary Assembly. Mr. Marty's interim assessment of the Council of Europe investigation found no formal evidence of secret CIA detention centers in Romania or Poland. He called for further investigation based on reliable sources and highlighted the U.S. practice of rendition and its links to torture in third countries. In his report, Marty accused the United States of running a system involving abduction, transport, and torture in third countries outside of Europe. He called for a continuation of the Council of Europe's inquiries and a widening of the probe to explore broader issues related to counterterrorism and human rights protection. Davis criticized European countries' safeguards in controlling or monitoring foreign activities based on questionnaire results. European countries lack oversight controls over foreign intelligence services on their soil, increasing the risk of human rights violations. Governments were questioned about laws controlling foreign agencies, preventing unlawful deprivation of liberty, and responding to rights violations. No government confirmed involvement of public officials in activities leading to deprivation of liberty. The Venice Commission issued an opinion on the legality of secret detention centers and the transport of detainees by foreign agents through European territory. They stated that secret arrests and detentions violate the European Convention on Human Rights. States that cooperated in such activities were criticized. The Venice Commission criticized states for secret detentions, stating that they violate the European Convention on Human Rights. States were urged to investigate claims of illegal custody and prevent abductions. The Commission called for a prohibition on rendition and extradition to countries where there is a risk of torture. Additionally, oversight and control mechanisms over security agencies were emphasized. On June 12, Council of Europe investigation head Dick Marty released a report criticizing the United States and certain European states for secret detentions and unlawful transfers of detainees. The report highlighted a global network of CIA-run \"black sites,\" renditions, and the use of military aircraft for detainee transport. Marty's findings implicated 14 European countries in violations of individual rights or collusion. 14 European countries were charged with violations of individual rights or collusion involving secret detention or unlawful inter-state transfers. The European Union initiated actions in cooperation with the Council of Europe to investigate alleged secret detention centers, seeking information from member and prospective member states, as well as from the European Union Satellite Center and Eurocontrol for flight and satellite data. In January 2006, the European Parliament formed a temporary committee to investigate alleged illegal detainee transfers and secret detention facilities in EU countries. The committee, led by Carlos Miguel Coelho, held hearings and traveled to various countries, including the United States. A final draft report was issued in November 2006 and formally approved in January 2007. The European Parliament formed a temporary committee in January 2006 to investigate illegal detainee transfers and secret detention facilities in EU countries. The committee issued an interim report in June 2006, accusing the CIA of illegal activities in EU member states. A final draft report was approved in January 2007, implicating several European countries in extraordinary rendition and illegal detention practices. The report accused the CIA of making over 1,245 flights in Europe, implying the existence of secret detention facilities in Romania and Poland. European governments were criticized for their reluctance to cooperate with the investigation, with some accused of actively or passively aiding CIA activities."
