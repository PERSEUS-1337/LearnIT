The medical loss ratio (MLR) measures the portion of premiums spent on medical claims, with higher MLRs indicating better value for consumers. States use MLR requirements to evaluate health insurance companies, while private entities use MLR data to assess financial performance. The MLR measures the value consumers receive for each premium dollar paid, with higher ratios indicating more benefits paid out. The MLR is an aggregate measure based on a health plan's overall performance. The ACA imposes a federal minimum MLR requirement on fully funded health plans, starting in 2011. Insurers must report the share of premium dollars spent on benefits to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires insurance companies to detail the share of premium dollars spent on medical benefits and administrative expenses. Insurers must issue rebates if they do not meet ACA MLR standards. In 2013, $332 million in rebates were required for 6.8 million consumers, compared to $504 million in 2012 and $1.1 billion in 2011. This report outlines ACA requirements for insurers. The report details ACA requirements for MLR reporting and rebates, including minimum MLR percentages for different market segments. It also addresses concerns about insurance commissions paid to brokers and agents. The ACA defines large group policies as those sold to employers with more than 100 workers, and small group policies as those sold to employers with up to 100 workers. Individual policies can be purchased through insurance agents, brokers, associations, or state health exchanges established under the ACA. MLR reporting requirements exclude premiums and claims experience of newly introduced health insurance offerings under certain circumstances. Health insurers were required to provide their first MLR reports to the HHS by June 1, 2012, detailing financial activity for 2011. Beginning in 2014, insurers must submit MLR reports to HHS by July 31 for the previous benefit year. Insurers must report aggregated activity for large group, small group, and individual policies within each state. Penalties can be imposed for non-compliance, with for-profit insurers required to report their MLRs by June 1, 2012. The ACA imposes separate MLR standards for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage Plans (MA), requiring a minimum 85% MLR for coverage sold through these programs. Contracts failing to meet this standard may face penalties, including payment to HHS and enrollment restrictions. Additional adjustments to the MLR formula were provided by HHS. The HHS made adjustments to the MLR formula for expatriate and mini-medical insurance plans, exempting expatriate plans from MLR reporting requirements starting in July 2015. Self-funded plans are also not subject to the MLR requirement. During 2012, 58.6% of private sector insurance enrollees obtained health coverage through self-funded plans. Medigap plans are supplemental policies for Medicare beneficiaries and have separate MLR requirements. Expatriate plans are group policies for employees working outside their country of citizenship. ACA's MLR requirements do not apply to long-term care, dental, vision, or Medigap plans. The ACA's MLR requirements do not apply to long-term care, dental, vision, or retiree health insurance. The federal MLR represents the percentage of premium dollars spent on medical claims and quality improvement activities. The formula for calculating the MLR includes the sum of medical claims and quality improvement expenditures in the numerator, and earned premiums minus taxes, licensing, and regulatory fees in the denominator. Specific details about each component are crucial for determining potential rebates to policyholders. The NAIC recommended factors for the MLR formula components. The MLR formula components, based on HHS regulations, determine the likelihood of premium rebates to policyholders. Increases in medical claims or quality improvement expenditures raise the MLR, reducing rebate chances. Conversely, decreases in these expenses lower the MLR, increasing rebate likelihood. The definition of medical claims is crucial for calculating potential rebates. The definition of medical claims is based on direct claims incurred during the MLR reporting year, adjusted for reserves. MLR rebates to policyholders are excluded from this measure to prevent passing on costs to policyholders. Medical claims are adjusted by unpaid claims reserves, contract reserves, and claims-related reserves for contingent benefits and lawsuits. Contract reserves are established to cover future benefit payments as policies mature. Reserves are adjusted for contingent benefits and lawsuits. Concerns were raised about potential manipulation of reserves leading to overstated MLR. The NAIC and HHS recommend including prescription drug costs in incurred claims and deducting rebates. The ACA allows insurers to include quality improvement spending in the MLR calculation. The NAIC and HHS recommend including prescription drug costs in incurred claims and deducting rebates. Companies must submit annual data to the Secretary of HHS detailing premium revenue spent on quality improvements, meeting specific criteria. Quality initiatives must improve health outcomes, prevent hospital readmissions, and enhance patient safety through various activities. The HHS rules require health plans to focus on quality improvement, evidence-based medicine, and health promotion activities. Non-claims expenses must meet specific criteria to be considered quality improvement, including improving health care quality, measurable outcomes, and evidence-based practices. HHS allowed insurers to count a percentage of their ICD-10 conversion costs as quality improvement activities. ICD codes are alphanumeric designations used in medical billing and research. The deadline for insurers to convert from ICD-9 to ICD-10 was extended multiple times. Insurers can include up to 0.3% of premium revenue for ICD-10 conversion costs in their MLR calculation. Insurers can count up to 0.3% of premium revenue for ICD-10 conversion costs as quality improvement activities, potentially increasing their MLR slightly. Additional costs for ICD-10 maintenance and claims adjudication systems would be considered administrative costs. HHS rules allow insurers to include money recovered from fraud and abuse initiatives towards the MLR requirement for medical benefits spending, but not broader fraud prevention activities. HHS stated that fraud reduction efforts under the MLR rule align with NAIC's position, allowing recovered payments to be adjustments to incurred claims for issuers. While fraud prevention activities like medical review are considered administrative expenses, broader initiatives could lower the MLR. Non-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans were restricted from adjusting medical claims for quality under final IRS regulations in 2014. Non-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans were previously unable to adjust medical claims for quality expenditures, unlike for-profit insurers. However, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 allowed non-profit plans to include spending on activities that improve healthcare quality in their calculations, retroactive to 2010. Premium revenues play a key role in the MLR calculation, with an increase lowering the MLR and a reduction raising it. The ACA also permits insurers to deduct certain taxes and fees from premiums, further impacting the MLR amount. Earned premiums for health insurance coverage are calculated based on all payments made by policyholders, excluding certain assessments and subsidies. These premiums should be reported before deducting discounts for health and wellness programs, and should not include reinsurance. Net payments or receipts related to risk adjustment programs under the ACA are also factored in. Taxes, licenses, and regulatory fees are subtracted from premiums in the MLR calculation. Taxes, licenses, and regulatory fees are subtracted from premiums under the MLR formula. Higher taxes and fees can raise the MLR. Federal taxes allocated to health insurance coverage are defined by HHS. State taxes and assessments must be reported separately by insurers. Regulatory fees must also be reported. The MLR calculation includes adjustments for licensing and regulatory fees, such as statutory assessments and examination fees. Fines, penalties, and fees for examinations by other authorities must be reported separately. The ACA mandates credibility adjustments for smaller, different, and newer health insurance plans to address variability in claims data. Adjustments for smaller health insurance plans include credibility adjustments based on life years to adjust MLR upward. Insurers with a large share of high deductible health plans can also receive a credibility adjustment due to the variable claims experience in these plans. The MLR calculation includes a deductible adjustment based on the average deductible of all policies. This adjustment can increase credibility adjustments by a multiplier of 1.0 to 1.736. For example, a small group plan with a high percentage of HDHPs may need to apply these adjustments to meet the minimum MLR standard of 80%. The MLR calculation includes a deductible adjustment based on the average deductible of all policies. The final MLR is calculated by multiplying the base credibility factor by the deductible factor. The deductible factor does not apply to insurers with more than 75,000 life years. The ACA allows the HHS Secretary to adjust the MLR based on partially credible experience. The ACA allowed the HHS Secretary to adjust the MLR standard for the individual health insurance market to prevent destabilization. States could request a temporary adjustment for up to three years to avoid coverage disruptions. Factors considered for waivers included insurer exits, impact on consumer access, alternate coverage options, and impact on premiums and benefits. HHS granted adjustments to the federal MLR for the individual market in 17 states and a territory in early 2012. Seven states were granted waivers, while ten states and a territory were denied. Most MA plans must meet an 85% MLR standard starting in 2014, with final rules issued by CMS in May 2013. The MLR calculation for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans is based on the percentage of contract revenue spent on clinical services, drugs, quality improvement, and direct benefits to beneficiaries. Insurers failing to meet the 85% threshold must pay HHS the difference between the target MLR and their actual MLR. Insurers must calculate the MLR at the contract level for Part D and MA plans. Insurers enter into contracts with HHS to provide coverage to beneficiaries. Since 2006, Medicare Advantage sponsors can offer regional plans in 26 U.S. regions designated by the Secretary of HHS. Sponsors must report a single MLR for each contract that includes MA-PD plans. Plans failing to meet the 85% MLR for three or more consecutive years will face consequences. If a Medicare Advantage or Part D contract fails to meet the 85% MLR for three consecutive years, new enrollees will be barred from joining the plan. If the contract is out of compliance for five consecutive years, it will be terminated. The MLR data must be reported annually, and consequences will be enforced in the following contract year. CMS requires Medicare plans to report MLR data annually, with earlier reporting for contracts failing to meet the threshold for two consecutive years. This allows for potential enrollment sanctions or contract terminations before Medicare open enrollment. Health insurers failing to meet minimum MLR requirements must issue rebates to policyholders by August 1 each year. Health insurers must issue rebates to policyholders by specific deadlines based on MLR data. Rebates are calculated using aggregate data from all insurer plans in each market category. HHS does not differentiate between the efficiency of different plans offered by the same insurer. Rebates are required if the MLR threshold is not met, regardless of individual plan efficiency. Health insurers must issue rebates to policyholders based on MLR data. Rebates are calculated using aggregate data from all plans in each market category. HHS defines \"enrollee\" as the subscriber, policyholder, or government entity that paid the premium. Insurers pay rebates to enrollees in individual insurance and to employers in employer-sponsored coverage, who then distribute a portion to employees based on their premium shares. Enrollees who paid premiums to an insurance plan that did not meet its required MLR are entitled to a rebate, even if they are no longer covered by the specific insurance plan. Rebates can be allocated to current enrollees if distributing to former enrollees is not cost-effective. Rebates under group policies must be coordinated through the employer. Rebates under group policies must be coordinated through the employer. Employers can provide rebates in the form of premium credits to avoid taxation on lump-sum payments. The entity distributing rebates can choose to disburse payments as a lump-sum check, deposit to a card, or credit against future premiums. Rebates for 2011-2013 must be applied to the first plan premium due on or after August 1. Starting from the 2014 MLR reporting year, rebates provided as premium credits must be applied to the first month's premium due on or after September 30. Any excess rebate amount for October will be applied to future payments until fully credited. Former enrollees can receive rebates in the form of a check or transfer to a debit/credit card. Special rules apply for de minimis rebates in group policies where the total rebate is less than $20 for the year. Insurers are not required to issue direct rebates if the amount is less than $5 per enrollee for a given year. De minimis amounts must be aggregated and distributed to other enrollees in the state. Employers overseeing plans are also exempt from issuing rebates if the cost exceeds the rebate amount, but they must use the de minimis amounts for allowable activities to benefit enrollees. In 2012, insurers were required to notify enrollees of their MLR results as a one-time requirement. Insurers failing to meet annual MLR requirements must inform enrollees about the federal MLR, rebate amount, and how premium dollars are used. In 2013, insurers issued $332 million in rebates to 6.8 million consumers, compared to $504 million in 2012 and $1.1 billion in 2011. Highest average rebates per family were in Alaska, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana. In 2013, health insurers subject to ACA MLR provisions reduced overhead costs in individual, small group, and large group markets. Average rebates per family were highest in Alaska, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, and Wyoming. Health insurance agents and brokers assist consumers in choosing and enrolling in health insurance products. Health insurance producers assist individuals and small employers in enrolling in health insurance products. They are paid sales commissions by insurers, which are a percentage of premiums paid by the enrollee. The National Association of Health Underwriters argued that commissions are similar to taxes and should not be deducted from administrative expenses when calculating the ACA MLR. The NAHU argued that commissions should not be considered as an expense in the MLR calculation, unlike taxes. The NAIC recommended that HHS recognize the role of producers and accommodate their compensation in MLR regulations. HHS noted that state regulators could seek MLR waivers if concerned about destabilizing the individual insurance market. During the 112th and 113th Congress, legislation was proposed to exclude brokers' commissions from the ACA MLR calculation, as it was found that excluding commissions would significantly lower rebates to consumers. State governments regulate health insurance and have their own MLR requirements for evaluating insurance company performance. The NAIC developed MLR guidelines in 1980 for state regulators to evaluate benefits paid under medical policies. When the ACA was passed in 2010, 34 states had established MLR guidelines, set limits on administrative expenses, and required premium refunds for insurers not meeting standards. State MLR targets ranged from 55% to 80% for individual market insurers. The federal ACA provisions set national minimum MLR requirements for insurers in individual and group markets, ranging from 55% to 85%. States can apply for waivers if ACA rules disrupt their insurance markets. Some states have additional MLR laws, varying between rural and urban areas with different insurance options. State MLR calculations may differ from federal standards. The federal ACA provisions set national minimum MLR requirements for insurers in individual and group markets, ranging from 55% to 85%. Federal MLR standards allow for adjustments based on quality improvements, taxes and fees, credibility adjustments, and other factors. A 2011 GAO analysis found that federal allowances raised federal MLRs above MLRs based only on medical claims compared to premium revenue. Average MLRs calculated under the ACA formula were significantly higher than traditional MLRs in different market segments. Final HHS rules allow separate adjustments in the MLR formula for mini-medical (mini-med) policies. Limited-benefit health plans, such as mini-med plans, have annual benefit limits of $250,000 or less and typically offer lower benefits with higher copayments and deductibles. Mini-med insurers expressed concerns about meeting ACA MLR requirements due to higher administrative costs, turnover, and lower claims. Consumer, healthcare, and labor groups opposed relaxing MLR standards for mini-med plans. In response to concerns from mini-med insurers about meeting ACA MLR requirements, HHS included a special allowance for mini-med plans with annual benefit limits of $250,000 or less. The interim final rule allowed insurers to multiply incurred claims and activities that improve healthcare quality by 2.00 in 2011. After reviewing comments, HHS extended and modified the special treatment, setting a multiplier of 1.75 in 2012, 1.50 in 2013, and 1.25 in 2014. The ACA provisions starting in 2014 prohibit the sale of health plans with annual limits on essential health benefits. The HHS final rule was based on data from insurers selling limited benefit plans, showing that many issuers in the individual and large group markets would not meet the standard MLR targets. With a 2.00 multiplier in place, only 3 of the 12 companies in the individual market would not meet the MLR requirements, while all issuers in the small and large group market would meet the standard. Medicare Credibility Adjustments were set separately for MA and Part D plans."
