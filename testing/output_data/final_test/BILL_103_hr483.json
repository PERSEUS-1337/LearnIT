    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new subchapter in the Internal Revenue Code, titled \"Self-Dealing in Certain Assets of Tax-Exempt Medical Service Organizations.\" It includes a tax on self-dealing in certain assets of tax-exempt medical service organizations. A 5% tax is imposed on self-dealing asset transactions between disqualified persons and medical service organizations. The tax is paid by the disqualified person involved in the transaction. Additionally, a tax is imposed on organization managers who participate in such transactions knowingly. A 2.5% tax is imposed on self-dealing asset transactions with medical service organizations. Organization managers participating in such transactions are responsible for paying the tax. If the transaction is not corrected within the taxable period, a 200% tax is imposed on the disqualified person involved. The tax imposed on disqualified persons involved in self-dealing asset transactions is 50% if they refuse to correct the transaction. If multiple individuals are liable for the transaction, they are jointly and severally liable. The term 'self-dealing asset transaction' refers to the sale, exchange, or leasing of a medical asset to a disqualified person. Exceptions include transactions at arm's length, for fair market value, and not involving the disposition of a medical activity. The rules state that a medical service organization will be treated as disposing of a medical asset if a controlled entity disposes of it. Any disposition of an interest in the entity will also be considered a disposition of the organization's share of the medical assets. The term 'proportionate share' refers to the percentage of interests held by the organization in the entity. The term 'disqualified person' in a medical service organization includes organization managers, individuals providing medical services, family members of those individuals, and 35-percent controlled entities. The term 'manager' in a medical service organization refers to any officer, director, or trustee with similar powers or responsibilities. A 'medical service organization' is defined as an organization that would be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) if it engages in medical activities. 'Medical activity' includes providing medical or hospital care. The term 'medical asset' refers to any tangible or intangible asset used in a medical activity. Controlled entities are defined as corporations, partnerships, trusts, or estates where certain individuals own more than 35 percent of voting power, profits interest, or beneficial interest. The term '50-percent controlled entity' refers to a corporation, partnership, or trust where a medical service organization owns over 50 percent of voting power, profits interest, or beneficial interest. Constructive ownership rules similar to section 4946(a) apply. The 'taxable period' for a self-dealing asset transaction starts from the transaction date and ends on the date of mailing a deficiency notice under section 6212 for the tax imposed. The term 'amount involved' in a self-dealing asset transaction refers to the money and fair market value of property transferred by a medical service organization. Fair market value is determined at the transaction date. In self-dealing asset transactions, fair market value is crucial, and corrections should ensure the medical service organization is not financially worse off. Technical amendments include inserting specific code sections for clarity. The text chunk provides technical amendments to the tax code related to self-dealing asset transactions in tax-exempt medical service organizations. It includes specific code sections for clarity and updates the table of subchapters for chapter 42 of the tax code. The amendments made by this section apply to transactions occurring after November 26, 1991."
