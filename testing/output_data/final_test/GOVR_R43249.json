    "content": "The Great Lakes ecosystem, covering 300,000 square miles shared by eight U.S. states and one Canadian province, holds nearly 90% of U.S. freshwater. Urban and industrial development have degraded water quality, leading to habitat changes, nonnative species introduction, and endangered species listing. The Great Lakes ecosystem is facing deteriorating conditions, prompting restoration activities by governments. An estimated 40 million people rely on the ecosystem for various needs. The economic benefit of restoring the Great Lakes was estimated at $50 billion in 2007. Congress has enacted over 30 laws to support restoration efforts in the region. Efforts to restore the Great Lakes ecosystem have been ongoing for decades, with various stakeholders involved in addressing specific issues such as water quality and invasive species. However, there is a need for a comprehensive approach that considers the entire ecosystem. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement focuses on water quality but not habitat issues. Progress in restoration efforts has been evaluated by the Government Accountability Office. The Government Accountability Office found slow progress in Great Lakes restoration efforts, citing concerns about toxic sediment cleanup, governance issues, and lack of a comprehensive plan. A federal Task Force and Regional Collaboration were established to provide strategic direction and involve stakeholders in ecosystem restoration. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy recommended specific actions and activities. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy recommended actions to restore the ecosystem over a five-year period. The total cost was estimated at $20 billion, but the Strategy is not fully implemented. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) was established in 2010 to continue restoration efforts. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem by addressing focus areas such as toxic substances, invasive species, habitat protection, and monitoring. The EPA leads federal efforts in implementing the GLRI and coordinating restoration activities through the Task Force. EPA receives and distributes funds to federal agencies for restoration projects in the Great Lakes region. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) is implemented by the EPA through the Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO) to fund restoration activities in the Great Lakes region. The GLRI is guided by recommendations from the Great Lakes Advisory Board (GLAB), consisting of 18 members representing nonfederal stakeholders. The GLAB advises on protection and restoration policies, long-term goals, annual priorities, and the implementation of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) is guided by the Great Lakes Advisory Board (GLAB) and the Action Plan, created by the Task Force, provides a framework for restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem. It includes problem statements, goals, objectives, progress measures, and activities for each focus area under the GLRI. Federal agencies identify projects to implement the Action Plan each year. Federal agencies select projects annually to implement the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Action Plan based on criteria such as achieving measurable outcomes, advancing existing Great Lakes activities, feasibility of prompt implementation, interagency collaboration, adherence to science, public support, and low transaction costs. Projects aim to meet overall and interim goals in various focus areas. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Action Plan includes goals for Habitat and Wildlife Protection and Restoration, with quantifiable measures and indicators to track progress. Monitoring and oversight mechanisms are in place, with an accountability system to measure success. An accountability system was established to track project progress and implementation in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Action Plan. An interactive map displays project locations and details, with recipients required to submit status reports. The EPA compiles annual reports to the President on outcomes and funding allocations. The most recent report for FY2011 shows mixed results in meeting goals, with an estimated cost of $2.2 billion for the first five years of implementation. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative received $475 million in its inaugural year, with approximately $400 million in new funds for restoration activities. Funding remained steady at around $300 million for the next three years, with a request for $300 million in FY2014. Total estimated cost for the first five years is $2.2 billion. In FY2014, a request for $300 million was made for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) to carry out restoration activities funded through grants and transfers to other federal agencies. Agencies are expected to maintain base funding levels for restoration activities and identify new activities to support GLRI. Total annual funding for restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem includes funding for GLRI and base restoration programs. Base funding for Great Lakes ecosystem restoration activities is detailed in the Great Lakes Ecosystem Restoration Crosscut Budget. In FY2011, base funding for Great Lakes restoration was $677.0 million, with GLRI funding totaling $977.0 million. Over a billion dollars has been appropriated for GLRI through FY2013, with most going to the EPA, FWS, NOAA, and the Corps. GLRI implementation is guided by appropriations laws and reports. In FY2012 appropriations, GLRI was instructed to follow guidelines in H.Rept. 112-151, directing EPA to transfer funds expeditiously to supplement existing programs. The committee report prioritized \"action-oriented\" projects over studies and evaluations, expecting measurable results from funding. GLRI's implementation since FY2010 has significantly increased funding for Great Lakes restoration, addressing ecosystem restoration holistically. Issues include clarity on GLRI's management structure. Issues with GLRI include management structure, integration with existing restoration efforts, effectiveness of Action Plan, direction and duration of restoration, and funding needs. Proposed legislation in 113th Congress aims to establish governance structure, authorize GLRI, specify scope and function, and authorize coordinating role of Great Lakes Interagency Task Force. Restoration efforts in the Great Lakes have historically lacked centralized leadership, with various federal and state agencies involved. The EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office has implemented some activities. The GAO has raised concerns about the effectiveness of these efforts due to the lack of centralized governance. GLRI has addressed some of these concerns, but questions about the governance of the initiative remain. The governance of the Great Lakes restoration initiative is unclear, with questions about a central governing structure overseeing all activities. While the EPA is seen as the lead federal agency for implementing the initiative, it lacks the authority to direct the entire restoration effort, including non-GLRI federal activities. EPA created the Action Plan with the Great Lakes Task Force and provides annual reports on funds allocated to federal agencies for GLRI activities. The Great Lakes Task Force coordinates all restoration activities in the Great Lakes ecosystem and implements the Action Plan. However, it does not have decision-making functions and focuses on new federal activities, not pre-existing baseline activities or infrastructure affecting water quality. The GLRI is not a centralized management approach for restoring the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Task Force coordinates restoration activities in the Great Lakes ecosystem but lacks decision-making functions. The GLRI aims to build on existing federal, state, and local activities for restoration efforts. Coordination with state and local entities in the Great Lakes remains unclear. The Great Lakes Task Force coordinates restoration activities in the Great Lakes ecosystem but lacks decision-making functions. Coordination with nonfederal entities in the Great Lakes might be significant due to the number of entities involved in restoration efforts. Some argue that without formal coordination, restoration projects may overlap. Greater coordination among federal and nonfederal stakeholders could leverage resources for restoration projects. Nonfederal representatives do not have a formal role in coordinating with federal actions. GLAB provides advice on GLRI implementation but does not prioritize coordination among nonfederal members. Some question the need for formal collaboration with Canada and Ontario for GLRI. Some argue for formal collaboration with Canada and Ontario to coordinate restoration activities under GLRI. Nonfederal entities conduct restoration projects with federal grants, but these projects are not integrated into the Great Lakes Accountability System (GLAS), hindering analysis for potential collaboration. Efforts to organize federal and state activities related to ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes have been made, including the creation of a mandated Great Lakes crosscut budget by Congress. The creation of a Great Lakes crosscut budget mandated by Congress contains information on GLRI funding, federal and state spending for restoration efforts. Various approaches for governance and coordination, such as creating a central entity to coordinate all restoration activities, are being considered. The Platte River restoration initiative is guided by a Governance Committee. The Platte River restoration initiative is overseen by a Governance Committee (GC) consisting of representatives from Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming, USBR, FWS, water users, and environmental entities. The GC makes programmatic decisions, justifying changes with new information or recommendations from adaptive management efforts. An Oversight Committee, including the Secretary of the Interior and the Governors of the three states, approves significant modifications to the program. Other ecosystem restoration initiatives are governed by hybrid entities with limited decision-making authority. The bodies overseeing ecosystem restoration initiatives have limited decision-making authority. Examples include the Chesapeake Bay Executive Council and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. Bills in the 113th Congress address governance and coordination under GLRI, authorizing the EPA to select programs and projects for Great Lakes protection and restoration. The Task Force and GLAB recommendations are considered in project selection. The bill authorizes the Task Force to coordinate activities for restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem, including collaborating with Canada, managing the system, and developing outcome-based goals. EPA would lead GLRI implementation, while the Task Force would coordinate federal and nonfederal efforts. GLRI would prioritize nonfederal partner work and require coordination with states and organizations for projects. The bills aim to create a Great Lakes crosscut budget to report funding and projects for GLRI and other non-GLRI activities, ensuring coordination among federal, state, and nonfederal projects. The lack of a comprehensive plan in the past hindered restoration efforts, leading to the development of the GLRI Action Plan to address this issue. The Action Plan aims to address concerns regarding restoration efforts in the Great Lakes region by setting short term goals and discussing broad themes. However, some argue that it is not comprehensive as it does not include specific restoration projects or cover all federal restoration activities. The Action Plan aims to address concerns about restoration efforts in the Great Lakes region by setting short-term goals and discussing broad themes. Some argue it is not comprehensive as it does not include specific restoration projects or cover all federal restoration activities. The scope of the Action Plan is based on implementing GLRI, and the specificity of projects depends on annual decisions and recommendations by the EPA, federal agencies, and the Task Force. Restoration actions are also guided by the Strategy and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, which list thematic areas and key actions for restoration. Both bills in the 113th Congress would authorize restoration actions. The 113th Congress bills would authorize restoration actions related to water quality in the Great Lakes region, aiming to achieve goals set in the Action Plan, Strategy, and GLWQA. The broader restoration effort goes beyond just implementing the Action Plan and includes actions and goals from both the Strategy and GLWQA. Questions may arise about how the Action Plan will integrate GLRI activities with existing federal, state, and local activities. The GLRI does not encompass all federal and nonfederal actions for Great Lakes restoration, focusing on guiding GLRI implementation rather than all restoration efforts in the ecosystem. The Action Plan builds upon existing programs and plans, but it is unclear if GLRI requirements directly cover non-GLRI projects. The GLRI may not cover all federal activities for Great Lakes restoration, leading to questions about integrating non-GLRI projects. The pending revision to the Action Plan aims to address these concerns by emphasizing monitoring, adaptive management, and outcome-oriented results. The pending revision to the GLRI Action Plan aims to focus on outcome-oriented results for ecosystem restoration, addressing concerns about integrating non-GLRI projects and incorporating lessons learned from the first phase of restoration. However, the current Action Plan lacks a clear overall vision for a restored Great Lakes ecosystem and specific long-term restoration goals. The Task Force, under GLAB, is revising the Action Plan to describe activities and goals from FY2015 to FY2019. It is uncertain if this represents a stage for restoration or a plan to complete restoration. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement serves as a guiding document for long-term restoration, outlining objectives for restoring the waters of the Great Lakes. Issues related to restoration in the Great Lakes include addressing excess nutrient deposition and controlling aquatic invasive species. The lack of clarity on the timeline and cost of restoration efforts raises questions about the long-term plans for restoration, potential controversial actions, and the manipulation of water flows to enhance habitat for native species. Some argue that the five-year restoration plan for the Great Lakes may not adequately address long-term issues like invasive species control and climate change effects. Incorporating climate change considerations into the plan is crucial for the ecosystem's viability. Climate change could impact water levels, affecting ecosystem properties and economic factors. The Great Lakes restoration plan, addressed by S. 1232 and H.R. 2773, authorizes the Task Force to review and update the Action Plan every five years. The plan aims to track restoration progress but lacks a clear vision for ecosystem restoration and estimated duration. GLRI, initiated in 2010, aims to restore the ecosystem but lacks clarity on the required efforts. GLRI's accountability system, GLAS, lists projects, funding, and quantifiable results. GLAS documentation suggests that project results can be aggregated and tracked to adjust priorities based on data. However, it is unclear how project completion or progress relates to overall ecosystem restoration. Some argue that restoration projects are completed in isolation without a comprehensive assessment of their impact on ecosystem restoration. The outcomes of the restoration initiative remain unclear, despite reported indicators and measurements. The GLRI aims to provide a visual representation of progress towards metrics through dashboard indicators. Proposed bills in Congress seek to create outcome-based goals for the Great Lakes to evaluate restoration progress at a regional level. Developing outcome-based goals may differ from developing a strategy for achieving outcomes under the GLRI accountability approach. The GLRI accountability approach under GLAS may only apply to GLRI projects, raising questions about evaluating the effectiveness of GLRI versus non-GLRI restoration efforts. Progress towards goals in FY2010 and FY2011 reports is mixed, with indicators still undetermined and no differentiation between GLRI and non-GLRI actions. Evaluating only GLRI activities may be challenging, and progress towards goals may not be measurable in the short term. Progress in restoration activities may not be immediately visible, with some initiatives experiencing delays in meeting initial goals. There is a lack of consequences for not meeting targets set by the GLRI, and policy mechanisms may need to be revised to address shortcomings. Adaptive management could be implemented to allow for changes in projects and goals if needed. The GLRI encourages agencies to incorporate adaptive management in restoration projects, but has not yet implemented a process. A draft report proposes an adaptive management framework for Great Lakes restoration to address programmatic decisions and refine project priorities. This framework could measure and adjust program implementation and progress towards restoration objectives, despite challenges in setting long-term targets and a vision for a restored ecosystem. The GLRI aims to restore the Great Lakes with defined targets for measuring progress, but lacks discussion on long-term restoration goals. Questions arise on the number of steps needed for full restoration and the current status of the ecosystem. Other restoration initiatives have faced challenges in estimating duration and costs, leading to adjustments in funding and completion timelines. The question of funding ecosystem restoration initiatives, like the Great Lakes, is complex due to unclear total costs and duration. The Brookings Institution's 2007 study highlighted financial benefits of Great Lakes restoration, including higher catch rates, lower water treatment costs, improved recreational opportunities, and removal of contaminated sediment. The study in 2007 estimated the present-value benefits of environmental improvements in the Great Lakes to be around $50 billion for long-term gains and $30-$50 billion for short-term gains. However, the full cost of restoration was not identified, making it impossible to evaluate the net benefit. The GLRI estimates that $2.2 billion is needed for the first five years of restoration, but the total cost and timeline for restoration remain unclear. The first phase of Great Lakes restoration (2010-2014) had significant funding, with annual federal funding ranging from $649 million to $687 million before GLRI. GLRI increased funding to approximately $1.2 billion in FY2010, surpassing funding for other ecosystems like the Everglades and Chesapeake Bay. The large size of the Great Lakes ecosystem justifies the higher cost of restoration. Some argue that the Great Lakes ecosystem's size justifies higher restoration costs compared to other ecosystems. Federal funding for GLRI is seen as high, with proposed bills authorizing significant amounts for restoration projects. The Great Lakes Program Office oversees restoration activities funded by H.R. 2773, including $100 million for sediment contamination remediation. The GLRI aims to restore the Great Lakes ecosystem with a coordinated effort and comprehensive plan, addressing past criticisms. The complex ecosystem presents challenges and uncertainties in restoration projects, leading to questions from Congress and stakeholders. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) faces questions from Congress and stakeholders regarding the timeline and cost of restoration. Two bills in the 113th Congress aimed to authorize the GLRI, designating the EPA as the lead agency and allocating $475 million annually from FY2014 to FY2018 for restoration activities."
