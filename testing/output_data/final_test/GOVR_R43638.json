    "content": "The President has the power to nominate and appoint officers of the United States with the Senate's advice and consent. The appointment process involves three stages: selection and clearance by the White House, Senate consideration, and final appointment by the President. The President selects candidates for positions with the advice and consent of the Senate. Senators may recommend candidates, but the White House is not obligated to follow these recommendations. Senators can delay or block nominations if they feel consultation was insufficient. Candidates go through a clearance process and submit various forms. During the clearance process, the candidate submits forms like the \"Public Financial Disclosure Report\" (OGE 278) and the \"Questionnaire for National Security Positions\" (SF 86). The FBI conducts a background investigation, OGE reviews financial disclosures, and conflicts of interest are mitigated if found. Once vetting is complete, the nomination is ready for Senate submission. The selection and clearance stage for appointments to high-level national security positions can be lengthy, with delays often occurring when multiple candidates are processed simultaneously. In 2004, amendments were made to the Presidential Transition Act to expedite the appointment process for a new President's national security team. Candidates for higher-level positions are given priority in the clearance process. The Presidential Transition Act of 1998 allows for a 90-day extension of temporary appointments during transitions. The President typically nominates individuals recommended by Senators from the state where the position is located. Recommendations from party leaders or opposition party Senators may also be considered. Recess appointments may be given under certain circumstances. The Senate plays a crucial role in confirming nominations for various positions, with the authority to act coming after Senate confirmation and presidential appointment. The Senate's decision on a nomination depends on factors like the position's importance, political circumstances, and policy implications. The Senate confirmation process for nominations involves factors like the nominee's views, impact on public policy, and the President's party control. Nominations are received by the Senate executive clerk and referred to committees for investigation, hearings, and reporting. Committees gather information from the White House and conduct hearings on nominations. The Senate confirmation process for nominations involves committees holding hearings to discuss nominees' qualifications, policy perspectives, and oversight issues. Committees have the option to report a nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation to the full Senate. Failure to obtain a majority vote on the motion to report means the nomination will not be brought to the Senate floor. The Senate confirmation process involves committees holding hearings to discuss nominees' qualifications and policy perspectives. If a nomination fails to obtain a majority vote on the motion to report, it may not be brought to the Senate floor. Unsuccessful nominations usually do not make it past the committee stage for various reasons. The Senate confirmation process involves committees holding hearings to discuss nominees' qualifications and policy perspectives. If a nomination fails to obtain a majority vote on the motion to report, it may not be brought to the Senate floor. Unsuccessful nominations usually do not make it past the committee stage for various reasons. Once confirmed, the nominee receives a commission signed by the President and is sworn into office, granting full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the position. Limited-term appointments can be made by the President without Senate confirmation during recesses. The recess appointment power allows Presidents to make appointments without Senate confirmation during Senate recesses. These appointments expire at the end of the next Senate session. Congress has enacted provisions to restrict pay for recess appointees in certain situations. If a position becomes vacant while the Senate is in session and the President fills it through a recess appointment, the appointee may not be paid until confirmed by the Senate. The salary prohibition for recess appointees does not apply in certain situations, such as when the vacancy occurred within 30 days before the end of the Senate session, if a nomination was pending, or if a nomination was rejected and a new appointee received a recess appointment. A new nomination must be made within 40 days of the next session. The President typically submits a new nomination even if an earlier one is pending. The FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act may prevent a recess appointee from being paid after a nomination rejection. Congress has used specific scheduling practices to prevent recess appointments by the President. Limited statutory authority exists for temporarily filling vacant positions requiring Senate confirmation. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), vacant executive agency positions requiring confirmation can be temporarily filled in three ways: the first assistant assumes duties, the President can direct an officer in another agency, or the President can select an officer or employee meeting specific criteria. Temporary appointments under FVRA are limited to 210 days. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), temporary appointments for vacant executive agency positions are limited to 210 days, but the time restriction can be suspended under certain circumstances. President Obama submitted 347 nominations for full-time executive positions during the 111th Congress, with 293 confirmed, 16 withdrawn, and 38 returned. During the 111th Congress, President Obama submitted 347 nominations for full-time executive positions. Of these, 293 were confirmed, 16 were withdrawn, and 38 were returned to the President. The average time between nomination and confirmation was 73.2 days, with a median of 52.0 days. Each executive department profile includes information on full-time PAS positions and appointment actions during the Congress. During the 111th Congress, President Obama submitted 347 nominations for full-time executive positions, with 293 confirmed, 16 withdrawn, and 38 returned. Data on full-time PAS positions and appointment actions were collected from authoritative sources. The tables show pay levels, incumbents, vacancies, and appointment details for presidentially appointed positions. The appointment action tables provide details on nominees, positions, nomination dates, confirmation dates, and the number of days between nomination and confirmation. It also includes actions other than confirmation, such as nominations returned or withdrawn by the President. Some individuals were nominated multiple times for the same position. The tables present average \"days to confirm\" in mean and median to account for outliers influencing the data. The appointment action tables provide details on nominees, positions, nomination dates, confirmation dates, and the number of days between nomination and confirmation. Presenting both mean and median values gives a more accurate central tendency of the data. Titles of positions may differ between the White House submission, statutory establishment, and department usage. The first table lists incumbents based on department data, while the second table relies on the Senate nominations database. The curr_chunk discusses the database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) containing information on nominations sent to the Senate by the White House for executive department positions. Inconsistencies in position titles are noted in footnotes, with tables in Appendix A and B providing details on nominations, confirmations, and appointment timelines. The curr_chunk provides a table summarizing appointments and nominations by department, including details on positions, nominees, confirmations, and appointment timelines. Department abbreviations can be found in Appendix C."
