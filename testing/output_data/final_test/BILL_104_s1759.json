    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The Act is titled the \"Federal Health Program Benefit Change Accountability Act\" and addresses the issue of copayments for prescription drugs for Federal retirees. The Act highlights the financial burden on retirees who use local pharmacies instead of mail order pharmacies. The Act criticizes the impact of favoring out-of-state mail order pharmacies over local retail pharmacies, leading to economic losses and reduced accessibility, especially in rural areas. The Office of Personnel Management did not assess the effect on the quality of pharmacy care for Federal retirees. The Office of Personnel Management did not consider alternative cost containment options in the prescription drug program, focusing on economic factors instead. It also did not determine if savings were due to lower mail order drug costs or higher copayments at local pharmacies. Additionally, it did not assess the compatibility of the changes with current private market prescription drug programs. The Office of Personnel Management did not assess the impact of changes in the prescription drug program on the overall health care marketplace, neglecting the contractor's ability to fulfill mail order prescriptions and inconveniencing retirees. The Office should be more accountable for major changes in Federal health care. The Office of Personnel Management should be accountable for major changes in Federal health care program benefit designs, requiring justification of cost savings, access, and quality of care before implementation. SEC. 2. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The Office must prepare an annual report detailing any significant changes in benefits for the upcoming contract year, including justification, cost savings analysis, impact on care access and quality, and costs. The Office will publish an annual report in the Federal Register and submit it to Congress, detailing proposed changes in benefits for the upcoming contract year. The report will include assessments on access to care, quality, costs, carrier implementation efficiency, and economic impacts on providers and enrollees. The amendment will apply to changes taking effect in contract years starting six months after enactment. The amendment will apply to changes beginning later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act."
