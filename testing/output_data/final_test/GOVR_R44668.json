    "content": "The TANF block grant was created in 1996 to replace the AFDC program, providing cash assistance to needy families. Legislative activity since 2002 has focused on extending funding for TANF without major policy changes. The TANF Extension Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-4) extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019, without changing TANF policy. The report provides a brief history of the AFDC program, welfare reform debates, and a detailed chronology of TANF legislation. Federal funding for cash assistance for needy families with children dates back to the early 1900s. The history of the ADC/AFDC program focused on providing federal funding for social services, medical assistance, child care, and foster care. The program also addressed issues of work and marriage incentives for single mothers, leading to the creation of the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program was created to reimburse states and the federal government for providing assistance to single mothers. It evolved into distributing child support payments from noncustodial parents to custodial parents, mainly to families not receiving cash assistance. The Social Security Act of 1935 established social insurance programs for old age benefits and unemployment compensation, along with federal funding for state programs aiding low-income aged, blind persons, and needy families with children. The Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) program was created to help finance programs for children deprived of parental support. States determined eligibility and received federal funding for the program. The legislative history emphasized that ADC payments were meant to allow mothers to stay at home and provide necessary care for their children. The 1935 Social Security Act delegated administration and eligibility decisions to states, including determining ADC benefit amounts. Initially, ADC families were often headed by widows or disabled fathers, but the program evolved. The 1939 Social Security Amendments added survivor benefits to Old Age and Survivors Insurance, providing social insurance benefits to spouses and children of deceased workers. The 1956 Social Security Amendments further expanded the program. The 1956 Social Security Amendments added Disability Insurance to Old Age and Survivor Insurance, creating a more universal means of aiding widows and their children. These changes expanded the types of jobs covered by Social Security and helped families where the father was alive but absent, leading to an increase in nonwhite recipients. There was debate over whether single mothers should work, as the original intent of Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) was for mothers to stay home, but low-income women, especially women of color, often had to work. The Social Security Amendments of 1956 expanded aid to widows and children, leading to an increase in nonwhite recipients. The amendments also added goals of self-sufficiency and strengthening family life to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). In 1961, cash assistance benefits were extended to families with two able-bodied parents, and in 1962, the program was renamed AFDC with the establishment of a community work and training program for recipients. The Social Security Amendments of 1967 introduced financial incentives and work requirements for AFDC recipients, including the creation of the Work Incentive Program (WIN) for women. Welfare reform debates began in the late 1960s due to the increasing costs and number of families on AFDC, which grew from fewer than 1 million in 1964 to 3.1 million in 1973. In 1973, AFDC rolls increased to 3.1 million families. President Nixon proposed the Family Assistance Plan (FAP) in 1969, based on the \"negative income tax\" concept. The proposal aimed to provide a guaranteed income to families without earnings and gradually reduce benefits as earnings increased. The FAP would have nationalized the program, with the federal government paying the income guarantee. However, the legislation was not enacted. In 1972, the Senate Finance Committee proposed guaranteeing jobs for parents of school-age children, but this proposal also did not pass. President Carter proposed an NIT-based cash assistance program in 1977, but it did not pass. His 1979 proposal passed the House but not the Senate. President Reagan's welfare reform proposals focused on devolution to states and work requirements. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 limited earnings disregard and gave states more authority to require work or community service from recipients. In the 1980s, there was increasing attention to \"welfare dependency\" as policymakers focused on the challenges faced by single mothers leaving welfare for work, risking losing benefits like Medicaid and facing work-related costs. The Family Support Act of 1988 aimed to address these issues. The Family Support Act of 1988 established mutual responsibility between cash assistance recipients and the state, creating the JOBS Training program for employment services. It also provided benefits for two-parent families on more restrictive terms than single-parent families and introduced the Transitional Medical Assistance program for Medicaid coverage during the transition from welfare to work. Additionally, it guaranteed child care for AFDC recipients in work activities and offered time-limited child care for those leaving AFDC for work. The legislation in 1990 expanded child care by creating a new block grant for those without a connection to AFDC, providing matching funds for child care for those \"at risk\" of receiving AFDC, and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. The era of experimentation on \"welfare-to-work\" initiatives began in the 1980s, with President Reagan proposing legislation in 1987 for states to conduct demonstration projects overseen by an Interagency Low-Income Opportunity Board. Though the legislation was not enacted, waivers of AFDC requirements were issued by subsequent administrations for experimentation on these initiatives. During the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton promised to reform welfare by implementing time-limited aid and increased financial support for those who found employment. In 1993, the EITC was expanded through a tax bill. President Clinton proposed welfare reform in 1994, which included a two-year limit on AFDC receipt without work and mandatory participation in a wage-paying work program. President Clinton proposed welfare reform in 1994, including a two-year limit on AFDC receipt without work and mandatory participation in a wage-paying work program. The proposal was never considered by Congress, but waivers were granted to 43 states for welfare reform demonstration projects before the 1996 welfare reform law. Welfare reform was part of the \"Contract with America\" in 1994, requiring recipients to work after two years. The welfare proposal in the Contract with America included a lifetime five-year limit on benefits, barred AFDC to unwed minor mothers, imposed a \"family cap,\" and capped funding for AFDC and child care. H.R. 4 was the original proposal, but House Republicans later worked on an alternative that involved block granting funding for AFDC and other social programs. The House Republicans proposed an omnibus welfare reform bill, the Personal Responsibility Act, which replaced AFDC with TANF through block grants to states. H.R. 4 formed the basis for subsequent welfare reform bills in the 104th Congress, focusing on work requirements and a broad range of benefits and services for TANF recipients. The Personal Responsibility Act replaced AFDC with TANF through block grants to states, with requirements for caseload reduction, a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance, restrictions on unwed minor parents and benefits for noncitizens, and limitations on increasing cash benefits for new babies. The bill also consolidated child care funding and increased funding for child care, but ended the guarantee of child care for those transitioning from welfare-to-work. The Senate Finance Committee bill, ordered in May 1995, differed from the House bill by maintaining a separate employment and training program, excluding a family cap, and not prohibiting benefits to unwed minor parents. Disputes over fund distribution delayed the bill until August and September 1995. Negotiations between party leaders led to a compromise bill that retained the basic structure of the House bill but included modifications such as requiring states to continue spending their own funds. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 4 on September 19, 1995, which included provisions such as a maintenance of effort requirement, supplemental grants for states with high population growth, a contingency fund for states in economic need, aid for unwed minor parents, and charitable choice provisions for faith-based organizations. The House Budget Committee reported its budget reconciliation bill on October 17, 1995, which ended AFDC and replaced it with TANF. The House and Senate passed the budget reconciliation bill (H.R. 2491) in October 1995, which included welfare reform provisions replacing AFDC with TANF. President Clinton vetoed the bill in December 1995, citing concerns about cuts to low-income programs. The final agreement on the stand-alone welfare reform bill (H.R. 4) included modifications such as a compromise maintenance of effort requirement, supplemental grants to states with high population growth, and a state option to impose a family cap. President Clinton vetoed H.R. 4 on January 9, 1996, emphasizing the need for sufficient child care, job placement rewards, health coverage guarantees, and state support for moving people from welfare to work. The President objected to budget cuts unrelated to the TANF proposal, including cuts to food stamps, benefits for disabled children, benefits for noncitizens, school lunches, and foster care and adoption assistance. The National Governor's Association requested additional child care funds, contingency funds for recessionary periods, and bonus payments for states meeting employment outcomes. House and Senate Republicans introduced bills providing additional funding for child care, the TANF contingency fund, and performance bonuses. The budget reconciliation bill H.R. 3734 in 1996 included welfare reform provisions and a proposal to revise Medicaid. The bill passed the House and Senate with modifications, leading to the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. This law replaced AFDC with the TANF block grant and consolidated funding for child care programs. The 1996 law replaced AFDC with the TANF block grant, consolidating funding for child care programs. States run TANF programs, setting benefit levels and income eligibility. Waivers allowed states to continue programs with different rules until 2007. The BBA97, enacted in 1997, made changes to TANF including the creation of the Welfare-to-Work Grant program (WTW) providing $3 billion for two years. Administered by the Department of Labor, it targeted the hardest to serve population on TANF and noncustodial parents. Subsequent legislation relaxed targeting requirements and extended the deadline for expenditures. The BBA97 made permanent changes to TANF, allowing more recipients to be counted as engaged in work through education and training. It also set a limit on transfers to the Social Services Block Grant and made technical corrections to the welfare reform bill. President George W. Bush proposed a five-year reauthorization for TANF, maintaining funding levels and providing mandatory child care funding through FY2007. The Bush Administration proposed changes to TANF, including raising the work participation standard to 70% of families, requiring 40 hours of work per week, allowing states to count rehabilitative activities for three months, and ending the caseload reduction credit. These proposals were incorporated into bills that passed the House in 2002 and 2003. The House proposals in 2002 and 2003 retained the caseload reduction credit and provided extra credit to states with significant historical caseload reductions. The Senate Finance Committee bills differed significantly, allowing a broader range of activities to count towards the work participation standard and replacing the caseload reduction credit with a credit based on employed leavers, families diverted from the rolls, and families receiving work supports. In the absence of reauthorization legislation, TANF program and funding authority was extended on a temporary basis multiple times from 2002 to 2006. Legislation to reauthorize TANF was considered in 2005, with the Senate Finance Committee reporting S. 667 (109th Congress) and the House Ways and Means Committee considering H.R. 240. Further action on TANF reauthorization occurred in the fall of 2005, with the House passing TANF reauthorization bills as part of their reconciliation bill. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171) included a long-term extension of TANF funding through FY2010, elimination of performance bonuses to states, establishment of a fund for research on healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood, and changes to TANF work rules. The DRA of 2005 extended TANF funding, changed work rules, and increased child care funding. It was signed into law in February 2006. In response to the recession, the ARRA of 2009 included tax cuts, unemployment insurance, and extra funding for states. The ARRA of 2009 provided fiscal relief to states, including $5 billion for a TANF Emergency Contingency Fund. This fund reimbursed states for increased expenditures for basic assistance, emergency aid, and subsidized employment. The TANF caseload reduction credit was frozen at prerecession levels through FY2011. The long-term extension of TANF enacted in the DRA expired in FY2010, leading to short-term extensions by Congress. During periods of government shutdowns in October 2013 and December 2018, TANF funding faced gaps, but states could use unspent funds. Some short-term extensions of TANF funding made policy changes, including the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 extending TANF through FY2011 and altering funding for marriage and fatherhood programs. The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 altered funding for responsible fatherhood programs, splitting the $150 million appropriation into $75 million for healthy marriage and $75 million for responsible fatherhood. It also required special reports from states on fund usage and individuals with no work participation hours. TANF supplemental grants were only funded until June 30, 2011, and were not provided for the last quarter of FY2011 or any fiscal year thereafter. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended TANF through FY2012 and permanently amended TANF law to prevent cash assistance withdrawals at ATMs in certain establishments. The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act extended funding for the TANF block grant and financed TANF-related research. In 2018, legislation was proposed to reauthorize and fund TANF for five years with revised work rules and spending requirements. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 established the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. States were required to implement TANF by July 1, 1997. P.L. 104-327 amended the transition rule from pre-TANF programs to TANF, changing the limit on funding for FY1997. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) raised the cap on education as work to 30%, established the Welfare-to-Work grant program, and made technical corrections to previous legislation. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (P.L. 105-89) reduced the contingency fund appropriation by $40 million. The Transportation Act for the 21st Century allowed federal TANF funds to be used as matching funds for reverse commuter grants and set a limit on TANF transfers to Title XX social services. Subsequent acts broadened eligibility for the Welfare-to-Work grant program and extended the time grantees had to spend grant funds. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act extended TANF grants through FY2002. Subsequent acts further extended TANF funding through March 31, 2004. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act extended TANF grants through FY2002. Subsequent acts further extended TANF funding through September 30, 2005, including provisions for Hurricane Katrina relief. In 2005, states were allowed to use contingency funds to help those affected by Hurricane Katrina, with repayment of loans forgiven and penalties suspended. TANF grants were extended through March 30, 2006, and later through FY2010 with changes to funding and requirements. The Medicare Improvements and Patients and Providers Act of 2008 extended TANF supplemental grants through FY2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 established a $5 billion Emergency Contingency Fund to reimburse states for increased costs during the Great Recession. This fund reimbursed states for 80% of increased costs and allowed states to freeze caseload reduction credits and use TANF reserve funds for any benefit or service. Supplemental grants were extended through FY2010. P.L. 111-242 extended TANF funding through December 3, 2010, and P.L. 111-290 extended it through December 18, 2010. P.L. 111-291 extended basic TANF funding through FY2011 but only provided supplemental grants until June 30, 2011. P.L. 112-35 extended basic TANF funding for three months. The Short-Term TANF Extension Act extended basic TANF funding through December 31, 2011. The Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 extended funding through February 29, 2012. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended funding until September 30, 2012 and imposed restrictions on TANF cash access. The Protect Our Kids Act of 2012 allocated $612 million to the TANF contingency fund for FY2013 and FY2014. Various bills extended TANF funding through FY2013 and FY2014, with specific dates ranging from March 2013 to January 2014. The TANF funding was extended multiple times through short-term continuing resolutions and omnibus appropriations acts from January 2014 to December 2015. The TANF funding was extended through various legislative acts from December 2015 to May 2017, with provisions for TANF-related research activities and a reduction in the basic block grant for each state. The TANF funding was extended through legislative acts from December 2015 to June 2019, with provisions for TANF-related research activities and a reduction in the basic block grant for each state by 0.33%. The Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Department of Labor, developed a database named \"What Works Clearinghouse of Proven and Promising Projects to Move Welfare Recipients into Work.\""
