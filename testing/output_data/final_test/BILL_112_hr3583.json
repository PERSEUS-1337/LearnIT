    "content": "The Act titled \"Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2011\" includes provisions for automatic continuing appropriations. The \"Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2011\" includes a new section in Chapter 13 of title 31, United States Code, allowing for continuing appropriations if an appropriation measure is not enacted before the fiscal year begins. This provision ensures funding for programs, projects, or activities from the previous fiscal year if no new appropriations are in place. Appropriations and funds for programs in a fiscal year shall not exceed 99% of the previous year's funding, or the most recent continuing resolution. The text chunk discusses making continuing appropriations for part of the fiscal year, with a reduction in operations rate for subsequent three-month periods. The total amount of appropriations and funds for a program should not exceed specified levels. Appropriations and funds for a program shall be available for the fiscal year. The text chunk outlines the availability of appropriations for programs, projects, or activities during a lapse in appropriations, subject to certain conditions. The appropriations or funds made available for a fiscal year will follow the terms and conditions of the preceding fiscal year. During a fiscal year, appropriations and funds for programs, projects, or activities under this section must cover all obligations or expenditures incurred. Expenditures for these purposes will be charged to the appropriate appropriation when a regular appropriation bill or continuing resolution becomes law. This section does not apply if another law provides funding for the program, project, or activity. During a fiscal year, appropriations and funds must cover all obligations or expenditures incurred for programs, projects, or activities. Expenditures will be charged to the appropriate appropriation when a regular appropriation bill or continuing resolution becomes law. If no funding is provided by another law, appropriations, funds, or authority for a program, project, or activity may continue. Continuing appropriations allow for the funding of programs, projects, or activities when no other funding is provided by law."
