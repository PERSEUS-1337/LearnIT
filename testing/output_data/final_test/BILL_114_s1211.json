The term 'severe wound' in this paragraph refers to various types of serious wounds such as stage 3 or 4 wounds, infected wounds, non-healing surgical wounds, and others. This definition applies to individuals discharged from long-term care hospitals following a stay that was immediately preceded by a discharge from a subsection (d) hospital. The term 'severe wound criterion' in this subparagraph refers to individuals discharged from long-term care hospitals who received excisional debridement, total parenteral nutrition, or have at least one major organ failure. The temporary exception for certain severe wound discharges from long-term care hospitals allows for payment to be made without applying certain conditions for discharges occurring before October 1, 2017. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the treatment needs and costs of individuals requiring specialized wound care under Medicare, focusing on access to care and the impact of specific regulations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the impact of section 1886(m)(6)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act on access, quality, and cost of care for individuals needing specialized wound care under Medicare.
