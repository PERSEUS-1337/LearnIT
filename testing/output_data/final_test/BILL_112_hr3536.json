    "content": "The \"Safe Roads for America Act of 2011\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that individuals aged 65 need 4 times more light at night than those aged 25. By 2030, 1 in 4 drivers will be 65 or older. Increasing the retroreflectivity and size of traffic signs benefits older drivers and emergency responders, reducing accidents and response times. Over 50% of fatal traffic accidents occur at night, highlighting the importance of improved sign visibility. In response to a statutory requirement from Congress, deadlines were established in 2007 for roadway owners to ensure that their signs meet minimum levels of retroreflectivity by specific dates. The Federal Highway Administration estimated the cost of these retroreflectivity improvements for signage throughout the United States to be $37,000,000 over a 10-year period. The United States is facing economic challenges, leading to local governments adopting cost-cutting measures such as laying off employees and postponing capital improvements. Local governments are facing rising costs of employee benefits and are being burdened with more expenses as states pass on service costs to balance their budgets. Recovery is expected to take at least 5 years, with local governments delaying increased tax collections due to property tax nature. This has led to measures like postponing capital improvements, deferring maintenance, cutting equipment inventories, and even declaring bankruptcy in some cases. SEC. 3. RETROREFLECTIVITY LEVEL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO TRAFFIC SIGNS. The Secretary of Transportation will adjust compliance dates for retroreflectivity level standards in traffic signs, with a target compliance date of January 22, 2012, for maintaining retroreflectivity levels and January 22, 2018, for replacing signs that fail to meet the standards. The Secretary of Transportation will revise compliance dates for street name signs and overhead guide signs failing to meet established minimum levels, with a target compliance date of January 22, 2021. Funding for this revision can be sourced from available funds regardless of previous funding limitations. The Highway Safety Improvement Program under Section 4 is outlined. The amendment to Section 148 of title 23, United States Code, includes the installation, replacement, and upgrade of highway signs and pavement markings to meet performance standards and regulations. Additionally, a new definition is added for maintaining minimum levels of retroreflectivity. The amendment to Section 148 of title 23, United States Code, includes projects to maintain minimum levels of retroreflectivity for highway signs and pavement markings. The amendment to Section 148 of title 23, United States Code, includes standards for projects to upgrade highway signs and pavement markings by maintaining minimum levels of retroreflectivity. The Secretary will issue standards for the use of funds apportioned to states for highway safety improvement projects in this regard. The amendment to Section 148 of title 23, United States Code, includes standards for highway safety improvement projects to upgrade highway signs and pavement markings to meet defined criteria. The funds can be used for initial upgrades but not for maintenance activities."
