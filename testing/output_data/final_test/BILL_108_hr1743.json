    "content": "The Act titled \"Iowa Medicare PPO Demonstration Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. The findings and purpose of the Act are outlined in section 2. Congress finds that Iowa had lower initial reimbursement rates under the Medicare program due to cost containment techniques, leading to widened differentials in reimbursement rates among states over the years. Despite having a high percentage of elderly citizens, Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa utilize the healthcare system less frequently and have shorter hospitalizations compared to residents of other states. The disparity in Medicare reimbursements between Iowa and Louisiana is significant, with Iowa receiving the lowest reimbursement per beneficiary in the nation. This discrepancy is not justified by the similar cost of living between the two states. The undercompensation in health care costs for Iowa, combined with its aging population and rural healthcare challenges, has created a crisis for healthcare providers and Medicare beneficiaries in the state. The inequity in Medicare reimbursements exacerbates the cost of living differential between Iowa and states like Louisiana. This disparity leads to shortages of healthcare providers in Iowa, particularly in smaller counties, posing a significant challenge for the state's healthcare system. The differences in Medicare reimbursement between states should not be far below the cost of living differentials. Low payment rates and provider shortages discourage Medicare+Choice plans in rural areas, creating unfairness for residents who want to access additional services. In order to promote Medicare+Choice plans in rural States, incentives are needed for States, insurers, and entities interested in sponsoring such plans. Iowa's low Medicare reimbursement rate hinders new healthcare models from attracting enough providers. Preferred provider organizations can enhance care management and clinical outcomes. State governments should support the establishment of organizations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may approve a demonstration project to improve access to health care services for Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa through cooperative efforts among insurers, providers, and health care professionals. The project aims to test innovative reimbursement options under the Medicare program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may approve a demonstration project to improve access to health care services for Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa through cooperative efforts among insurers, providers, and health care professionals, testing innovative reimbursement options under the Medicare program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may approve a demonstration project in Iowa for preferred provider organizations (PPOs) under the Medicare+Choice program, aiming to align Medicare reimbursement rates with the national average. Insurers domiciled in Iowa can apply for participation in this project. The project in Iowa and Illinois aims to offer a Medicare+Choice plan meeting specific requirements, including eligibility of all licensed healthcare providers as preferred providers and adjustments to hospital payment rates for indirect medical education costs. The Medicare+Choice plan in Iowa and Illinois includes adjustments to hospital payment rates for indirect medical education costs, reimbursement for services at a rate no less than 110 percent, partial underwriting of financial risk by the Secretary, and provision for healthcare by the insurer. The insurer should provide additional health care benefits beyond those required under Medicare parts A and B, such as coverage for outpatient prescription drugs, hearing aids, and eye glasses. The Secretary may also provide additional payments for start-up costs associated with preferred provider organizations. The demonstration project will operate for 5 years. The insurer will operate a demonstration project for 5 years, with an advisory board to review payment rates for services. The board will consist of 7 members with expertise in healthcare, including the Attorney General of Iowa and members recommended by the Governor and Iowa Hospital Association. The advisory board, consisting of 7 members with healthcare expertise, will review payment rates for services in a 5-year demonstration project. Members will serve 5-year terms, meet as needed, and vacancies will be filled promptly. No additional compensation will be provided for their service."
