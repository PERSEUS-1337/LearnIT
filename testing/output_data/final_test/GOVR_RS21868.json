    "content": "On August 5, 2004, the United States, the Dominican Republic, and five Central American countries signed a regional free-trade agreement (DR-CAFTA). This agreement integrated the Dominican Republic into the existing CAFTA agreement, with the same obligations and commitments as other Central American countries. Market access schedules were negotiated for goods, agriculture, services, investment, and government procurement. Under the agreement with the Dominican Republic FTA, 80% of U.S. exports of non-agricultural products would become duty-free immediately, with remaining duties phased out over 10 years. U.S. sectors with immediate duty-free access include information technology products, agricultural and construction equipment, paper products, wood, pharmaceuticals, and medical and scientific equipment. U.S. autos and auto parts would enter duty-free after five years. Over half of U.S. agricultural exports would receive duty-free treatment immediately, including corn, cotton, wheat, soybeans, fruits, vegetables, and processed food products. Tariffs would be phased out on most agricultural products within 15 years and all agricultural products within 20 years. Beef, pork, poultry, rice, and dairy products would become duty-free under tariff-rate quotas. Most U.S. agricultural producers support the agreement. The FTA with the Dominican Republic includes duty-free access for U.S. agricultural products, with the sugar provisions being less controversial compared to other countries. The U.S. sugar industry is concerned about the market-opening precedent set by the agreement. The tariff-rate quota on sugar would gradually increase over the years. The agreement is supported by U.S. agricultural producers and industry associations. The FTA with the Dominican Republic includes duty-free access for U.S. agricultural products, with sugar provisions being less controversial. The tariff-rate quota on sugar would gradually increase over the years. Dale Hathaway noted the increase in the Dominican Republic's sugar cap was not significant. The U.S. Sugar Industry Group expressed concerns about potential destabilization of domestic prices with more imports from the Dominican Republic. Textiles and apparel from the Dominican Republic would become duty-free and quota-free immediately if they met the agreement's rules of origin. The American Textile Manufacturers Institute expressed concerns about CAFTA potentially reducing U.S. employment in the textile industry. The American Apparel and Footwear Association, on the other hand, stated that the swift implementation of the FTA with the Dominican Republic could have a positive economic impact in the United States. An unresolved issue is the production of apparel under co-production arrangements with Haiti, as CBTPA benefits expire when a new FTA enters into force between the United States and a CBTPA beneficiary country. The United States works with Congress to ensure Haiti's eligibility under CBTPA for apparel with inputs from the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic commits to combat broadcast piracy as part of the bilateral FTA with the US. U.S. industry advisors urge vigilant monitoring of the agreement's implementation. The Dominican Republic signed on to the general principles of each CAFTA chapter but negotiated its own specific concessions, such as in government procurement where each signatory would observe principles only with respect to its own negotiated list of agencies and thresholds for contract amounts covered. Similarly, chapters on cross-border trade in services, financial services, and investment include general principles like nondiscriminatory treatment. The Dominican Republic agreed to most CAFTA provisions, including labor and environmental chapters. Parties would enforce domestic laws but retain discretion. They recognized the importance of not weakening laws for trade, ensuring access to judicial proceedings. Governmental committees would oversee implementation, with a dispute process for labor or environmental complaints resulting in potential monetary damages for the losing party. The U.S. Trade Representative states that the FTA with the Dominican Republic will enforce labor laws and improve enforcement capacity. Despite existing worker rights in the Constitution and Labor Code, there are challenges in practice. Calls for further reform include effective enforcement provisions, protection against trade law violations, and safeguards for pregnant women in the workforce. The Dominican Republic's accession to CAFTA allows for the establishment of various chapters covering dispute settlement, trade remedies, electronic commerce, and telecommunications. These chapters aim to resolve disputes, set rules for safeguards, maintain duty-free transmission of digital products, and ensure standards for telecommunications services. Additionally, there are chapters on customs administration, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and transparency of laws and regulations. This agreement would also establish a Committee on violations, with concerns raised about workplace discrimination and the potential loss of protections for workers under current U.S. trade programs. The Dominican Republic's participation in the FTA was threatened by a newly passed tax in 2004. The tax, which included a 25% increase on soft drinks with high-fructose corn syrup, jeopardized the agreement. US officials warned that the tax could lead to Senate opposition. Despite this, the Dominican Republic repealed the tax in response to the opposition. The Dominican Republic repealed the 25% tax in response to opposition, uncertain when implementing legislation for DR-CAFTA will be submitted to Congress. Expected to be controversial."
