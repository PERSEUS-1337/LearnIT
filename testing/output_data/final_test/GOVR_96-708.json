    "content": "This report provides a summary of House and Senate procedures for reaching agreement on legislation, focusing on the most common procedures. The House and Senate must pass the same bill or joint resolution and reach full agreement on its text before submission to the President. Exceptions, complications, and modifications to procedures are possible. The House and Senate must pass the same bill or joint resolution and reach full agreement on its text before submission to the President. One house can pass its own bill and send it to the other body for consideration and passage. Committees in each chamber may develop their own bills on the same subject, leading to debates, amendments, and eventual passage of corresponding bills. For example, the House may amend a Senate bill by replacing the text with its own before passing the amended Senate bill. This process allows for the passage of two bills with the same text. The House and Senate can pass two bills with the same text, but the Senate bill is more likely to become law. The Senate may amend the House bill with its own text before passing it. This process can become more complicated if the Senate passes a bill before the House passes its own bills on the same subjects. After the House and Senate pass bills with the same text, they may replace the text of one bill with both of their own bills. This can be done to resolve policy differences and create a conference committee to address major bills. The House and Senate can resolve differences in bills through informal negotiations and exchanging amendments. The amendments can be passed back and forth between the houses until an agreement is reached. This process can involve accepting, amending, or further amending the amendments, leading to agreement between the two chambers. The House and Senate can resolve differences in bills through informal negotiations and exchanging amendments. The House can concur with Senate amendments, but cannot propose new amendments to them. Prohibitions on third-degree amendments can be waived by special rules or unanimous consent. If disagreements persist, the bill can be sent back and forth between the houses multiple times. The process of resolving differences in bills between the House and Senate involves informal negotiations, exchanging amendments, and potentially submitting differences to a conference committee. If an agreement is reached, the House can concur with Senate amendments, leading to a resolution of their differences. The House and Senate resolve differences through informal negotiations and conference committees. House amendments to Senate bills are privileged for floor action, with motions to dispose of amendments being debatable and subject to filibusters. The majority leader can move to concur in House amendments and preempt other motions by \"filling the tree.\" If 60 Senators support ending debate, the motion to concur can proceed. The Senate can avoid further amendment and extended debate on a House amendment by unanimous consent. House amendments to Senate bills are privileged for floor action, and can be accepted or amended by the House through a motion to suspend the rules or a special rule recommended by the Rules Committee. Before a conference committee is created to resolve disagreements between the two houses, the House and Senate must each state disagreement. The papers are comprised of the official copy of the bill as passed by the house in which it originated, the official copies of amendments by either house, and the messages by which each house informs the other of the actions it has taken. Both houses cannot consider the same bill at the same time, as they can only act if they have the \"papers.\" The House and Senate always act in sequence as custody of the papers changes hands. Before a conference committee is created to resolve disagreements between the two houses, the House and Senate must each state disagreement over a bill. The process involves disagreeing to amendments or insisting on their own amendments. If one house concurs with the other's amendments and proposes its own, there is no formal disagreement. However, either house can propose going to conference at any point during an exchange of amendments. The two houses usually establish a conference committee in one of two ways, such as when the Senate passes a House bill with amendments and requests a conference. The House typically agrees to the conference, but it is not always necessary. The Senate passes a House bill with amendments, which may lead to a conference if the House does not accept the amendments. Both chambers can agree to send a measure to conference by unanimous consent. If there is an objection, a privileged motion can be made to request a conference with the Senate. The Senate can authorize a conference with the House if unanimous consent cannot be reached. A motion can be made to form a conference committee, subject to debate under Senate rules. If cloture is invoked, the Senate can vote to approve the motion after two hours of debate. Each house appoints its conferees immediately after deciding to go to conference. The Speaker appoints House conferees, while the Senate can authorize the presiding officer to appoint Senate conferees. The chairman and ranking minority member of the committee or subcommittee that reported the bill are usually appointed as conferees, along with other members selected by party leaders. The Speaker and Senate presiding officer typically accept the list of conferees prepared by committee leaders. Members of multiple committees may be appointed as conferees for bills involving their jurisdictions. Conferees are appointed to negotiate agreements on specific sections or titles of a bill within their committee's jurisdiction. The Speaker may appoint additional Representatives for important amendments. House and Senate conferees vote as a delegation, with a majority required to sign the conference report. The number of managers appointed by each house may differ, and party balance is reflected in the list of conferees. Conferees from the House and Senate negotiate agreements on bill sections within their jurisdiction. Instructions to conferees are not binding, and the House can also instruct them if they do not report within a specified timeframe. Conference committee meetings are typically open to the public, but can be closed if the conferees vote to do so. Both chambers have guidelines for these meetings, but they are often waived. Conferees select their own chairman and work without formal rules on procedural matters. The negotiations are conducted by the conferees themselves, with a single public meeting being common. Conference committees are established to resolve disagreements between the House and Senate over bills. Conferees have limited authority to make decisions within the scope of differences between the two versions. They cannot change provisions both houses agree on or add new elements. For example, if the House appropriates $10 million and the Senate amends it to $20 million, conferees cannot agree on an amount outside this range. Conferees have limited authority to resolve differences between the House and Senate over bills. It is easier to determine differences when they are quantitative rather than qualitative. Modern practice often involves one amendment in conference, such as a Senate substitute for the House version of a bill. Conferees may write their own conference substitute if the House and Senate versions of a bill have significant differences. The conference report can be challenged if it goes beyond the scope of the differences or addresses non-disagreements, but the House often waives rules to protect it. The Senate tends to be more lenient in allowing conferees to develop a conference substitute. The Senate can waive its rule with a three-fifths vote of Senators to limit the authority of Senate conferees in developing a conference substitute. Senate Rule XLIV, paragraph 8, allows a Senator to raise a point of order against new directed spending provisions in a conference report. The Senate can waive restrictions on conference reports with a three-fifths vote. When conferees reach agreement, a conference report and joint explanatory statement are prepared. House and Senate managers must sign both documents. House rules require conferees to sign the agreement at a specific time and place. After reaching agreement, a conference report and joint explanatory statement are prepared, signed by House and Senate managers. The final conference agreement is reviewed by House managers, followed by debates and votes in each chamber. The house that requested the conference typically acts first on the report, but this is not a strict rule. The Senate usually considers a conference report by unanimous consent, with a 48-hour availability requirement before voting. The Senate rules require a conference report to be available to the public for 48 hours before a vote, with exceptions for significant disruptions. The report must be posted on a congressional or government website. Debate on the report can be extended unless limited by unanimous consent or cloture, or if expedited procedures are in place. The Senate rules require a conference report to be available to the public for 48 hours before a vote, with exceptions for significant disruptions. Debate on the report can be extended unless limited by unanimous consent or cloture, or if expedited procedures are in place. Paragraph 8 of Senate Rule XXVIII states that time for debating a conference report shall be equally divided between the majority and minority parties. A point of order may be made against a conference report at any time, and if sustained for exceeding authority, offending portions can be struck out and the rest considered. The Senate rules allow for a point of order to be raised against provisions in a conference report. If sustained, the offending provisions can be removed, and the Senate can then consider a motion to send a revised proposal to the House. Amendments to this motion are not allowed, and debate is limited as it was on the original conference report. The Senate rules allow for a point of order to be raised against provisions in a conference report. If sustained, the offending provisions can be removed, and the Senate can consider a motion to send a revised proposal to the House. The House then has an opportunity to act on the amendment under regular procedures. Senate rules also allow for waiving restrictions on conference reports through a motion to waive points of order. If supported, the Senate agrees to keep the potentially violating matter in the conference report. The House follows specific rules for considering conference reports, including availability requirements and waivers by the Rules Committee. Typically, a special rule is adopted to protect the report against points of order. Debates on conference reports are conducted under the one-hour rule with equal time divided between parties. The House follows specific rules for considering conference reports, including availability requirements and waivers by the Rules Committee. Typically, a special rule is adopted to protect the report against points of order. Debates on conference reports are conducted under the one-hour rule with equal time divided between parties. If both floor managers support the report, a Representative opposed to it may claim one-third of the time for debate. At the end of the first hour, the House normally votes to order the previous question, which precludes additional debate. Conference reports are not amendable and each report is a compromise proposal for resolving disagreements between the House and Senate. When the House and Senate agree on a conference report, the bill is enrolled and sent to the President for approval. The report is based on the interpretation of rules and precedents, with readers advised to study House and Senate rules and precedents for better understanding. The process of resolving legislative differences in Congress involves conference committees and amendments between the Houses.
