    "content": "The \"Medicaid Expansion Incentive Act of 2013\" allows for the redistribution of federal Medicaid funds to states that choose to meet ACA Medicaid expansion requirements from states that do not elect to do so. The \"Medicaid Expansion Incentive Act of 2013\" amends Section 1903 of the Social Security Act to provide a bonus for states electing to meet ACA Medicaid expansion requirements using funds from non-participating states. This allows participating states to receive increased payments under their State plan based on the net reduction in Federal expenditures for nonparticipating states. The \"Medicaid Expansion Incentive Act of 2013\" incentivizes states to meet ACA Medicaid expansion requirements by providing a bonus using funds from non-participating states. Participating states can receive increased payments under their State plan based on the reduction in Federal expenditures for nonparticipating states. States are requested to inform the Secretary before each fiscal year if they will be applying their State plan in accordance with the expansion requirements. The ACA Medicaid expansion requirements, outlined in section 2001(a) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, include specific criteria that states must meet. The Secretary will determine participating and nonparticipating states based on information submitted each fiscal year. The ACA Medicaid expansion requirements determine which states will be participating or nonparticipating in applying the requirements each fiscal year. The Secretary calculates payment increases for participating states. The Secretary calculates payment increases for participating states based on available funds and a specified formula, which may consider elements like increasing FMAP to 100% for newly eligible individuals, raising matching percentages for administrative costs related to ACA Medicaid expansion, and increasing DSH allotments. Additionally, the Secretary publishes information on the estimated impact of nonparticipation for each nonparticipating state. The Secretary estimates the forgone Federal funds and additional beneficiaries for nonparticipating states under the State plan."
