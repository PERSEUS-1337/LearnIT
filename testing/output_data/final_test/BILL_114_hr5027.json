    "content": "SECTION 1. CALLABLE STOCK OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS. The Federal Reserve Act is amended to change the subscription to stock payment schedule. Instead of one-sixth payments, it will now be one-twelfth paid at the necessary time. The Federal Reserve Act is amended to change the stock payment schedule to one-twelfth of the subscription to be paid as directed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. For member banks with total assets of $10,000,000,000 or less, different payment provisions apply. For member banks with total assets of $10,000,000,000 or less, they may elect to pay one-half of the subscription instead of the one-twelfth amount specified. The election must be made before the end of the 1-year period from becoming a member bank. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may only call the subscription subject to call. The Federal Reserve System can only call a member bank's subscription if surplus funds are exhausted. A member bank can request a return of called amounts if surplus funds exceed $1,000,000,000. The Board of Governors adjusts dollar amounts of total assets annually. The Federal Reserve System adjusts dollar amounts of total assets annually based on the Gross Domestic Product Price Index. The subscription payment process for member banks is also modified, with one-twelfth of the subscription to be paid upfront and the remainder subject to the Board of Governors' call. The Federal Reserve System adjusts total assets annually based on the GDP Price Index. Member banks must make an election within a year if they have assets of $10 billion or less. The Board of Governors will direct Federal reserve banks to return payments to member banks. The Federal Reserve System will return 2.5 percent of the paid-up capital stock and surplus to member banks with total assets exceeding $10 billion or less if they choose to pay one-twelfth of the subscription amount. The term \"member bank\" is defined under the Federal Reserve Act."
