    "content": "The \"Ensuring Quality in the Unemployment Insurance Program (EQUIP) Act\" requires drug screening as a condition for receiving benefits. The \"Ensuring Quality in the Unemployment Insurance Program (EQUIP) Act\" mandates substance abuse risk assessments for applicants before receiving benefits. The \"EQUIP Act\" requires substance abuse risk assessments for applicants before receiving benefits. If a high-risk applicant tests positive for controlled substances, no compensation is paid for 30 days and for the remainder of the benefit year unless they test negative at the end of the period. High-risk applicants must undergo controlled substance testing during the benefit year with limited notice. If a high-risk applicant tests positive, they are responsible for the cost of the test and no compensation will be paid for the remainder of the benefit year. High-risk applicants are subject to controlled substance testing during the benefit year, with the individual responsible for the cost of the test if they test positive. The term 'controlled substance' is defined by the State and excludes substances used under a valid prescription or authorized by law. The text discusses substance abuse risk assessment and funding for substance abuse testing under the Social Security Act. It clarifies the definition of a substance abuse risk assessment and exempts merit staffing requirements for the implementation of certain sections of the Act. Funding for substance abuse testing is also addressed, including amendments to the funding source. The text amends funding provisions for substance abuse testing under the Social Security Act, specifying the use of funds for section 303(l) and removing certain paragraphs related to funding sources. The amendment made by subsection (a) of the Act will take effect 180 days after enactment, with a provision for delay if state legislation is pending. The Secretary of Labor cannot withhold certification for payment to a state solely for not implementing the requirements of section 303(l) of the Social Security Act before the specified date."
