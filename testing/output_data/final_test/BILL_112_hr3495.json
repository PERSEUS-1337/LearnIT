The \"Market Based Manufacturing Incentives Act of 2011\" introduces a new section allowing a tax credit for purchases of specified products during an eligible period. The credit amount is based on a percentage determined by the Commission, ranging from 5% to 20%, and the eligible period is determined to be between 5 to 10 years. The \"Market Based Manufacturing Incentives Act of 2011\" offers a tax credit for specified products acquired for use or lease, not for resale. Each specified product designated under the Act is considered separately. The term \"specified product\" refers to a domestic product with original use starting with the taxpayer, while \"designated domestic product\" is certified as assembled in the United States. The \"Market Based Manufacturing Incentives Act of 2011\" provides a tax credit for products assembled in the United States with at least 60 percent of components originating in the US. The term \"designated product\" refers to 10 products designated by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission. The credit allowed for property used in a trade or business is treated as part of the general business credit. The \"Market Based Manufacturing Incentives Act of 2011\" offers a tax credit for designated products that promote technological innovation and create long-term job opportunities in the US. The Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, designates 10 products eligible for this credit. The Secretary considers job creation and speed of job creation when designating products for tax credits under the \"Market Based Manufacturing Incentives Act of 2011\". The credit percentage for designated products ranges from 5% to 20%. The Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, determines the eligible period for tax credits for designated products, which ranges from 5 to 10 years based on market factors. The term 'Commission' refers to the 21st. The Commission, established under the Market Based Manufacturing Incentives Act of 2011, defines the term 'Commission'. The basis of property for which a credit is allowed will be reduced by the amount of the credit. Any deduction or credit allowable with respect to property will be reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. The taxpayer who sold property described in section 50(b)(3) or (4) to the user shall be treated as placing the property in service if they disclose the credit amount. Property used outside the United States is not eligible for the credit. The Secretary can recapture credits for property no longer eligible, and taxpayers can elect not to take the credit for certain vehicles. The section does not apply to property acquired after 10 years from enactment. Conforming amendments are made to Section 38(b) of the Code. The text chunk introduces amendments to various sections of the tax code related to domestic manufacturing consumer credit and recapturing credits for ineligible property. Amendments include adding new paragraphs and inserting references to specific sections. The Government Accountability Office will report to Congress on the economic effects of the domestic manufacturing consumer credit every 3rd, 5th, and 7th year after its effective date. The credit applies to property acquired after recommendations are made by the 21st Century American Manufacturing Commission to the Secretary of the Treasury. The 21st Century American Manufacturing Commission is established to research and recommend products eligible for a tax credit. It consists of 10 members appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Recommendations must be made within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The 21st Century American Manufacturing Commission consists of 10 members appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Members serve for life and receive pay equivalent to grade GS-11 of the General Schedule for their duties. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Secretary of the Treasury appoints members to the Commission who must sign an agreement to prevent conflicts of interest and comply with specified requirements and penalties. Members of the Commission appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury must not have any financial interests in designated products, components, or equipment for manufacturing for a 5-year period after the effective date of the domestic manufacturing consumer credit. Any existing interests must be divested unless held in a broad-based index fund. The Chairperson of the Commission is designated by the Secretary of the Treasury at the time of appointment. Commission staff are appointed according to US Code provisions and paid based on classification and pay rate regulations. The Commission terminates 30 days after making recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury, unless an extension is requested. The Commission will continue to exist for a period specified by the Secretary of the Treasury, not exceeding 1 year after making recommendations."
