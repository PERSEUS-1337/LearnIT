    "content": "Point clouds are a common way to represent 3D objects with varying resolution. Previous research has shown that adapting encoder networks to match the semantics of input point clouds can improve their effectiveness. This study explores decoder architectures that better align with the semantics of variable-sized point clouds by using sample-based methods. Three sample-based decoder architectures are developed and compared for their performance, showing improved effectiveness over feedforward architectures. The study explores decoder architectures for variable-sized point clouds, showing improved effectiveness over feedforward architectures. The key distinction of point clouds is their invariant information content to the ordering of points, making spatial relationships not explicitly captured. The work is available as an extensible software platform for future research. Standard convolutional architectures are not directly applicable to point clouds due to their indexing structure. Voxelization is a common approach to process point clouds with deep networks, but it may not be suitable for all use cases due to the unknown required resolution leading to large tensors. Developing architectures that support processing point cloud data directly is motivated by the limitations of voxelization, which can lead to large tensors beyond practical constraints. One approach is to 'flatten' the point cloud into a list for processing by standard convolutional or fully-connected architectures. However, this method has drawbacks such as the lack of meaningful information in the indexing order and the need for networks to generalize in an invariant way. Additionally, varying numbers of points in point clouds can pose challenges for some applications. PointNet and DeepSets architectures are designed to process point clouds with varying numbers of points efficiently. They use a shared MLP to transform each point into a high-dimensional representation, allowing for scalability to any number of input points. This approach has shown significant advantages in applications like shape classification. The success of PointNet and DeepSet architectures in processing point clouds has shown that designing a network architecture to match the semantics of a point cloud results in a more efficient and better performing network. Designing networks to decode point clouds from a shape representation can lead to the creation of point cloud auto-encoders for applications like anomaly detection and noise smoothing. The current approach to designing a differentiable point cloud decoder involves feeding the dense representation of the object through a feedforward MLP and reshaping the result for the desired point cloud size. The paper introduces the 'NoiseLearn' algorithm, a novel point cloud decoding approach inspired by PointNet's principles. It emphasizes the importance of designing decoders that match the semantics of point clouds for better performance. The simplicity of the decoding architectures and improved performance suggest that sample-based decoders should be considered as a default in future studies and systems. Point cloud decoders are a relatively unexplored area of research, focusing on learning a useful latent shape representation passed to a MLP decoder. PU-Net is an example of a novel point cloud upsampling network using a hierarchical approach to aggregating and expanding point features. The network decodes the learned shape representation into a point cloud by passing the latent vector through a feedforward MLP to produce a fixed number of points. Retraining the network for a different upsampling rate may not be a desired property of an upsampling algorithm. TopNet (Tchapmi et al., 2019) and Valsesia et al. (2019) propose efficient ways to decode point clouds using hierarchical structures and graph convolutions, respectively. However, issues like fixed-size output remain unaddressed. Point Cloud GAN and PointFlow (Yang et al., 2019) offer alternative methods for generating point sets in a generative setting. The sampling-based approach in generating point sets offers advantages such as drawing points from Gaussian noise to create point clouds without retraining. This method decodes individual points independently, avoiding data inefficiency problems with MLPs. However, its applicability beyond GAN settings is uncertain. The algorithm's applicability outside of GAN settings is uncertain, as it is unclear if bespoke loss functions are needed for effective training. Point cloud auto-encoders aim to represent shapes without auxiliary information, with the encoder-decoder architecture handling up-scaling or downscaling of point clouds. Point cloud auto-encoders consist of an encoder E(C) and a decoder D(h) to represent shapes without auxiliary information. The focus is on the Chamfer distance as a measure of auto-encoder quality, which compares the input point cloud C with the output point cloud \u0108. The architectures use a common PointNet-style encoder and vary in the decoder architecture. The PointNet-style encoder is used for point cloud auto-encoders, with a focus on Chamfer distance for quality comparison. The encoder learns a transformation function f to map points to a latent representation, invariant to point order, using max as the reduction function. The PointNet-style encoder uses max as the reduction function to map point features to a fixed-size latent shape representation. The encoder architecture includes hidden layers and the size of the latent shape representation, with a focus on sample-based decoders for producing an arbitrary number of output points. The decoder in the PointNet-style architecture transforms high-dimensional point representations into points in space on the surface of the target object by sampling point features from a distribution. This process involves transforming each sampled point feature into a triple representing its location, using a similar encoding mechanism as the encoder but with different input and output tensor sizes. The decoder network in the PointNet-style architecture transforms high-dimensional point representations into points on the surface of the target object by sampling point features from a distribution. The hidden layer sizes of the decoder network are shown in Table 1. Three architectures for decoding point clouds are compared, including the NoiseAppend Decoder which appends noise sampled from a Gaussian distribution to the latent shape vector. The size of the noise vector appended should be much smaller than the latent shape representation. The NoiseAdd and NoiseLearn Decoders aim to address the issue of introducing noise to the latent shape representation in the decoder network of the PointNet-style architecture. NoiseAdd adds unit Gaussian noise to the latent shape vector, while NoiseLearn attempts to learn the amount of noise needed instead of uniformly adding noise to every element of the latent vector. These approaches aim to avoid introducing excessive noise that may obscure crucial information in the latent shape representation. The NoiseLearn Decoder aims to predict the log-variance of the desired point feature distribution by learning a small separate function V (h). It allows the network to choose the amount and location of noise to be added to the latent shape vector, ensuring accurate reconstruction without introducing additional hyperparameters. The decoding architecture was evaluated on a point cloud auto-encoding problem using the ModelNet40 dataset. The ModelNet40 dataset contains 12,000 3D models of 40 object classes, with 9800 models in the training set and 2500 in the test set. 10% of the training data is used for validation. Each object model is converted to a point cloud with 4096 points within a unit sphere before training. The point clouds are downsampled to 1024 points during training to reduce computational cost and improve generalization. The Chamfer distance is used as the loss function for comparing point clouds of different sizes. The network architectures are trained for 100 epochs using the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate schedule. Different instantiations of the architectures were tested with varying numbers of parameters, and the training process was repeated 15 times for each instantiation. Code for replicating the experiments will be made available for review. The validation loss of different network architectures was compared after 100 epochs of training. The MLP showed unstable training runs, while the sample-based architectures were stable and showed rapid progress early on. Despite stability issues, the MLP performed similarly to the worst sample-based architecture by the end of the learning curve. After comparing the performance of different network architectures, it was found that NoiseLearn outperformed NoiseAppend and NoiseAdd. NoiseAdd's uniform noise addition may obscure critical information, while NoiseAppend separates noise from the shape representation. NoiseLearn intelligently selects noise levels, avoiding information obscuring and achieving accurate reconstruction. The average test set performance of the architectures after 100 epochs is shown in Figure 4, with more detailed results in the appendix. The appendix displays detailed results for the four architectures, showing consistent improvement in performance for sample-based architectures as sizes grow. However, the MLP architecture shows initial improvement but then a significant decrease in performance past 100K parameters. Further analysis reveals that larger MLPs struggle with optimization, indicating inefficiency in exploiting larger network sizes compared to sample-based architectures. The structured sample-based architectures outperform large MLP networks without the need for tweaking. Results show better encoding bias for decoding shapes in ModelNet40 and more stable learning as architectures grow. Noise parameters and auto-encoding results demonstrate the effectiveness of sample-based architectures. The NoiseLearn architecture performs best across all network sizes and epochs, showing better spatial distribution by MLP network and finer detail capture by sampling-based approaches. No single approach dominates in visual quality, with all sample-based architectures missing similar object details. The NoiseLearn architecture outperforms other approaches in spatial distribution and detail capture. Different sampling architectures use noise to index locations on the latent shape manifold for generating points. The primary difference lies in how they utilize noise for spatial indexing and traversing the manifolds. The NoiseLearn architecture outperforms other approaches in spatial distribution and detail capture by predicting individual variances for each element in the dense shape encoding. It selects the five elements of noise with the highest variance to influence the decoder's output, demonstrating how the network learns to exploit individual elements of noise and combine them to produce a point cloud that spans the entire shape. The NoiseLearn architecture selects the five elements of noise with the highest variance to influence the decoded point cloud shape. It uses only four significant noise elements, showing that three or four elements are sufficient for good coverage. Modifying the NoiseAppend architecture to append fewer noise elements results in the network learning a single path to span the target shape. The NoiseLearn architecture selects five noise elements with high variance to influence the decoded shape. With two noise elements, the network learns individual 'loops' around the object. Adding too much noise does not impact performance but increases parameter count. In this study, various sample-based point cloud decoder architectures were evaluated and compared. These approaches were found to be competitive with or better than the MLP approach, using fewer parameters and offering improved functionality. The results suggest that sample-based point cloud decoders should be the preferred method for producing independent point samples of underlying functions or objects. Additionally, an open-source implementation of the tools used in the research is provided to further this area of study. The tables display the average loss of each architecture on individual classes in the ModelNet40 dataset, with the best-performing network highlighted for each object class."
