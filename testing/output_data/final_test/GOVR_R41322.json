    "content": "Congress is exploring alternatives to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and considering covered bonds as a potential option. Covered bonds allow financial institutions to raise funds by offering collateral to investors, backed by the bank's promise to repay and assets pledged as collateral. This funding mechanism is being compared to securitization, with various economic advantages and disadvantages being analyzed. Recent legislative proposals are also being discussed in relation to covered bonds. Covered bonds are a form of debt where financial institutions use mortgages or other assets as collateral to issue bonds to investors. The European Covered Bond Council has defined essential features of covered bonds, including full recourse to a credit institution and statutory protections in some countries. Covered bonds are issued by credit institutions with full recourse to them, backed by a cover pool of financial assets. The institution must maintain sufficient assets in the cover pool, supervised by independent bodies. In the U.S., there is no independent cover pool supervisor, making U.S. covered bonds different from those in other countries. Covered bonds offer dual-recourse for investors, allowing recourse against both the financial institution and the asset pool. In contrast, unsecured bonds have no collateral, while ABS or MBS bonds are backed by independent collateral pools. Variations in structures exist, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guaranteeing credit risk for MBS. The FDIC has the power to limit the market for covered bonds by regulating the collateral and funding limits for insured depositories. Covered bonds are defined as non-deposit, recourse debt obligations of Insured Depository Institutions with terms between one and thirty years. Covered bonds are non-deposit, recourse debt obligations of Insured Depository Institutions with terms between one and thirty years, secured by eligible mortgages or AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities. Covered bonds typically tie up more capital than securitizations as they remain on the balance sheet of sponsoring institutions. Covered bonds tie up more capital than securitizations and issuers have a long-term stake in the assets. Covered bonds may be less prone to investor loss of confidence compared to securitization. Policymakers are considering alternative funding sources for mortgage finance post-2008. Covered bonds have advantages but also come with less advantageous capital requirements and potential costs to the FDIC's deposit insurance fund. The foreclosure crisis has raised concerns about securitization's long-term incentives. Lenders selling loans in the secondary market without retaining risk may lead to eroding underwriting standards. Mandating issuers to retain some risk could prevent this, but it may also result in the creation of complex financial instruments. Regulators must ensure a balance between issuers and securities holders in dividing risk. Advocates of covered bonds argue that issuers maintaining a long-term stake in loan performance ensures quality underwriting standards. Covered bonds require 100% issuer commitment, preventing hedging that could undermine retained risk regulations. The distinction between statutory and contractual covered bonds allows for further refinement in risk management. In practice, financial regulatory agencies and Congress could limit collateral eligible for covered bonds. A statutory framework may restrict eligible collateral to loans with quality underwriting, as seen in related FDIC guidance. The complexity of asset securitization has contributed to market turmoil, with uncertainties for investors evaluating firms and securities. Investors evaluating securities may find it challenging to estimate their value due to the complexities of MBS construction. Lack of transparency in securitized mortgages may have worsened investor confidence. Covered bonds are argued to have a more transparent financial structure, with issuers not selling assets, leading to more accurate risk reflection on balance sheets. Covered bond transactions are less likely to issue multiple classes of complex securities from the same loan pool, reducing surprises for investors. Regulatory agencies and Congress can promote transparency in securitization by creating a statutory framework. Securitization in the 1990s shifted default risk out of the banking system, allowing for more lending with less capital. Policymakers considering a shift to covered bonds must weigh the pros and cons of higher capital requirements and lower lending volume. Covered bonds, like securitization, enable lenders to issue securities backed by assets. Covered bonds, similar to securitization, allow lenders to access investors in the secondary market without adding capital to the balance sheet. However, investors in covered bonds have recourse against the issuer, leading to higher risk and the need for more risk-based capital. This shift could result in either more capital held in the banking system, less lending, or a combination of both. Policymakers may adjust the capital treatment of securitized assets and covered bonds. Financial regulatory agencies have changed the accounting treatment of securitized assets, potentially reducing the advantage of securitization. FDIC guidance on FAS 166 and 167 may lead to securitizers holding more capital. This could decrease the capital disadvantage of covered bonds in the future. Banks face a maturity mismatch with short-term liabilities and long-term assets, which exposes them to potential problems. The bank structure's maturity mismatch exposes it to risks from interest rate fluctuations. Securitization allows banks to sell long-term assets to better manage mortgage maturity. Covered bonds offer a way to fund long-term assets without removing them from the balance sheet, reducing maturity risks. Covered bonds help banks match long-term assets with long-term liabilities, reducing maturity mismatch compared to portfolio lending. However, there is still some maturity mismatch due to uncertain loan lengths like mortgages. Increased reliance on covered bonds over securitization may raise maturity-mismatch risks if loan maturity cannot be forecasted accurately. This could lead to higher use of financial derivatives, posing transparency and risk issues. The FDIC resolves failing banks with insured deposits. The FDIC resolves failing banks with insured deposits, aiming to minimize losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Covered bonds are used to protect bondholder interests in case of issuer failure, but clarity on FDIC policies for covered bonds is needed. Policymakers can protect the DIF in various ways, including addressing the impact of an increase in covered bonds. Policymakers can protect the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) by limiting covered bond issuance or implementing additional directives for investor protection. This could result in lower revenues for banks issuing covered bonds and decreased recovery rates for investors in case of bank failure. Alternatively, legislation could prioritize covered bonds over the DIF, directing the FDIC to respect covered bond security interests. Covered bonds could potentially lead to higher revenues for banks and increased recovery rates for investors in case of bank failure. If policymakers prioritize covered bonds over the DIF, taxpayers may face greater losses if the DIF runs out and the FDIC taps its line of credit with the Treasury. Covered bonds share similarities with the Federal Home Loan Bank system in terms of dual recourse and priority repayment in case of member institution failure. The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) has a superlien repayment priority in case of member institution failure, allowing them to draw on the entire balance sheet. Members must pledge mortgages as collateral for advances, creating a constraint on the volume of advances. FHLB advances can fund non-mortgage activities as long as they don't exceed the institution's mortgage holdings, similar to covered bonds. Both FHLB advances and covered bonds improve creditor priority in repayment if the firm fails. Both covered bonds and FHLB advances improve creditor priority in repayment if the firm fails. Covered bonds provide recourse to specific assets, while FHLB advances allow the mortgage originator to keep the funded mortgage on its balance sheet. There are differences in capital requirements between the two, with FHLB advances being callable in many cases. The Treasury Department and the FDIC considered covered bonds as an alternative to mortgage securitization during the mortgage market turmoil in 2007 and 2008. The Treasury Department and the FDIC considered covered bonds as an alternative to mortgage securitization during the mortgage market turmoil in 2007 and 2008. They believed covered bonds could provide a more stable source of funding compared to securitization, especially after the collapse of American private-label mortgage securitizations. Treasury officials suggested increasing the use of covered bonds to restore confidence in mortgage finance in March 2008. Covered bonds allow banks to retain mortgage loans while accessing financial market funding. Covered bonds offer banks the ability to retain mortgage loans while accessing financial market funding, providing an alternative to mortgage securitization. Rule-making, not legislation, is needed to facilitate covered bond issuance and address the lack of liquidity in the market. The Treasury Department issued a Best Practices for Residential Covered Bonds document in 2008 to provide clarity and encourage the development of a covered bond market in the U.S. The Treasury Department issued a Best Practices for Residential Covered Bonds document in 2008, outlining standards for covered bond programs to follow, including issuer requirements, maturity limits, overcollateralization values, and issuer liability limits. The FDIC issued Financial Institution Letters in 2008 regarding covered bonds, defining them as nondeposit debt obligations of insured depository institutions secured by assets consisting of eligible mortgages. FDIC rules for resolving claims against insolvent banks with outstanding covered bonds may need to be modified to adapt covered bonds to the U.S. system. The FDIC issued Financial Institution Letters in 2008 defining covered bonds as nondeposit debt obligations secured by eligible mortgages. Eligible mortgages conform to agency guidance on subprime and nontraditional mortgages. FDIC rules for resolving claims against insolvent banks with covered bonds may need modification to adapt to the U.S. system. FDIC's intended policy in case of an insured depository failure requires consent for collateral liquidation during conservatorship or receivership. Issuers of covered bonds may face additional costs for maintaining liquidity if FDIC fails to make payments or provide access to collateral. The FDIC announced rule changes to extend the maturity of guarantee for some assets under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. This was seen as a move to accommodate covered bonds with longer maturities. However, the implementation of this initiative was delayed by FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair. In contrast to the US, the EU covered bond market has been a traditional feature of Europe's capital markets. The EU covered bond market is a traditional feature of Europe's capital markets, with approximately 2.38 trillion euros in outstanding EU covered bonds as of the end of 2008. Covered bonds in the EU market can be categorized into regulated and structured types, with regulated bonds governed by specific legislation such as European directives and national laws. Regulated covered bonds are subject to privileged financial market regulation, unlike structured bonds which operate outside dedicated laws. Key laws outlining minimum requirements for regulated covered bonds include Article 22(4) of the 1988 UCITS Directive and the Capital Requirements Directive. The European Central Bank (ECB) has focused on covered bonds due to global financial market instability. A study by the ECB's Banking Supervision Committee (BSC) found that EU covered bonds were resilient during the financial crisis, but were affected in September 2008. To support European capital markets, the ECB initiated a one-year purchase program of around EUR 60 billion in covered bonds. The European covered bond market has performed better than the American private label-mortgage securitization market. The European covered bond market has fared better than the American private label-mortgage securitization market. The average spread between covered bond yield and euro interest rate swap rate remained stable after December 2009. However, the debt crisis in some European countries widened spreads of covered bonds. European banks used funding facilities to raise funds, resulting in a 40% decrease in covered bond issuance in 2012 compared to 2011. Representative Garrett introduced H.R. 940 in March 2011. H.R. 940, introduced by Representative Garrett in March 2011, aimed to establish a statutory framework for covered bonds in the United States. The bill proposed that the Department of Treasury would oversee covered bonds, with federal banking regulators or the Treasury acting as regulators. It also sought to clarify the treatment of covered bonds in the event of bank failures. Key sections of the bill included defining eligible assets backing covered bonds and considering whether other types of loans should be eligible assets. Under H.R. 940, a statutory framework for covered bonds in the U.S. would allow non-mortgage asset classes like residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans, and small business loans. The Secretary of Treasury could designate additional eligible assets. Covered bond issuers would include insured depositories, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies. Under H.R. 940, covered bond programs in the U.S. would encompass various asset classes beyond mortgages. The regulatory oversight would involve federal banking regulators for insured depositories and banks, while the Secretary of Treasury would oversee entities without a federal banking regulator. Eligible issuers could sponsor entities solely for issuing covered bonds on a pooled basis. H.R. 940 would have created a statutory framework for covered bonds in the United States, defining covered bonds as recourse debt obligations secured by a cover pool owned by the issuer, approved by a covered bond regulator, and not classified as a deposit. Eligible issuers could sponsor entities solely for issuing covered bonds on a pooled basis. The proposed legislation, H.R. 940, aimed to establish a covered bond oversight program overseen by the Secretary of Treasury and federal banking regulators. Eligible issuers would need approval for each covered bond program they create, based on standards set by the Secretary. A national registry for covered bonds would also be created under the legislation. H.R. 940 proposed a national registry for covered bonds, with the Treasury maintaining a website containing information on issuers, programs, regulators, bond holders, asset monitors, and trustees. Issuers would be assessed fees to cover regulation costs, set by regulators. Overcollateralization requirements for covered bonds were also outlined. The bill H.R. 940 proposed standards for overcollateralization in covered bonds, including asset-coverage tests and reporting requirements. It also set minimum standards for eligible cover assets and outlined procedures for addressing failures to meet the asset-coverage test. H.R. 940 proposed procedures for defaulting or failing issuers of covered bonds, creating separate estates for each bond program to cover bondholder claims in case of issuer bankruptcy or receivership. The estate would be liable only for the covered bonds, not other obligations of the issuer. If assets in the estate do not fully cover the bond, bondholders would retain their claims against the issuer. If an issuer of covered bonds is placed in receivership or conservatorship before defaulting, the FDIC must transfer the covered bond obligations and asset-cover pools to another eligible issuer within 180 days."
