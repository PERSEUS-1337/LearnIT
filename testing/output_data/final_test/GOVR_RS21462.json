    "content": "Russian interests in Iraq have historical roots dating back to the 1960s, with Moscow maintaining friendly relations with Baghdad. The USSR was a major arms supplier to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War, leading to a significant debt owed by Baghdad to Moscow. Economic factors, along with strategic interests and historic ties, have influenced Russia's policy towards Iraq. This includes support in U.N. debates to facilitate debt repayment, as Russia faced a shortage of hard currency. Russian interests in Iraq date back to the 1960s, with Moscow having historical ties to Baghdad. The USSR supplied arms to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War, resulting in a significant debt owed by Baghdad to Moscow. Economic factors, strategic interests, and historic ties have influenced Russia's policy towards Iraq, including support for debt repayment due to a shortage of hard currency. Russian oil companies have contracts worth billions to develop Iraqi oil fields and modernize Iraq's economic infrastructure, with fears of a post-Saddam Iraq affecting Russian oil profits. Leaders in Russia are concerned about a potential drop in oil prices due to a post-Saddam Iraq, which could impact the country's economic growth and government revenues. This fear is also driven by a desire to counter U.S. global dominance and promote a multi-polar world where Russia plays a significant role. Russia, led by Putin, aims to counter U.S. global dominance and promote a multi-polar world. Putin seeks to limit U.S. power by cooperating with traditional allies like France and Germany, as well as partners like China. This strategic decision was made in 2001 to reorient Russian foreign and defense policy towards broad cooperation. Putin shifted Russian national security policy towards integration and cooperation with the West and the United States in 2001. Despite opposing U.S. military action in Iraq, Russia aimed to prevent damage to broader bilateral relations. Deputy Foreign Minister Georgi Mamedov stated that Russia would cooperate with the United States for a quick resolution of any conflict, aiming to minimize negative effects and return to diplomatic solutions. By mid-2002, Russia hinted at not strongly opposing U.S. military action in Iraq as long as it was not unilateral and respected Russian economic interests. Discussions on this were reported in the press, and Iraq's $40 billion agreement with Russian firms in August 2002 may have been a move to secure Russian political support. In December 2002, Iraqi authorities cancelled a $3.7 billion contract with Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, to develop the West Qurna oil field, seen as retaliation against Lukoil for discussing its future role in post-Saddam Iraq with U.S. officials. Russia aimed to balance its interests with France, Germany, and China while avoiding conflict with the U.S. during negotiations leading to the approval of Resolution 1441 by the UN Security Council in November 2002. Many believed Putin would make a deal with the US regarding Russian economic interests in Iraq in exchange for not using its UNSC veto. Putin's chief of staff visited Washington in February 2003 to discuss economic deals in return for Russia's support. Based on reports and discussions with U.S. and Russian officials, the U.S. response to Russia's economic interests in Iraq is that they will be considered, but not given special treatment over other countries. U.S. officials suggested an informal agreement to respect Russian economic interests in Iraq, but emphasized that the U.S. does not control oil prices or guarantee specific levels. The U.S. and Russia discussed Russian economic interests in Iraq, but no concrete guarantees were made. The U.S. designated Chechen groups as terrorist organizations and introduced a bill to exempt Russia from certain provisions. The Bush Administration used both incentives and threats in their approach. Russian veto of the U.S.-backed Security Council resolution on Iraq could damage bilateral relations, affecting cooperation on security, energy, antiterrorism, antimissile defenses, and the space program. In February 2003, Russian opposition to U.S. military action against Iraq hardened, with Putin rejecting regime change as a legitimate goal in Iraq. The United Nations' only legitimate goal in the Iraq situation is disarmament. Russia opposed the U.S.-backed resolution for war and Putin criticized the military operations in Iraq as a mistake. Russian public opinion was against U.S. aggression, leading to anti-war rallies and anti-American sentiments. Kremlin's strong influence over the media in Russia shaped the negative attitude towards coalition military action. Russia's shift towards a more hard-line stance against the United States over Iraq is raising questions about Putin's alignment with France and Germany. Putin's stance is influenced by Russia's interest in promoting a \"multi-polar world\" and strengthening the authority of the U.N. vis-a-vis the U.S. Most of Russia's political elites and national security establishment are hostile towards American warmongering. Putin may feel pressured to consider the opinions of his generals, diplomats, political establishment, and voters regarding the U.S. war in Iraq. Many Russians, including military spokesmen, are concerned about America's superior military capabilities and fear for Russian economic interests in Iraq due to a lack of firm assurances from the Bush Administration. Russian concerns about U.S. policy in Iraq are growing, with Putin facing pressure from various sectors in Russia. Despite differences, Putin and Bush agreed to increase bilateral cooperation on other issues. Putin criticized the U.S. attack as a \"political blunder\" but emphasized the importance of minimizing damage to bilateral relations. U.S.-Russian tension over Iraq remains a key issue. Russian Duma postponed action on the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty due to Iraq conflict, but legislative leaders close to Putin criticized this as against Russian interests. Vershbow, speaking on Russian TV, predicted Russian approval of the treaty soon, stating that U.S.-Russian tension over Iraq would pass."
