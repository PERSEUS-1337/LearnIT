    "content": "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service (FS) manage a total of 449 million acres of federal land in the U.S., with BLM overseeing 255.8 million acres and FS administering 192.8 million acres. Both agencies have similar management responsibilities and face common issues. There have been proposals to merge the two agencies due to their overlapping functions. The lands are to be managed for multiple uses, including recreation, range, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife, and conservation, with a focus on sustained yield. The BLM and FS manage federal lands for sustained yield without impairing productivity. BLM focuses on rangelands and mineral development, while FS manages federal forests and assists nonfederal forest landowners. Both agencies have unique functions and historical differences, but share common issues like land disposal, range management, and minerals development. The General Land Office and U.S. Grazing Service were established to manage public lands. Congress debated federal land management, leading to the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, which consolidated BLM's responsibilities and emphasized multiple use and sustained yield principles. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages public lands based on multiple use and sustained yield principles, ensuring fair market value for resources. BLM oversees various activities like energy development, grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. The Forest Service (FS) was established in 1905 to manage forest lands for timber, grazing, recreation, and wildlife, promoting harmonious management practices. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 addresses issues related to timber harvesting and land management plans. Wilderness protection is also a key concern for the Forest Service, with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act authorizing wilderness use on national forest lands. Pressures persist to protect the wilderness character of national forests. This report focuses on issues affecting the lands of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (FS) that are of interest to the 110th Congress, including onshore energy resources, hardrock mining, wilderness, wild horses and burros, wildfire protection, and Forest Service implementation of NEPA. It does not cover general issues affecting federal land management. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL32393. A BLM-coordinated study found that a significant portion of oil and natural gas on federal lands is classified as \"inaccessible\" for drilling. The oil and gas industry argues that access to these areas is crucial for future domestic energy supply, while opponents suggest focusing on conservation and increased exploration on current leases. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 governs oil, gas, and coal development on federal lands, with a multi-step approval process on BLM lands. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made significant changes to energy development laws on BLM and FS lands, with the Administration responding to EPAct provisions. A BLM report analyzed rights and responsibilities of mineral lease owners, private surface owners, and the federal government, recommending administrative actions for access. The BLM issued a final rule in March 2006 allowing ownership of oil and gas leases covering greater acreages. A final programmatic EIS for wind energy facilities on BLM lands was completed in January 2006, supporting land management plan amendments for wind energy development in western states. The BLM has also completed environmental assessments and issued leases for oil shale research and development under EPAct. The BLM has completed environmental assessments and issued leases for oil shale research, development, and demonstration projects on federal lands in Colorado and Utah. A report highlights the progress of the pilot project, and a programmatic environmental impact statement is underway to support a commercial tar sands and oil shale leasing program. Final regulations for commercial oil shale development are required within six months of issuing the final PEIS, with funding restrictions in place for FY2008 but omitted in the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009 (CR, Division A, P.L. 110-329) provides appropriations to DOI agencies through March 6, 2009. The Interior Department aims to finalize a commercial oil shale and tar sands leasing program by the end of 2008. The BLM has completed its final environmental impact statement and issued a rule for geothermal energy development on federal lands. EPAct amended the Geothermal Steam Act to improve leasing procedures and increase geothermal energy production potential on federal lands. The federal geothermal leasing process could boost geothermal energy production. The BLM oversees 423 geothermal leases, with 55 currently in production. Legislation was introduced in the 110th Congress to address concerns with the implementation of EPAct, which was later incorporated into the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Several bills aimed to end the spending prohibition on issuing final regulations for oil and gas development on federal lands. The General Mining Law of 1872 grants free access to individuals and corporations to prospect for minerals on federal lands. There is ongoing debate on whether this law should be reformed to balance mineral development with competing land uses. Critics view the claim-patent system as a giveaway of publicly owned resources. Critics argue that the claim-patent system under the Mining Law of 1872 is seen as a giveaway of publicly owned resources due to lack of royalty payments and low fees for maintaining claims and obtaining patents. Congress has halted mining claim patents since FY1995, but the right to stake claims and extract minerals remains. Approximately 165 million acres of federally owned mineral rights have been withdrawn from mineral entry, while mineral development on another 182 million acres is subject to surface management agency approval. The absence of direct statutory authority for environmental protection has led to reform proposals. Protection under the Mining Law of 1872 is a major issue that has led to reform proposals. Critics argue that current environmental laws are not sufficient for reclamation of mined areas and advocate for withdrawing lands from development under the Mining Law. They also highlight the lack of regulatory authority over patented mining claims and the need for clear legal authority for reclamation. In 2005, new surface management regulations were implemented, along with increased mining claim fees. Fees increased in 2005 to $30 and $125 per claim. Legislation introduced in 2007 aimed to reform the General Mining Law of 1872, including establishing royalties on mineral production and creating a mine reclamation fund. Hearings and committee reports followed, with the bill passing the House in November 2007. The House passed a bill in November 2007, with no further action taken. Senate hearings on mining law reform were held in the 110th Congress, addressing hardrock mining on federal land and reform of the General Mining Law of 1872. A Senate bill aimed at cleaning up abandoned hardrock mines by establishing a cleanup fund and imposing fees on mining operations was also introduced. The BLM established the National Landscape Conservation System in 2000 to manage and protect specially designated conservation areas. It covers 27 million acres of land with various federally recognized units, including national monuments, conservation areas, wilderness areas, and historic trails. The system aims to conserve and restore landscapes with significant archaeological, geological, cultural, and ecological values. The National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) was established by the BLM in 2000 to manage and protect conservation areas covering 27 million acres. Current issues for Congress include establishing the system legislatively and funding adequacy. Legislation has been introduced to establish the NLCS without altering current management practices, aiming to conserve significant landscapes for future generations. The Senate has indefinitely postponed S. 2180, while three other bills are on the Senate calendar. The Administration testified in favor of establishing the National Landscape Conservation System legislatively, aiming to formalize and strengthen its conservation system within the agency's multiple-use mission. The House passed H.R. 2016 with amendments clarifying the management of its units. The House passed H.R. 2016 with amendments clarifying the management of its units, including provisions to protect existing grazing rights, energy development, hunting, fishing, trapping, and recreational shooting access. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported S. 1139 with an amendment seeking to clarify the description of the components of the system. The Senate Committee reported S. 1139 with an amendment to clarify the components of the system without substantive changes. The bill was placed on the Senate calendar along with other similar provisions for the NLCS. P.L. 110-229 established two Outstanding Natural Areas within the NLCS. Other House and Senate bills also propose federal land designations and additions to the NLCS. Funding adequacy for the NLCS is a concern. Questions have been raised about the funding adequacy for the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS), particularly regarding management and law enforcement to address vandalism and damage to cultural resources. The Administration proposed a $4.4 million decrease in funding for the NLCS in FY2009, with the total requested at $49.9 million. Designations for the NLCS are controversial as only Congress can designate federal lands for the system. The controversy surrounding wilderness designations includes restrictions on commercial activities, motorized access, and development in wilderness areas. The Clinton rule protecting national forest roadless areas was seen as a response to Congress's slow designation of wilderness areas, while the Bush Administration's actions aimed to open areas with wilderness attributes to development, making them ineligible for wilderness designation. The Wilderness Act directed agencies to review potential wilderness areas on national forest, National Park System, and National Wildlife Refuge System lands. For BLM lands, FLPMA required the agency to review potential wilderness and not impair the wilderness character of wilderness study areas until Congress decides otherwise. In 1996, then-DOI Secretary Bruce Babbitt used BLM authority to inventory lands and resources for wilderness potential. In 1996, then-DOI Secretary Bruce Babbitt used BLM authority to inventory lands and resources for wilderness potential. The State of Utah challenged the inventory as violating the review required by \u00a7 603, leading to new wilderness guidance being issued by the DOI in September 2003. This guidance prohibited further reviews and limited the nonimpairment standard to previously designated \u00a7 603 WSAs. As of October 2008, multiple bills have been introduced in Congress to designate new wilderness areas or expand existing ones in various states. The Senate committee has reported 12 bills and held hearings on numerous bills, including ones with provisions to release specific BLM WSAs. A bill has been introduced to amend the Wilderness Act, allowing qualified recreation organizations to cross wilderness areas on established trails with restrictions. The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 aims to protect wild horses and burros on federal land, placing them under the jurisdiction of the BLM and FS. Controversies surrounding their management include determining appropriate herd sizes, removal methods, fertility control, funding adequacy, and more. The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 aims to protect wild horses and burros on federal land. Controversial changes enacted by the 108th Congress allowed for the sale of excess animals deemed too old or unable to be adopted, with proceeds used for the adoption program. Criminal penalties for processing wild horse or burro remains into commercial products were also removed. The 108th Congress made controversial changes to the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, allowing for the sale of excess animals and removing penalties for processing their remains into commercial products. These changes aim to help agencies achieve appropriate management levels, improve animal health, protect range resources, and restore ecological balance on federal lands. However, critics fear that this could lead to the slaughter of healthy animals. As of October 14, 2008, the BLM had sold nearly 2,900 animals out of an estimated 33,000 wild horses and burros on BLM lands. National maximum appropriate management levels are set at 27,512, with additional animals on FS lands and in BLM facilities. The BLM has been working towards achieving Appropriate Management Levels (AMLs) for wild horses and burros, with plans to remove 5,200 animals in FY2008 and 3,300 in FY2009. Despite declining adoptions, they continue to outpace sales, with little demand for older animals. The BLM projects a total of 33,444 wild horses and burros on the range in FY2009. The BLM is considering euthanizing healthy wild horses and burros to reach Appropriate Management Levels due to low demand for older animals. This action is controversial but allowed under the 1971 law to maintain ecological balance and protect the range. The BLM requested funding reductions for wild horse and burro management in FY2008, but Congress did not support it, instead appropriating $36.2 million. The Administration requested $37.0 million for FY2009, but funding has not been determined yet. The debate over funding levels for wild horse and burro management has been ongoing, with concerns about the cost of holding animals in facilities. The BLM is seeking bids for new long-term holding facilities to care for between 500 and 2,500 animals each. In 2007, the House passed a bill to overturn changes made in the previous Congress regarding the authority to sell wild horses. The bill in the 108th Congress aimed to repeal the authority to sell wild horses and burros, reinstate a ban on their sale for commercial products, and impose criminal penalties for processing their remains. The debate focused on preventing the slaughter of healthy animals versus managing their population. No further action has been taken on H.R. 249. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found challenges in managing the costs of holding animals in facilities, limited options for dealing with unadoptable animals, and non-compliance with the 1971 law by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). GAO recommended that BLM discuss with Congress ways to comply with the law or amend it. Recent fire seasons have been more severe, with increased acres burned and damage to property and resources. The 2008 fire season in California has been relatively mild, with 40% fewer acres burned compared to the previous five years. The threat of severe wildfires has grown due to unnaturally high fuel loads in forests and increasing structures near forest areas. President Bush proposed the Healthy Forests Initiative in 2002 to improve wildfire protection, leading to the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. The Administration made regulatory changes to facilitate fire protection activities, including excluding certain actions from analysis under NEPA and revising administrative review processes for emergency actions. The Administration made regulatory changes to facilitate fire protection activities, including excluding certain actions from analysis under NEPA and revising administrative review processes for emergency actions. Other regulatory changes, such as new NEPA categorical exclusions for small timber harvesting projects and new regulations for FS planning, could impact fuel reduction, public involvement, and environmental impacts. The 110th Congress has focused on wildfire protection, including wildfire preparedness, cost containment, and the effects of global climate change on wildfires. Bills on forest health restoration to reduce wildfire threats have been introduced, including the Forest Landscape Restoration Act providing a collaborative process for large-scale strategies to restore forests and reduce wildfire threats. The bills introduced aim to restore forests, reduce wildfire threats, and utilize biomass on a large scale. The fund is authorized at $40 million annually for ten years, with requirements for multi-party monitoring and reporting. Additionally, there are proposals to categorically exclude fuel reduction projects from NEPA analysis under certain conditions. The 110th Congress is considering legislation to address wildfire threats in the wildland-urban interface, including funding for the National Fire Plan. The Administration's FY2009 budget request includes decreases in funding for fire preparedness and wildfire operations. Funding for wildland fire management for FY2009 is still undetermined. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009 extended funding for wildfire control efforts through March 6, 2009. Concerns have been raised about wildfire funding delaying other agency activities. Bills have been introduced in Congress to establish a separate fund for major wildfire suppression efforts, such as the FLAME Act (H.R. 5541/S. 3256). H.R. 5541, passed by the House on July 9, 2008, aims to allocate annual appropriations to a fund based on the five-year average of emergency fire suppression expenditures. The Emergency Wildland Fire Response Act of 2008 (H.R. 5648) establishes a fund for declared emergency incidents for wildfires, providing assistance to fire-ready communities and authorizing good neighbor partnerships for HRFA projects on federal lands. The House Committee on Natural Resources held hearings on the bill and the Stable Fire Funding Act in 2008. The Act would establish separate funds for the BLM and FS to pay suppression costs exceeding annual appropriations. The FS has exempted certain activities from analysis and public participation under NEPA, which has sparked debate between proponents and opponents. In 2008, the FS shifted many NEPA policies from the Forest Service Handbook. In 2008, the FS shifted NEPA policies from the Forest Service Handbook to the Code of Federal Regulations, modifying some regulations. The rule allows for \"incremental alternative development\" in the NEPA process and limits consideration of cumulative impacts to relevant past actions. The FS can now consider only one alternative in an EA if there are no conflicts. Additionally, the types of activities exempt from environmental review have increased from 18 to 27, including biomass fuel reduction projects and small timber sales. The Forest Service has made changes to its regulations regarding categorical exclusions (CEs), allowing for biomass fuel reduction projects, \"small\" timber sales, and forest plans. The new rule gives officials discretion to determine if extraordinary circumstances warrant NEPA analysis. Additionally, new regulations have been issued changing notice, comment, and appeals procedures for land management planning. Legislation addressing CEs has been limited, with two bills aiming to repeal the authority to use CEs for certain energy leases. Two bills are addressing categorical exclusions (CEs) - one to repeal the authority for certain energy leases and another to authorize CEs for wildfire protection projects. A new CE appeals regulation was challenged in court, with the Ninth Circuit ruling that the exclusion of public comment and appeals violated the Forest Service Decision Making and Appeals Reform Act. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the issue in early October. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the issue of categorical exclusions in October 2008. The regulations for new CE types were challenged in the U.S. District Court for Alabama, which upheld the regulations in January 2007. Despite this, the hazardous fuels reduction CE is not in effect as the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it violated NEPA in December 2007. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in December 2007 that the Forest Service violated NEPA by not considering the environmental consequences of a broad program. New appeals regulations in Part 215 are still in place, except for \u00a7 215.12(f), and the hazardous fuels reduction CE cannot be used. Other federal lands topics of interest to Congress include national forest roadless areas, forest planning, county payments, BLM land sales, and grazing management. Potential wilderness areas in the National Forest System were examined in the 1970s and 1980s, with some advocating for protection of remaining roadless areas. The Clinton Administration rule in 2001 limited road building and timber cutting in roadless areas, while the Bush Administration's 2005 rule allowed governors to petition for special rules. Despite legal challenges, the Administration continues to manage roadless areas under interim directives. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, states can petition for a special rule. Idaho's final rule was published in 2008. Legal battles have ensued over roadless rules, with conflicting court decisions. In 2006, a court found the Bush roadless rule violated NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, reinstating the Clinton rule. Multiple lawsuits and appeals have followed, with ongoing challenges to the Clinton roadless rule. The U.S. District Court for Wyoming found the Clinton roadless rule violated NEPA and the Wilderness Act, and enjoined it. Conflicting court rulings have created uncertainty in roadless area management. Two bills in the 110th Congress address roadless area management, but no further action has been taken on them. Two bills, H.R. 1975 and H.R. 7090, aim to protect roadless areas as part of broader legislation. Hearings were held on H.R. 1975 in October 2007, and H.R. 7090 was introduced in September 2008. The Forest Service is required to develop land management plans with public input, ensuring multiple use and sustained yield of resources in accordance with NEPA regulations. The Bush Administration replaced Clinton's rules on national forest planning in 2005 to balance biological and socioeconomic sustainability. The new rules aimed to reduce regulatory guidelines, alter public input, and exempt plans from NEPA and ESA. However, the rules were challenged for reducing environmental protection without adequate public comment and consideration of endangered species. The U.S. District Court for Northern California remanded the Bush rules to the agency in March 2007. The U.S. District Court for Northern California remanded the Bush rules to the agency for violating NEPA, ESA, and APA. The FS reissued the 2005 rule as a proposed rule to comply with the court's requirements. The final planning rules were issued in April 2008, facing challenges for reducing environmental protection without adequate public comment and consideration of endangered species. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 provided an alternative compensation for counties with tax-exempt federal lands. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program provides payments to counties for tax-exempt federal lands. The program was extended in FY2007 and FY2008-FY2011, with modifications to allocate payments based on federal landholdings. Additionally, the Payments-In-Lieu-of Taxes (PILT) program received mandatory spending for five years (FY2008-FY2012). Legislation for SRS payments must be offset by new revenues or changes in mandatory spending programs. The President's FY2009 budget request included a proposal to extend and amend BLM's authority to sell or exchange land under the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301), which expires on July 24, 2010. Proceeds from land sales are deposited into a separate Treasury account for acquiring nonfederal lands adjacent to federal lands. The law aims to reconfigure land ownership patterns for better resource management and administrative efficiency. The President's proposal aims to extend FLTFA until January 1, 2018, with changes in land management plans for selling or exchanging lands. It would allocate 70% of net proceeds to the Treasury's general fund, with some for BLM restoration projects, capping Interior's annual receipts at $60 million. The Administration estimates $193 million in revenue from FY2008 to FY2012, promoting these changes to reduce the federal deficit and ensure public benefit from land sales. Legislation may be needed to make changes to land sales under FLTFA, as identified in a report by the Government Accountability Office. Challenges include insufficient staff and emphasis on selling available land. Completing land acquisitions also faces obstacles, with most revenues from sales/exchanges required to be used for specific purposes. The BLM issued new grazing regulations in 2006, which were later halted by a court due to violations of NEPA, ESA, and FLPMA. The court criticized the regulations for reducing public input and not consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service. The BLM issued new grazing regulations in 2006, which were later halted by a court for violating NEPA, ESA, and FLPMA. The court required the BLM to address environmental impacts, consult under ESA, and restore public comment provisions before reinstating the regulations. The BLM is currently operating under the 1995 grazing regulations, with some provisions not in effect. The 2006 changes aimed to increase flexibility, improve procedures, and promote conservation, but faced criticism for being unnecessary or harmful. The BLM issued new grazing regulations in 2006, which were later halted by a court for violating NEPA, ESA, and FLPMA. Some regulatory changes included sharing title to range improvements, allowing permittees to acquire water rights for grazing, changing the definition of grazing preference, eliminating conservation use grazing permits, extending time to remedy rangeland health problems, and reducing occasions for public consultation. Controversial issues like revising the grazing fee were not addressed. The BLM planned to revisit related grazing policy changes once the new regulations were in effect. The CRS reports cover various topics related to federal land ownership, forest fire protection, grazing regulations, appropriations for interior and environment agencies, land exchanges, oil and gas development on public lands, mining of hardrock minerals, national forest roadless area initiatives, and natural resources. The CRS reports cover a range of topics including federal land ownership, forest fire protection, grazing regulations, appropriations for interior and environment agencies, land exchanges, oil and gas development on public lands, mining of hardrock minerals, national forest roadless area initiatives, and natural resources. Wilderness: Overview and Statistics, Wildfire Damages to Homes and Resources, Wildfire Funding, Wildfire Protection in the Wildland-Urban Interface - CRS reports by [author name scrubbed] provide insights on various aspects of wildfires and their impacts."
