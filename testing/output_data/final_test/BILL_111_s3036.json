    "content": "The National Alzheimer's Project Act establishes the National Alzheimer's Project within the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create and maintain a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The Project aims to coordinate research and services, accelerate treatment development, and improve care for individuals with Alzheimer's. The National Alzheimer's Project Act aims to prevent, halt, or reverse Alzheimer's, improve early diagnosis and care coordination, include high-risk populations, and collaborate globally. The Secretary of Health and Human Services oversees the national plan and evaluates federal efforts. The National Alzheimer's Project Act gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services discretionary authority to evaluate federal programs related to Alzheimer's. An annual assessment of the nation's progress in preparing for Alzheimer's burden is required, along with the establishment of an Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services. The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services includes federal members such as the Administration on Aging, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Indian Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Surgeon General, National Science Foundation, Department of Veterans Affairs, Food and Drug Administration, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Additionally, there are 12 expert members from outside the Federal Government. The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services consists of 12 external members, including Alzheimer's patient advocates, caregivers, health care providers, state health department representatives, researchers, and voluntary health association representatives. Meetings are held quarterly and are open to the public. The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services advises the Secretary of Health and Human Services and provides an annual report to Congress with evaluations and recommendations for federally funded Alzheimer's programs. The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services advises on federally funded programs for families living with Alzheimer's disease. The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services will terminate on December 31, 2025. Agencies with Alzheimer's data must share it with the Secretary of Health and Human Services for an annual report to Congress. The annual report to Congress will evaluate federally funded efforts in Alzheimer's research, clinical care, and programs, provide recommendations for priority actions to reduce the financial impact of Alzheimer's. The Project aims to improve health outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers through federally funded programs. It includes implementation steps, priority actions for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care, and an annually updated national plan. The Project will expire on December 31, 2025."
