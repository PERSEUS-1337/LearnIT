SEC. 7. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that Federal financial assistance for social service programs should be distributed effectively and efficiently, all eligible organizations should be able to compete for assistance without discrimination based on religion, and Federal programs must adhere to the first amendment of the Constitution. (5) Faith-based organizations should be eligible for Federal financial assistance and participate in social service programs without compromising their independence or religious character. (6) Organizations receiving Federal funds for social services must not discriminate based on religion. (7) Organizations involved in religious activities should be allowed to engage in worship and religious instruction. Faith-based organizations receiving Federal financial assistance should be able to conduct religious activities separately from supported programs, ensuring voluntary participation. They must maintain independence and uphold their religious mission, excluding the use of Federal funds for inherently religious activities. Faith-based organizations receiving Federal financial assistance should be allowed to use their facilities for social services without removing religious symbols or altering their religious mission. They should also be able to retain religious terms in their name, consider religion in selecting board members, and include religious references in their mission statements or governing documents."
