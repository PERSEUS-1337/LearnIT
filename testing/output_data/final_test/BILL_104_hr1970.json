    "content": "The Act titled \"Mothers' and Infants' Good Health Act of 1995\" requires coverage for child birth. The \"Mothers' and Infants' Good Health Act of 1995\" mandates health plans to cover a minimum of 48 hours of inpatient care after a vaginal delivery and 96 hours after a caesarean section. Home deliveries require coverage for 48 hours of appropriate home health care. Plans cannot impose varying cost-sharing based on the length of stay. In implementing the requirements of the \"Mothers' and Infants' Good Health Act of 1995,\" health plans cannot modify coverage terms based on an enrollee's decision to request less than the minimum required stay after childbirth. Plans must provide written notice to enrollees about the coverage regulations, following guidelines set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The notice should be included in general plan mailings and yearly informational packets. Enrollees must receive written notice about coverage regulations either as part of the yearly informational packet or by January 1, 1996. Health plans violating these provisions may face civil money penalties determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The enforcement process follows the guidelines of the Social Security Act. The term \"health plan\" in this section refers to any plan or arrangement providing health benefits, excluding certain types of coverage like accidental death, sickness-related wage coverage, Medicare supplemental policies, and liability insurance supplements. The term \"health plan\" includes coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance, worker's compensation, automobile medical-payment insurance, long-term care policies, and other plans determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It also encompasses any plan providing benefit payments for a specified disease or illness. The term \"health plan\" includes coverage for a specified disease or illness or period of hospitalization, regardless of costs or services provided during that time. The provisions of section 2 of the Act apply to all health plans offered, sold, issued, or renewed after the enactment date."
