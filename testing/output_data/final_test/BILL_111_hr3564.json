    "content": "The \"Children's Act for Responsible Employment of 2009\" or the \"CARE Act of 2009\" revises the age requirement for child agricultural employment under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. It removes the waiver provision for hand harvest laborers. SEC. 3. INCREASED CIVIL PENALTIES FOR CHILD LABOR VIOLATIONS. Section 16(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to increase civil penalties for child labor violations. Penalties range from $500 to $15,000 per employee for violations, and up to $50,000 for violations causing serious injury, illness, or death of employees under 18 years old. Penalties may be doubled for repeated or willful violations. SEC. 4. SPECIAL CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN AGGRAVATED CHILD LABOR VIOLATIONS. Any person who repeatedly or willfully violates section 12 of the Fair Labor Standards Act and causes the death or permanent disability of an employee under 18 years old may face imprisonment for up to five years or a fine under title 18, United States Code, or both.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON WORK-RELATED INJURIES TO CHILDREN AND RELATED MATTERS. An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires a report to Congress on work-related injuries to children and related matters. SEC. 12A. DATA ON WORK-RELATED INJURIES TO CHILDREN AND RELATED MATTERS. The Secretary must analyze data on children under 18 working in agriculture, including work-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths. The sources for this analysis include Department of Labor agencies, state employment security agencies, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. An annual report to Congress summarizing the collected data is required. The Secretary must analyze data on child labor in agriculture, including safety and health hazards. The report must be published in the Federal Register and on the Department of Labor website. SEC. 6. EMPLOYER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to include a new section on employer reporting requirements. Employers must report work-related serious injuries, illnesses, or deaths of employees under 18 in agriculture to the Secretary within 5 days. The report should include employer and employee details, as well as incident specifics like environmental hazards. Employers must report work-related serious injuries, illnesses, or deaths of employees under 18 in agriculture to the Secretary within 5 days. The report should include details such as environmental hazards, machinery use, work tasks, and other incident-related information. Failure to report may result in a civil penalty ranging from $500 to $7,000 per violation. The terms 'serious injury' and 'serious illness' are defined as per section 16(e)(1)(B). The Worker Protection Standard prohibits employing children under 18 in hazardous pesticide-related work. The Fair Labor Standards Amendments will be applied accordingly. The Secretary of Labor must issue final rules within 180 days of the Act's enactment to implement the amendments and revisions. These rules will take effect within 30 days of publication. The amendments and revisions will apply to violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act occurring after the rules take effect, without preempting any state laws providing greater employee protections. The employer reporting requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as added by the Act, will take effect when the final rules issued under the Act are implemented. The Act and its amendments will take effect 30 days after the regulations required under section 8 are published in the Federal Register."
