    "content": "The National Emergencies Act, enacted in September 1976, established a procedure for presidential declaration and congressional regulation of national emergencies. It returned standby emergency powers to a dormant state two years after approval, but did not cancel existing national emergency proclamations issued by the President. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 established a procedure for declaring national emergencies and outlined the process for congressional regulation. It allowed for the termination of emergency declarations after one year unless extended by the President or Congress. The method for congressional termination was initially a concurrent resolution, but was later changed to a joint resolution following a Supreme Court ruling in 1983. The Emergencies Act of 1985 amended the process for rescinding a national emergency declaration by using a joint resolution. The President must specify the powers being activated in response to the emergency, with nearly 160 provisions of law that could be activated. These provisions include the authority to prosecute those making defective war material, waive radio station license requirements, release national defense stockpile materials, control vessels in territorial waters, and regulate foreign transactions. The Emergencies Act of 1985 amended the process for rescinding a national emergency declaration by using a joint resolution. The act allows for the activation of various provisions of law in response to emergencies involving foreign countries or their nationals. Initial use of the act occurred in 1979 in response to the U.S. embassy hostage crisis in Iran, leading to actions against several other countries. Since 1983, national emergencies have been declared to maintain export control regulations under the Export Administration Act. Over 30 national emergencies have been declared, with about a dozen terminated. President Clinton declared a national emergency in 1995 related to transactions with terrorists disrupting the Middle East peace process. President Bush declared a national emergency in 2001 in response to terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. President Bush's national emergency declaration did not activate dormant legal provisions allowing censorship and martial law. Instead, it selectively activated statutory authorities related to the suspension of laws concerning military officers during war or national emergencies. During a war or national emergency, the President can defer end-strength limitations for military components and suspend certain sections of Title 10, United States Code related to officer strength. The President can also increase the number of active-duty members beyond appropriated funds if necessary. During a war or national emergency, the President has the authority to suspend certain sections of Title 10, United States Code related to officer strength and call members of the Ready Reserve to active duty. Additionally, the Secretary of Transportation can order retired Coast Guard officers to active duty in times of war or national emergency. During a war or national emergency, the President can order retired Coast Guard members to active duty. President Bush invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to block transactions with terrorists. President Bush invoked the IEEPA to prohibit transactions with terrorists threatening the Middle East peace process. He also issued E.O. 13235, granting emergency construction authority for military projects during declared war or national emergency. President Bush issued E.O. 13303 in May 2003, declaring a national emergency to protect the development fund for Iraq and other property in which Iraq has an interest. This action stemmed from U.S. intervention in Iraq, justified as a response to al Qaeda presence and a regime supporting terrorists. President Bush issued E.O. 13321 in December 2003, invoking emergency powers to appoint qualified persons to officer grades in the armed forces, in line with previous national emergency declarations related to terrorism. The report will document declarations and additional declarations related to terrorism as they are made."
