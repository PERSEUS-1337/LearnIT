    "content": "The \"AIRWAVES Act\" aims to advance innovation and investment in wireless broadband Internet access, promote connectivity for all individuals in the US, including those in rural areas, and support a spectrum policy that includes licensed, unlicensed, and shared use of spectrum bands. In this Act, the term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific Senate and House committees with jurisdiction, the term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Communications Commission, the term \"eligible Federal entity\" refers to entities described in a specific section of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act, and the term \"eligible frequency\" refers to frequencies for which eligible Federal entities can be reimbursed for relocation costs. The Spectrum Relocation Fund may reimburse entities relocating from the frequency. Definitions include \"Federal entity,\" \"NTIA,\" and \"Spectrum Frontiers proceeding.\" The Spectrum Relocation Fund is established under the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act. The term \"system of competitive bidding\" refers to a bidding system under the Communications Act of 1934. The Commission must complete the Spectrum Frontiers rulemaking within 1 year of the Act's enactment. Additionally, there is a focus on expanding access to commercial spectrum. The FCC, in consultation with the NTIA, must complete competitive bidding for priority access licenses for 70 megahertz of spectrum between 3550 MHz and 3650 MHz by December 31, 2018. Competitive bidding for spectrum between 24250 MHz and 28350 MHz must also be completed by the same date. The FCC must complete competitive bidding for spectrum in various frequency bands by December 31, 2020, including 31800-33400 MHz, 42000-42500 MHz, and 50400-52600 MHz. The FCC's rules reserve specific frequencies for authorized access use in the 3550-3700 MHz band, while also identifying frequencies between 7125-8400 MHz for unlicensed purposes. The NTIA, in consultation with the Commission, will identify frequencies between 7125-8400 MHz for potential unlicensed use without causing interference. If identified, the Commission will consider initiating a rule-making process. Additionally, the NTIA will report on the reallocation of certain incumbent federal stations by December 31, 2020. The NTIA will identify frequencies between 7125-8400 MHz for potential unlicensed use. The Commission will consider rule-making if identified. A report on the reallocation of incumbent Federal stations in specific frequencies is due by December 31, 2020. The relocation of spectrum between 1300-1350 MHz and 1780-1830 MHz for non-Federal use will take place after 2023. Amendments to the Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015 include increasing the spectrum allocation to 100 megahertz and changing the deadline to July 1, 2023. MODERNIZING MID-BAND SPECTRUM. The Commission, in consultation with the NTIA, will identify up to 500 megahertz of additional spectrum between 3700 and 4200 megahertz for commercial use by December 31, 2019. A spectrum auction for this identified spectrum must be completed by December 31, 2022. Additionally, a notice of proposed rule making will be issued within 180 days after the enactment of this Act to create opportunities for unlicensed spectrum use between 5925 and 7125 megahertz. The FCC will create opportunities for unlicensed spectrum use between 5925 and 7125 megahertz. SEC. 7. RURAL SET-ASIDE. The Commission will allocate 10 percent of bidding proceeds for wireless infrastructure in underserved areas. No funds can be combined with existing programs. SEC. 8. SPECIAL RULES. The Commission must notify Congress and NTIA if relocation of incumbents in a frequency band is not possible and no mitigation technology can prevent interference. No actions can be taken that may harm incumbents until interference is prevented. The Commission must prevent harmful interference with incumbents in the covered band. The Commission is required to conduct a study on enhancing the benefits of unlicensed spectrum for rural communities, focusing on healthcare, distance learning, and agriculture. Recommendations should address barriers to using unlicensed spectrum and expanding broadband access in rural areas. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the efficiency of transferring funds from the Spectrum Relocation Fund to eligible Federal entities. Any frequency range mentioned in the Act includes both upper and lower frequencies. The Act does not impact requirements under section 156 of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act."
