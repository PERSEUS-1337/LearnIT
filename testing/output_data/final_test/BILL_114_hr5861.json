The purpose of this Act is to establish terms for the conveyance of certain Federal land in the area. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Permittee - a person holding a valid permit for use of a Property, including heirs, executors, and assigns.\n(2) Property - Federal land associated with private cabins on vacation sites in Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area.\n(3) Secretary - the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 4. SALE OF PROPERTIES. The Secretary must offer the permittee the first option to purchase the Property at fair market value, less the value of improvements. If not purchased, the Property will be offered to the public at fair market value. If not conveyed before the lease expires, permit extensions will be granted at no extra cost. If no bids meet fair market value, the property remains federal. The Secretary must offer to sell all US rights in the Property, including easements for access. The Secretary may sell Federal land contiguous to each Property for fair market value, excluding shoreline or land for public access, to eliminate inholdings and facilitate administration of adjacent land. The Secretary will conduct appraisals of each Property to determine fair market value, excluding permittee improvements. The Property will be sold to the highest bidder at or above fair market value through a sealed bid process. The cost of conveyance of a Property under this Act, including required appraisals, will be paid by the Secretary for sales to permittees from sale revenues, and by the purchaser for sales to others. Proceeds from the sale of Federal land under this Act will be available to the Secretary for costs under section 4(e)(1) and deferred maintenance activities in the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area."
