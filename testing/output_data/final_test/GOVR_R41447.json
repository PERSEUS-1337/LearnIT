Critics, including members of Congress and the Obama Administration, question the legitimacy of the election under the ruling military junta. There are doubts about the election being free and fair, raising debates about U.S. policy towards Burma and the effectiveness of past isolationist measures. The upcoming parliamentary elections in Burma on November 7, 2010, have raised concerns about the government's treatment of the Burmese people and the effectiveness of past isolationist measures. The opposition National League for Democracy's victory in the 1990 elections created optimism for democracy, but the ruling military junta refused to accept the results. Following the 2010 parliamentary elections in Burma, the ruling military junta, now known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), arrested opposition leaders, including NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The SPDC held a referendum on a new constitution shortly after Cyclone Nargis, with widespread criticism of the results being fraudulent. The SPDC announced parliamentary elections in 2010 following criticism of fraudulent results in a referendum on a new constitution. The elections would involve 330 seats in the lower house, 168 seats in the upper house, and 665 seats in regional assemblies. 25% of seats would be appointed by the commander-in-chief of Burma's Defense Services. Five new laws were released for the pending elections on March 9, 2010. The new laws released for the pending elections in Burma included regulations for the registration and operation of political parties, the establishment of a Union Election Commission, and the formation of different types of parliaments. These laws faced criticism for imposing unreasonable restrictions on opposition leaders and undermining the credibility of the democratic process. The Union Election Commission Law and the appointment of 17 members by the SPDC faced objections. Political parties had to submit registration materials within 60 days to participate in the 2010 elections. The National League for Democracy and other opposition parties chose not to register or participate. The SPDC transformed the USDA into the USDP and a splinter group of the NLD formed the NDF. In 2010, 47 political parties were active. In 2010, 47 political parties submitted registration applications to the UEC for the parliamentary elections on November 7. 37 parties were allowed to run candidates after meeting the requirements set by the UEC. In 2010, 37 political parties were allowed to run candidates in the elections, while five parties were dissolved and five new parties were cancelled for not meeting requirements. The UEC also refused five parties associated with ethnic minorities. Independent candidates also registered by the deadline. Reports of candidates being ruled ineligible, including a National Unity Party candidate disqualified for being a retired Christian minister. The UEC disqualified 14 members of the dissolved Kachin State Progressive Party and rejected a Democratic Party candidate for alleged tax evasion and not meeting residency requirements. Controversy surrounded some USDP candidates, with government officials joining the party despite election laws prohibiting it. The SPDC chief and top military officers resigned to run in the upcoming election, seen as a move to bypass laws. Allegations of controlling the campaign to ensure victory in November elections. Opposition claims election laws disenfranchise voters and prohibit candidacy of opposition leaders. UEC decisions criticized as a mechanism for controlling elections. The UEC's decisions, criticized for controlling the election, include refusal to allow minority parties to participate, short candidate registration time, high registration fees, and cancellation of elections in certain regions. The official campaign period for the November elections began on September 24, 2010, with each political party given 15 minutes of airtime to present their platform on national television and radio. The UEC and Ministry of Information can refuse to broadcast party statements, which are subject to restrictions to avoid harming security or tarnishing the image of the State or Tatmadaw. The official campaign period for the November elections began on September 24, 2010, with political parties given airtime to present their platform on national television and radio. The UEC released Notification 91/2010 on August 18, 2010, setting conditions for political rallies and speeches, requiring permits to be obtained at least seven days prior to the event. Permit applications must include details such as location, date, speakers' names, and content of speeches must abide by regulations. Opposition groups have organized an election boycott campaign, with student groups and Buddhist monks among the first to support it. The UEC has been accused of being more lenient towards pro-junta parties in issuing permits for rallies. Some attendees of opposition rallies claim to have been harassed by the police. The NLD launched a campaign to educate voters about their rights not to vote in the 2010 elections. The SPDC responded by intimidating boycott supporters and arresting organizers. The New Light of Myanmar encouraged voting and criticized non-voters as \"irresponsible opportunists.\" Several university students in Rangoon were arrested for their election-related activities. Several university students in Rangoon were arrested for their involvement in the election boycott campaign. A Buddhist monk received a 15-year prison sentence for anti-election activities. Members of the NLD and other boycott supporters faced threats of imprisonment and fines. The Peace and Diversity Party withdrew from the election due to government censorship. Other parties requested a delay in the election to campaign and raise funds. Interest in the election was low among voters. Some election observers report little interest in the election, as many voters presume pro-junta parties will win a majority of seats, potentially enough to amend the constitution. The opposition and ethnic parties are not contesting many seats, giving pro-junta candidates a strong presence at the local level. The Irrawaddy reported on the upcoming election, highlighting that pro-junta parties are expected to dominate due to budget and time constraints faced by opposition parties. The USDP and NUP are set to have candidates in the majority of seats, potentially leading to pro-junta candidates winning most seats. Opposition parties lack sufficient candidates to secure a majority in national or regional parliamentary seats. The upcoming election in Burma may not be free and fair, with the ruling party potentially winning control in certain states despite reports of intimidation. The Obama Administration has expressed concerns about the election's fairness. The Obama Administration expressed concerns about the upcoming parliamentary elections in Burma on November 7, 2010, stating that they may lack international legitimacy. Sanctions could be adjusted based on the actions of the ruling military junta, with considerations for tightening financial sanctions and supporting a U.N. commission of inquiry into crimes in Burma. Several countries have expressed support for a U.N. commission on human rights in Burma, with the idea first proposed in 2010. The President has the authority to impose financial sanctions on Burmese officials under various executive orders and acts. The 2008 JADE Act requires notifying Congress of new additions to the sanctions list. The Obama Administration plans to impose tighter financial sanctions on the leadership of the SPDC and the Burmese military to avoid harm to the people of Burma. No specific timeframe was given for the implementation of these new sanctions."
