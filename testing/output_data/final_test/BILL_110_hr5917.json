Congress enacted legislation to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, requiring a fleet-wide fuel economy of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. This represents a 27 percent increase over current standards and mandates Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors to invest $85 billion in research and development. Currently, these companies invest $16 billion annually in developing safer, more efficient, and alternative fuel vehicles, employing over 65,000 Americans for this purpose. Investments in new energy efficiency initiatives should not detract from current investments in vehicle safety technology. Energy availability is a critical national security issue due to reliance on imported petroleum products. Clean diesel technology can reduce emissions in the short-term while alternative energy sources are developed. Electric vehicle propulsion can reduce dependence on petroleum-based energy. Energy storage is crucial for making electric vehicles commercially viable. Technical challenges exist in achieving adequate energy storage for electric vehicles. There is currently no domestic production of advanced battery technology for hybrid or electric vehicles. Domestic research and development in advanced battery and electric vehicle technology can create high-paying jobs. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are seen as a long-term solution. The United States Government invests Federal funds in research and development of advanced fuel technology, spending approximately $400,000,000 in fiscal year 2007 and $1,100,000,000 in fiscal year 2008. Coordinating these efforts would lead to greater gains in developing efficient alternative fuel technologies. The US Government invests in research and development of advanced fuel technology to develop efficient alternative fuel technologies and relieve the auto industry's cost burden. The US Government invests in advanced battery research and development to promote efficient alternative fuel technologies and reduce the auto industry's costs. The US Government invests in advanced battery research and development to promote efficient alternative fuel technologies and reduce the auto industry's costs. A battery is defined as an electrochemical energy storage system powered by electrical current. The Secretary of Energy establishes a grant program for National Laboratories and higher education institutions to research, develop, and demonstrate high-efficiency advanced battery technologies, including exploratory research, battery system development, vehicle technology demonstration, and US advanced battery production capability development. Priority consideration is given in awarding grants. The Secretary of Energy prioritizes National Laboratories and higher education institutions partnering with vehicle manufacturers for advanced battery technology research. $150,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary of Energy for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. SEC. 4. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to remove a subsection related to the research activities credit and add a new subsection allowing a portion of the credit for technology meeting fuel economy standards to be treated as refundable. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow the partnership level to apply for the credit, treat the credit as an overpayment of tax, refund the overpayment to the partnership, and reduce credits separately stated to partners. Additionally, a conforming amendment removes a subsection related to the research activities credit. The amendments made by this section apply to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2007, by striking subparagraph (D). SEC. 5. INTERAGENCY GROUP ON CAFE STANDARDS. Establishment of Interagency Working Group on Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards with representatives from various government departments, agencies, and the automobile manufacturing industry appointed by the President. The Interagency Working Group, chaired by a representative from specified federal agencies, aims to coordinate research on advanced fuel technology to enhance vehicle fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. The Interagency Working Group, chaired by a representative from specified federal agencies, meets regularly to examine auto companies' efforts to meet fuel economy standards, propose policy recommendations, formulate a budget for research on advanced fuel technologies, review agency priorities, and promote communication among government, private sector, and academia on research. The Interagency Working Group, chaired by a representative from federal agencies, meets regularly to examine auto companies' efforts to meet fuel economy standards, propose policy recommendations, formulate a budget for research on advanced fuel technologies, and promote communication among government, private sector, and academia on research and development requirements. They also submit an annual report of their activities to Congress. SEC. 6. The EPA will collaborate with standard-setting organizations to harmonize biofuels production standards. An annual progress report will be submitted to Congress. SEC. 7. Hydrogen fueling pumps. SEC. 7. HYDROGEN FUELING PUMPS. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a grant program to install 100 hydrogen fueling pumps at gas stations by 2013. Gas station owners must contribute 10% of the pump cost. $50,000,000 is authorized annually for this program. SEC. 8. FEDERAL ACQUISITION OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES. $50,000,000 authorized annually for the acquisition of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for Federal agencies from 2012 to 2014."
