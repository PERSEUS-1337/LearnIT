Subsection (d) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish the Great Lakes Research Council, defining the Great Lakes and Great Lakes research. The Great Lakes Research Council is established to coordinate federal research activities related to the Great Lakes ecosystem, aiming to avoid duplication and enhance effectiveness. The Great Lakes Research Council coordinates federal research activities for the Great Lakes ecosystem to avoid duplication, assess research needs, evaluate federal expertise, and make recommendations for achieving the goals of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The Great Lakes Research Council recommends research priorities for Federal research on the Great Lakes, coordinates efforts with Canada, identifies topics for meetings and conferences, and makes recommendations for data collection and storage to enhance research and management protocols. The Great Lakes Research Council aims to restore the ecosystem integrity, establish a comprehensive database, and ensure timely dissemination of research findings. The council's membership is diverse. The Great Lakes Research Council is comprised of research managers with expertise in the Great Lakes ecosystem from various federal organizations, with the option for non-voting members who are not federal employees to serve at the council's request. The Great Lakes Research Council members elect a Chairperson for a 2-year term, with a limit of 2 consecutive terms. Non-federal members are reimbursed for travel expenses while serving on the Council. Interagency cooperation is required from federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities. The Council can request personnel, services, or facilities from Federal agencies to assist in achieving its goals. Federal agencies must provide data or information upon request. This subsection does not affect the authority of Federal agencies to conduct Great Lakes research activities under existing laws."
