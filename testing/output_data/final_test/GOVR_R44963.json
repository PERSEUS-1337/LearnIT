    "content": "Waste discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants are a significant source of water quality problems, including nutrients, bacteria, pathogens, metals, and toxic chemicals. The Clean Water Act establishes performance levels to prevent harmful discharges. The Clean Water Act sets standards for municipal sewage treatment plants to prevent harmful waste discharge into surface waters and ensure sewage sludge meets environmental quality standards. The Act requires secondary treatment of sewage or more stringent treatment where necessary to meet water quality standards. The U.S. has made progress in controlling chemical pollution in rivers since 1972, but continued infrastructure improvements are needed. The population served by sewage treatment plants with at least secondary treatment increased from 85 million in 1972 to 234 million in 2012, representing 74% of the U.S. population at that time. Despite improvements in sewage treatment plants, challenges remain with wet weather pollution from combined and sanitary sewers. These untreated discharges during rainfall events pose public health and environmental risks. Control costs for wet weather problems are a concern, with about 21% of households relying on on-site septic systems instead of centralized treatment facilities. The nation faces serious public health and environmental issues due to wet weather pollution and toxic waste discharge. Despite $104 billion in CWA assistance since 1972, funding needs for wastewater infrastructure remain high, with an estimated $271 billion needed over the next 20 years. This includes $197 billion for wastewater treatment and collection systems, $48 billion for combined sewer overflow corrections, $19 billion for stormwater management, and $6 billion for recycled water distribution systems. The Clean Water Act has provided $104 billion in assistance since 1972, but there is still a high funding need for wastewater infrastructure, estimated at $271 billion over the next 20 years. Small communities account for 12% of the total needs, with the largest needs being for new conveyance systems, treatment, system repair, and advanced treatment. Five states - New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Texas, and Alabama - make up 30% of the small community needs. The CWA authorizes federal programs to support wastewater treatment plant construction and related activities. Since 1972, the Clean Water Act has allocated approximately $104 billion to support compliance and restoration of the nation's waters. Title II of the act authorized grants to states for wastewater treatment plant construction, with funds allocated based on states' financial needs and population. States used their allotments to fund various wastewater treatment projects. The Clean Water Act amendments in 1987 created the Clean Water State Revolving Funds (CWSRFs) program, where states provide a 20% match to federal grants for sewer projects. The program replaced Title II in FY1991 and transitioned to Title VI, which included earmarked water infrastructure grants to communities. Earmarking stopped in FY2011 due to opposition. Federal contributions to CWSRFs were meant to help states transition to full state and local financing by FY1995. Despite early funding and administrative issues, most states believe the program is successful today. Congress has continued to allocate funds for wastewater construction projects. The history of EPA wastewater infrastructure appropriations shows stable funding levels in recent years. In FY2018, the CWSRF program received a 22% increase in funding, totaling $1.694 billion. This program represents a shift towards loan programs for financing wastewater treatment needs, unlike the previous construction grants program. States use their CWSRFs to provide financial assistance for project construction loans, refinancing local debt, loan guarantees, and insurance. Additional subsidies like principal forgiveness and negative interest loans may be offered. Loans must be repaid within 30 years, with a dedicated revenue stream from user fees. CWSRF monies must first be used for wastewater treatment facilities compliance before supporting other water quality programs. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) provides financial assistance for various projects like wastewater treatment plant construction, stormwater management, energy-efficiency improvements, and security enhancements. States must ensure compliance with specific requirements, such as using American-made iron and steel products and paying prevailing wages for construction. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 expanded the list of eligible projects and activities. The CWSRF requires recipients to use American-made iron and steel products in projects. States prioritize projects based on water pollution severity and financial considerations. States must have mechanisms to administer the loan program and can receive capitalization grants. Some states quickly adapted to the new program, while others struggled with the transition. Over half of the states leverage their funds with federal grants. Since 1988, over half of the states have used federal grants and state matching funds to borrow in the public bond market, increasing available funds for project lending. Small communities and states with large rural populations face challenges with CWSRF funding due to limited resources and difficulties in qualifying for loans. These communities lack an industrial tax base, leading to high per capita user fees for sewage treatment projects. Compared to larger cities, they struggle with economies of scale, affecting project costs. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) program provides financial assistance for water infrastructure projects. It authorizes EPA to provide credit assistance for wastewater and drinking water projects with project costs of $20 million or more. In rural areas, project costs must be $5 million or more. Congress authorized $1.75 billion from FY2015 through FY2019 for the program. In 2017, Congress allocated funds for the WIFIA program, providing $20 million initially and an additional $8 million for loan subsidy costs. EPA received 43 letters of interest from borrowers requesting $6 billion in loans. 12 projects were selected to continue the application process, with loan amounts ranging from $22 million to $625 million. In FY2018, $63 million was provided for the WIFIA program. In FY2018, Congress allocated $63 million for the WIFIA program, with an additional $8 million for administrative costs. EPA estimated that this budget authority would provide around $5.5 billion in credit assistance. Other federal agencies like USDA and HUD also offer assistance for water infrastructure projects in rural and urban areas. The Department of Commerce administers the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program with $3.3 billion in funds provided by Congress for FY2018. Water and waste disposal projects, accounting for approximately 10% of total grant disbursements, compete with other CDBG-funded public activities. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides project grants for public facilities, including water and sewer systems, as part of approved economic development programs. The federal government funds only a small portion of the nation's annual wastewater treatment capital investment, with state and local governments providing the majority of funds. Local governments own and operate approximately 15,000 treatment plants. Local governments own and operate approximately 15,000 wastewater treatment plants nationwide, with construction historically financed through federal and state grants, local taxes, and bonds. Municipal bonds are the primary financing tool used, with most projects being debt-financed. Shifting the aid program to the Clean Water Act has impacted how local governments finance capital investments. The shift from categorical grants to the CWSRF loan program in 1990 made localities responsible for nearly 100% of project costs, leading to increased financial challenges for local governments in funding environmental services. Options for localities include raising additional funds through various means or failing to comply with federal standards. Authorizations for CWSRF grants expired in FY1994, leading to congressional interest. The House passed a reauthorization bill in the 104th Congress, but no legislation was enacted due to controversies. The 106th Congress authorized $1.5 billion for wet weather sewerage projects. Wet weather projects compete with other CWSRF projects. Authorization for wet weather project grants under the CWSRF program expired in FY2003 and has not been renewed, with no funds appropriated. Recent efforts in Congress have focused on extending the CWSRF program, increasing authorization for capitalization grants, and addressing water quality priorities beyond traditional treatment plant construction, particularly managing wet weather pollutant runoff. The 113th Congress made significant changes to the CWSRF provisions in 2014, including extending loan repayment terms, expanding eligible projects, increasing assistance to Indian tribes, and imposing \"Buy America\" requirements. The amendments also allowed for forgiveness of principal and negative interest loans under certain conditions. However, long-standing issues like authorization of appropriations for capitalization grants and prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act were not addressed. The 2014 legislation made changes to the CWSRF provisions, extending loan terms and imposing \"Buy America\" requirements. The 114th Congress passed the Water Resources Development Act, but many wastewater funding provisions were not included in the final legislation. Interest in water infrastructure needs is strong, but proposals for financial assistance may face competition. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress include wastewater infrastructure provisions. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress include wastewater infrastructure provisions."
