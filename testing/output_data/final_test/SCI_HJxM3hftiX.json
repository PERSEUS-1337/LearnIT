    "content": "Significant advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) modelling since 2018 allow for accurate results with minimal labelled data. These models benefit from training on both task-agnostic and task-specific unlabelled data, but come with high size and computational costs. The workshop paper discusses a convolutional student architecture trained through distillation from a large-scale model, achieving significant speedup and parameter reduction. It highlights recent advances in NLP modeling, emphasizing the benefits of training on large corpuses and fine-tuning on task-specific unlabelled data for downstream tasks. This work demonstrates how a model distillation process can train a 'student' CNN structure from a larger 'teacher' Language Model using both labelled and unlabelled data. Results show that the student model can achieve similar performance to large attention-based models with only convolutional layers. The OpenAI Transformer model is used as the 'teacher' in this model-distillation setting. The model consists of a Byte-Pair Encoded subword BID13 embedding layer and 12 layers of a \"decoder-only transformer with masked self-attention heads\" BID3. It was pretrained on a corpus of 7000 books and achieved excellent performance on various NLP tasks through discriminative fine-tuning. Different models were trained directly on the classification task or via distillation of the logit layer output by a pretrained OpenAI model. Distillation logits were inferred for unlabelled samples using transfer learning with pretrained GloVe embeddings. The BlendCNN architecture, inspired by ELMo, leverages hierarchical representations for text classification. It consists of CNN layers with global pooling outputs that are blended through a dense network for classification. The model was tested on standard datasets like AG News, DBpedia, and Yahoo Answers. The BlendCNN architecture, inspired by ELMo, achieved top scores in text classification tasks on datasets like AG News, DBpedia, and Yahoo Answers. The experiment involved evaluating baseline methods and student networks, with the large LM serving as a 'teacher' to improve performance through distillation. The 3-Layer and 8-Layer variants of BlendCNN performed best, with the guidance of the teacher leading to marked improvement in training. The BlendCNN architecture, inspired by ELMo, achieved top scores in text classification tasks on datasets like AG News, DBpedia, and Yahoo Answers. The 3-Layer BlendCNN student model has significantly fewer parameters and faster inference compared to the OpenAI Transformer. Mastery in text classification may require high-level concepts and fine-grained textual features. High-capacity models with task-agnostic pre-training may excel on small datasets, while convolutional student architectures are ideal for practical applications. The BlendCNN architecture efficiently achieves higher scores on text classification tasks by leveraging hierarchical features. The curr_chunk discusses achieving higher scores on text classification tasks by leveraging hierarchical representations from a strong teaching model. Specialized student architectures could surpass teacher performance by utilizing knowledge from a pretrained teacher model and optimizing for task-specific constraints."
