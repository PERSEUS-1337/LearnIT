    "content": "A \"grand coalition\" government of Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the SPD, led by Angela Merkel, took office on November 22, 2005, after the 2005 federal election produced no clear winner. Some doubt its longevity, but others see it as necessary for implementing economic and social reforms. Foreign policy is expected to take a backseat to domestic issues, with U.S.-German relations already improving under the new government. Since Merkel took office, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced early federal elections in 2005 due to defeats in state elections, giving CDU firm control of the Bundesrat. Economic issues and welfare reforms were key factors in the SPD's loss. Early elections are rare in Germany due to the strict Basic Law. The German Basic Law makes it difficult to dissolve the Bundestag, with the President needing a vote of no confidence to do so. New elections were set for September 18, 2005 after a vote of no confidence in the government. The election resulted in no party gaining a majority with its preferred coalition partner, with the CDU/CSU winning the most votes but having a weak showing compared to pre-election polls. The CDU/CSU won the election with 35.2% of the vote, narrowly beating the SPD. Neither party could form a government with their preferred coalition partner. The FDP performed better than expected with 9.8% of the vote, ahead of the Greens at 8.1%. The new Left Party received 8.9% of the vote, enough to be seated in the Bundestag. Voter turnout was 77.7%, slightly lower than in the previous election. In the 2005 German Federal Election, the CDU/CSU won with 35.2% of the vote, narrowly beating the SPD. The FDP and the Greens also had significant percentages, while the new Left Party secured enough votes to be seated in the Bundestag. Voter turnout was 77.7%, slightly lower than in the previous election."
