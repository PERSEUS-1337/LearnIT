    "content": "The Act titled \"Combating the Opioid Epidemic Through Forensic Drug Testing Act of 2017\" amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to address public safety and heroin distribution, sale, and use. Grants are authorized to confront the use of heroin and associated drugs. The Act authorizes grants to States and Indian tribes to address heroin, fentanyl, and synthetic drug distribution, sale, and use for public safety enhancement. Grants can be used for forensic science laboratories and medical examiner offices. The Act authorizes grants to address backlogs of untested drug samples and conduct autopsies related to drug overdose deaths. It also provides funding for equipment and technology to improve laboratory efficiency and prevent future backlogs. Grants can be used by State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies. The Act authorizes grants to reimburse law enforcement agencies for field-testing equipment to detect heroin, fentanyl, and synthetic drugs, investigate and prosecute drug-related crimes, and support health department services. At least 60 percent of the funding will be allocated for specific purposes, with $10,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2018 to 2020. The Act authorizes grants for field-testing equipment to detect drugs and support law enforcement agencies. Funding will be allocated to States based on population and at the discretion of the Attorney General for competitive grants. The Act authorizes grants to States with high rates of opioid treatment admissions for law enforcement agencies. The Attorney General considers violent crime rates and recipient needs. Each State receives a minimum of 0.6 percent of funding annually. For allocation purposes, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are considered as 1 State, with 67 percent allocated to American Samoa and 33 percent to the Northern Mariana Islands."
