    "content": "The Administration proposed deferring the start of a next-generation bomber program for the Air Force in the FY2010 defense budget, pending the completion of strategic reviews and arms control negotiations with Russia. The budget did not allocate specific funding for the NGB program, despite prior research and development efforts by the Air Force. However, there is support for eventually starting the program from the Secretary of Defense and Air Force officials. The requirements list for the Air Force's FY2010 budget includes a classified $140-million item for a next-generation bomber. Congress must decide whether to fund the NGB program and amend legislation on bomber force structure. Secretary of Defense Gates recommended deferring the NGB program in the proposed budget. The National Defense Strategy emphasizes U.S. predominance in conventional warfare and the need for necessary programs to deter aggression and protect interests globally. Recommendations include new investments and shifts in key areas, such as a decision to defer the development program for a follow-on Air Force bomber until further understanding is gained. Strategic requirements will be reviewed in various defense reviews and arms control negotiations. An Office of Management and Budget document outlines terminations, reductions, and savings in the proposed FY2010 budget, including the proposal for the NGB. The Administration has decided not to pursue development of a new long-range bomber as the existing fleet is performing well and will be able to meet expected threats. The decision to defer the development program for a follow-on Air Force bomber is part of terminations, reductions, and savings in the proposed FY2010 budget. The Administration has decided not to pursue the development of a new long-range bomber due to the existing fleet's performance meeting expected threats. This decision will result in significant cost savings through 2013. The Department will use the additional time to better understand requirements and develop suitable technologies for a future bomber. The Administration's proposed FY2010 defense budget requested no funding for the development of a next-generation bomber. Instead, funding was allocated for an Air Force research and development line item focused on Automated Air-to-Air Refueling to support Next Generation Long Range Strike development strategies. The budget submission outlined concept refinement for a next-generation long-range strike capability and a phase two demonstration for Automated Aerial Refueling. The Air Force's FY2010 unfunded requirements list includes a classified $140 million item for continued work on a next-generation bomber. The Pentagon ordered research teams from Northrop Grumman and Boeing-Lockheed Martin to halt their work on the long-range bomber program. The Air Force's FY2010 unfunded requirements list includes a classified $140 million item for a next-generation bomber program. Contractors were told to halt their work on the program, which aimed to field a next-generation bomber by 2018. The 2006 QDR called for increasing long-range strike capabilities by 50% and the penetrating component by a factor of five by 2025, with 45% of the force being unmanned. The Department plans to develop a new land-based, penetrating long-range strike capability to be fielded by 2018 while modernizing the current bomber force. The B-52 force will be reduced to 56 aircraft to support global strike operations. The Air Force announced a three-phase study on implementing the decision on bombers, with phases focusing on modifications to the current fleet, development of the 2018 bomber, and examining bomber needs beyond 2025 and 2030. The 2006 QDR accelerated Air Force plans for a new bomber to enter service in 2018, aiming to replace the current bomber fleet with advanced technologies. The need for at least 96 next-generation bombers was discussed to replace existing nuclear-capable aircraft. The Air Force envisioned procuring about 100 new bombers, utilizing existing aircraft technologies due to time constraints for developing new ones. The 2018 target in-service date for a new bomber would not allow enough time for developing new technologies. The aircraft might be subsonic, stealthy, with a range of 2,000 to 3,000 miles and carry 28,000 to 40,000 pounds of armaments. Whether it would be manned or unmanned was undecided, but the initial version would likely need to be manned. Northrop and a team of Boeing and Lockheed were expected competitors for the program. Boeing and Northrop Grumman were competing for the Next Generation Bomber program. Secretary of the Air Force mentioned a decision on the design would be made in 2012-2014. Northrop Grumman received contracts for secret aircraft programs in 2008. A full-scale competition for the NGB was expected to start around 2010. Boeing and Lockheed Martin expressed readiness to build the Air Force's new bomber. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are prepared to build the Air Force's Next-Generation Bomber program, which was not included in Defense Secretary Robert Gates' budget proposal. They have the technology and capability to move forward with the project, while Northrop Grumman is also expected to compete. Analysts estimate the acquisition program could involve procuring 50 aircraft. The estimated cost of the next-generation bomber acquisition program, including 50 to 60 aircraft, is $30 billion to $40 billion. The program has received prior-year funding and additional classified funding. There is a parallel demonstration program with multibillion-dollar funding over the next five years. The next-generation bomber acquisition program has a demonstration program with 'multibillions of dollars' in funding over the next five years. Secretary of Defense Gates highlighted the threat posed by other nations developing disruptive means to counter American power, particularly China's investments in cyber, anti-satellite, anti-air, and anti-ship capabilities. This emphasizes the importance of America's ability to strike from afar, use missile defenses, and protect its bases and assets in the Pacific. The next-generation bomber program has significant funding over the next five years. Secretary Gates emphasizes the importance of America's ability to strike from afar, use missile defenses, and protect its assets in the Pacific. Senator Thune questioned Secretary Gates on his position regarding a next-generation bomber during a hearing on the proposed FY2010 defense budget. The next-generation bomber program, with significant funding over the next five years, is crucial for America's ability to project power and protect assets in the Pacific. Secretary Gates highlights the need for long-range systems like the next generation bomber to counter China's advancements in cyber and anti-satellite warfare. Secretary Gates emphasized the importance of shifting towards long-range systems like the next generation bomber to counter China's advancements in cyber and anti-satellite warfare. However, he later announced that the department would not pursue a development program for the follow-on Air Force bomber, citing a lack of analysis to make a firm decision. Secretary Gates highlighted the need for a next generation bomber to address evolving threats, especially from China. However, he decided not to proceed with the development program due to insufficient analysis and the risk of preconceived notions influencing the outcome. The decision will be informed by the quadrennial defense review, nuclear posture review, and arms control negotiations with Russia. Secretary Gates emphasized the importance of a next-generation bomber to counter emerging threats, particularly from China. He opted to delay the decision on the bomber's development to allow for further analysis through the quadrennial defense review and nuclear posture review. Senator Thune questioned the validity of the 2006 QDR's directive to field the follow-on bomber by 2018, prompting a reevaluation of the threat-based analysis. Secretary Gates highlighted the evolving need for a next-generation bomber to counter new threats, especially from China. He postponed the decision on the bomber's development for further evaluation during the quadrennial defense review and nuclear posture review. Senator Thune raised concerns about the 2006 QDR's directive to have the follow-on bomber ready by 2018, leading to a reassessment of the threat analysis. Gates mentioned the increased experience with unmanned aerial vehicles in recent years and the potential impact of arms reduction discussions with Russia on the need for a nuclear triad. Discussions with Russia may impact the decision on developing the next-generation bomber. Secretary Gates questions if the decision is driven by budget constraints or actual requirements. The termination of the program was not mandated by OMB. In a speech at an Air Force Association convention, Secretary Gates expressed concerns about countries like China focusing on cyber, anti-satellite, anti-air, and anti-ship warfare capabilities that could threaten America's ability to project power in the Pacific. This could degrade the effectiveness of short-range fighters and emphasize the importance of long-range strike capabilities. Secretary Gates is committed to ensuring the US has long-range strike capabilities, as seen in ongoing defense reviews. He aims to avoid the costly mistakes of past bomber programs, like the B-2, which resulted in a limited fleet. The focus is on developing a future bomber, the B-3, to prevent a national disaster in case of aircraft loss. The focus is on developing a future bomber, the B-3, to prevent a national disaster in case of aircraft loss. Air Force officials in 2009 have expressed support for starting an NGB program following defense reviews. The Air Force Chief of Staff outlined his wish list for the Pentagon's fiscal year 2010 budget, including modernizing existing fighters, accelerating F-35 production, funding for a new long-range strike capability, and more automation technology in unmanned aerial systems. Schwartz's priorities for the Pentagon's FY-10 budget include securing funding for a new long-range strike capability, particularly after cuts to the Air Force's next-generation Bomber program. He emphasizes the need for the armed forces to own a properly defined long-range strike capability, likely a bomber, and aims to ensure the Secretary of Defense is comfortable with the proposed parameters. Schwartz is determined to address any concerns to guarantee support for a platform capable of threatening any target. Gates aims to ensure a new long-range strike capability is funded, particularly after cuts to the Air Force's next-generation Bomber program. The B-52H bombers are expected to remain in service until at least 2040, but the Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) may be decommissioned by 2018. The B-52H bombers are expected to remain in service until at least 2040, but the Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) may be decommissioned by 2018. The ALCM fleet has undergone a Service Life Extension Program to allow retention until at least 2020 with the possibility to extend to 2030. The Defense Department is reexamining the long-range strike mission and exploring technological and conceptual opportunities. A new Air Force long-range strike platform is being considered, which will serve as both a bomber and reconnaissance platform. Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expected to receive a report on this in the early fall. The Air Force is considering a new long-range strike platform that can serve as both a bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. The existing bomber fleet includes 20 B-2 stealth bombers, 66 B-1B bombers, and 94 B-52H bombers. The B-2 can function as both a conventional and nuclear bomber, with a total of 21 in service after a crash in 2008. The B-1B bomber, with 66 remaining in service, was designed for low-altitude supersonic bombing and has reduced vulnerability compared to the B-52. The Air Force focused on upgrading the B-1B for conventional missions through the Conventional Mission Upgrade Program (CMUP). The B-52 bomber, with the longest unrefueled loiter time and a wide array of conventional and nuclear munitions, had its service life extended in 2007 to remain in service until 2040. Close management of spare parts availability may be necessary due to potential disappearance of parts manufacturers. The B-52 bomber's role as a standoff weapons carrier and its need for modernization to remain effective in low-threat areas are highlighted. The bomber force, historically associated with strategic nuclear deterrence, also participated in conventional combat operations during the Cold War. In the post-Cold War era, the bomber force maintains its strategic nuclear mission but may not be survivable in higher-threat environments by 2015-2020. The bomber force retains its strategic nuclear mission but has become more involved in conventional combat operations. Upgrades have improved their ability to participate in such operations, and the development of precision-guided munitions allows for more effective strikes. In recent operations, B-2s and B-1s have been successful in engaging targets, with bombers accounting for a significant portion of bomb tonnage dropped. Bombers have become more involved in conventional combat operations, with upgrades improving their ability to participate. In recent operations, bombers dropped 76% of the bomb tonnage, including attacks in Afghanistan with coordinates provided by U.S. special forces on horseback. Recommendations on bomber numbers and types post-Cold War have been summarized in studies, with prior-year legislative activity requiring a study on bomber force requirements. The FY1995 defense authorization act allocated $125 million for an Enhanced Bomber Capability Fund and prohibited the retirement of certain strategic nuclear delivery systems. The FY1996 defense authorization act also restricted funding for retiring or dismantling these systems, including B-52Hs. Additionally, the FY1998 defense authorization act further prohibited the retirement or dismantling of strategic nuclear delivery systems. The FY2000 defense authorization act amended previous acts to prohibit the retirement or dismantling of certain strategic nuclear delivery systems, including B-52H bomber aircraft, unless specific conditions were met. The FY2007 defense authorization act further restricted the retirement of B-52s, requiring the maintenance of 44 combat-coded B-52s until a specified date or the introduction of a replacement aircraft. The FY2007 defense authorization act amended previous acts to require the maintenance of 44 combat-coded B-52s until a specified date or the introduction of a replacement aircraft. The FY2008 defense authorization act further amended this, setting a primary aircraft inventory of not less than 63 B-52s, a backup inventory of not less than 11, and an attrition reserve inventory of not less than two aircraft. In FY2007, the defense authorization act allowed for four B-52s for ground maintenance training. Congress is debating funding for a next-generation bomber program in FY2010 and potential legislation on bomber force structure. Factors to consider include bomber roles in nuclear deterrence, conflicts, and warfare, cost-effectiveness, timing of the new bomber program, and impact on industrial base. The future roles and missions of bombers, including discussions on the required number of F-22 fighters, are part of the 2010 QDR and Nuclear Posture Review. The emerging U.S. military strategy focuses on preparing for conflicts similar to Iraq and Afghanistan while also being able to combat a major regional peer competitor. This contrasts with previous defense-planning standards established in the 1990s. In the early 1990s, after the Cold War, the U.S. aimed to be prepared for two major regional conflicts. Analysts suggest adjusting funding for aircraft acquisition to operate effectively against anti-access systems. Arms control negotiations with Russia could lead to a reduction in required bombers for strategic nuclear deterrence missions. The number of bombers needed for conventional operations and irregular warfare may exceed those needed for strategic nuclear deterrence. Design of bombers and counting rules in arms control agreements are important factors. The current bomber force's ability to perform future roles and missions cost-effectively will be influenced by these factors. The feasibility and cost effectiveness of modernizing current bombers and extending their service lives, including air-launched cruise missiles, will impact the overall cost effectiveness of keeping B-52s in service until 2040. The Air Force has undergone a Service Life Extension Program for the ALCM inventory, potentially extending its service life to 2030. The question remains on whether it is more cost-effective to keep the B-52s in service or build a new bomber before 2040. Advocates of deferring the start of a next-generation bomber program argue that it could allow for the design of an unmanned platform, potentially reducing procurement costs. Opponents suggest designing the bomber to be either manned or unmanned based on future needs, with the option to modify it later. The next-generation bomber program could be designed as a manned aircraft initially and later modified to operate as either manned or unmanned. Secretary of the Air Force Donley highlighted key areas needing attention in the bomber design and construction industrial base, especially with proposed program terminations in the fiscal 2010 budget request. The focus is on long-range strike capabilities, secure satellite communications, and bolstering the workforce for the next-generation long-range bomber. The aerospace and defense industry requires substantial financial resources to sustain production and engineering capabilities. Retaining minimum technical capabilities in advanced military aircraft design is crucial for long-term viability. Interruptions in design and development activities can have serious consequences on technical capabilities. The aerospace and defense industry faces challenges in maintaining technical capabilities due to interruptions in production and design activities. Reconstituting lost capabilities could take years and significant resources. The decline in critical capacities, such as rotorcraft and long-range bomber design, has been observed. Regenerating industrial capability is possible but requires time and expenditure. DoD should consider these costs when making strategic decisions. Re-establishing a long-range strike capability will require substantial effort and resources due to past program decisions. The history of Air Force bomber production over the last several decades highlights the challenges in maintaining technical capabilities in the aerospace and defense industry. The production pattern for U.S. bombers has been inconsistent, with interruptions and cancellations affecting the industrial base perspective. Considerable time and expenditure are needed to regenerate lost capabilities, and DoD should factor in these costs when making strategic posture decisions. The history of Air Force bomber production in the last few decades shows challenges in maintaining technical capabilities in the aerospace and defense industry. The production pattern has been inconsistent, with interruptions and cancellations affecting the industrial base. Regenerating lost capabilities will require substantial effort and resources. The last B-2 stealth bomber was delivered in the mid-1990s, and no new bomber designs have been in production since then, impacting the long-range strike capability. Irregular Warfare LRS platforms have been used extensively in irregular warfare, showcasing their weapons flexibility and long loiter times. The use of long-range aircraft in irregular warfare depends on the target set and the need for long-endurance assets with multiple payloads. Neglecting the design and production of long-range strike (LRS) systems would result in a loss of U.S. capability. Companies may now be less willing to absorb losses for extended periods as seen in the past with the B-1B program. The current focus includes using LRS in irregular warfare and supporting near-peer contingencies, especially in penetrating sophisticated hostile air defense environments. The need for sophisticated long-range strike (LRS) platforms is crucial in penetrating advanced hostile air defense systems. These systems are increasingly mobile and could be deployed by near-peer states to protect targets in various territories. Designing LRS systems for near-peer conflicts also requires consideration of nuclear capabilities. However, the gap in LRS design and development capabilities since the end of the B-2 program has left the industry ill-prepared to meet these demands. The delay in the long-range strike program will impact industrial base capabilities. The need for new LRS systems is crucial due to the age and low numbers of current platforms. Power projection scenarios require a greater number of aircraft for sustained presence over target areas. The need for new long-range strike systems is essential due to the aging current platforms and low numbers of newer ones. Maintaining LRS capability over the long term, especially for power projection, requires the cultivation of military airframe design and manufacturing expertise, as well as advancements in technologies like stealth and avionics. Additionally, addressing technical issues related to electronic warfare and weapon integration is crucial. Industry must be prepared to expand once a policy decision is made to \"ramp up\" the program. To successfully develop a long-range strike program, industry must expand engineering and production teams as designs progress. This will require a decade-long commitment of time, assets, and fiscal resources. Only a few aerospace contractors are capable of being prime contractors for such a program. Corporate capital investments in long-range strike would be difficult to justify without a clear government-backed policy commitment. The program will take a decade or more to complete. The Air Force's research and development account includes a line item for the development of a next-generation bomber, but funding for this program has not been requested for FY2010-FY2015. The House Armed Services Committee recommends no funding for the next-generation bomber in FY2010, but suggests additional funding for \"Other Programs\" in the Air Force research and development account. The House Armed Services Committee included $215 million for classified Air Force R&D in the fiscal 2010 defense authorization bill, which is believed to contain the next-generation bomber project. Rep. Neil Abercrombie stated that the House is focused on the advanced technology associated with the bomber. The House Armed Services Committee allocated $215 million for classified Air Force R&D in the fiscal 2010 defense authorization bill, including funding for the next-generation bomber project. Rep. Neil Abercrombie mentioned the House's interest in advanced technology for the new bomber, with a focus on increased stealth capabilities. Section 1032 of H.R. 2647 requires the Secretary of Defense to report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, specifically regarding bomber force structure decisions. The Senate-reported FY2010 defense authorization bill does not recommend funding for the development of a next-generation bomber, but includes detailed line-item funding tables. Division D of the bill also recommends $140 million in additional funding for classified Air Force R&D, with a focus on increased stealth capabilities for the new bomber. Section 1032 of H.R. 2647 requires the Secretary of Defense to report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, specifically regarding bomber force structure decisions. The Senate-reported FY2010 defense authorization bill does not recommend funding for a next-generation bomber. However, Section 124 of S. 1390 outlines findings supporting the development of next-generation bomber aircraft technologies to maintain long-range strike capabilities. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review identified the need for a next generation bomber aircraft to maintain long-range strike capabilities. However, in 2009, Secretary Gates announced a delay in pursuing a follow-on Air Force bomber program until further assessment of the need, requirement, and technology. President Barack Obama terminated the next generation bomber aircraft program in 2009 due to the lack of urgent need and affordability concerns. The United States will require a new long-range strike capability for future conflicts with heavily defended airspace. General Michael Maples highlighted Russia's development of advanced air defense systems during a Senate hearing in 2009. The United States terminated the next generation bomber aircraft program in 2009 due to affordability concerns. Russia is the main developer of advanced air defense systems and exports them to China and other countries. The need for a new long-range strike capability in heavily defended airspace was emphasized during a Senate hearing in 2009. General James Cartwright, Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, highlighted the urgent need for a new bomber aircraft in 2009. Currently, the US only has 16 combat-ready B-2 bombers capable of missions over 1,000 nautical miles into enemy territory. The crash of a B-2 bomber in 2008 underscored the importance of modernizing the bomber fleet. The urgent need for a new bomber aircraft was highlighted in 2009 by General James Cartwright, Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The primary mission requirement of the next generation bomber aircraft is the ability to strike targets globally with various weapons. The technologies needed for the development of the next generation bomber aircraft already exist in fifth-generation fighter aircraft. The United States policy supports the development program for next generation bomber aircraft technologies, despite Secretary Gates' announcement to delay the program for further evaluation. The United States Strategic Command, Pacific Command, and Joint Forces Command commanders testified that a next-generation bomber is necessary for future capabilities. Discussion on the bomber will be part of the Quadrennial Defense Review and Nuclear Posture Review, informing the 2011 budget deliberations. Senator John Thune's additional views on Section 124 are based on S. 1044. The conference report on H.R. 2647 authorizes no FY2010 funding for the Air Force research and development line item for the bomber. The report authorizes $182 million in additional funding for a line item in the Air Force research and development account, with $172.5 million designated for \"Program Increase.\" It is unclear if any of this funding is related to a next-generation bomber. Section 255 of H.R. 2647 supports the development of next-generation bomber aircraft technologies. Congress acknowledges the critical need for long-range strike capabilities, including a next-generation bomber aircraft to maintain dominance and deter potential adversaries. This new aircraft is intended to provide quick response to contingencies, operate beyond enemy anti-access capabilities, and impose significant defensive costs on adversaries. The United States will not pursue a development program for a follow-on Air Force bomber until there is a better understanding of the need, requirement, and technology. President Obama terminated the next generation bomber aircraft program due to lack of urgency and affordability. A new long-range strike capability is needed for future conflicts with heavily defended airspace. Michael Maples, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, highlighted Russia's role in developing and exporting advanced air defense systems to China and other countries. The Congressional Commission's Final Report emphasized the value of bomber forces in extending deterrence and imposing a cost burden on potential adversaries. Commanders of various US military commands have testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Joint Forces Command and the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified in support of the need for a new bomber aircraft due to the aging bomber inventory. The current B-2 bomber aircraft is the only platform capable of executing missions over 1,000 nautical miles into enemy territory. The crash of a B-2 bomber in Guam in 2008 highlighted the risk of attrition even in peacetime. The next generation bomber must have the capability to strike targets globally with various weapons. Existing technologies from fifth-generation fighters can be used for development. The US policy supports the development of next generation bomber aircraft technologies. The House report on H.R. 2647 includes language on the factors informing decisions about bomber force structure. The House Appropriations Committee released an explanatory statement on H.R. 3326, which was passed into law as P.L. 111-118 on December 19, 2009. The explanatory statement for H.R. 3326 shows a $24.1 million increase for classified Air Force research and development programs, with an additional $160.0 million allocated to a specific line item. The House Appropriations Committee recommends no FY2010 funding for a next-generation bomber but suggests a net $193.4 million increase for classified programs in the Air Force research and development account. The FY2010 funding request for \"Classified Programs\" was $11.96 billion, with $215 million allocated for a classified program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for a next-generation bomber but suggested a net $109.8 million increase for \"Other Programs,\" including $140 million for a classified program. The FY2010 funding request for \"Classified Programs\" was $11.96 billion, with $215 million allocated for a classified program. S. 1044 introduced on May 14, 2009, aims to develop the next-generation bomber without delays caused by defense reviews or arms negotiations. The Air Force's existing fleet of B-2, B-1B, and B-52H bombers includes the B-2 Spirit Advanced Technology Bomber, which is the world's only long-range, low observable bomber capable of delivering 80 independently targeted GBU-38s. B-2 availability has increased due to maintenance enhancements like the Alternate High Frequency Material program. The B-2 Spirit bomber is undergoing upgrades through the Extremely High Frequency Satellite Communications and Computer Upgrade program. This program includes three increments aimed at enhancing avionics capabilities, such as flight management computers, secure communications, and integration into the Global Information Grid. Increment 1 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development and is scheduled for fleet installation starting in FY13. Additionally, radar antenna replacements and avionics upgrades are part of the ongoing improvements to the B-2. The Radar Modernization Program (RMP) is replacing the radar antenna and upgrading radar avionics on the B-2 Spirit bomber. The LRIP contract for the first six production radar kits was signed in December 2008, with the remaining seven shipsets to follow. Congressional support has helped modify the acquisition strategy to include life-of-type component buys and advance procurement to avoid production delays. The B-2 Radar Modernization Program (RMP) aims to recover lost schedule time from integration issues. A March 2009 GAO report assesses the RMP and the B-2 Advanced EHF SATCOM program. The B-2 bomber is a multi-role aircraft with stealth capabilities for effective penetration of defenses. The B-2 bomber's low-observable characteristics allow it to penetrate enemy defenses and threaten high-value targets effectively. Its blend of stealth technology, aerodynamic efficiency, and large payload gives it advantages over other bombers. With a range of approximately 6,000 nautical miles, the B-2's reduced signatures make it hard for defensive systems to detect, track, and engage. The B-2 bomber's low-observable characteristics make it difficult for defensive systems to detect, track, and engage. Its composite materials, special coatings, and flying-wing design contribute to its stealthiness. The B-2 has a crew of two pilots and the first aircraft was publicly displayed in 1988. Whiteman AFB in Missouri is the only operational base for the B-2. The B-2 bomber, based in Missouri, has proven its combat effectiveness in various operations. It completed missions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, releasing over 1.5 million pounds of munitions. Its stealth design and capabilities led to full operational capability in 2003. The B-2 bomber, based in Missouri, has proven its combat effectiveness in various operations, completing missions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Its stealth design and capabilities led to full operational capability in December 2003. The prime contractor is Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems Sector, with key members including Boeing Military Airplanes Co., Hughes Radar Systems Group, General Electric Aircraft Engine Group, and Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc. Key characteristics include a wingspan of 172 feet, length of 69 feet, height of 17 feet, weight of 160,000 pounds, maximum takeoff weight of 336,500 pounds, fuel capacity of 167,000 pounds, and payload of 40,000 pounds. Powered by four General Electric F118-GE-100 engines with a thrust of 17,300 pounds each, the B-2 bomber operates at high subsonic speeds. The B-1B Bomber has a payload of 40,000 pounds, high subsonic speed, intercontinental range, and can carry conventional or nuclear weapons. It has a ceiling of 50,000 feet and a crew of two pilots. The unit cost is approximately $1.157 billion. The Air Force testified in May 2009 that the B-1 provides massive firepower potential and significant loiter capability, with unique supersonic dash potential. The B-1's capabilities have been modernized for current conventional lethality. The B-1B Bomber's capabilities have been modernized for current conventional lethality, exemplified by adding an Advanced Targeting Pod. In 2007, a fast-track development and procurement timeline was initiated to deploy Sniper-equipped B-1 bombers to support OEF and OIF operations. The program continues in 2009 to outfit the remaining fleet with laser-guided weapons and integrate pod data directly into the avionics system for machine-to-machine transfer of targeting data. The B-1 Bomber's capabilities have been enhanced with the addition of the Sniper pod, making it more in demand for operational tasks. The Air Force is addressing issues to prevent potential aircraft grounding, including a cockpit and communications modernization program called the B-1 Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) program, which upgrades the cockpit with color multifunction displays and advanced data link capabilities. The B-1B bomber's capabilities have been enhanced with the addition of the Sniper pod, making it more in demand for operational tasks. The B-1 FIDL program is progressing with Air Force and Congressional support, evolving the bomber into a networked provider of precision firepower. The B-1 can deliver a large payload of guided and unguided weapons rapidly against any adversary worldwide. The B-1B bomber's features include a blended wing/body configuration, variable-geometry wings, and turbofan afterburning engines for long range, maneuverability, and high speed. It has forward and aft wing settings for different flight scenarios, making it highly maneuverable in various altitudes. With its substantial payload, radar targeting system, and survivability, the B-1B is a key element in joint/composite strike forces, capable of creating far-reaching effects on the battlefield. The B-1B bomber is a versatile weapon system with advanced avionics for tracking and engaging moving targets with precision. It has a Global Positioning System for autonomous navigation and Combat Track II radios for secure connectivity. This allows aircrews to receive targeting data and strike emerging targets rapidly in time-sensitive environments. The B-1B bomber's offensive avionics system is updated to strike emerging targets efficiently, demonstrated in operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Its self-protection electronic jamming equipment, radar warning receiver, and countermeasures system support penetration of hostile airspace. The electronic countermeasures system detects adversary threats and applies jamming techniques, while chaff and flares are used against radar and infrared systems. The Conventional Mission Upgrade Program has enhanced B-1 capabilities, allowing it to carry up to 30 cluster munitions. The B-1B bomber's offensive avionics system has been updated to strike emerging targets efficiently, with improved lethality and survivability. The Conventional Mission Upgrade Program has enhanced B-1 capabilities, allowing it to carry a variety of advanced guided precision and non-precision weapons. The B-1B bomber's avionics system has been updated to carry extended range JASSM and Link-16 for future integrated battlefield operations. Radar and cockpit modifications increase reliability, situational awareness, and information flow. The B-1A was developed in the 1970s as a replacement for the B-52 but was canceled in 1977. The B-1B bomber, an improved variant initiated in 1981, underwent major changes to increase payload, improve radar, and reduce radar cross section. The first production B-1 flew in 1984, with the first B-1B delivered in 1985. It achieved initial operational capability in 1986 and holds numerous world records. The most recent records were made official in 2004. The B-1B bomber, first used in combat in 1998, played a significant role in various operations, including Operation Allied Force and Operation Enduring Freedom. It dropped a large percentage of total ordnance and maintained a high mission capable rate. The bomber is a long-range, multi-role, heavy bomber with four General Electric F101-GE-102 turbofan engines.

The B-52 bomber is a crucial part of the U.S. strategic bomber force, capable of dropping a wide array of weapons including gravity bombs, cluster bombs, precision guided missiles, and JDAMs. It has been updated with modern technology to deliver Joint developed weapons and remains an important element of the nation's defenses. The Air Force has invested in modernization programs to keep the B-52 operationally relevant by adding advanced targeting pods, smart weapons integration, and communication upgrades. Together with the B-1 and B-2 bombers, the B-52 serves as a key component of the United States' long-range bomber force. The B-52 bomber is a long-range, heavy bomber that has served in various conflicts and continues to provide continuous bomber presence in the Pacific. It can carry nuclear or precision guided conventional ordnance with worldwide precision navigation capability. The bomber is capable of strategic attack, air interdiction, offensive counter-air, and maritime missions. During Desert Storm, B-52s delivered 40 percent of all coalition forces' weapons. It is effective for ocean surveillance, anti-ship, and mine-laying operations. Equipped with advanced viewing systems and night vision goggles for enhanced combat ability and safety during night operations. The B-52 bomber's capabilities include terrain clearance, radar avoidance, and night vision for covert operations. Modifications since 1989 include GPS, heavy stores adapter beams, and advanced weapons. Aerial refueling gives the B-52 an unlimited range, demonstrated in missions like Operation Desert Storm and Allied Force. In Desert Storm, B-52s played a crucial role in striking enemy targets and boosting coalition morale. The B-52 bomber, a key element of the US strategic bomber force, has been in service for over 40 years and is capable of delivering a wide range of weapons. With modern technology upgrades, it will remain operational beyond 2040. During Operation Allied Force, B-52s used conventional cruise missiles and bombs to target Serbian army positions. The B-52 bomber, first flown in 1954, has a life span extending beyond 2040. The B-52H model, the only one still in service, can carry up to 20 air-launched cruise missiles and conventional cruise missiles used in various operations. General characteristics include a wingspan of 185 feet, length of 159 feet, and a height of 40 feet. The B-52 bomber has a wingspan of 185 feet, length of 159 feet, and a height of 40 feet. It weighs approximately 185,000 pounds and has a maximum takeoff weight of 488,000 pounds. The bomber has a speed of 650 miles per hour, a range of 8,800 miles, and a ceiling of 50,000 feet. It can carry approximately 70,000 pounds of mixed ordnance and has a crew of five. The unit cost is $53.4 million and the initial operating capability was in April 1952. The 1992 U.S. Air Force Bomber Roadmap aimed to transition the bomber fleet to focus more on conventional missions post-Cold War. The roadmap included upgrades for conventional weapons delivery, a new concept of operations, and training shifts. It proposed a bomber force of 95 B-52Hs, 96 B-1Bs, and 20 B-2s to meet future requirements. The 1993 Bottom-Up Review (BUR) called for a U.S. military force structure to handle two major regional conflicts, with a focus on upgrading the bomber fleet to carry advanced conventional munitions. Concerns were raised over the reduction in bomber numbers, with the need for about 180 operational bombers to address potential conflicts. The 1994 Nuclear Posture Review endorsed the decision to reorient the B-1B to a conventional-only role, calling for a force of 66 B-52s and no more than 20 B-2s to support the nuclear mission. The 1995 DOD Heavy Bomber Force Study was a classified study initiated by congressional direction. The 1995 DOD Heavy Bomber Force Study, presented by Under Secretary of Defense Paul Kaminski, concluded that the planned bomber force of 181 aircraft was sufficient for two major regional contingencies. It recommended procuring advanced guided munitions over 20 additional B-2s, and highlighted the cost-effectiveness of B-1 conventional upgrades. The study emphasized the importance of shorter-range tactical aircraft in the overall force composition. The 1996 GAO report disagreed with the DOD's requirement for 181 bombers, suggesting a reduction or elimination of the B-1 fleet. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review recommended sustaining the bomber fleet at 187 aircraft, including B-52Hs, B-2s, and B-1Bs, stating that additional B-2s would not be cost-effective. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review deemed it not cost-effective to procure more B-2 bombers despite criticism from a congressionally mandated review led by Brent Scowcroft. Scowcroft's study emphasized the importance of long-range air power in the evolving security landscape and called for funding at least one additional B-2 squadron. The 1999 USAF White Paper on Long-Range Bombers recommended funding at least one additional B-2 squadron of nine aircraft. The study also adjusted aircraft requirements, with 76 B-52s, 93 B-1s, and 21 B-2s needed for operational taskings. A new bomber reaching Initial Operational Capability by 2037 was endorsed, and the 2001 QDR called for 112 \"combat-coded\" bomber aircraft. The 2001 white paper on Long-Range Strike proposed a reduction in combat-coded bombers, with plans to retire 33 B-1s and 17 B-52s by the end of 2002. This would result in a total bomber force of 157 aircraft, with 76 B-52s, 60 B-1s, and 21 B-2s. The Air Force aimed to invest savings from retiring B-1s into upgrading existing bombers, stating it is more cost-effective than procuring new aircraft. The paper also highlighted changes in operational and force-structure that could impact bomber service lives. The 2002 Nuclear Posture Review called for a force of 76 B-52s and 21 B-2s for nuclear missions, supporting Air Force plans for a new bomber in the 2040 timeframe. It also mentioned the possibility of needing additional or improved bomber capabilities sooner than expected."
