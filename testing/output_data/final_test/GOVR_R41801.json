    "content": "The development of the \"higher civil service\" in the United States in the mid-20th century led to the creation of supergrades, civil servants in high-level agency positions holding GS-16, GS-17, and GS-18 positions. Congress established the GS scale in 1949, limiting supergrade positions to 400 individuals with salaries comparable to political executives. These specialized positions were later converted into the Senior Executive Service under the Civil Service Reform Act to centralize high-level managerial roles. The creation of the Senior Executive Service (SES) aimed to centralize high-level managerial roles in the government for flexibility and efficiency. Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson also proposed reforms to the executive levels of the civil service prior to the establishment of the SES. President Nixon asked the Civil Service Commission to study and recommend improvements to the federal executive personnel system. The commission suggested enhancing management capabilities, recruiting talented individuals, centralizing resources, and providing executive training. Nixon proposed the establishment of the Federal Executive Service in 1971, incorporating these recommendations. Scholars have noted the political context of Nixon's presidency and a controversial provision related to the Federal Executive Service. President Nixon proposed the Federal Executive Service in 1971 to improve the federal executive personnel system. Congress did not pass Nixon's FES bill due to the political landscape and controversial provisions. President Carter, known for his \"Washington outsider\" status, criticized the federal bureaucracy as \"wasteful\" and \"disorganized.\" He created the Federal Personnel Management Project to address these issues, led by key government officials. The Management Project, led by Sally Greenberg, identified critical problems in the federal executive personnel system, including lack of control over executive cadre numbers, mismatch between authorized positions and current needs, hiring authorities with different standards, and placement of inexperienced managers in key positions. The federal executive personnel system faces challenges such as inexperienced managers placed in key positions, limited career advancement opportunities, and difficulties in reassigning executives during political transitions. The federal executive personnel system faces challenges such as inexperienced managers in key positions, limited career advancement opportunities, and inefficient processes for filling executive positions. The report highlighted issues with compensation, lack of incentives for career managers, and the exclusion of minorities and women from top management roles. The task force recommended establishing a new executive personnel system to address challenges in staffing and managing senior managerial positions. The Senior Executive Service (SES) aimed to strengthen the link between civil service and politically appointed agency heads, creating a smoother interface between career civil servants and political appointees. The Senior Executive Service (SES) was created to improve relations between career civil servants and political appointees by providing a shared resource and consistent leadership across administrations. It aimed to bridge the gap between technical programmatic details and executive skills in running agencies, easing the transition for new Presidents and their appointees. The Senior Executive Service (SES) was established to offer consistent leadership during presidential transitions, aiming to prevent gaps in direction for civil servants. It was intended to provide flexible and responsive managers to ensure smooth agency operations under new leadership, easing uncertainty during transitions. President Carter's reform of the civil service, including the creation of the SES, was seen as a response to past management failures. President Carter's civil service reform, including the creation of the Senior Executive Service, aimed to increase program effectiveness and public confidence in federal administration. This reform was a response to past management failures, with a focus on the importance of senior managers in program success. The Senior Executive Service (SES) was launched in July 1979 with the goal of providing managerial expertise to agency leadership. It aimed to limit politicization by placing a 10% government-wide limit on political appointments to SES positions. The SES comprised primarily career positions and was designed to be insulated from political influence. The Senior Executive Service (SES) was established to provide consistent leadership across administrations and limit political influence. SES positions are divided into career reserved and general categories, with half in each. Career reserved positions must be filled by career employees and certain positions, such as audits and law enforcement, must be free from political influence for public confidence. The Senior Executive Service (SES) has career reserved and general positions, with career appointees filling most SES roles. Career appointees handle various tasks like program administration and legal counsel. Approval from OPM is needed to convert positions between career reserved and general categories. Table 1 shows the current distribution of senior executives by appointment type. The Senior Executive Service (SES) has career reserved and general positions, with career appointees filling most roles. Career appointments are made through a competitive process, while noncareer appointees do not require a competitive staffing process. Approval from OPM and the SES Qualifications Review Board is needed for career appointees, while noncareer appointees must have their qualifications certified by the hiring agency head. Noncareer appointees may serve in general positions such as chiefs of staff or senior advisers within Cabinet departments. Limited term appointees may serve as chiefs of staff or senior advisers within Cabinet departments or head specific projects for a specified period of time, such as in regional offices of agencies like the EPA and GSA. These appointments are used for temporary positions, lasting up to three years or 18 months for emergencies, and are not renewable. For example, after Hurricane Katrina, limited term appointees were appointed in DHS for roles like Chief Finance Director for Gulf Coast Recovery. The Civil Service Reform Act replaced the Civil Service Commission with the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB) and OPM. OPM is responsible for employee training, examinations, pay, and benefits administration, while MSPB protects employee rights. OPM creates and distributes SES positions to agencies. Limited appointments for SES positions are capped at 5% government-wide, with agencies allocated up to 3% and requiring OPM approval for additional positions. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for creating and distributing Senior Executive Service (SES) positions to agencies. SES positions are filled using merit staffing procedures, with candidates recruited through USAJOBS. The Executive Resources Board (ERB) within each agency reviews qualifications of top-ranked candidates for SES positions. The Executive Resources Board (ERB) reviews top-ranked candidates for SES positions and makes recommendations to the selecting authority. The agency certifies technical qualifications, then OPM's SES Qualifications Review Board (QRB) assesses executive core qualifications (ECQs) like Leading Change and Building Coalitions. Candidates must demonstrate all ECQs to be certified by the QRB before being appointed to the SES. Individuals interested in joining the SES can participate in a Candidate Development Program (CDP) for training based on Executive Core Qualifications. Graduates of the CDP may apply for QRB certification and appointment to the SES without further competition. However, appointment is not guaranteed, and career appointees serve a one-year probationary period. The SES allows for removal of executives for unsatisfactory performance after probation. The CSRA encourages skill improvement through diverse agency placements. SES aims for a mobile workforce to tackle government challenges. The SES aims for a mobile workforce to tackle government challenges by providing learning opportunities and fresh perspectives through diverse agency placements. The new system attaches rank to individuals for greater flexibility in reassignment. Changes to the pay structure include incentive-based rewards for good performance. The pay system for senior executives changed dramatically in 2004 due to pay compression and the President's Management Agenda. The original SES pay system had six levels of basic pay, tied to the GS and EX scales. Increases in pay were determined by the President concurrent with annual adjustments to the GS pay scale. The pay system for senior executives changed in 2004 due to pay compression and the President's Management Agenda. Up to 50% of senior executives could receive annual cash performance bonuses linked to performance reviews, worth up to 20% of basic pay. Salary compression became an issue as the SES pay scale floor increased with GS-15 levels, causing differences in pay levels to decrease and top levels to receive the same salary. In 2001, President George W. Bush introduced the President's Management Agenda (PMA) to improve government performance. The PMA addressed pay compression issues for senior executives, including SES members consistently rated highly on performance appraisals. Changes in 2002 under the Homeland Security Act increased the cap on total compensation for senior executives to the Vice President's salary. President Bush proposed changes to the pay structure for senior executives in his FY2004 budget request, aiming to provide more financial incentives by increasing the pay ceiling and eliminating the six-level pay structure. Congress passed provisions in the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act to modify the SES pay system, including eliminating locality pay, replacing pay levels with a single range, increasing the cap on basic pay, and adding a higher cap for agencies with OPM-certified performance appraisals. The pay-for-performance system for senior executives encourages OPM-certified performance appraisals, with a cap on basic pay at $179,700. The new system aims to create stronger performance incentives by promoting meaningful distinctions in performance ratings. Locality pay for senior executives has been eliminated to foster greater performance incentives. Senior executives do not receive automatic pay increases but can receive pay adjustments based on performance. Performance awards ranging from 5% to 20% of basic pay are available for career executives with good ratings. Incentive awards are also given for suggestions or inventions that benefit the government. A select group of career senior executives receive Presidential Rank Awards, with two categories: Distinguished Rank awarding 35% of basic pay. Presidential Rank Awards have two categories: Distinguished Rank awards 35% of annual basic pay, and Meritorious Rank awards 20% of annual basic pay. Critics argue for SES reform to improve government program efficiency and workforce management. A report by the Partnership for Public Service and Booz Allen Hamilton found that the SES has not met its original vision. The original vision of the Senior Executive Service (SES) has not been realized and is inadequate for today's needs. Decentralized talent development, passive recruiting, lengthy hiring processes, inadequate leadership training, and pay disparities hinder the creation of a high-caliber executive organization. The Senior Executive Association (SEA) has called for reforms, with President Carol Bonosaro advocating for changes before the House Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Management. In March 2009, President Carol Bonosaro proposed reforms for the Department of Homeland Security and government-wide, including restoring career leadership, creating a fair pay system, and providing training for Senior Executives. Advocates for changes to the SES system identified areas needing reform such as pay compression, recruiting, career development, mobility, diversity, and the role of OPM. The 2004 reforms to SES pay eliminated locality pay to provide stronger performance incentives, but created a system where GS-14s and GS-15s may have little incentive to move to the SES. Current basic pay for SES members starts at 120% of GS-15 step 1 pay, but GS-15s in Washington, DC, already earn more with locality pay. This could impact senior executives in agencies. Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association, highlighted in 2009 that senior executives in federal agencies may have employees earning more than them. She mentioned that pay overlap, along with added responsibilities and lower retirement benefits, could deter individuals from joining the SES. Performance bonuses for SES members do not contribute to retirement annuities, which could be a further disincentive. Awards counting towards an executive's \"high-three\" in the SES could make it a more attractive career goal for federal workers. Senior executives have identified a disconnect between performance ratings and pay adjustments, with many believing changes in pay are based on administrative decisions rather than actual performance. Critics also note that SES pay is low compared to equivalent private sector jobs, leading to a high opportunity cost for SES members considering a switch to senior management positions in the private sector. The Senior Executive Service (SES) faces challenges in attracting highly qualified candidates due to lower salaries compared to the private sector and the lack of locality pay. Recruiting and retaining individuals for SES positions, especially outside of Washington, DC, where most SES jobs are located, is essential for its effectiveness. Observers have noted issues with the SES recruiting process, indicating room for improvement. The government tends to be passive in recruiting senior executives, often filling SES positions from within without considering a broader pool of applicants. Agencies could benefit from developing GS-14s and GS-15s for SES positions to improve recruiting efforts. Advocates suggest paying more attention to the talent pipeline within the government to identify qualified individuals for senior executive roles. Federal agencies may have a Candidate Development Program (CDP) for senior executives, but these programs have not always led to SES appointments. Technical expertise is often favored over leadership ability, leading to a bias in selection. The SES historically consisted of specialists lacking leadership training, hindering the development of effective government leaders. The government requires specific training and skills for SES members, who were originally specialists but became generalist executives in 1979. Agencies tend to prioritize technical skills over leadership and management skills when hiring for SES positions, which may not align with the original vision of the SES. Technical experts may lack the executive skills needed to strategically advance programs. Retention of talented government employees, especially in the Senior Executive Service (SES), is crucial for the smooth operation of the public sector. The SES has struggled with retaining individuals, with a turnover rate of almost 10% annually in its early years. The attrition of senior executives can lead to the loss of knowledge and skills, a decline in organizational loyalty, and vacancies that take time to fill. Hiring technical experts over generalists with leadership skills may be easier due to the identifiable technical skills, but it can overlook the importance of leadership capabilities in the long term. The retention of senior executives in the government, particularly in the Senior Executive Service (SES), has been a challenge for decades. While low pay has been cited as a reason for turnover, a recent study found that pay is not a major factor. Instead, the lack of effective onboard training for new senior executives may play a role in retention efforts. Successful onboard training could help expedite the transition period for new executives. The need for effective onboarding programs for new senior executives, especially those from outside government, has been highlighted as crucial for improving retention, performance, and engagement. A report suggested that the government could benefit from enhancing its onboarding programs to emphasize the skills that differentiate senior executives from the rest of the civil service. This could help address the lack of leadership skills in potential senior executives moving from lower positions. The Civil Service Reform Act assigned OPM the responsibility for training senior executives, with OPM offering various training opportunities such as the Federal Executive Institute and Management Development Centers to strengthen Executive Core Qualifications. OPM offers training opportunities for senior executives, but critics argue that agencies and OPM have not prioritized training. This decentralized approach has led to variation in training opportunities among agencies. The decentralized training structure for senior executives has led to inconsistent and infrequent government-wide training programs. Critics argue that this approach violates the original vision of the SES and limits opportunities for executives to learn from colleagues in other agencies. Suggestions have been made to utilize resources within the government, such as Presidential Rank Award recipients, to provide additional training opportunities for SES members. The SES members feel their developmental opportunities could improve, with only 25% receiving formal executive coaching. The SES was meant to be a cohesive corps promoting mobility across agencies for leadership skill development. Senior executives would gain experience and leadership skills through mobility, bringing fresh perspectives to agencies. However, mobility for senior executives has not been fully realized due to perceived job rotations as punitive. Other barriers to mobility include political leaders using it to remove unwanted personnel. The CSRA required OPM to centralize administration for the new SES, but recruitment and assessment responsibilities have been delegated to agencies. Job rotations are seen as beneficial for senior executives to gain diverse career development experiences, similar to the military model. Job rotations for senior executives in the SES can enhance their skills in adaptability, flexibility, leadership, and planning. A recent report suggests reviewing SES positions to identify those suitable for rotation. The idea of a mobile SES corps is no longer practical, and separating positions into \"Agency SES\" and \"National SES\" is recommended. Some SES positions may benefit from technical expertise and could be turned into Senior Technical (ST) roles. The SES positions could be divided into \"Agency SES\" and \"National SES,\" with some roles converted to Senior Technical (ST) and Senior Level (SL) positions. Mobility agreements and developmental rotations could be established for National Corps members, while agency senior executives may not have the same rotational requirements. Concerns have been raised about the lack of diversity in the SES. The Service Reform Act aimed to create a diverse and competent Federal workforce, including the Senior Executive Service (SES). However, the SES currently lacks diversity compared to the rest of the federal workforce. Diversity in the SES can bring varied perspectives and strengths to policy development and decision-making. The SES demographic profile is similar to GS-14s and GS-15s, seen as the SES development pool. Increasing diversity in the SES could be beneficial. The SES could benefit from increased diversity in the talent pool as many senior executives are expected to retire soon. Diversity in the SES is crucial for effective government operations and decision-making, as it brings different perspectives and experiences. Scholars suggest that a diverse public workforce can enhance government effectiveness and public perception. A strong OPM is essential for a successful SES. A strong OPM is crucial for a successful SES, as highlighted by Bernard Rosen, a former executive director of the Civil Service Commission. Rosen emphasized the importance of OPM in serving as a \"catalyst\" between the President, his appointees, and the agencies, especially during new administrations. OPM should provide guidance and monitoring without excessive control, transitioning to a more active leadership role. OPM plays a crucial role in the success of the SES by providing guidance and monitoring without excessive control. The lack of OPM efforts to establish a mobile SES has resulted in a highly immobile SES, hindering government operations. The Civil Service Reform Act granted OPM various responsibilities to enhance the mobility and development of SES members, but some of these responsibilities have been delegated to agencies. OPM has delegated responsibilities to agencies for training, career development, performance evaluation, and recruiting efforts for the SES. A more centralized effort could strengthen the SES, but some argue that agency control allows for flexibility. President Obama's Management Council established a working group to improve the SES, with OMB and OPM issuing a joint memo in 2011 outlining proposals for professional development, streamlining processes, performance management, and talent pipelines. The memo suggested reforms to improve senior executive recruitment techniques, increase diversity, and talent within the SES. A Senate hearing on the SES discussed challenges facing the government's leadership corps, with witnesses from OPM, the Partnership for Public Service, and the Senior Executives Association. Senator Daniel Akaka proposed improvements to the hiring process among other changes. Senator Daniel Akaka proposed improvements to the hiring process for the Senior Executive Service (SES). Senator Ron Johnson emphasized the importance of strong leadership in both public and private sectors. Witness Max Stier suggested changing the 10% government-wide cap on noncareer senior executives to a 10% cap for each agency. Nancy Kichak discussed OPM's efforts to enhance hiring processes, while Carol Bonosaro raised concerns about pay compression. Other topics included diversity within the SES. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to reform the Senior Executive Service (SES) pay system. Senator Daniel Akaka introduced S. 2249, which aimed to adjust SES pay, reduce noncareer senior executives, establish an SES Resource Office, and enhance professional development. Representative Jim Moran introduced H.R. 6042 with similar proposals, including evaluating skills for SES positions. H.R. 6042 aims to evaluate skills and qualifications for SES positions and hold executives accountable for addressing employee satisfaction."
