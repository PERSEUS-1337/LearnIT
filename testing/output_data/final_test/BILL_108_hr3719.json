    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom of Choice Act\". The \"Freedom of Choice Act\" recognizes the principles of individual liberty, personal privacy, and equality in making reproductive health decisions without governmental interference, as established by Supreme Court cases like Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade. The Roe v. Wade decision affirmed a woman's right to make reproductive decisions before fetal viability, balancing personal considerations with the state's interest in potential life. This protection has safeguarded women's health and lives in the US, preventing the previous need for unsafe abortions. Before the Roe v. Wade decision, many women resorted to illegal abortions, leading to numerous health risks and even death. Unsafe abortions were a significant cause of maternal mortality worldwide, with approximately 80,000 deaths annually. The Supreme Court decision in 1992 further solidified women's reproductive rights. The Supreme Court in Parenthood v. Casey recognized the importance of women's ability to control their reproductive lives for equal participation in society. Despite the Roe v. Wade decision, threats to the right to choose remain, including legal barriers and lack of abortion providers in 87% of U.S. counties, endangering women's health and lives. To ensure women's right to choose is protected, Congress has the power to enact legislation under the Constitution, allowing access to reproductive health services and reducing the need for abortions. The amendment to the Constitution allows Congress to protect a woman's right to choose regarding abortion, citing reasons such as women crossing state lines for abortions and the interstate nature of reproductive health clinics. Nurses and personnel travel across state lines to provide reproductive health services to patients. The Act defines key terms such as \"government,\" \"State,\" and \"viability.\" It also prohibits interference with reproductive health. The United States policy affirms every woman's right to choose to bear a child, terminate a pregnancy before or after fetal viability for health reasons. Government interference with these rights is prohibited, and discrimination in providing benefits or services is not allowed. Individuals can take civil action for violations of these rights. An individual aggrieved by a violation of this section may seek relief in a civil action. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY: If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. \n\nSEC. 6. RETROACTIVE EFFECT: This Act applies to all federal, state, and local laws, regardless of when they were enacted."
