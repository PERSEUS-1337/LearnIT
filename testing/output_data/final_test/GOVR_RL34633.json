    "content": "The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires federal agencies to submit final rules to Congress and the GAO before they can take effect. It allows Congress to use expedited procedures to overturn agency rules. If a rule is disapproved through the CRA, it cannot be reissued in a similar form without statutory authorization. The CRA is seen as a way for Congress to assert authority over rulemaking agencies. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) was initially seen as a way for Congress to assert authority over rulemaking agencies, but it has had little direct impact on agency rules. Since its enactment in March 1996, the CRA has only been used to disapprove one rule - the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's November 2000 final rule on ergonomics. The rejection of the ergonomics rule in March 2001 was due to specific circumstances related to a transition in party control of the presidency. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) has had limited impact on agency rules, with only one rule being disapproved since its enactment in 1996. The rejection of the ergonomics rule in 2001 was due to a transition in party control of the presidency. The report discusses implications of the CRA in transition-related circumstances and the complex time periods involved in the disapproval process. The report discusses the Congressional Review Act (CRA) provisions for carrying over the disapproval process into a subsequent session of Congress and the impact on rules submitted at the end of a Congress. It also highlights the phenomenon of \"midnight rulemaking\" at the end of presidential administrations. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows for rules issued at the end of an administration to have lasting impact, as subsequent administrations must go through lengthy processes to change or eliminate them. The Bush Administration reduced the volume of rules from the Clinton Administration and protected its own rules from being overturned. Midnight rulemaking was a significant issue at the end of the Clinton Administration. Andrew H. Card, Jr., directed executive departments and agencies to halt sending regulations to the Office of the Federal Register, withdraw unpublished regulations, and delay the effective date of published regulations for 60 days to allow for review by the President's appointees. The Bush Administration also took preemptive action against potential \"midnight rules\" at the end of the President's term. President's term. White House Chief of Staff Joshua B. Bolten issued a memorandum to limit regulatory activity in the final months of the Administration. Regulations needed to be proposed by June 1, 2008, and finalized by November 1, 2008. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs would oversee compliance with this directive. The CRA is a complex statute with multiple ways to measure its impact. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) utilizes four different ways to measure time: calendar days, days of continuous session, session days, and legislative days. These measures impact Congress's ability to use the CRA disapproval process, especially towards the end of a session or presidential term. Section 801(a)(3) of the CRA delays the effective dates of \"major\" rules for 60 calendar days after being provided to Congress or published. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) delays the effective dates of \"major\" rules for 60 calendar days after being provided to Congress or published in the Federal Register. This allows Congress to review and potentially disapprove these rules before they take effect. Non-major rules can take effect as specified in the rules themselves. The CRA can still be used to disapprove a rule even after it has taken effect, as long as there is time left in the congressional review period. A joint resolution of disapproval must be introduced within 60 days of the rule being received by Congress, excluding days when either House is adjourned for more than 3 days. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review and potentially disapprove rules before they take effect. The initiation period for resolutions of disapproval is defined by session adjournment rules. Resolutions are referred to committees in each house, with the House following general procedures and the Senate having 20 days to report a resolution. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review and potentially disapprove rules before they take effect. If a Senate committee does not report a disapproval resolution within 20 calendar days, 30 Senators can petition to discharge the committee. The CRA makes consideration of the measure privileged, limits floor debate to 10 hours, and sets a 60-day action period for the Senate to act on a joint resolution of disapproval. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review and potentially disapprove rules before they take effect. Section 801(d) of the CRA provides that if Congress adjourns its annual session sine die less than 60 legislative days in the House of Representatives or 60 session days in the Senate after a rule is submitted to it, then the rule is subject to a new initiation period and action period in the following session of Congress. This provision ensures that both houses have enough time to consider disapproving rules submitted during the end-of-session \"carryover period.\" The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review and potentially disapprove rules before they take effect. If Congress adjourns before the rule is reviewed, it goes through a new initiation and action period in the following session. Resolutions of disapproval can be introduced within 60 days of the new session, and the Senate can act on them during the same period. The Bolten memorandum's requirement for final rules to be published in the Federal Register by November 1, 2008, may prevent the next presidential administration from extending the effective dates of rules published during the Bush Administration. Rules submitted before the deadline will still be subject to congressional disapproval in the 111th Congress. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to enact resolutions of disapproval for rules that have already taken effect. The starting point for the CRA carryover period in the second session of the 110th Congress can be determined by examining prior congressional activity. This analysis looked at calendars of the House and Senate from the 100th Congress to the first session of the 110th Congress to identify potential starting points. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to enact resolutions of disapproval for rules that have already taken effect. Table 1 below presents data on the starting points for CRA carryover periods in different sessions of Congress. The starting points varied between the House and Senate in each session, with the House starting earlier in most cases. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to enact resolutions of disapproval for rules that have already taken effect. The starting points for CRA carryover periods in different sessions of Congress varied between the House and Senate, with the House starting earlier in most cases. The earliest starting point for the carryover period was May 12, and the latest date was September 9. The median starting point for all sessions of Congress was June 25, with starting points typically earlier in second sessions than in first sessions. Since the Congressional Review Act was enacted in March 1996, the starting points for carryover periods during second sessions of Congress have been earlier than for the full period, ranging from May 12 to June 23, with a median starting point of June 7. Any rule submitted after the starting point date would not have 60 days of session in both houses, allowing Congress to introduce and act on CRA resolutions of disapproval in the next session. A new initiation period for the rule begins on the 15th session day of the new session of Congress. The targeted adjournment date in the House of Representatives is September 26, 2008, but no targeted adjournment has been set in the Senate. The starting point dates for CRA carryover periods in the second session of the 110th Congress may impact rules issued late in the session. Federal agencies are planning to finalize controversial proposed rules by the end of 2008, including an EPA revision of the definition of \"solid waste\" and a DOT rule updating roof-crush resistance standards in passenger vehicles. Members of Congress have criticized these proposed rules. The EPA is seeking an extension for finalizing a new source review rule that could change requirements for upgrades at power plants. Environmental groups are concerned that the rule may weaken protections. Additionally, there is a proposed EPA rule that could impact pollution levels under the Clean Air Act and emissions standards for industrial facilities near national parks. The National Park Service is also considering a rule change. The National Park Service is considering a rule change that would allow state laws to determine concealed firearms in national parks. The Department of Justice proposed a rule to update policies on criminal intelligence systems. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is implementing stricter fuel economy standards for automakers. The FDA is proposing a rule to prohibit something. The FDA is proposing a rule that would prohibit pharmaceutical companies from changing labeling without evidence of a causal association with safety concerns. The Employment Standards Administration is also considering a rule that would change the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Act, causing concerns about workers' rights. The proposed rules include a Department of the Interior rule on surface coal mining operations, a proposed amendment to the Federal Acquisition Regulation for E-Verify system usage, a HUD rule on disclosure regulations under RESPA, and concerns raised by Members of Congress. Several proposed rules have been introduced, including a Department of Health and Human Services rule on medical providers' rights regarding abortions, a Department of Labor rule on occupational health risk assessments, a DOI rule giving federal agencies more responsibility under the Endangered Species Act. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to prohibit the enforcement of certain rules. Members of Congress have expressed concerns about these rules. During the final months of the Bush Administration, significant final rules are expected to be issued by federal departments and agencies. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about these potential \"midnight\" rules. Any final rules submitted to Congress with less than 60 session days left will be carried over to the next Congress for review under the Congressional Review Act. Each rule will have a new review period in the new session of Congress. During the initiation period, final rules submitted to Congress with less than 60 session days left will be carried over to the next Congress for review under the Congressional Review Act. The new session of Congress may subject these rules to a resolution of disapproval, with the outcome depending heavily on the new President's actions. The White House Chief of Staff Bolten issued a memorandum directing agencies to issue final rules by November 1, 2008, to ensure they take effect before the next President takes office in January 2009. This may prevent the next administration from extending the effective dates of rules published during the Bush Administration. The Bolten memorandum directs agencies to issue final rules by November 1, 2008, to prevent the next administration from extending effective dates of rules published during the Bush Administration. The memorandum may impact the issuance of rules before the end of the Bush Administration, but it will not affect Congress's ability to overturn agency rules submitted within the last 60 legislative days. The CRA allows Congress to enact resolutions of disapproval for rules that have already taken effect, preventing agencies from proposing similar rules without statutory authorization. Congress can also halt rulemaking through appropriations legislation. The Bolten memorandum directs agencies to issue final rules by November 1, 2008, to prevent the next administration from extending effective dates of rules published during the Bush Administration. Unlike disapprovals under the CRA, regulatory requirements that have been put into effect are not rescinded, and the agency is not prohibited from issuing a substantially similar regulation in the future."
