    "content": "The Sportsmen's Heritage Act of 2012 (H.R. 4089) aims to open federal lands and waters for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting, while also establishing criteria for land management agencies to close lands to these activities. Critics argue that the bill could negatively impact wilderness areas and add complexity to land management planning processes. Titles I and II of H.R. 4089 establish a system for land management agencies to decide on closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. Titles III through VI address various issues related to hunting, fishing, and federal lands, such as permits for importing polar bear parts, use of lead shot and sinkers, opening the Kisatchie National Forest for dog-deer hunting, and limiting the President's authority to establish national monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906. Federal laws regulating hunting and fishing on federal lands are exceptions to the general rule that states manage these activities within their boundaries. The federal government regulates habitat, while states regulate the take of animals. Hunting and conservation have been linked since early wildlife legislation. Conservation programs have been successful due to efforts by sportsmen and state fish and game departments. Controversy surrounds hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal land, with debates over land planning processes and recent court decisions favoring wilderness protection. H.R. 4089 addresses issues of balancing recreational access with game management and resource conservation. The bill is supported by groups like the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance and National Rifle Association, while opponents include Wilderness Watch and the Humane Society. H.R. 4089 is a bill that aims to clarify hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting as legitimate uses of federal public lands. Supporters believe it will increase access for hunters and anglers, but critics like Wilderness Watch argue it could weaken protections under the 1964 Wilderness Act. The bill does not provide funding for physical access improvements and may slow down the planning process. The bill H.R. 4089 could potentially slow down the planning process by adding new steps to land management processes, including new criteria, reporting requirements, and public notices. It does not specify when implementation is required, which could result in land agencies having to revise all land management plans simultaneously. The bill also proposes different criteria for various types of lands and activities, making it challenging for land management agencies to apply. Additionally, it favors activities over conservation values on lands designated for specific purposes like wilderness areas or BLM national monuments. Introduced in 2012, H.R. 4089 combines elements from three earlier bills. Title I of H.R. 4089 is based on the Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act, while Title II is based on the Recreational Shooting Protection Act. Title III concerns importing polar bear trophies from Canada, and Title IV regulates the use of lead shot and sinkers by the EPA. Title V is similar to a bill about hunting dogs in Louisiana, and a portion of Title VI limits the President's ability to establish national monuments. The bill was reported by the Committee on Natural Resources in April 2012. The bill H.R. 4089, reported in April 2012, allowed for eight amendments with three approved by the House. The federal government owns 635-640 million acres of land managed by four agencies. Land management plans are required every 15 years, detailing activities like hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting with public input. The federal government manages vast amounts of land, with land management plans detailing activities like hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. Agencies must balance statutory mandates for use and conservation, with plans subject to amendments. Increased communication among agencies and sporting organizations is facilitated through a memorandum of understanding. All federal agencies must comply with environmental laws like NEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act. Title I of H.R. 4089 and Senate bill S. 2066 aim to establish a management policy for federal lands regarding fishing, hunting, and recreational shooting. The bills require specific criteria for closing federal lands and involve public consultation. The analysis will focus on the potential impacts of Title I. Title I of the Sportsmen's Heritage Act of 2012 defines federal public land broadly as any land or water owned by the United States and managed by a Federal agency for conservation purposes. The definition excludes lands held in trust for Native Americans and lands on the Outer Continental Shelf. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act does not have a statutory definition of federal public land. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) does not have a statutory definition of federal public land. Title I of the Sportsmen's Heritage Act of 2012 defines federal public land broadly as any land or water owned by the United States and managed by a Federal agency for conservation purposes. The definition could potentially include lands under various federal agencies beyond the traditional land management agencies like BLM, NPS, FWS, and the Forest Service. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 defined federal lands as those requiring rights of way from multiple departments for conservation purposes. Executive orders direct all agencies with land to preserve the environment, implying a purpose of \"conservation of natural resources.\" Title I of H.R. 4089 covers agencies with this purpose, potentially reaching more lands than intended. Referring to specific management agencies in the definition could limit the scope, as seen in other legislation like the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act. Section 103(2) of Title I defines hunting as using firearms, bows, or other authorized means for pursuing, capturing, or killing wildlife, including trapping and field trials. Trapping on federal lands is controversial and less common than traditional hunting. Using hunting dogs for waterfowl is also included in the definition. The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act addresses the controversy surrounding field trials, particularly the use of horses and large numbers of participants and spectators. While field trials occasionally occur on federal lands, H.R. 4089 could potentially expand this activity. Current regulations prohibit field trials in wildlife refuges without a special permit, and the bill does not clearly distinguish between hunting, sport hunting, and recreational hunting. The bill does not clearly distinguish between hunting, sport hunting, and recreational hunting. The provision addressing licensing refers to \"fish, hunt, and trap,\" which is inconsistent with the definition. Section 104(g)(1) potentially expands allowed activities related to fishing and hunting. The definition of hunting excludes the use of skilled volunteers for culling excess animals. NPS has historically been reluctant to allow volunteers for culling operations where hunting is forbidden. The definition of recreational fishing in H.R. 4089 is unclear and may include commercial fishing, leading to potential confusion, especially in federal land units like Glacier Bay National Park. The definition of recreational shooting in H.R. 4089 includes various activities involving firearms and bows, such as hunting, shooting ranges, target practice, and war reenactments. While these activities were intended to be promoted on federal public lands, there is controversy over whether shooting ranges on Forest Service or BLM lands are affected. Recreational shooting on NPS or FWS lands would likely be contentious, with war reenactments possibly permitted on NPS but not on FWS lands. Section 104 of H.R. 4089 directs federal land management agencies to facilitate hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting activities on public lands, in accordance with state and federal laws. However, there may be challenges in implementing this directive, as state laws do not necessarily authorize actions on federal lands. Section 104 of H.R. 4089 directs federal land management agencies to facilitate hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting activities on public lands, but there is tension in the bill regarding the preference for these activities over other uses of federal public land. The provision also directs agency heads to lease or permit lands for shooting ranges and designate specific lands for recreational shooting activities. Section 104(d)(2) of H.R. 4089 directs federal agencies to address recreational shooting, while Section 104(j) requires agency heads to consult with advisory councils. Additionally, Section 104(c)(2) would allow skilled volunteers to assist in managing wildlife populations on federal lands where hunting is banned. The decision to allow volunteers to cull animals on federal lands may not be subject to NEPA, reducing the time needed for wildlife management plans. H.R. 4089 establishes processes for closing lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting, but some criteria may not have been used in developing land plans by federal agencies. The bill introduces definitions that could impact existing plans. The bill introduces processes for closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting, with potential impacts on existing plans. Revision of the Wilderness Act could significantly change land management. Title I actions may be exempt from NEPA reviews, but agencies still have other statutory requirements for public review. Section 104(a) directs agencies to facilitate use of and access to Federal public lands, with criteria for closing lands based on national security, public safety, or resource reasons. Existing law authorizes limits on federal lands for national security, public safety, or resource conservation reasons. The new criteria in Section 104(a)(3) may require all three criteria to be met before closing lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting. This could lead to additional steps in agencies' planning processes and potential grounds for litigation. The bill introduces new criteria for closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting, requiring evaluation based on subjective phrases. This may lead to additional steps in agencies' planning processes and potential litigation. The bill introduces new criteria for closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting under Section 104(c)(1)(A), which would provide opportunities for these activities unless deemed incompatible with land management purposes. Section 104(d) applies specifically to BLM and Forest Service lands, mandating that they remain open unless closed by the managing agency. Section 104(d) provides additional criteria for BLM and Forest Service closures, allowing the head of the agency to limit lands for various purposes such as resource conservation, public safety, and national security. This section may supersede Section 104(a) and is consistent with existing land planning practices. The criteria for BLM and Forest Service land closure decisions appear to differ from other federal public land agencies, adding to agencies' planning responsibilities. Section 104(g)(1) requires a process for permanent or temporary land withdrawals or changes in classification. Section 104(g)(1) requires a process for closing or restricting 640 or more contiguous acres of Federal public land for fishing or hunting, excluding recreational shooting and closures under Section 104(d) on BLM and Forest Service lands. Closures must follow specific procedures and notification requirements, with short-term closures not exempted. Section 104(g)(2) of the legislation addresses the aggregate effects of multiple closures smaller than 640 acres each. It states that if closures or changes effectively restrict 1280 or more acres of land or water, they should be treated as a single withdrawal for reporting purposes. This aggregation applies to closures across all agencies and does not require a geographical link among the closures. It does not seem to apply to BLM or Forest Service lands. Section 104(g)(3) allows federal land agencies to close the smallest area in emergencies for safety, conservation, or security reasons. Emergency closures end after a reasonable time, but it's unclear if notice and reporting requirements must still be followed. NEPA waivers may apply, but under S. 2066, NEPA is not waived for emergency closures. Planning documents will specify which lands are closed for hunting, fishing, and shooting. Section 104(c) of an agency's planning document must evaluate its effects on recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting. Federal lands are mostly open to hunting and fishing, but recreational shooting is less common. It is unlikely agencies have evaluated recreational shooting broadly when making land use plans. NPS and FWS may not have used new criteria for closures when evaluating restrictions on these activities. BLM and Forest Service may have different planning criteria under the bill, which would not pose a similar obstacle. H.R. 4089 aims to limit environmental and land use planning requirements. H.R. 4089 aims to limit environmental and land use planning requirements for opening new areas, with uncertainty on immediate changes or waiting for plan revisions. Lands may be open upon enactment, especially for BLM and Forest Service lands. The potential impact of H.R. 4089 on land management plans is unclear, particularly regarding the triggering of plan revisions. Despite a possible waiver of NEPA, agencies may still incur costs in revising existing plans due to public review processes. Clarification is needed to determine if agency regulations will require review before implementing new recreational activities. H.R. 4089 states that federal agencies do not need to consider environmental effects for actions on federal public lands, as they are not considered major actions under NEPA. The section appears to exempt Title I activities from NEPA review, possibly waiving environmental assessments and categorical exclusions. It also seems to prevent management activities under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act from undergoing NEPA reviews, but the scope of these exemptions is unclear. The S. 2066 NEPA provision is slightly different. The broad interpretation of actions taken under this Title is not clear. The waiver in the land management plan for BLM may only apply to specific tasks in Title I, such as reporting and notice requirements. S. 2066 requires NEPA reviews in certain instances that H.R. 4089 appears to waive. S. 2066 requires environmental reviews for designating lands for shooting ranges and withdrawing lands for hunting/fishing, even in emergencies, which may slow decision-making but provide a fuller analysis of environmental impacts. It is unclear why emergency closures must follow NEPA, as NEPA reviews take time and are typically done before closures. Section 104(e) of H.R. 4089 allows activities related to fishing, hunting, recreational shooting, or wildlife conservation in wilderness areas, potentially undermining wilderness values. Despite claims that it won't open wilderness areas to motorized travel, it's unclear what other activities it permits. Section 104(e) of H.R. 4089 allows activities like fishing, hunting, recreational shooting, and wildlife conservation in wilderness areas, potentially undermining wilderness values by potentially repealing limits on prohibited uses. Section 104(e) of H.R. 4089 could potentially allow construction of roads, cabins, and dams in wilderness areas for activities like hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting, potentially undermining wilderness values. The term \"within and supplemental to\" Wilderness purposes in section 4(a) of Public Law 88-577 means that requirements imposed by the Wilderness Act should only be implemented if they do not hinder wildlife conservation or recreational opportunities on Federal public lands. Section 104(e)(2) of H.R. 4089 could potentially prioritize recreational opportunities and wildlife conservation over wilderness values in land management. Section 104(e)(3) in H.R. 4089 aims to limit the scope of opportunities related to hunting, fishing, shooting, and wildlife conservation by excluding commodity development, motorized recreational access, and use. It is unclear if this restriction applies to motorized transport. A court may interpret that Section 104(e)(3) only prohibits general recreational motorized access allowed in Section 104(e)(2), not specific activities. H.R. 4089 restricts motorized recreational access but may allow motorized vehicles for hunting, fishing, shooting, and wildlife conservation. S. 2066 may have clearer restrictions on motorized uses related to hunting and fishing. The revisions to the Wilderness Act in S. 2066 do not authorize motorized recreation access or non-hunting, fishing, and trapping activities. The bill appears ambiguous and may need clarification to ban all motorized activities or specify which motorized uses are permitted. The bill does not establish deadlines for implementing wilderness changes, suggesting activities may be allowed upon enactment or when planning documents are revised. Section 104(c)(1)(B) exempts wildlife refuge management activities from NEPA, potentially waiving the NEPA review for activities like preparing Comprehensive Conservation Plans. The bill exempts wildlife refuge management activities from NEPA review, potentially affecting conservation efforts. Public notice and comment requirements under the CCP process could offer an alternative avenue for public participation. The provision clarifies that the Act does not amend the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. The bill exempts wildlife refuge management activities from NEPA review but does not amend the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. Differences between the bill and the Refuge Act may raise questions regarding the priority of hunting and fishing activities in refuge planning and management. Section 104(i) does not repeal the Refuge Act priority use provision unless expressly stated. Section 104(h) clarifies that national parks and monuments are not required to open to hunting or recreational shooting. However, this exclusion does not apply to other types of national park units. Proposed amendment to exclude all national park units from Title I was defeated. Section 104(h) does not require certain park units to be open to Title I activities but does not exempt them from Title I. Section 104 requires NPS to follow closure procedures for limiting lands for hunting or recreational shooting, but does not mandate opening the lands. Two sections of Title I require federal land agencies to notify Congress of restrictions on hunting and fishing. Despite a biannual reporting requirement, reports only describe closures from the previous year, raising questions about intent. Section 104 requires NPS to follow closure procedures for limiting lands for hunting or recreational shooting, but does not mandate opening the lands. An additional reporting mandate in Section 104(g) requires notice to congressional committees of closures affecting 640 acres or more. Sections 203(b) and (g) in Title II require additional reports for recreational shooting in national monuments managed by BLM. It is unclear if the reporting requirements in Title I replace or supplement those in FLPMA. Section 202 of FLPMA requires BLM to report to Congress when closing land for principle or major uses over 100,000 acres for two or more years. Section 104(d)(2) includes a waiver of liability for the federal government for claims related to shooting ranges. Section 104(d)(2) includes a waiver of liability for the federal government for claims related to shooting ranges. The limitation of liability may only apply to BLM and Forest Service lands, not other recreational shooting activities. The bill is not intended to interfere with state law, as indicated by various provisions. Section 104(k)(2) of the bill prohibits imposing federal licenses, fees, or permits for fishing, hunting, or trapping on federal lands, except for the Migratory Bird Stamp. It is unclear if this provision aims to prevent new requirements or revoke existing permits. Existing permit requirements for activities on federal lands mandated in Title I may be affected if revocation is intended. For example, permits for field trials on refuge lands and NPS permits for war reenactments could be impacted. Section 104(k)(2) prohibits federal licenses, fees, or permits for fishing, hunting, or trapping on federal lands, except for the Migratory Bird Stamp. This may require land management agencies to revise their regulations, potentially allowing recreation fees for activities like shooting ranges. Access to federal lands for hunting and fishing can be limited, with agencies like BLM and the Forest Service having authority to acquire property for easier access, including through eminent domain. Title I grants authority, including eminent domain, for agencies to acquire property to facilitate access to federal lands. Title II focuses on recreational shooting on BLM national monument lands, requiring lands to be open for this activity unless specific justifications are met. Closures are limited to six months, with restrictions on repeated closures for the same reasons. Title II of the legislation focuses on recreational shooting on BLM national monument lands, which must be open for this activity unless specific justifications are met. Monuments are established by Congress or presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act to preserve federal lands with historic or scientific interest, each managed uniquely based on the proclamation or legislation creating the monument. Current practice requires BLM land management planning to ensure recreational shooting aligns with the land's preserved values. The definition of national monument land under Title II refers to lands designated as national monuments under the Antiquities Act. Title II of the legislation focuses on recreational shooting on BLM national monument lands, which must be open for this activity unless specific justifications are met. The definition of national monument land refers to lands designated as national monuments under the Antiquities Act. Section 203(a) requires that BLM national monuments be open for recreational shooting unless closures are \"necessary and reasonable and supported by facts and evidence,\" using similar criteria as for other BLM lands. However, Title II closures do not require consideration of certain factors like resource conservation, energy production, or protection of private property rights, as these would be uncommon in a national monument. Title II of the legislation focuses on recreational shooting on BLM national monument lands, which must be open unless specific justifications are met. Unlike Section 104 determinations, Section 203 closures are not excluded from NEPA review. Section 203(b) requires BLM to prepare a different analysis for limiting shooting on monument lands than for other lands it manages. Section 203 of the legislation requires BLM to publish notices of closures or restrictions in newspapers, submit reports to Congress, and provide annual reports on national monument land closures for recreational shooting. Closures can be allowed for 30 days in cases of public safety or national security risks. Title II of the legislation establishes temporary closures lasting six months, with Congress able to end closures earlier through legislation. However, a future Congress cannot be bound by the 30-day reopening requirement. Closures cannot exceed six months unless extended by law, and no closure may be renewed unless there is a change in circumstance. The legislation establishes temporary closures lasting six months, with Congress able to end closures earlier through legislation. Closures cannot exceed six months unless extended by law, and no closure may be renewed unless there is a change in circumstance. This could lead to conflicts with the Endangered Species Act and open monument lands to recreational shooting within six months. Title III of the legislation would allow hunters to import legally hunted polar bear trophies from Canada to the United States, applicable only to bears killed before May 15, 2008 when polar bears were listed as a threatened species under the ESA. The legislation would permit hunters to import polar bear trophies from Canada, with a $1,000 permit fee for each trophy to support conservation efforts. Despite warnings, the import of trophies continued until the ESA listing became final, prompting a court-ordered immediate listing. FWS supports allowing hunters who applied for permits before the listing to import their trophies. Title III of H.R. 4089, which allows hunters to import polar bear trophies, has faced opposition from groups like the Humane Society of the United States due to concerns about conservation efforts and setting a dangerous precedent for wildlife protection laws. The amended version of H.R. 991 addressed FWS concerns before being reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources. The Fish and Wildlife Service prohibited polar bear trophy imports after listing the bear as threatened. H.R. 4089 exempts lead shot and ammunition from the Toxic Substances Control Act. EPA denied a citizen petition to regulate lead in ammunition and fishing sinkers. On April 30, 2012, a lawsuit challenging the denial of a petition to regulate lead shot was dismissed. A new suit was filed on June 7, 2012, challenging EPA's 2012 denial. H.R. 4089 would prevent federal regulation of lead shot under TSCA, but lead shot has been banned for hunting migratory waterfowl since 1991 under other laws. Some states have their own laws banning the use of lead sinkers and ammunition. Title V, added by H.Amdt. 1009, prohibits the Forest Service from restricting the use of dogs in deer hunting activities on the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana. This title would overturn the 2012 decision by the Forest Service regarding dog-deer hunting on the forest. The bill does not consider the impacts of dogs on the forest's resources or public health and safety. Section 501 allows restrictions on hunting activities only in limited areas necessary to control trespass onto adjacent lands. Section 601 would end the President's authority to establish such restrictions. Section 601 would end the President's authority to unilaterally establish a national monument under the Antiquities Act. The proclamation for land protection would require approval from the governor and legislature of the affected state. The monument designation could not restrict public use until the Secretary of the Interior allowed an \"appropriate review period.\" The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages 245 million acres of public lands for diverse uses, including hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. BLM regulations allow these activities in accordance with state laws, with over 95% of BLM lands open for such purposes. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages public lands for various uses, including hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. State and local laws apply, and BLM works with state fish and game departments to manage wildlife habitats. Activities like hunting and fishing on BLM lands may be restricted based on site-specific regulations. BLM may limit hunting activities to protect people, property, and resources by closing areas temporarily or permanently through the land use planning process or closure orders. Restrictions on other activities, such as travel or motorized access, can indirectly limit hunting. BLM aims to keep lands open for hunting in alignment with state regulations but may restrict recreational target shooting in rare cases. BLM occasionally restricts recreational target shooting in limited circumstances to comply with public safety laws and protect sensitive resources. Land management plans under FLPMA determine which lands are open, restricted, or closed to specific uses. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) outlines criteria for the development and revision of land use plans by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), emphasizing principles of multiple use and sustained yield. Public participation is encouraged through various provisions, including involvement in the planning process and opportunities for comment and participation in plan formulation. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) follows the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) to develop and revise land use plans, emphasizing multiple use and sustained yield principles. BLM coordinates planning efforts with other federal, state, local, and tribal activities, involving resource advisory councils in land use planning. Land management plans are intended to guide agency lands for 10-15 years, with revisions or amendments made as new issues arise or conditions change. Plan revisions replace existing plans, while plan amendments change specific terms or decisions. BLM intensified efforts to update outdated plans starting in FY2001 due to increased demands for energy resources and off-highway vehicle use. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been updating land use plans since FY2001 to address increased demands for energy resources and off-highway vehicle use. The agency estimates that 67 plans have been updated, 48 are currently being updated, and 44 need revision or amendment. The Forest Service manages the National Forest System, which includes national forests, national grasslands, and a tallgrass prairie, totaling 193 million acres in 44 states and Puerto Rico. The National Forest System (NFS) includes various designated areas like National Recreation Areas, Wilderness Areas, and Game Refuge/Wildlife Preserve Areas. Approximately 21% of NFS lands are not federally owned, causing management challenges. Most NFS lands are open to recreational activities like hunting and fishing, with some areas closed to hunting as per Congressional restrictions. The Forest Service does not track the exact amount of land open for activities. The Forest Service manages hunting, shooting, and fishing on NFS lands, with permission needed for inholdings. Management goals for national forests aim to improve and protect forests for water flow and timber supply, as outlined in Congressional acts. The goals of forest administration under the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960 include outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife purposes. The Forest Service is guided by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act and the National Forest Management Act, which require comprehensive land and resource management plans for each NFS unit. Planning regulations were first issued in 1979 and most recently revised in 2012. The Forest Service develops land management plans for NFS lands, which must be revised every 15 years or sooner if conditions change significantly. There are 127 plans, with 68 past due for revision. Efforts to create a new planning rule have contributed to delays. The National Park Service manages 84 million acres in 397 units for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. The National Park Service oversees 84 million acres of land in 397 units, including national parks, monuments, memorials, battlefields, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, reserves, preserves, rivers, and trails. The NPS aims to balance facilitating visitor access while protecting the natural, historic, and cultural integrity of the lands. Park Superintendents have the authority to close areas for specific uses. Fishing is allowed in national park units according to state laws. Hunting and trapping are generally prohibited, except in specific park areas authorized by federal law after NPS approval. Some national park units allow hunting, such as Fire Island National Seashore, Lake Chelan Cascades National Recreation Area, and others. NPS regulations do not specifically address recreational shooting but restrict special events that could include shooting competitions. Permits for events must have a meaningful association with the park area and not interfere with park purposes or resources. The National Park Service restricts activities that interfere with park administration, concessioners, public safety, or existing uses. Management is guided by key statutes and management plans like General Management Plans (GMPs) that set long-term goals for park units. The National Park Service manages park units through General Management Plans (GMPs) prepared every 10 to 15 years. Approximately 375 out of 397 park units have GMPs, with 50 new or revised plans in development. The Fish and Wildlife Service administers the National Wildlife Refuge System, which includes 149.0 million acres, with a small portion managed for waterfowl breeding habitat. The Fish and Wildlife Service manages the National Wildlife Refuge System, which includes 149.0 million acres of Waterfowl Production Areas (WPAs) for breeding habitat. Of the 594 wildlife refuges and WPAs, 365 are open to hunting, with closures for safety, conservation, and lack of huntable species. All FWS lands are primarily managed for conservation, allowing compatible uses like hunting, fishing, and recreation. The Refuge System permits some commercial uses but can have more restrictive public access compared to NPS lands. The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 prioritized wildlife-dependent recreational uses on refuge lands, such as hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and photography. Non-wildlife-dependent activities may be permitted if compatible with wildlife, but recreational shooting is not considered a priority use. Refuge System planning is based on the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. System planning under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act prioritizes wildlife-dependent recreational activities like hunting. Refuge managers must document opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation in their Comprehensive Conservation Plans (CCPs). H.R. 4089 may expand the scope of CCPs by including trapping and field trials under hunting, as the Refuge Act does not define hunting or fishing explicitly. The Comprehensive Conservation Plans (CCPs) process includes developing background information, preparing alternatives, and specifying one alternative as preferred, subject to public notice and comments. FWS responds to comments and issues a final plan within 15 years of the Refuge Act amendment. 429 out of 554 units in the Refuge System have completed CCPs. Public comments are invited during the planning process. Out of 554 units in the Refuge System, 429 have completed Comprehensive Conservation Plans (CCPs). There are 109 plans under development, and 16 CCPs are expected to begin soon. It is anticipated that almost all units will be completed by the October 9, 2012, deadline."
