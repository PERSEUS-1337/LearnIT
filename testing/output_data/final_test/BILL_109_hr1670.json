    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Egyptian Counterterrorism and Political Reform Act\". It includes findings related to counterterrorism and political reform. Congress finds that Egypt has shown hostility towards Israel since the 1978 peace agreement, promoting a boycott of Israeli products and allowing anti-Semitic content in the Egyptian press. Egypt continues to promote a boycott of Israeli products and has been found to have arms smuggling tunnels to the Gaza Strip. Despite no major external threat, Egypt uses US military assistance to purchase weapons that undermine Israel's security. The Coptic Christian minority in Egypt is regularly victimized without protection from the government. In late 1998, Copts in Egypt faced sectarian violence. The Egyptian government is known for torturing its citizens, with thousands detained without charge each year. Amnesty International reported in 2003 that everyone detained in Egypt is at risk of torture. For fiscal year 2006 and subsequent years, US military assistance to Egypt is prohibited, with a waiver option for the President if it's in the national security interests. Congress believes that the US should provide economic support fund assistance to Egypt in place of military aid, ensuring it is separate from funds used by the Egyptian armed forces. The President must certify procedures before funds are allocated. The Comptroller General should have access to US financial information for review, and the US, Egypt, and Israel should decrease foreign assistance. SEC. 5. DEFINITION. The term \"United States military assistance\" includes aid for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining, international military education and training, and the Foreign Military Finance program."
