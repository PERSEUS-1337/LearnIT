    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Enhancing Safety in Medicine Utilizing Leading Advanced Simulation Technologies to Improve Outcomes Now Act of 2007\". The Congress recognizes the benefits of simulation-based education and training in various healthcare fields, which can improve procedural skills, enhance clinical skill development, and ultimately lead to better health outcomes, patient safety, and reduced costs. Many educational institutions and healthcare providers face challenges in acquiring medical simulation technology. Federal grants can help educational institutions and healthcare providers deploy medical simulation technology and improve training protocols. Establishing medical simulation centers of excellence and a Federal coordinating council can further support the adoption and advancement of medical simulation technologies. SEC. 918 of the Public Health Service Act amends Part B of title IX to enhance medical simulation. The Director of the Public Health Service Act shall conduct research, evaluations, and initiatives to enhance medical simulation technologies in healthcare education. This includes establishing medical simulation centers of excellence to lead research and expand the use of simulation-based skills. Medical simulation centers of excellence aim to provide training and improve research efficiency in medical simulation technology. They lead in specific areas of simulation technology, enhancing knowledge base and program requirements. The Director of medical simulation centers of excellence promotes innovation in medical simulation technologies, supports research on complex simulation technologies, and serves as a resource center for health professional schools and individuals interested in learning about medical simulation. The Director promotes innovation in medical simulation technologies, supports research on complex simulation technologies, and develops an electronic clearinghouse of medical simulation technologies. Grants are awarded for the purchase of these technologies for training healthcare professionals and students. The Director awards grants to eligible entities like hospitals, academic medical centers, and schools of allied health, dentistry, medicine, nursing, osteopathic medicine, or podiatric medicine to incorporate medical simulation technologies into curricula for training healthcare professionals. The Director awards grants to eligible entities like academic medical centers, professional organizations, and health profession licensing boards to deploy medical simulation technologies for training healthcare providers. The Federal Medical Simulation Coordinating Council is established within the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate the government's activities on medical simulation technologies. Voting members consist of representatives from Federal agencies responsible for improving healthcare delivery. The Coordinating Council within the Department of Health and Human Services is made up of representatives appointed by the Secretary, including individuals from various agencies such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National Institutes of Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The Coordinating Council within the Department of Health and Human Services includes representatives from agencies like the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Institutes of Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Food and Drug Administration, Department of Defense, and Department of Veterans Affairs. The Coordinating Council includes 2 nonvoting representatives from the advisory panel, selected by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Defense, and Veterans Affairs. The Director serves as the Chair and is responsible for leadership and oversight. The Coordinating Council consults with outside organizations to improve medical simulation policy and access. They meet at least twice a year, with meetings open to the public. The Director establishes an advisory panel to make program recommendations. The Director establishes an advisory panel of at least 10 representatives from the medical simulation community to make program recommendations. The panel includes members from academic medical centers, health care professionals, and multidisciplinary associations focused on medical simulation. The text chunk discusses the definition of a qualified student in the context of teaching therapeutic and diagnostic procedures to healthcare professionals. It also mentions the authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2008 to 2012."
