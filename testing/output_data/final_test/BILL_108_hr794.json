    "content": "The \"Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 2003\" repeals the 160-acre limitation for coal leases and allows the Secretary to establish a period of more than 40 years for mining plans if it ensures maximum economic recovery or is in the interest of orderly development. Additionally, the Act addresses the payment of advance royalties under coal leases. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 is amended to require diligent development and continued operation of coal mines under lease, with the option for the Secretary of the Interior to suspend this condition upon payment of advance royalties. The advance royalties are based on the average coal price in the spot market from the same region during the last month of each applicable operation year, with a limit of 20 years for accepting advance royalties in lieu of continued operation. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 is amended to allow for the reduction of production royalties by advance royalties paid under the lease. This amendment applies to existing leases and mining units. Additionally, the Secretary of the Interior is granted the authority to waive, suspend, or reduce advance royalties under the Act. SEC. 5 eliminates the deadline for submission of coal lease operation and reclamation plans. SEC. 6 makes amendments regarding financial assurances for bonus bids. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to prohibit requiring surety bonds for coal leases issued based on cash bonus bids. Failure to pay installments within 10 days results in lease termination and no further owed payments to the United States. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to prevent returning bonus payments to lessees or crediting them in future lease sales. Additionally, a conforming amendment eliminates the requirement to immediately pay the United States any unpaid bid remainder upon default or cancellation of a coal lease. SEC. 7. INVENTORY REQUIREMENT. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other departments, will review coal assessments on public lands to identify resources and restrictions. Definitions for compliant coal are provided. The Secretary will complete an inventory of coal containing sulfur dioxide levels and update it as needed. A report will be submitted to relevant committees and made publicly available. The amendments made by this Act apply to any coal lease issued before, on, or after the enactment date."
