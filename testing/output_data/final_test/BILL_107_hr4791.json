    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Weather Research Program Act of 2002\" and focuses on the program's objectives. The United States Weather Research Program, established under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, quick progress in impactful areas, and collaborative scientific efforts. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, and collaborative scientific efforts through research grants to universities and research institutions. SEC. 3. PROGRAM RESEARCH PRIORITIES. The research priorities of the United States Weather Research Program focus on improving forecasts for hurricanes, heavy precipitation, and floods. This includes enhancing landfall location forecasts and hurricane strength predictions, improving forecasts for winter and rain storms, and enhancing flood forecasting and warning systems for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones. The United States Weather Research Program is working on developing a new flood warning index for tropical cyclone-related inland flooding. They are also training emergency management officials and meteorologists on improved forecasting techniques and risk management. Additionally, they are conducting outreach and education efforts. The United States Weather Research Program is focusing on developing a new flood warning index for tropical cyclone-related inland flooding. They are also improving short and medium range numerical weather predictions, conducting the THORpex experiment to fill observational gaps, and testing advanced data assimilation techniques in global models. The United States Weather Research Program is conducting research on societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, evaluating the usefulness of weather information for decision makers, and testing research concepts at test bed centers. The United States Weather Research Program is conducting research on societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, evaluating the usefulness of weather information for decision makers, and testing research concepts at test bed centers. The research aims to develop tools identical to those used by operational meteorologists for technology transfer. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the US Weather Research Program, coordinating with other federal agencies and entities to develop a five-year plan for research, dissemination of weather information, and transferring research results to forecasting operations. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to specific congressional committees, detailing the five-year plan, funding sources, changes to the plan, progress made towards plan objectives, and research activities conducted. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to specific congressional committees, including an analysis of the success and acceptance of the inland flood warning index developed by the public and emergency management professionals. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for fiscal years 2003-2005, with specific allocations for forecasting model grants. Competitive grants for higher education institutions to develop models improving forecasting of coastal and estuary-inland flooding influenced by tropical cyclones. Models should consider storm surges, soil saturation, and other relevant factors."
