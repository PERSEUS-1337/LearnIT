Congress finds that the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) provides millions of Metrorail and Metrobus trips annually to Federal employees, commuters, and visitors to the Nation's capital. Approximately 40 percent of peak-hour commuters are Federal employees. WMATA's rail system, with 91 stations and 117 miles of track, began in 1969. Safety concerns from deferred maintenance have been identified by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). SafeTrack aims to address these concerns by adjusting weekend schedules and expanding weekday maintenance. SafeTrack maintenance plan includes 15 \"Safety Surges\" with single tracking or segment shutdowns impacting rush hour commutes. WMATA encourages customers to use alternative commuting options during SafeTrack, scheduled to end in March 2017. Federal Government is interested in assisting employees with alternate commuting options during SafeTrack. SEC. 2. RIDE-SHARING SERVICES PROVIDED BY A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANY.
