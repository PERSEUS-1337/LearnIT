Dental amalgam, often called \"silver fillings,\" contains 42 to 58 percent mercury, deceiving consumers with the term \"silver.\" Dentists are the third largest purchaser of mercury, placing millions of amalgam fillings in children each year despite non-toxic alternatives being available. Dental amalgam fillings contain mercury which is emitted as vapor. Mercury toxicity builds up over years of exposure, entering the bloodstream and depositing in the brain and kidneys. The National Institutes of Health found that inorganic mercury in brain tissue does not decrease over time, leading to a permanent increase in mercury body burden from dental amalgam exposure. The World Health Organization states that daily intake of mercury from dental amalgam is higher than all other sources combined. The California Dental Association mandates warnings about mercury fillings. As of March 9, 2003, California Dental Offices are required to post warnings about mercury fillings. The warnings inform patients about the risks of exposure to mercury, which can cause birth defects or reproductive harm. Consumers have the right to know the health risks associated with mercury fillings, as mercury can pass through the placenta and breast milk, posing risks to unborn and newborn babies. The National Academy of Sciences estimated that over 600,000 children are born each year at risk for adverse neurodevelopmental effects due to in utero exposure to methyl mercury. Studies show that mercury from fillings can biotransform into highly neurotoxic methylmercury. Many health groups oppose the use of mercury in products put into the body. Highly effective and durable alternatives to mercury-based dental fillings exist, but many health plans do not allow consumers to choose alternatives. Mercury wastewater from dental clinics is considered hazardous waste and can lead to the formation of methyl mercury in fish, which is highly toxic. Mercury contamination in fish has led to numerous advisories being issued by states and federal agencies. Dental offices are now the leading source of mercury due to the use of mercury fillings. Mercury from dental amalgam fillings is a significant source of mercury entering the environment through various pathways, including placement or removal of fillings, bodily excretions, incineration of sewage sludge, and vapor release during cremation. Currently, there are no requirements for mercury capture during cremation. Mercury from dental amalgam fillings is a major contributor to environmental mercury pollution, with the dental industry accounting for a significant portion of mercury use in the United States. The cost of removing mercury from treatment works is substantial, ranging from $10,000,000 to $100,000,000 per pound. Amalgam restorations are a significant reservoir of mercury, contributing to ongoing environmental contamination. According to a study by the EPA and the Cremation Association of North America, 238 pounds of mercury, mainly from dental fillings, were released from crematoria in 1999. Cremation is chosen in about 30% of deaths, with a projected increase. Dental offices often exceed mercury exposure levels allowed by OSHA standards. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON INTRODUCTION OF DENTAL AMALGAM INTO INTERSTATE COMMERCE.\" prohibits the introduction of dental amalgam into interstate commerce. Effective January 1, 2009, dental fillings containing mercury are prohibited under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Devices with mercury for dental fillings must be labeled as containing a highly toxic element and should not be used on children under 18, pregnant women, or lactating women."
