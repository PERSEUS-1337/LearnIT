    "content": "Services encompass a wide range of economic activities that involve providing human value-added in the form of labor, advice, managerial skill, entertainment, and more. They are intangible and must be consumed at the point of production. Technology is reducing restrictions on services, such as computer software that can be stored online. Examples of services include wholesale and retail trade, transportation, information, finance, education, arts, entertainment, and health. The services sector in the U.S. economy has seen significant growth, accounting for 69% of GDP in 2007 and 85% of the total civilian workforce in 2008. Services like financial services play a crucial role in the economy by facilitating the flow of capital. The services sector in the U.S. economy is vital, accounting for a large portion of GDP and the total civilian workforce. There is a symbiotic relationship between service providers and manufacturers, with demand for one creating demand for the other. U.S. trade in services plays a significant role in overall U.S. trade, although domestic services have a much larger impact on the economy. The relative importance of trade in services in the U.S. economy has remained constant, with services accounting for around 30% of exports by 2003. Despite dominating the domestic economy, services only make up 16%-18% of U.S. imports. The U.S. consistently sees surpluses in services trade, helping to offset deficits in goods trade. In 2006, U.S. firms sold $806 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned affiliates, contributing to a more accurate measurement of trade in services. In 2006, U.S. firms sold $806 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates. Foreign firms sold $616 billion in services to U.S. residents through their majority-owned foreign affiliates in the United States. Data for cross-border trade and sales by majority-owned affiliates are not directly compatible, making it difficult to measure overall services trade accurately. Other modes of services delivery include temporary movement of consumers and providers. U.S. data on services sales through these modes are not readily available. The United States engages in trade in services with various regions worldwide. The U.S. engages in trade in services with various regions worldwide, with a significant portion of cross-border trade occurring with EU-member countries. Figures show that a large percentage of U.S. services exports and imports are with the European Union, with Canada accounting for a smaller share. The EU's dominance in U.S. services trade is evident, especially when considering services provided through multinational corporations. Figure 4 displays the sales shares by region in 2006 to U.S. persons by foreign majority-owned MNCs, with Europe accounting for 57% of sales to foreign persons and 62% of sales to U.S. persons. Canada represented 11% and 9% of total sales. Figures 5 and 6 show the shares of U.S. services exports and imports by types of services in 2007, with travel and related services dominating U.S. cross-border services trade. Passenger fares and other transportation services also played significant roles in U.S. services exports and imports. U.S. policymakers face challenges in increasing foreign trade in services, including identifying barriers in foreign government laws and working with trading partners to facilitate trade. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is still in early development, and managing disputes is another challenge in conducting trade in services. Barriers in services trade differ from goods trade as they are within the borders of the importing country, often in the form of government regulations to protect consumers and the economy. Regulations include licensing for professionals like doctors and lawyers, and certification for financial services providers. Governments regulate to prevent harmful shocks, such as controls on foreign currency. Controls on foreign currency transactions are designed to protect the economy from sudden shocks and maintain stable exchange rates. Trade barriers in services industries often involve restrictions on international payments, which can unintentionally affect foreign services trade. Barriers to services trade include restrictions on international payments, movement of personnel, information transfer, government procurement, taxation policy, and monopolies. Barriers to services trade include restrictions on foreign direct investment, local employment requirements, quotas on foreign service suppliers, and licensing requirements. These barriers are specific to different service industries such as construction of buildings and transportation infrastructures. Construction and related engineering services involve firms that work on transportation infrastructures like roads, bridges, airports, and tunnels. These firms also install prefabricated structures and provide finishing work. U.S. firms are competitive in this global market, requiring specialized skills and often partnering with local firms in foreign markets. The industry is labor-intensive and tightly regulated for quality control and safety. The construction and related services industry is heavily regulated by governments to ensure quality control and safety. This includes meeting technical standards, adhering to land use and environmental controls, and restrictions that may disproportionately affect foreign suppliers. Local trade associations may have conflicting interests when ruling on permit applications, and some countries have \"buy national\" policies favoring domestic firms. Collusive practices, such as bid-rigging, have been observed in certain countries like Japan. In Japan, local construction companies engage in bid-rigging practices known as dango, where a small group agrees on the lowest bid to secure contracts. This collusive practice excludes foreign and domestic competitors. Travel and tourism, a key industry in many countries, includes lodging, restaurants, travel agencies, and tourist services. It is a top sector in U.S. cross-border services trade and a primary source of foreign exchange for smaller countries. The tourism industry relies on various service sectors like transportation, construction, advertising, and telecommunications. It is evolving due to technology advancements like the Internet. The industry is indirectly impacted by regulations related to immigration, transportation, foreign exchange, and construction standards. Banking and financial services encompass activities such as deposits, lending, and brokering securities. The financial services industry includes activities such as deposits, lending, brokering securities, insurance, managing assets, and financial planning. American firms are competitive globally in this complex sector critical for protecting assets and facilitating capital flow. Rapid technological changes, especially the Internet, have enabled international transactions in insurance, deposits, and securities. The financial services industry involves activities like deposits, lending, securities brokering, and insurance. Many countries have relaxed regulations to allow foreign ownership, but the sector remains heavily regulated to protect investors and ensure stability. Regulations like deposit insurance and licensing requirements aim to maintain a healthy financial system and protect customers. Foreign banks and insurance companies face restrictions on direct investment, services, and facilities in different countries. The United States is collaborating with trading partners to establish rules on trade in services, including multilateral rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATS) administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO). The World Trade Organization (WTO) administers rules on trade in services, which are also part of various free trade agreements. Multilateral negotiations on services trade began over 25 years ago, with the US pushing for inclusion in trade agreements despite initial reluctance from developing countries. The Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986 led to the inclusion of services in trade agreements, resulting in the creation of the GATS under the WTO. The GATS sets rules for trade in services among over 100 countries and is part of ongoing WTO negotiations since 2001. The agreement, completed by 1993, defines the scope of the GATS and aims to reduce government barriers to trade in services. The GATS aims to reduce government barriers to trade in services at all levels and modes of delivery. It includes principles like most-favored-nation treatment, transparency, and obligations for monopoly suppliers. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, binding each member to their commitments. It prohibits imposing less favorable treatment than committed to, limits on foreign service suppliers, and requires national treatment for service suppliers from other member countries. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, binding each member to their commitments. It allows further reductions in trade barriers for services and applies national treatment to foreign service providers. The obligations under Part III are restricted to services listed in each member's schedule of commitments, following a positive list approach to trade commitments. The GATS includes schedules of commitments for each member country, which are the core of the agreement. Parts IV-VI contain technical but important elements, such as the requirement for new negotiations to expand coverage and resolve conflicts through the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. The agreement also has annexes, including one on MFN exemptions and a \"prudential carve out\" for governments to take prudent actions to protect investors or the national financial system, even if they conflict with GATS obligations. The GATS evaluations range from pessimistic views criticizing limited accomplishments and restrictive commitments to optimistic views seeing the establishment of GATS as a significant achievement despite initial resistance. Critics question the positive list approach for trade liberalization negotiations. The GATS required WTO members to start new negotiations on services in 2000 as part of the WTO \"built-in agenda,\" ensuring continued negotiations even without a new full round. The negotiations aimed to address issues like giving credit to governments that had liberalized their services sectors and providing special treatment to least developed countries. The new GATS negotiations began in February 2000. The GATS negotiations started in February 2000, with little progress made in the DDA services negotiations. Participants were disappointed with the offers made at the December 2005 Ministerial meeting in Hong Kong. Participants were disappointed with the offers made in the DDA services negotiations. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA after the G-6 members failed to agree on basic conditions for agriculture and NAMA negotiations. Progress on services negotiations remains stagnant due to the division between developed and developing countries. The progress in services negotiations in the DDA has been hindered by the reluctance of some countries to open their markets to competition, the impact of stalled agriculture and non-agriculture market access talks, and the complexity of the agenda with various stakeholders involved. Developing countries are waiting for commitments from the US and EU to reduce agriculture subsidies before improving their offers. The progress in services negotiations in the DDA is hindered by reluctance to open markets, stalled talks in agriculture and non-agriculture, and the complexity of the agenda. Factors affecting completion include political will, willingness to compromise, and resolution of market access issues. Negotiators are focusing on services negotiations, but progress is uncertain. WTO Director-General suspended DDA negotiations in 2006 due to disagreements. Talks resumed in 2007, but consensus on objectives has not been reached. The United States has bilateral and regional trade agreements in place. NAFTA, the largest free trade agreement involving the United States, covers a broad range of services trade. Chapter 12 of NAFTA addresses most cross-border services trade, excluding financial services, services purchased by state enterprises or governments, and international air transportation. Services related to the provider's commercial presence in the consumer's country are covered in Chapter 11 on foreign direct investment. Chapter 12 of NAFTA requires Canada, the United States, and Mexico to provide national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment to each other's services and service providers. Exceptions can be made in certain sectors listed in Annex II and non-discriminatory quotas listed in Annex V. The three parties also list their commitments to liberalize cross-border trade in services in Annex VI, with a major controversy arising over trucking services. The Clinton Administration banned Mexican truckers' access beyond the border regions in 1995 due to safety concerns. An arbitration panel under NAFTA ruled in 2001 that the U.S. was violating its obligations but could impose safety requirements on Mexican trucks. Certification of Mexican truck safety was required before access to the entire U.S. was allowed. The Department of Transportation launched a pilot program in September 6, 2007, allowing some Mexican trucks to deliver goods in the United States, despite opposition from the Teamsters' Union and some Members of Congress. The U.S.-Israeli FTA, effective since August 1985, focuses on trade rather than services. The U.S.-Jordan FTA came into force on December 17, 2001. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force on December 17, 2001, covering trade in services. The agreement requires commitments to open up services trade no less liberal than those under the GATS. The U.S. has several other FTAs in force with provisions on services trade, reflecting the sector's significance in the U.S. economy and global competitiveness of U.S. firms. The services sector is broad and poses policy challenges for U.S. policymakers as they work on trade agreements. Negotiations are complex due to barriers, disputes, and changing characteristics. The U.S. pushes for liberalization to benefit competitive services providers in global markets. The United States faces pressure from its partners to make concessions that may harm certain industries, requiring U.S. negotiators and Congress to assess if trade agreements are in the country's best interests."
