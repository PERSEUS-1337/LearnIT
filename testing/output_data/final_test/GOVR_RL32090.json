    "content": "On October 29, House and Senate appropriators announced a conference agreement on H.R. 3289, a bill providing supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill was approved by the House and Senate and signed into law by the President on November 6. The conference agreement rejected a Senate proposal for Iraq reconstruction assistance to be provided as loans. On September 17, the White House requested $87.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2004 from Congress. The Defense Department and the Coalition Provisional Authority provided additional information on the request. Congressional committees held hearings and debated various legislative proposals related to the funding. The Senate approved the conference agreement on H.R. 3289 on November 3. The White House requested $87.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2004 from Congress. Congressional committees debated measures to require reports on Iraq policy, roll back tax reductions, encourage allied contributions, transfer control of Iraq reconstruction, and ensure fair competition on contracts. The major issue was whether to provide Iraq reconstruction funds as grants or loans. Congressional action included approving the conference agreement on H.R. 3289 and discussing long-term costs and funding for ongoing military operations and reconstruction. The Administration requested $87 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2004, with $65.6 billion for defense and $21.4 billion for foreign policy programs. Of the defense funding, $51.5 billion was for ongoing military operations in Iraq, $10.5 billion for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and $3.6 billion for homeland defense and support to allies. For foreign policy programs, $20.3 billion was allocated for security and reconstruction in Iraq, $800 million for Afghanistan, and $200 million for other Global War on Terrorism initiatives. The Administration requested $87 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2004, with $65.6 billion for defense and $21.4 billion for foreign policy programs. This included $51.5 billion for ongoing military operations in Iraq, $10.5 billion for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and $3.6 billion for homeland defense and support to allies. The request aimed to cover pressing requirements for the next year to fifteen months, with funds allocated for diplomatic facilities, peacekeeping costs, and ongoing military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The Administration requested $87 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2004, with $65.6 billion for defense and $21.4 billion for foreign policy programs. Troop levels and operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere would remain unchanged through the fiscal year. The $20 billion requested for reconstruction in Iraq only covers a portion of the estimated $50-75 billion needed in the long run. Total projected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion. The White House projected reconstruction costs for Iraq amount to $55 billion through 2007, with $17.5 billion needed in 2004 alone. Iraqi oil revenues and international support are expected to help meet these needs, but there is concern that government operations will consume most of the oil money, leaving little for reconstruction efforts in the near term. The request for $87 billion in defense and reconstruction assistance is in addition to over $110 billion already provided for these purposes since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Defense funding for military operations, homeland defense, and the war in Iraq has been allocated through various appropriations bills. Since September 11, Congress has provided approximately $12 billion for Iraqi and Afghan reconstruction and foreign aid in the global war on terrorism. Specifically, $1.4 billion has been allocated for Afghanistan and $2.5 billion for Iraq through the Emergency Wartime Supplemental. The April FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental provided $2.5 billion in foreign operations funding for relief and reconstruction, with $1.6 billion allocated for Iraq. Debate in Congress focused on cost issues, including the impact on the federal budget, transparency of cost projections, and future costs. The Office of Management and Budget's mid-session review of the budget is also discussed. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mid-session review estimated federal budget deficits of $455 billion in FY2003 and $475 billion in FY2004. White House officials projected a deficit of about $525 billion for FY2004 with additional appropriations of $87 billion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline projected deficits of $401 billion in FY2003 and $480 billion in FY2004, including additional supplemental appropriations for military activities. The FY2004 budget included appropriations for military activities in Iraq and elsewhere, similar to FY2003. Reconstruction assistance for Iraq and Afghanistan saw a significant increase in the FY2004 request. Administration officials believed the economy could handle the additional federal borrowing for the supplemental, citing OMB projections of a deficit totaling 4.4% of GDP. Congressional critics argued that funding for domestic programs has been limited, and borrowing 20%-25% of the federal budget is irresponsible. Some expressed concerns about the long-term impact of continuing deficits on the economy. Some Members of Congress argued for financing Iraq's reconstruction costs as loans due to future oil revenue potential. Administration officials were hesitant to provide long-term cost estimates for the war with Iraq. Senator Levin mentioned former White House economic advisor Larry Lindsey's projection of $100-200 billion for the conflict. The White House dismissed Larry Lindsey's projection of $100-200 billion for the war with Iraq, stating costs would be around $50 billion. Some legislators accused the Administration of withholding cost projections to avoid impacting support for tax cut legislation. Independent estimates were prepared for war and post-war expenses. Several independent estimates projected higher costs for the war with Iraq, taking into account post-war peacekeeping and reconstruction costs. Estimates of reconstruction costs became a focus, with the Administration requesting $20 billion for Iraq. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz mentioned that Iraq's oil revenues could bring in $50-100 billion over the next two years. The U.S. government underestimated Iraq reconstruction costs, attributing the damage to Saddam Hussein's regime. The country is capable of financing its own reconstruction, with estimates of $50-100 billion from oil revenues over the next few years. The infrastructure of the country is fragile, with poorly managed water systems and denied services to the people. Questions remain about the accuracy of military and reconstruction cost projections in Iraq, with officials believing no need for more U.S. troops due to progress in organizing Iraqi security forces and expected contributions from other nations. Cost projections assume current force levels and pace of operations will be maintained. The current pace of operations and force levels are assumed to remain the same for the next year. The security situation's improvement is debated, along with questions about the Defense Department's funding request, including concerns about war-related emergencies and potential understated costs. The funding request for Army forces does not include money for reconstituting or resetting equipment to pre-war standards, which could lead to challenges in maintaining current force levels. Some members of Congress suggest increasing the Army's size to alleviate pressure, but this would take time and cost $9-10 billion annually. Officials underestimated Iraq's infrastructure weakness during reconstruction efforts. The reconstruction of Iraq's infrastructure was originally underestimated, leading to challenges in estimating costs and funding sources. The current reconstruction financing gap is uncertain, with varying projections from officials. The upcoming Madrid donor conference is expected to pledge around $2 billion for Iraq in 2004. U.N. officials estimate $2 billion will be pledged for Iraq in 2004. The World Bank plans to recommend $1 billion in loans to Iraq. The duration of U.S. military presence in Iraq remains uncertain, with differing opinions on how long it will be necessary. The House Budget Committee Democratic Staff projects the long-term cost of the war in Iraq to be over $178 billion, potentially exceeding $400 billion. Legislative measures include proposals for congressional oversight, taxes, domestic priorities, additional funding for programs, health insurance for military reservists, competitive contracting, and limitations on corporate profits. The congressional debate on oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq includes proposals for extensive reporting on economic and security situations, attacks on military and civilian personnel, security plans, costs, international participation, self-government timeline, and military personnel projections. Senator Feinstein and other Democratic Senators introduced a bill, S. 1594, for this purpose. The congressional debate on oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq includes proposals for extensive reporting on economic and security situations, attacks on military and civilian personnel, security plans, costs, international participation, self-government timeline, and military personnel projections. Senator Feinstein and other Democratic Senators introduced a bill, S. 1594, for this purpose. In response, the Senate and House have adopted amendments to impose reporting requirements on the Administration. Senator Biden proposed offsetting costs of the supplemental by delaying tax cuts for the top 1% of taxpayers for one year. Senator Biden, along with other Senators, proposed an amendment to limit the reduction in the top income tax rate to increase revenues by $87 billion. The House Appropriations Committee discussed offsetting costs by reversing tax cuts and criticized the Administration for opposing domestic spending while requesting more funds for programs in Iraq. Several measures were debated in Congress regarding funding for domestic and international programs, including additional funds for homeland security and AmeriCorps. An amendment to add $880 million for international HIV/AIDS was tabled by the Senate. Senator Stabenow's amendment to reduce Iraq reconstruction funding by $5 billion and transfer the money to domestic priorities was rejected by the Senate. In FY2004, the U.S. committed $3 billion for various purposes, including Liberia peacekeeping and Sudan reconstruction. The Senate approved $200 million for Liberia, while the enacted bill provided $200 million plus $245 million for U.N. peacekeeping in Liberia. An amendment was passed to offer health insurance to non-active duty reservists and their families through the DOD TRICARE program, estimated to cost $500 million in FY2004 and over $2 billion in total. The provision to offer health insurance to non-active duty reservists and their families through the DOD TRICARE program was estimated to cost $500 million in FY2004 and over $2 billion by FY2008. The Administration threatened to veto the authorization if this provision was included, leading supporters to consider offering it as an amendment to the supplemental bill. The Senate approved an amendment providing health insurance to unemployed or ineligible reservists, sparking debate over companies like Halliburton earning excessive profits from non-competitive contracts for U.S. forces in Iraq. Several legislators proposed measures to address excessive profits in reconstruction activities in Iraq. Representative Maloney introduced the Clean Contracting in Iraq Act of 2003 (H.R. 3275), while the Senate Appropriations Committee approved an amendment by Senator Leahy to penalize fraud and profiteering on contracts for Iraq. The House version of the bill included restrictions on non-competitive procedures for reconstruction contracts, with additional amendments tightening reporting requirements. A combination of these proposals was included in the enacted legislation. Several Members proposed amendments to convert a portion of the $20.3 billion Iraq reconstruction request into loans guaranteed by Iraqi oil, rather than grants. The Senate passed a measure to convert $10 billion of funding to loans, with the condition that the U.S. would treat them as grants if foreign creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. These efforts were a key issue during congressional deliberations but were ultimately dropped from the enacted bill. Senator Dorgan also attempted to shift grants to loans, but his amendments were unsuccessful. During congressional deliberations, there were various proposals to convert a portion of the $20.3 billion Iraq reconstruction request into loans collateralized by Iraqi oil revenue. The Senate passed a measure to convert $10 billion of funding to loans, contingent on foreign creditors canceling 90% of Iraq's debt. However, these efforts were ultimately dropped from the final bill. Senator Dorgan also tried to shift grants to loans, but his amendments were unsuccessful. The U.S. proposed a Trust Fund for economic development projects in Iraq, with a matching pledge from other donors. If not established in six months, $10 billion would go to reconstruction loans. Legal questions arose about accepting sovereign loans and concerns about Iraq's debt. Congressional actions included marking up bills for funding military and reconstruction. The House and Senate approved a supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 3289, for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill was signed into law as P.L. 108-106 on November 6, with $65.560 billion allocated for defense as requested. The Senate committee bill rejected an Administration proposal to revise military personnel benefits and extended an increase in Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowances through FY2004. It provided an additional $962 million for Army operations and maintenance, including funding for body armor, battlefield ordinance cleanup, and communications equipment for troops in conflict areas. The Senate committee bill provided funding for Army operations and maintenance, including body armor and communications equipment. It also allowed for the transfer of $2.5 billion among defense accounts without advance congressional approval, with an additional $5 billion subject to approval by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Senator Byrd proposed measures to limit funding flexibility and allocated $200 million for training and equipment for the Iraqi and Afghan armies. The Senate committee bill provided $1.0 billion for coalition support in Iraq, Afghanistan, and nearby regional nations, $400 million less than requested. Debate focused on reconstruction funds, with amendments by Senator Byrd rejected. $21.445 billion was allocated for Iraq, Afghanistan, and global war on terrorism. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the total funding request of $20.3 billion for Iraq reconstruction, providing flexibility for allocation. They deleted $60.5 million for U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq, reallocating it for urgent needs in Afghanistan. The Senate panel made several additions and changes to the FY2003 supplemental funds for Iraq reconstruction, including earmarking $100 million for democracy-building activities, requiring competitive contracting procedures, applying USAID standards for disabled persons, ensuring religious freedom in the Iraqi constitution, prohibiting funds for Saddam Hussein's debts, and imposing penalties for war profiteering and fraud. During Senate Committee markup, two amendments by Senator Dorgan related to reducing U.S. costs of rebuilding Iraq were tabled. The first proposed creating an Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority using future oil revenues for financing, while the second aimed to convert reconstruction grants to loans. Opponents argued that increasing Iraq's debt would complicate stabilizing the economy. During Senate Committee markup, an amendment by Senator Harkin to reduce reconstruction funds to $10 billion and delay additional requests was tabled (15-14). The bill also approved a $100 million emergency fund for foreign crises and authorized $200 million for Pakistan debt relief. Additionally, $50 million was proposed for Emergencies in the Diplomatic. S. 1689 adds $41 million for specific purposes: reimbursement to New York City for protecting foreign missions since September 11, costs of the 2003 Free Trade Area of the Americas Ministerial meeting. The Senate also included funds for USAID operating expenses in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as construction of more secure overseas USAID facilities. Amendments were debated, including one to reduce Iraq reconstruction funds. Byrd proposed cutting $15.2 billion from the $20.3 billion requested for Iraq reconstruction for further review (rejected 38-59 on October 1). Biden's amendment to suspend tax reductions for Iraq security costs was tabled (57-42 on October 2). Daschle and Graham's amendment to offer health insurance to unemployed reservists and their families under TRICARE was adopted (October 2). The Senate adopted a $10 billion loan for Iraq reconstruction (51-47 on October 16). Reed-Hagel proposed adding 10,000 active duty personnel. The Senate approved a $10 billion loan for Iraq reconstruction on October 16, along with various amendments to cut funding for specific projects and redirect funds to other areas such as HIV/AIDS prevention and assistance for Liberia. The issue of financing Iraq reconstruction was extensively discussed during Senate deliberations. The Senate approved a $10 billion loan for Iraq reconstruction on October 16, despite strong White House objections. The loan could be converted into grants if international creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. There was also discussion about creating an Iraq Reconstruction Trust Fund governed by a Board of Trustees. The Senate approved a $10 billion loan for Iraq reconstruction on October 16, despite White House objections. The loan could become grants if international creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. A proposed amendment would have directed $10 billion to an Iraq Reconstruction Trust Fund, governed by a Board of Trustees representing top country contributors. Senator Hutchison did not bring up her amendment for a vote. Another proposal by Senators Bayh and Nelson would have required countries owed debt by Iraq to be paid before non-security reconstruction funds are obligated. After the Senate approved a $10 billion loan for Iraq reconstruction on October 16, an amendment was proposed to prioritize paying off countries owed debt by Iraq before using non-security reconstruction funds. This amendment was not debated, as the Senate had already adopted a similar Bayh/Nelson amendment. Overall, the Senate acted on almost 50 amendments during the seven days of debate, adopting 47 and rejecting 16, including amendments requiring competitive procedures for contracts over $1 million for military and reconstruction purposes in Iraq. Several amendments were proposed in the Senate, including prioritizing women's issues in reconstruction programs in Iraq and Afghanistan, requiring a report on efforts to increase contributions for Iraq reconstruction, offering health insurance to reservists and their families, and increasing funding for up-armored vehicles. Several Senate amendments were proposed, including increasing funds for up-armored vehicles, preventing reconstruction funds from repaying foreign debts, allowing citizens held as POWs in the Gulf War to pursue damages in court, permitting the export of military equipment to Iraqi forces, urging forgiveness of Iraqi debt by foreign countries, providing funds for a National Guard family assistance program, and allocating funds for defense facilities. Several Senate amendments were proposed, including funding for defense facilities damaged by Hurricane Isabel, allowing military personnel to take leave for deployment-related business, ensuring federal employees activated for service receive their normal pay, making relief for hospitalized uniformed service members retroactive, cutting funds for specific Iraq construction projects and Iraqi oil imports. Several Senate amendments were proposed, including funding for defense facilities damaged by Hurricane Isabel, military personnel leave for deployment-related business, federal employees activated for service receive normal pay, relief for hospitalized uniformed service members retroactive, cutting funds for specific Iraq construction projects and Iraqi oil imports. Amendments rejected included additional funds for assistance to Liberia, conflict resolution activities, prioritizing aircraft equipping for homeland defense, additional medical care funds for the Department of Veterans Affairs, and various reports on Iraq reconstruction and security. The Senate rejected several proposed amendments, including ones for additional funding for safety equipment for US forces in Iraq, awarding the Iraqi Liberation Medal, reducing Iraq reconstruction funds for domestic programs, and requiring Iraqi-related reports. Several programs were tabled by various senators, including requirements for Iraqi oil revenues to fund reconstruction, limitations on non-security Iraq reconstruction funds, prohibition of contracts with certain corporations, matching future funding for Iraq with foreign contributions, and establishment of an Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority. Several amendments were tabled by senators, including reducing Iraq reconstruction funds by $879 million for HIV/AIDS prevention and research, establishing a National Commission on Intelligence Related to Iraq, shifting $600 million to secure and destroy weapons in Iraq, and prohibiting involuntary deployment overseas for National Guard and Reserves members. Several amendments were tabled by senators, including reducing Iraq reconstruction funds by $879 million for HIV/AIDS prevention and research, establishing a National Commission on Intelligence Related to Iraq, shifting $600 million to secure and destroy weapons in Iraq, and prohibiting involuntary deployment overseas for National Guard and Reserves members. Additionally, amendments were proposed by Senators Byrd, Brownback, Reid, and Lincoln to reallocate funds for reconstruction in Iraq, the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps, Afghanistan, Liberia, and disaster relief efforts. The House marked up its version of a supplemental appropriations bill (H.R. 3289) on October 9, providing $86.9 billion in total, with adjustments to funds for Iraq and Afghanistan reconstruction, and reallocation of funds for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq.

The House debated on various amendments to the bill, including a proposal to convert all reconstruction grants to loans. Some amendments were ruled out of order for constituting legislation on an appropriations bill. Chairman C.W. \"Bill\" Young of Florida introduced amendments to exempt servicemembers. Several amendments were proposed during the House debate on the bill, including exemptions for servicemembers with combat-related injuries from meal requirements while hospitalized, funding for women and girls in Afghanistan, tightening reporting requirements for non-competitive contracts, prohibiting funds for Iraq to participate in OPEC, transferring funds to the Family Advocacy Program, and providing funds for domestic travel for Army personnel on rest and recuperation leave.

On October 21, the House approved a motion to instruct House conferees to accept Senate provisions, including providing medical screening for military reservists before mobilization and extending transitional health care and benefits to military personnel for 180 days. The House approved Senate provisions for military personnel, including medical screening for reservists before mobilization and extending health care benefits for 180 days. The President's advisors warned of a possible veto if the bill included loans for Iraq reconstruction, opposed funding for veterans' health, and providing health insurance for non-deployed military reservists and their dependents. The House-Senate conference considered providing Iraq reconstruction funds as loans, but ultimately rejected the proposal. The conference agreement includes $500 million for FEMA disaster relief and eliminates a House provision for Senate confirmation of Iraq reconstruction aid coordination. The House-Senate conference agreement cuts the Administration's request for Iraq Relief and Reconstruction by $1.655 billion, directing $210 million for aid to Jordan, Liberia, and Sudan. It provides $1.2 billion for Afghan reconstruction, $245 million for U.N. peacekeeping in Liberia, $200 million for economic aid to Pakistan, and earmarks $200 million for Liberian relief aid and $10 million for Sudan humanitarian assistance. The conference report includes $200 million in economic aid to Pakistan and a modified Senate measure for health insurance for non-active duty reservists. It rejects a Senate provision to increase Army end-strength by 10,000 personnel and provides funds for repairing Hurricane Isabel damage at military facilities. Additionally, it allocates funds for munitions security and destruction. The conference report includes provisions for economic aid to Pakistan, health insurance for non-active duty reservists, repairing Hurricane Isabel damage at military facilities, and funds for munitions security and destruction in Iraq. It also includes a provision to move $858 million from defense to foreign operations for operating expenses in Iraq, provides $3 billion in transfer authority to the Secretary of Defense, imposes reporting requirements, and requires competition on certain matters. The Administration's proposal allocates $66 billion of the $87 billion total for military and intelligence operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The Senate Appropriations Committee fully funded defense, with additional funds for Army operations and maintenance and weapons procurement. The House Appropriations Committee cut $289 million from the defense total, adding funds for Army weapons procurement. Congressional action on FY2004 appropriations is detailed in Table 3. The request for FY2004 supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense includes funding flexibility, authority to train and equip foreign military forces, and military personnel benefits. The request is based on maintaining current force levels and pace of operations, with a reduction in Army combat divisions in Iraq. This will not significantly impact the total number of personnel deployed in Southwest Asia in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The request for FY2004 supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense is based on the use of the \"Contingency Operations Support Tool\" (COST) model developed by the Institute for Defense Analyses. This model helps estimate costs of military operations by considering various factors like duration, number of units deployed, transportation, and historical cost data. While not considered \"budget quality\" data, it provides detailed breakdowns of projected costs in advance of an operation. The Defense Department is using COST model data for estimating war costs, which are considered reliable projections. The new cost estimates are higher per troop compared to Congressional Budget Office estimates. The Department did not provide COST model figures to Congress before the war due to uncertainty in force size and composition. Flexibility in Defense Department funding is an ongoing issue between the Administration and Congress. The Defense Department requested $2.0 billion to be appropriated into the Iraq Freedom Fund, which is a contingency fund for potential military deployments. Congress agreed to provide $15.7 billion in the fund, with some funds subject to expenditure ceilings. This fund may be used to support a multinational division or deploy Army National Guard brigades and Marine forces if needed. The Defense Department requested authority to transfer $5 billion between appropriations accounts, with notification to Congress within five days. They also requested $500 million for a contingency construction account for military projects not otherwise authorized by law. The Defense Department's request includes a proposal to use up to $200 million for training and equipping military forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other regional nations for counter-terrorism operations. Additionally, there is $1.4 billion allocated for coalition support in the new request. The new request includes $1.4 billion for coalition support and additional amounts to lift and sustain multinational forces in the region of Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress has rejected Administration requests for funds to train and equip foreign militaries, with the Senate Appropriations Committee agreeing to provide $200 million for training the new Iraqi Army and Afghan National Army. In April 2003, Congress increased Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance for military personnel, with benefits extended through October 31, 2003. The Defense Department requested the payments to continue through December 31, 2003 in their supplemental proposal. The Defense Department requested to provide $225 per month in additional Hardship Duty Pay to personnel serving in combat zones in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, aiming to equalize pay between troops deployed in combat zones. However, opposition may arise from military advocacy groups and Congress due to potential pay decreases for troops not deployed in combat zones. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees rejected the request and extended increased Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance through FY2004. Another issue in Senate action was whether to provide health insurance for non-deployed military reservists. The Senate approved an amendment to allow non-activated military reservists to sign up for health insurance through TRICARE. The Administration threatened to veto the authorization if this provision is included. The Daschle-Graham amendment offers health insurance to reservists who are receiving unemployment compensation or not eligible for employer-sponsored health insurance, with a 28% co-payment requirement. The Daschle-Graham amendment offers health insurance to non-activated military reservists through TRICARE, with a 28% co-payment requirement. The Administration sought $21.44 billion for reconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, with $20.4 billion allocated for Iraq. Congress appropriated $9.6 billion in FY2003 for similar activities and is considering funding requests totaling $4.9 billion in the pending FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriation bill. The Administration and Senate bill included funding for CPA operating expenses in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration proposed reallocating funds from Baghdad facilities to urgent USAID needs in Afghanistan. The Senate bill provided separate funding for USAID in Afghanistan, making funds available for U.S. diplomatic facilities in Baghdad. The House bill and conference agreement allocated $35.8 million for a new U.S. mission in Iraq. The House bill and conference agreement allocated $35.8 million for a new U.S. mission in Iraq and rescinded $35.8 million provided in P.L. 108-11. Peacekeeping funds are available for both Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration is reprogramming $390 million for Afghan reconstruction. $40 million for USAID operating expenses in Afghanistan was provided in the Senate bill and conference agreement. The House bill provided $100 million in disaster and famine relief aid for Liberia and Sudan, while the Senate bill designated $200 million for Liberia from the Emergency Crises Fund account. The conference agreement allocated $210 million for Liberia and Sudan from various accounts. The Administration proposed $11 million for security operations in Afghanistan under the Diplomatic and Consular Services account. The Senate bill provided $35.8 million for security operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The House bill allocated $156.3 million in the D&CS account, with $109.5 million for MRV fees and consular services, $11 million for security measures in Afghanistan, and $35.8 million for a diplomatic mission in Iraq. The conference agreement provided $115.5 million for Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Services, with $50 million for rewards and $65.5 million for security measures in New York City and protection for foreign missions. The Administration requested $200 million for debt reduction in Pakistan from Economic Support Funds. The conference agreement included the authority for debt reduction and a $200 million appropriation. The $20.3 billion Administration request for reconstruction and security in Iraq was a significant increase from previous amounts. The aim was to address the pressing needs in Iraq, focusing on security and infrastructure concerns. The $20.3 billion Administration request for reconstruction and security in Iraq aimed to improve security capabilities, infrastructure, and judicial system. The funding would target training and equipment for border, customs, police, and fire personnel, as well as developing a new Iraqi army and Civil Defense Corps. The majority of the funding would go towards rapid improvements in infrastructure such as electricity, oil infrastructure, water, transportation, housing, roads, bridges, hospitals, and health clinics. These investments were deemed urgent for the next 12 months but did not cover all reconstruction requirements for the coming year. The Administration requested $20.3 billion for reconstruction and security in Iraq, focusing on improving security capabilities, infrastructure, and the judicial system. Additional funds were requested for government reform, agriculture, economic development, and education. $300 million was allocated for private sector growth and job training programs. The House bill excluded funding for Iraq traffic police and two prisons, while reducing funding for the National Security Communications Network. The conference agreement excluded funds for various projects including consultants for development, emergency supplies of oil products, water and sewerage services, solid waste management, environmental restoration projects, a telephone numbering system, postal information architecture, and housing. The conference agreement excluded funds for various projects including consultants for development, emergency supplies of oil products, water and sewerage services, solid waste management, environmental restoration projects, a telephone numbering system, postal information architecture, and housing. Additionally, key policy objectives of the Bush Administration in Iraq included restoring basic human services and the economic and political reconstruction of the country under the Coalition Provisional Authority led by Ambassador L. Paul Bremer. The CPA has initiated a process for Iraqi self-rule by appointing a 25-member Iraqi Governing Council with specific powers and duties. Local councils have been encouraged to address community needs, while institutions of civil and economic society have been reconstituted with CPA funding. Essential services like schools, hospitals, and the oil-for-food program continue to operate. New police and security forces are being trained, and infrastructure renovation projects are underway. Since the U.S. occupation began in April, efforts have been made to rebuild infrastructure and stimulate the economy in Iraq. However, the occupation authority has faced challenges in restoring order, security, and implementing political and economic reforms. The $20.3 billion supplemental request aimed to address these needs crucial for achieving U.S. objectives in Iraq. The Administration had suggested that the cost of reconstruction in Iraq could be met by a national budget of $8.2 billion, with $3.9 billion coming from oil revenue, taxes, and profits. The remaining deficit of $4.3 billion would be covered by frozen assets, the Development Fund for Iraq, and U.S. assistance. Iraq was projected to have $1.1 billion remaining for reconstruction by the end of December 2003. The re-assessment of Iraq's reconstruction needs indicated a larger demand for revenue than previously projected, with uncertainties surrounding oil export production and donor contributions. A supplemental reconstruction request was nearly 20% larger than the projected national budget for Iraq. The request aimed to address immediate needs in the 2004 fiscal year, based on a needs assessment conducted by the World Bank and the U.N. Development Program. The U.N. Development Program conducted a needs assessment of 14 Iraqi economic and social sectors, estimating reconstruction costs at $36 billion over four years. This does not include an additional $19.4 billion for security, oil, and other critical sectors. Total projected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion, with concerns about Iraqi oil revenues and international donor contributions. The United States may face increased financial demands to meet projected Iraqi needs. The Bank/UNDP report suggests that Iraq may not be able to handle more than $6 billion in infrastructure program commitments in 2004 due to security concerns and slow implementation. The Administration's request for infrastructure was $12.4 billion, intended to cover 18 months. The request in categories like electric power and water may meet needs beyond 18 months. The Administration had initially expected Iraq to fund most of the reconstruction costs through oil exports. Iraq's oil exports are crucial for funding reconstruction efforts, but production challenges and sabotage have lowered expectations. Current production is around 2 million barrels per day, with a goal of reaching 2.8 million. Potential revenues could range from $18.5 billion to $23 billion annually. Future production levels of 6 million barrels per day would require significant investment. Administration officials anticipate $12 billion in revenues over the next 12 months, covering government expenses. The Administration anticipates generating $12 billion in revenues over the next 12 months, covering government operating expenses but not urgent reconstruction needs. $503 million has already been allocated for oil facility repairs from the 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental, with a request for $2.1 billion in FY2004. Some funds for Iraqi security forces aim to defend against oil facility sabotage. There is a debate on whether reconstruction assistance should be in the form of loans or grants, considering Iraq's future oil revenues. Iraq's future oil revenues could be used to service debt incurred for rebuilding infrastructure, potentially through loans managed by the World Bank. The Administration proposed offering the $20.3 billion supplemental as grants to avoid adding to Iraq's existing substantial debt obligations. G7 leaders agreed to suspend Iraq's debt servicing requirements through 2004 to allow for a multilateral debt restructuring arrangement. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 states that Iraqi oil exports or proceeds could be utilized for this purpose. The U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 prohibits attaching Iraqi oil exports for debt until 2007 without authorization. The World Bank may manage a reconstruction fund for Iraq, but a sovereign Iraq authority must assume debt obligations. Legal scholars argue that the Coalition Provisional Authority, as the temporary government, cannot incur new debts on behalf of Iraq. The occupying power cannot incur new debts on behalf of the displaced sovereign, unless the loans were necessary for the welfare of the occupied territory and had fair terms. Congressional appropriation would be needed for loan reconstruction assistance, based on factors like loan terms and repayment likelihood. The subsidy appropriation under the 1990 Credit Reform Act must be provided in advance for U.S. government loans or guarantees, considering the uncertainty of Iraqi economy and debt service payments. The Senate considered converting $10 billion of reconstruction grants to loans, which could be restored as grants if foreign creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Various senators proposed amendments for using Iraqi oil to secure reconstruction financing and converting U.S. grants to loans, but these were rejected. Senator Hutchison submitted an amendment directing $10 billion of the reconstruction supplemental to a Trust. The Senate debated directing $10 billion of reconstruction funds to a World Bank Trust Fund, with proposals to convert grants to loans. Representative Wamp withdrew an amendment tying funds to the election of a new Iraqi leader. Representative Obey's amendments to shift funds to a World Bank loan facility and grants to loans were defeated. The impact of the supplemental on international donors was a concern. The impact of the supplemental on international donors at the late-October donors' conference was a concern. Some argued that a large U.S. aid pledge before the conference could encourage other donors to contribute more, while opponents of U.S. aid in the form of loans feared it might lead other donors to offer loans instead of grants, increasing Iraq's debt. The supplemental focused on infrastructure and security, areas less likely to be supported by other donors who typically prioritize social sectors like education and health, grassroots democratization, and economic development. Other donors' decisions were influenced by various factors. At a September 6 meeting in Brussels, donors discussed creating Iraq reconstruction trust funds managed by the U.N. or World Bank to address concerns about being perceived as supporting a unilateral U.S. policy. The Madrid donors' conference established two trust funds, one managed by the World Bank and the other by UNDP. Control over fund spending would be handled by a multilateral management board including officials from international organizations, major donors, and Iraqis representing interim ministries. The management of Iraq reconstruction funds by U.S. agencies became a significant issue during congressional debate on the $2.475 billion appropriation in P.L. 108-11. The White House wanted flexibility over the distribution of resources, including the ability to transfer funding to the Defense Department. This proposal sparked controversy, with critics arguing that aid programs should remain under the policy direction of the State Department. The White House gained control over reconstruction funds for Iraq, managed by L. Paul Bremer under DOD guidance. The $20.3 billion was allocated among five agencies, including DOD, with the establishment of the Iraq Stabilization Group. The establishment of the new \"Iraq Stabilization Group\" led by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice aims to expedite reconstruction efforts by addressing decision-making disputes in Washington. The State Department is expected to have a greater role in reconstruction policy, with its staff in Iraq set to increase. Despite this, Ambassador Bremer will still report to the Secretary of Defense. The Senate rejected an amendment that would have placed the CPA under the direct authority of the Secretary of State. The House bill included a provision prohibiting coordination of defense or reconstruction activities in Iraq or Afghanistan by a U.S. government officer. The House Committee wanted to ensure that the person in charge of coordinating reconstruction efforts in Iraq be available to testify at congressional oversight hearings. The White House argued that the new Iraq Stabilization Group does not affect control of reconstruction efforts, which remains under the Defense Department. However, conferees decided to remove the House-added provision from the legislation. The Administration stated that the FY2004 request only included the most urgent needs for Iraq. The reconstruction request for Iraq in FY2004 faced scrutiny in Congress due to concerns about the costs and the necessity of certain items. The House proposed a $1.655 billion cut in funding, while the Senate reduced reconstruction by $1.855 billion. The Senate and House both proposed significant cuts to Iraq reconstruction funding, with the final legislation reducing the President's proposal by $1.885 billion. Additionally, $210 million was transferred from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund to assist Jordan, Liberia, and Sudan. Afghanistan also received a $1.2 billion supplemental aid request. The $799 million supplemental aid request for Afghanistan included new appropriations and funds from DOD, State Department, and USAID. It aimed to double U.S. assistance for FY2003, focusing on immediate impact projects like security, government authority reinforcement, and voter support. The proposal addressed criticism over aid delivery delays, security issues, and shifting international attention to Iraq. The $799 million supplemental aid request for Afghanistan includes funding for high priority projects, technical experts in Afghan ministries, completion of major highway projects, social programs, and critical infrastructure. The White House also requested an increase in the military drawdown limit from $300 million to $600 million. The enacted legislation increased overall reconstruction funding by $365 million with changes in allocations for infrastructure, governance, and social services. The conference agreement includes an earmark of $60 million for women's programs, including education, anti-abuse programs, shelters, and widows' assistance. The conference agreement amended authorization levels in the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 to align with funding levels in the FY04 Supplemental and H.R. 2800. U.S. assistance in Afghanistan focuses on security, governance, and reconstruction, including establishing security institutions, training the Afghan National Army, demobilizing militias, and forming Provincial Reconstruction. The formation of \"Provincial Reconstruction Teams\" (PRTs) in Afghanistan aims to create secure conditions for aid workers by involving U.S. forces, Defense Department civil affairs officers, aid agency representatives, and Afghan personnel. Despite Taliban groups operating in the southeast, targeting U.S. and Afghan forces, efforts are being made to combat insecurity and support humanitarian operations. The PRTs in Afghanistan, led by various countries, aim to provide safe havens for aid workers, assist with reconstruction, and extend the Kabul government's authority. The U.S. may expand the program to 16 enclaves, with Germany and others taking leadership roles. Reports vary on the effectiveness of PRTs in improving security. Governance and institution building efforts have been ongoing since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Karzai was chosen as chairman of the interim administration and to lead Afghanistan until national elections in 2004. The establishment of a new parliament was not achieved at the loya jirga. A constitutional loya jirga was planned for October 2003 but postponed to December 2003. The draft constitution was released in November 2003. Preparations for the 2004 elections have faced delays, with concerns about regional leaders' power and independence from the central government. The international recovery and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan involves various entities such as the Afghan government, U.N. agencies, bilateral donors, international organizations, and NGOs. The intended outcomes include political stability, access to basic services, economic growth, and long-term independence. Karzai has taken steps to strengthen his authority in Kabul by replacing local leaders, and the U.S. plans to deploy advisers to Afghan ministries to enhance the efficiency of the government ahead of the 2004 elections. Successful reconstruction in Afghanistan is crucial for improving the standard of living, achieving economic growth, and gaining independence from foreign aid. Quick impact programs have transitioned to long-term projects in education, health, and infrastructure. However, some observers note Afghan frustration with slow progress in reconstruction efforts. Many factors are hindering reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, including lack of security, capacity, and funding. Analysts emphasize the need for improved security and progress in reconstruction to sustain donor involvement, attract private investment, and maintain hope for Afghan improvement. Effective reconstruction assistance could reduce war and drug economies, promote economic growth, and include initiatives like road construction and urban redevelopment. Reconstruction initiatives in Afghanistan include road construction, urban redevelopment, infrastructure repair, and programs for women, education, health, and media. The central government's strength and influence are crucial for intervention success. Efforts are being made to accelerate reconstruction with the aim of impacting security, road construction, and the 2004 elections. Additional funding could influence international donor decisions and expand the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Increased funding for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan may lead to concerns about corruption and absorption capacity. Some experts worry about the effectiveness of allocating additional funds quickly. There are also fears that the US support for the Karzai government could be seen as excessive before the upcoming elections. Other countries, like Italy and Germany, are involved in various reconstruction efforts in the country. Italy is advising on judicial reform, Germany is helping establish a national police force, and the US, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are funding the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat highway. Experts believe a long-term commitment is needed for a stable, democratic Afghanistan. International donors have shown willingness to assist in reconstruction, with estimated costs exceeding $15 billion over the next decade. United Nations and Afghan officials state $15 billion is needed over 5 years, but current pledges fall short of these estimates. Some concerns arise as estimates for Iraq reconstruction costs emerge, potentially diverting international donors' focus and resources from Afghan reconstruction. The supplemental proposal includes funds for various foreign policy initiatives related to the Global War on Terrorism. Congress has considered creating a foreign policy contingency fund twice this year. Congress has considered creating a foreign policy contingency fund twice this year, but has been reluctant to support such requests, preferring to allocate resources for specific needs in Iraq and for coalition partners. The House and Senate-passed FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriation bills do not provide money for a Complex Foreign Crises. The supplemental legislation, H.R. 2800, does not include funding for a Complex Foreign Crises Fund as requested by the Administration. Instead, it provides $200 million for Liberia and $10 million for Sudan. Additionally, it extends aid waivers for Pakistan through FY2004 and requests up to $200 million in economic aid to cover debt cancellation. The enacted supplemental legislation includes aid waivers for Pakistan and $200 million in economic aid for Islamabad, which may be used for debt reduction. It also provides $100 million in additional economic aid for Jordan. S. 1689 is an original bill for emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan security and reconstruction. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees considered and passed emergency supplemental appropriations for defense, Iraq, and Afghanistan for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004. The Senate passed the bill with amendments on October 17, 2003, while the House passed it with amendments on the same day.
