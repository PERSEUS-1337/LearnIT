    "content": "EPA has established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six criteria pollutants: particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur oxides (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and lead (Pb). Revisions to the NAAQS for particulates were made in 2006 to protect against health effects from short- and long-term exposure. The standards focus on particles smaller than 10 micrometers (PM10) and fine particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5). In 2006, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter (PM) by lowering the allowable daily concentration of PM 2.5 from 65 \u00b5g/m3 to 35 \u00b5g/m3. The annual PM 2.5 standard remained unchanged, while the 24-hour standard for PM 10 was retained and the annual standard was revoked. These revisions were based on a review of over 2,000 scientific studies conducted between 1997 and 2002. The 2006 particulates NAAQS tightened air quality standards for fine particulate matter, sparking national interest and debate. Concerns were raised about the standards being outside the recommended range by EPA staff and the scientific advisory panel. A U.S. Court of Appeals decision in 2009 partially granted petitions challenging aspects of the revised NAAQS. The D.C. Circuit partially granted petitions challenging aspects of EPA's revised NAAQS for particulate matter in 2006. Various industry and agriculture groups, as well as environmental and public health organizations, filed petitions challenging the standards. The court's decision did not vacate the standards but remanded certain aspects of the annual PM 2.5 standard to EPA for reconsideration. EPA initiated a review of the PM NAAQS in response to a court decision challenging aspects of the 2006 standards. Administrator Lisa P. Jackson proposed tightening the annual health-based standard for PM 2.5 based on scientific evidence. Options for new secondary standards were included, but standards for PM 10 were not modified. EPA is expected to finalize its decision on the PM NAAQS. The EPA is expected to finalize its decision on the PM NAAQS by December 14, 2012. A review of the 2006 standards for particulate matter (PM) is being conducted, with proposed revisions to the PM NAAQS. The report analyzes the costs and benefits of the revised standards and highlights concerns raised by the science advisory committee and Congress. Establishing NAAQS represents the EPA Administrator's judgment on ambient pollution levels to protect public health. Congress mandated EPA to set national air quality standards for pollutants endangering health or welfare. EPA reviews scientific studies every five years to reaffirm or modify NAAQS. The 2006 review found stronger evidence linking particulate exposure to health risks. Since 1997, evidence has strengthened the link between exposure to particulates and various cardiovascular and respiratory health issues. Studies show associations between ambient air PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels, even below the 1997 standards, with excess mortality and morbidity. EPA and CASAC agree that modifying particulates standards is supported by scientific evidence. The 1997 NAAQS for PM 2.5 and PM 10 included annual and daily limits to protect public health. The 24-hour standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10 were modified in 2006 to set new concentration limits. The PM 2.5 standard was strengthened to 35 \u00b5g/m3 for daily exposure, with an annual limit of 15 \u00b5g/m3. The PM 10 standard retained a daily limit of 150 \u00b5g/m3 but changed the exceedance criteria to no more than one per year on average over three years. The EPA revised the standards for fine particulates (PM 2.5) in 2006, setting a daily limit of 35 \u00b5g/m3 and an annual limit of 15 \u00b5g/m3. The agency also proposed replacing the PM 10 standard with a range of 10 to 2.5 micrometers (PM 10-2.5) and a daily limit of 70 \u00b5g/m3. The EPA proposed a new daily standard of 70 \u00b5g/m3 for PM 10-2.5, focusing on urban and industrial sources. States had to submit plans to comply with the NAAQS within three years of issuance. EPA's final decisions on alternative standards and nonattainment areas are discussed in the report. States submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to EPA to achieve NAAQS standards through regulations on products emitting pollutants and emission standards for new stationary sources. The 2006 tightening of PM 2.5 standards increased nonattainment areas, while PM 10 standards remained unchanged. EPA does not require new nonattainment designations for PM 10. The EPA published designations for nonattainment of the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 standard in 31 areas across 18 states, comprising 120 counties. The final nonattainment designation rule became effective on December 14, 2009, tightening the standard and increasing the number of areas designated nonattainment. The designation rule for the 2006 PM NAAQS became effective on December 14, 2009. Publication of the final area designation rule for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS was delayed due to the incoming Administration's review. States must submit \"infrastructure\" plans within three years of NAAQS issuance. Areas designated nonattainment must outline detailed control requirements to meet the 2006 24-hour PM standard. States must outline detailed control requirements in plans to meet the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. If states fail to develop an adequate plan, EPA can impose one. States are required to meet the standard within five years from the effective date of designation, unless an extension is granted. For more information on states' infrastructure and nonattainment area SIPs for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS, refer to CRS Report R40096. The EPA implemented national strategies to achieve attainment with the PM 2.5 NAAQS, including the Regional Haze Rule and federal emission standards. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) was vacated in 2008, leading to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) in 2011, which replaced CAIR's limits. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) replaced CAIR's limits in 2012 and 2014 for 28 states and the District of Columbia. The CSAPR was stayed in 2011 and vacated in 2012 by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, causing disruptions in implementing the 2006 revised PM 2.5 NAAQS. The U.S. Department of Justice sought rehearing of the decision in 2012, which was denied in 2013. The D.C. Circuit denied requests for rehearing on the Cross-State Rule in 2013. EPA has not yet responded to the denial. The rule's implications have sparked interest and debate. The Clean Air Act mandates EPA to prioritize public health in setting NAAQS, without considering costs or feasibility. EPA released a regulatory impact analysis in 2006. The EPA released a regulatory impact analysis in 2006 to meet obligations under Executive Order 12866. The analysis focused on the benefits and costs of implementing the PM 2.5 NAAQS, not the PM 10 standard. The analysis was for illustrative purposes and did not model specific state implementation strategies. The EPA's 2006 regulatory impact analysis focused on implementing the PM 2.5 NAAQS, including discussions on limitations and uncertainties. The analysis incorporated expected impacts of national regulations like the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to lower PM 2.5 concentrations. Despite initial vacating, CAIR was allowed to remain in modified form by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The EPA replaced CAIR with the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) in 2011, which was later vacated in 2012 by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. Department of Justice sought a rehearing of the decision, but it was denied in 2013. EPA has not yet decided on its response to the denial. EPA estimated costs of attaining the revised PM 2.5 standard based on assumptions and control strategies. States will choose programs best suited for their local conditions. The total annual social cost of compliance with the revised standard is estimated at $5.4 billion in 2020. EPA also estimated the monetized benefits of complying with the standard. The monetized benefits of complying with the revised PM 2.5 standard reflect the valuation associated with predicted reductions in health and social welfare effects. EPA estimated total annual monetized benefits of attaining the standard to range from $15 billion to $17 billion. Based on epidemiology studies, EPA's total annual benefits for 2020 are estimated to range from $8 billion to $76 billion. The estimated health and welfare net benefits of attaining the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS in 2020 ranged from $9 billion to $12 billion, with benefits ranging from $2.4 billion to $70 billion based on different methodologies. The EPA's estimates for benefits and costs are based on discount rates of 3% and 7%, in 1999 dollars, and are incremental to the agency's attainment strategy for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS by 2015. The baseline case includes impacts from national regulations on power generation and mobile sources to reduce PM 2.5 concentrations. EPA also estimated monetary benefits for visibility improvements in national parks and wilderness areas using a stated preference approach. The EPA estimated visibility \"willingness to pay\" benefits to be $530 million in 2020 with attainment of the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS. They also analyzed the cost and benefits of a more stringent alternative PM 2.5 for comparative purposes. The health effects estimates were a key component in determining the monetized benefits, with predicted reductions in adverse health effects annually in 2020. The EPA estimated reductions in premature mortality and adverse health effects based on various studies for the Six-Cities. Compliance with the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS was projected to prevent 15,000 premature deaths annually, along with other health benefits. These estimates have been debated and re-analyzed since 1998. EPA accelerated research on PM 2.5 to understand health effects and reduce risks, with funding supporting various research projects and university-based centers. A 2010 EPA report showed a decrease in PM 2.5 concentrations nationally from 2001 to 2008, with most monitoring sites showing a decline or little change. Notable decreases were observed in several states. Several monitoring sites across the United States showed significant decreases in annual and 24-hour PM 2.5 concentrations, with some sites in California, Montana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Utah showing the greatest improvements. However, there were also increases in PM 2.5 concentrations at some sites in Montana, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Despite overall progress, nearly 37 million people still lived in counties with high PM 2.5 levels in 2008. In 2008, nearly 37 million people lived in counties with PM 2.5 levels exceeding air quality standards, leading to respiratory health problems and premature death, especially for vulnerable populations. EPA's review supported modifying the PM 2.5 standard based on scientific evidence. The scientific evidence supported modifying the PM 2.5 standard, with a range of alternatives presented for consideration. Stakeholders closely followed the development of the 2006 particulates NAAQS, with congressional hearings held on implementation and review. Recommendations were the basis for proposing to strengthen the annual PM 2.5 standard. During the development of the 2006 particulates NAAQS, stakeholders presented evidence and arguments at public hearings. Business and industry opposed stricter standards, while public health and environmental groups advocated for them. The EPA received thousands of comments on the particulates criteria document and the particulates staff paper. The Administrator's decisions on the standards were the first to fall outside the range of CASAC's recommendations in its 30-year history. CASAC raised concerns about the proposed PM 10 and PM 2.5 standards in letters dated March 21, 2006, and September 29, 2006. The Administrator is not required to follow CASAC's recommendations on PM 10 and PM 2.5 standards. Courts generally defer to the Administrator's judgment on scientific matters. CASAC's objections to the process could impact the debate on EPA's reviews of NAAQS. In December 2006, various petitioners challenged the Administrator's decisions. In December 2006, a diverse group of petitioners challenged EPA's 2006 final rule revising the PM NAAQS. The court consolidated the cases, focusing on aspects of both fine and coarse PM standards. The court's decision in February 2009 remanded some aspects of EPA's decisions regarding the primary annual NAAQS for PM 2.5 for reconsideration but did not vacate the standard. The 2006 PM NAAQS standard may be insufficiently protective and could sacrifice current protection. EPA's completion of the periodic review and proposed revisions in June 2012 has raised concerns about the implementation process for the 2006 standards. Potential future actions by EPA to further tighten the standards could have longer-term implications, requiring modifications to SIPs in nonattainment areas. Key areas of concern following the promulgation of the 2006 PM NAAQS are summarized, including discussions of the D.C. Circuit's decision in February 2009. The 2006 PM NAAQS standard may not be protective enough, with concerns raised about potential future actions to tighten the standards. The D.C. Circuit's February 2009 decision highlighted discrepancies between EPA staff and CASAC recommendations for PM 2.5 levels, with CASAC favoring more stringent standards. The EPA Administrator's decision on the PM 2.5 annual standard was based on long-term exposure studies, leading to disagreement with CASAC's recommendations. Public comments, mainly from environmental and health organizations, urged reconsideration of the proposed revisions to the PM 2.5 standards. Some groups supported stricter PM 2.5 standards recommended by CASAC, while industry associations opposed revising the 1997 standards citing different research. Those against tighter standards pointed to newer studies showing lower health risk estimates. EPA discussed its final decision in the preamble of the October 2006 revisions. In the decision on Primary PM 2.5 Standards, EPA disagreed with CASAC on the level of uncertainty in the risk assessment for the annual PM 2.5 standard. CASAC recommended a lower standard based on short-term exposure studies, while EPA emphasized long-term mortality effects in key studies. CASAC expressed concerns in a letter to Administrator Johnson regarding EPA's 2006 particulates NAAQS decision. The CASAC expressed concerns to Administrator Johnson about the EPA's decision on the PM 2.5 standard, stating that there is clear scientific evidence for adverse health effects at levels below the current standard. They recommended a reduction in the standard for better public health protection. The D.C. Circuit remanded the EPA's decision not to strengthen the primary annual NAAQS standard for PM 2.5, citing concerns about the agency's reliance on long-term exposures and lack of consideration for vulnerable populations. The court found that EPA failed to adequately explain why the current standard of 15\u00b5g/m3 is sufficient to protect health, especially for vulnerable subpopulations. The decision was remanded for reconsideration without vacating the standard. The court remanded the EPA's decision on the PM 2.5 standard for reconsideration but did not vacate it. The court denied petitions regarding the EPA's analysis of long-term mortality studies and its decision not to rely on quantitative risk assessment. EPA estimated nationwide health and welfare benefits of attaining two suites of PM 2.5 NAAQS standards. EPA estimated that attainment of the more stringent alternative PM 2.5 NAAQS would result in $26 billion to $30 billion of total annual benefits in 2020, compared to $15 billion to $17 billion for compliance with the 2006 standard. The expert elicitation ranged from $15 billion to $140 billion for the more stringent alternative, compared to $8 billion to $76 billion for compliance with the 2006 standard. EPA also estimated $1.2 billion in benefits associated with improvements in visibility in selected national parks with the more stringent alternative standard. The EPA estimated that compliance with the alternative PM 2.5 NAAQS would cost $7.9 billion in 2020, compared to $5.4 billion for the revised standard. The agency predicted reductions in premature deaths and health effects associated with the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA used expert elicitation to estimate the impact of stricter PM 2.5 standards on premature mortality. Estimates ranged from 2,200 to 24,000 fewer deaths annually for the alternative standard and 1,200 to 13,000 for the 2006 standards. This sparked debate on tightening PM 2.5 standards further. EPA's assessments suggest that stricter standards could reduce long-term mortality risk. The CASAC supported the EPA staff's conclusion that the current PM 2.5 standards are inadequate and recommended considering stricter standards based on epidemiological and toxicological evidence. There was a lack of evidence for the annual standard and a specific need to address particles ranging from 2.5 to 10 micrometers. EPA's 2006 proposal aimed to replace the existing standards. EPA proposed changing the particle size indicator from PM 10 to PM 10-2.5 with a daily standard of 70 \u00b5g/m3 instead of 150 \u00b5g/m3 based on evidence of health effects from short-term exposure to coarse particles in urban and industrial areas. However, EPA decided to maintain the PM 10 indicator in the final 2006 particulates NAAQS due to limited evidence on health effects associated with PM 10-2.5 measurements. The 2006 particulates NAAQS retained the PM 10 indicator with a daily standard of 150 \u00b5g/m3. The CASAC expressed surprise at this decision, stating that PM 10 includes both fine and coarse particulate matter. EPA promulgated a new FRM for measurement of PM 10-2.5 concentrations in ambient air. EPA's 2006 particulates NAAQS retained the PM 10 indicator with a daily standard of 150 \u00b5g/m3. A new FRM was established for measuring PM 10-2.5 concentrations in ambient air, aiming to gather scientific data for future NAAQS reviews. In response to a 1999 court decision, EPA addressed concerns about PM 10 duplicating fine particle regulation. The D.C. Circuit denied industry petitions to review the primary daily standard for PM 10 in 2009. The National Pork Producers Council, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and the Agricultural Retailers Association challenged EPA's decision to retain the PM 10 daily standard of 150 \u00b5g/m3 in nonurban areas. The court denied the petitions, finding EPA's decision reasonable. Environmental groups petitioned for review of EPA's decision to revoke the primary annual standard for PM 10, but the D.C. Circuit denied the petition, stating that the latest scientific evidence does not indicate long-term exposure to coarse particles poses a health risk. EPA had also proposed focusing the PM 10-2.5 standard only on \"urban and industrial\" sources. EPA proposed focusing the PM 10-2.5 standard on urban and industrial sources, excluding rural windblown dust and soils. The current 24-hour PM 10 standards would be revoked except in areas with monitors showing violations and a population of 100,000 or more. This proposal was based on evidence of toxicity primarily in urban areas related to road dust and combustion products. The EPA proposed focusing on urban and industrial sources for the PM 10-2.5 standard, excluding rural windblown dust and soils. The CASAC raised concerns about exempting agricultural and mining sources, recommending an expansion of knowledge on the toxicity of PM 10-2.5 dusts. Members of the House Committee on Agriculture supported maintaining regulations for all industries. In July 2006, EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson received support for maintaining the provision to exclude agriculture and mining dust from the particulates NAAQS. Despite opposition from various groups and industries, EPA did not exclude any areas or particles in the final 2006 particulates NAAQS revisions. EPA acknowledged the health effects associated with thoracic coarse particles in urban areas. There is more evidence on health effects of thoracic coarse particles in urban areas compared to non-urban areas. EPA is expanding research and monitoring programs to gather more evidence on the differences between coarse particles in urban and rural areas. EPA amended its national air quality monitoring requirements to include measurement of \"inhalable coarse particles\" at 75 monitoring sites. The EPA amended national air quality monitoring requirements to include measurement of \"inhalable coarse particles\" at 75 monitoring sites, with some monitors being shut down in states where air quality concentrations are below the 24-hour PM 10 standard. The CASAC agreed with the EPA's decision against including exemptions in the final 2006 particulates NAAQS revisions, but concerns remain about potential burdens on the agricultural community. The EPA provided a reasonable explanation for not setting separate urban and nonurban PM 10 standards, rejecting challenges to the level of the standard. No new areas, including rural or non-urban areas, will be designated as nonattainment for PM 10. Some previously designated nonattainment counties have been determined to be in attainment since the 2006 revisions. States' recommendations for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS do not include new rural or non-urban areas. The majority of the US is in attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS. EPA designated 88 areas as nonattainment since 1990. Since 1990, EPA designated 88 areas as nonattainment with the PM 10 NAAQS. As of March 8, 2013, 43 of the 88 PM 10 areas previously designated nonattainment have been redesignated to attainment. Of the remaining 45 nonattainment areas, 28 are currently not meeting the PM 10 standard based on 2009-2011 air quality data. The agricultural community and some Members of Congress have expressed concerns with EPA's reviews of the PM NAAQS, particularly the PM 10 standards. Thoracic coarse particles (PM 10) are emitted from mechanical processes or dust resuspension. Processes like crushing or grinding particles and resuspending dust can contribute to emissions of PM 10, also known as \"farm dust.\" Other sources of thoracic coarse particles include unpaved and paved roads, traffic emissions, industrial operations, construction, and mining. Despite EPA's unchanged PM 10 standard in June 2012, there is skepticism about potential revisions. Congress is considering legislation, such as the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act of 2011, to delay EPA regulatory actions on PM 10 NAAQS. The FY2012 House-reported EPA appropriations language included a provision restricting the use of funds to modify the national ambient air quality standards for coarse particulate matter (PM 10). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 did not retain this provision. EPA's research focuses on urban areas with high levels of PM 10 from vehicular, industrial, and construction emissions. The EPA continues to research the link between coarse particle composition and toxicity, including urban versus rural particles. The EPA proposed particulate NAAQS in January 2006, setting secondary standards for PM 10 and PM 2.5 at the same level as their primary standards. Recommendations were made for more protective visibility standards by the CASAC panel. Consideration was given for a sub-daily standard for PM 2.5 at a lower level than the primary standard. The CASAC recommended setting a secondary standard for PM 2.5 at the same level as the primary standard, but not limited to urban areas. The D.C. Circuit remanded the PM 2.5 secondary NAAQS to EPA for reconsideration, finding that the NAAQS are inadequate to protect public welfare from adverse effects on visibility. EPA staff recommends revising secondary standards for PM 2.5 in the next round of periodic review. Stakeholders argue for consideration of new studies to lower the level for better protection against health risks associated with particulate exposure. Some stakeholders argue for lower PM 2.5 standards to protect health, citing new studies. EPA acknowledges new research but maintains that it does not change the scientific conclusions from 2004. EPA plans to review significant new studies in the future. The EPA's 2006 tightening of the fine particulates NAAQS sparked interest and concerns among stakeholders and Congress. Additional areas were classified as nonattainment, requiring new controls on particulate matter. This stricter standard will increase costs for transportation and industrial sectors. It is expected to result in fewer adverse health effects for the general population. The EPA's 2006 tightening of the fine particulates NAAQS has raised concerns among stakeholders and Congress due to the increased costs for transportation and industrial sectors. The decision is expected to lead to fewer adverse health effects, especially for sensitive populations like children, asthmatics, and the elderly. The evolution and oversight of the particulates NAAQS have been closely monitored, with recent challenges and delays prompting renewed interest in the issues surrounding the 2006 PM NAAQS."
