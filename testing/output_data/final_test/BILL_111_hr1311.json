    "content": "The \"Unemployment Assistance Act of 2009\" allows for exclusion of unemployment distributions from tax-favored accounts under section 139C of the Internal Revenue Code. Gross income excludes qualified unemployment distributions from tax-favored accounts. A qualified unemployment distribution is a distribution used by an individual during a period of unemployment, not exceeding 2 years, for qualified living expenses, health care expenses, or education/job training expenses. The term 'qualified living expenses' includes rent, groceries, vehicle or residence repairs, and other necessary expenses. It does not cover prepayments of rent or acquisition indebtedness. 'Qualified health care expenses' refer to medical care costs for the individual, spouse, and dependents. The term 'qualified education or job training expenses' refers to expenses that would be considered qualified tuition and related expenses for the Lifetime Learning Credit. A 'tax-favored account' includes eligible retirement plans as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B). Any individual who receives a qualified unemployment distribution may repay the amount to a tax-favored account where a rollover contribution could be made under various sections, including 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16), 223(f)(5), or 529(c)(3)(C). For qualified unemployment distributions from eligible retirement plans other than IRAs, contributions can be treated as eligible rollover distributions and transferred to the retirement plan within 60 days. Repayments for distributions from IRAs can also be made to tax-favored accounts for rollover contributions. Qualified unemployment distributions from eligible retirement plans other than IRAs can be treated as eligible rollover distributions and transferred to the retirement plan within 60 days. Contributions from health savings accounts or qualified tuition programs can also be made for rollover contributions. Qualified unemployment distributions can be treated as eligible rollover distributions and transferred to the retirement plan within 60 days. Any distribution excluded from gross income under this section shall not be considered for deductions or credits relating to the expense. Qualified unemployment distributions can be treated as eligible rollover distributions and transferred to the retirement plan within 60 days. Any distribution excluded from gross income under section 139C shall not be considered for deductions or credits relating to the expense. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code. Qualified unemployment distributions can be treated as eligible rollover distributions and transferred to the retirement plan within 60 days. The amendments made by this section regarding distributions from tax-favored accounts during periods of unemployment apply to distributions made after the date of the enactment of this Act."
