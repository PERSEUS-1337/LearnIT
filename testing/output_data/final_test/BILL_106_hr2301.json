    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congressional Responsibility Act of 1999\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The \"Congressional Responsibility Act of 1999\" aims to ensure that Federal regulations are only enacted by Congress, as outlined in Article I of the United States Constitution. This Act prevents the delegation of law-making responsibilities to unelected officials and requires regulations proposed by executive branch agencies to be approved by Congress. It aims to make Congress more democratic and accountable while protecting the public from regulations not endorsed by elected officials. SEC. 3. ENACTMENT OF AGENCY REGULATIONS.\n\nRegulations cannot take effect before the enactment of a bill containing the regulation's text. Agencies must submit a report to Congress with the proposed regulation text and an explanation. \n\nSEC. 4. EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURES FOR AGENCY REGULATIONS. (a) Introduction.--Within 3 legislative days of an agency submitting a report under section 3(b), the Majority Leader of each House of Congress must introduce a bill containing the regulation's text. If not done, any Member of that House may introduce the bill.\n(b) Bill.--A bill under this section consists of the regulation's text and is considered approved as law.\n(c) Referral and Consideration.--The bill does not go to a committee, and any Member can move for consideration in the respective House. A Member can move to proceed to the consideration of a bill in the respective House, with all points of order waived. The motion is privileged, not debatable, and not subject to amendment or postponement. If agreed to, the House immediately proceeds to consider the bill without interruption. Debate on the bill and related motions is limited to one hour, with equal time for supporters and opponents. Amendments are not allowed, but a motion to further limit debate is permitted. Appeals on procedural decisions are decided without debate. Final passage of the bill requires a vote. Final passage of a bill must occur in a House of Congress within 60 days of its introduction. An exception allows for a motion to suspend this rule with a majority vote. If the other House has passed a bill with the same text, it cannot be considered in the receiving House. Upon disposition of a bill received from the other House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the bill that originated in the receiving House. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"agency\" and \"regulation\" in accordance with existing laws. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to agency regulations made after its enactment. SEC. 7. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Regulations in bills under this Act are not subject to judicial review as agency actions."
