    "content": "According to data from the Census Bureau, the average price of imported petroleum products was $46 per barrel in 2017, a 27% increase from the previous year. Oil futures markets in April 2018 predicted prices to be around $63 per barrel for the rest of the year, but actual prices reached close to $70 per barrel in early April. Energy prices have fluctuated over the past seven years, with prices reaching nearly $140 per barrel in 2008 before falling sharply during the financial collapse. During the economic recession in 2009, prices fell between August 2008 and February 2009, but then rose by 85% to nearly $80 per barrel by December 2009. The average price of imported petroleum rose by 85% between February and December 2009, reaching nearly $80 per barrel. In 2012, the price rose 1% to $101.07 per barrel. Prices averaged around $97 per barrel in 2013, dropped to $91 per barrel in 2014, and fell to $37 per barrel in December 2015. Prices rose to close to $70 per barrel in early April 2018. Imported energy products, mainly crude oil, make up about one-fourth of total U.S. energy consumption. Various factors like Middle East turmoil, natural disasters, and economic growth impact oil prices. The impact of low oil prices on U.S. investment and production of petroleum and natural gas has made the United States the world's largest combined producer. This has led to a significant impact on oil prices. Despite fluctuations, the trade deficit has not changed appreciably, but the composition has shifted towards non-petroleum products replacing petroleum products. Lower energy prices benefit the U.S. economy by reducing energy costs for businesses, increasing consumers' real incomes, and attracting foreign investment. This influx of foreign capital can strengthen the dollar against other currencies. Volatility in the global economy drives investors to seek safe currencies like the dollar, further boosting its international value. The trade deficit could be offset if payments for U.S. exports or assets are made with the surplus. Consumers and some businesses also benefit from lower energy prices. Consumers responded to lower energy costs in 2015 by increasing overall consumption slightly, saving more, and reducing credit card debt. Energy producers, on the other hand, cut back on investments and payrolls in response to lower energy prices. The role of energy imports in the nation's trade deficit decreased from 40% in 2012 to 33% in 2013, but by January 2018, energy imports accounted for about 9% of the total U.S. trade deficit. The United States saw a decrease in the role of energy imports in the trade deficit, with a share of 4% in December 2017, the lowest in over a decade. Data from the Census Bureau shows an increase in energy-related petroleum imports in 2017, with 3.63 billion barrels valued at $174 billion, up 28% from 2016. U.S. demand for oil imports is more closely correlated with per capita income than oil prices. In 2016, the United States imported 3.58 billion barrels of energy-related petroleum products valued at $136 billion, with an average price per barrel of crude oil at $36, down 34% from 2015. Energy imports in 2018 are projected to rise to about $200 billion. Commerce Department data shows a 1.6% increase in energy-related petroleum products imported in 2017 compared to 2016, with crude oil imports rising by 2.6%. Monthly imports averaged about 303 million barrels in 2017, up 1.6% from 2016. In 2017, energy-related imports in the United States reached 331 million barrels in January and 328 million barrels per month in May, the highest levels since 2013. The nominal dollar value of energy imports was $174 billion, up 28% from 2016, accounting for 8% of total U.S. merchandise imports. The average price of imported oil in 2017 was $46 per barrel, increasing by 27% from 2016. In December 2017, the average price of imported oil was $52 per barrel, which increased to $55 in January 2018. The price of crude oil has fluctuated sharply over the years, with prices ranging between $90 and $108 per barrel from January 2012 to October 2014. In 2013, oil prices rose to $102 per barrel in September but fell to $91.34 in December. In 2015, oil prices dropped from $58.96 per barrel in January to $36.60 in December. By 2017, prices rose to a monthly average of $52 per barrel, the highest since mid-2015. Changes in crude oil volume, value, and prices significantly impact U.S. imports and trade deficit. Data from 1973 to 2018 show a 20% increase in crude oil imports volume and a two and a half times rise in average price per barrel between 1990 and 2015. The total value of U.S. crude oil imports rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, driven by a threefold increase in price per barrel. This increase in value was accompanied by a decline in imported volume, reflecting changes in the U.S. energy market due to increased domestic oil and natural gas production. Energy efficiency improvements and slower economic growth also impact energy consumption and the role of imported energy products. Lower energy prices, while beneficial, are not a cure-all for the U.S. economy. Lower energy prices have impacted the U.S. economy by reducing employment and investment in the energy sector. This has also affected energy-exporting countries and global trade, which could slightly negatively impact the U.S. economy. The rise in energy imports in 2017 and 2018 contributed to the overall U.S. trade deficit, although the deficit has remained relatively flat. The rise in energy imports in 2017 and 2018 contributed to the overall U.S. trade deficit. The average monthly price of imported oil remains volatile, making it challenging to predict when it will stabilize in 2018. Oil futures markets suggest a stabilization around $63 per barrel, but changes in energy prices will impact U.S. inflation and economic growth. Various factors, including events in the Middle East and a slowdown in Asian economic growth, pushed energy import costs slightly lower in 2015. The pace of economic growth in the United States slightly exceeded 3% in the second and third quarters of 2017, impacting oil imports and prices. Economic growth has also improved in Europe, Asia, and developing economies. Factors affecting crude oil prices include Atlantic hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and droughts in the midwestern United States. The price of oil has been influenced by various global economic events, including increased energy production in the United States, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, a drop in commodity prices, the value of the dollar, OPEC's production reduction agreement, and the potential resumption of oil production in Iran. Economic growth in the US and globally has led to higher energy import prices and contributed to the trade deficit. This deficit could be offset by dollars returning to the US economy through increased purchases of US goods and services. Some dollars returning to the U.S. economy through increased purchases of U.S. goods and services or investments in U.S. assets, including corporate securities and acquisitions of U.S. businesses. Concerns arise about national security implications of foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms and the growing share of U.S. Treasury securities owned by foreigners. Slower economic growth in various regions has reduced demand for oil and lowered energy import prices. Increased energy production in the U.S. has also decreased energy imports. Higher energy prices may have spurred the economy to improve efficiency and seek alternative energy sources. Lower energy costs could benefit producers and consumers, but may discourage investment in new energy sources. Congress may face challenges of slower economic growth and falling prices. The U.S. economy faces challenges of economic growth, stagnant tax revenues, and falling prices. Stimulative measures like increased government spending and lowering interest rates may push up inflation. The impact on the trade deficit is complex, with lower energy prices affecting trade accounts. Despite a decrease in the energy component of the trade deficit, the overall deficit remains unchanged due to various factors influencing exports and imports. The U.S. economy's trade deficit may worsen if its growth outpaces that of trading partners, leading to increased demand for imports and pressure on the dollar's value. Congress may need to address domestic factors causing the deficit."
