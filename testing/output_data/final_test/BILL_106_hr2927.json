    "content": "The \"Affordable Prescription Drugs Act\" allows for compulsory licensing of certain patented medical inventions. The \"Affordable Prescription Drugs Act\" permits compulsory licensing of specific patented medical inventions under certain conditions. This allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize the use of patented subject matter if the patent holder has not taken necessary steps to achieve this. The \"Affordable Prescription Drugs Act\" allows compulsory licensing of patented medical inventions if the patent holder fails to take steps for practical application, address health or safety needs, or prices the material unreasonably high. Authorization for other use of patented subject matter is considered on its merits, and can only be permitted after efforts to obtain authorization. The proposed user must make efforts to obtain authorization from the right holder on reasonable terms, which can be waived in cases of national emergency or extreme urgency. The right holder must be notified promptly in such situations. Public noncommercial use requires informing the right holder promptly, and the use shall be nonexclusive. The right holder must be informed promptly of nonexclusive, nonassignable use, which may be terminated if circumstances change. Adequate remuneration must be paid, and decisions can be reviewed by the competent authority. The legal validity of decisions on authorization and remuneration for use must be subject to judicial or independent review by a distinct Federal authority. Exceptions to conditions may apply to remedy anticompetitive practices, with authorities having the power to refuse termination if conditions are likely to recur. When authorizing use to exploit a second patent that infringes on a first patent, additional conditions apply: the second patent must represent a significant technical advancement with economic importance, the owner of the first patent is entitled to a cross-license, and the use of the first patent is nonassignable without the second patent. The regulations for authorizing the use of a second patent must be consistent with TRIPS. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents for chapter 14 of title 35, United States Code. SEC. 3. REPORT ON PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS AND SALES. The report requirement mandates individuals involved in manufacturing and selling patented drugs to annually report financial information related to pricing, including research and development costs. Failure to comply results in disqualification from federal programs. Manufacturers must stop receiving federal payments for drugs until compliance with reporting requirements is confirmed by the Secretary."
