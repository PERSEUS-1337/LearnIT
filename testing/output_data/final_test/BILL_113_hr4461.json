    "content": "The \"Climate Change Education Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act highlights key information related to climate change. Congress acknowledges the overwhelming evidence of human-induced climate change and the need for the United States to reduce carbon emissions. They emphasize the importance of shifting to renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and providing clear information to inspire action. Measures promoting energy efficiency and conservation will significantly reduce human impact on the environment. Measures promoting energy efficiency and conservation will reduce human impact on the environment by informing people of new technologies and programs. The Act defines \"climate change education\" as interdisciplinary learning about climate change and its effects on various systems. It also establishes a Climate Change Education Program. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will establish a Climate Change Education Program to educate people about human-induced climate change, its consequences, and potential solutions. The program will provide learning opportunities for all ages and backgrounds, promote new technologies for energy conservation and greenhouse gas reduction, and raise awareness about the impacts of climate change on human health and safety. The Climate Change Education Program includes a national information campaign and a grant program. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will establish a grant program to support public education on climate change, including teacher training, STEM education, and ensuring high school students graduate climate literate. The State education agencies are encouraged to integrate climate change education into K-12 academic standards, create model climate change curricula, and develop green school building standards. Additionally, efforts are being made to enhance higher education in green collar industries and fields related to the green economy, focusing on interdisciplinary teaching of climate change education. The curr_chunk discusses the adoption of interdisciplinary teaching of climate change education in higher education, engaging faculty and students in applied climate research for local communities, and building capacity for climate adaptation at the State and national level through various initiatives like career education and green collar workforce training. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will provide Congress with a report evaluating the scientific merits, educational effectiveness, and broader impacts of activities under the Act. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2015 to 2019 for carrying out the Act."
