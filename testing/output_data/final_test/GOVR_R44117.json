    "content": "USAID is the largest U.S. development agency, operating in 125 countries with a strong field presence to monitor project progress and consult with local governments and civil society. USAID works on a broad range of humanitarian and development concerns in multiple sectors, including microenterprise, health, agriculture, education, and disaster relief. They focus on the poorest countries to address poverty and humanitarian disasters, with programs in 31 of the 34 lowest-income countries in FY2013. USAID works in conflict or post-conflict countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia, focusing on stability and basic services. It also serves political/strategic and U.S. commercial purposes by supporting foreign policy goals and providing assistance to strategically important countries. USAID assists in economic growth and trade capacity building in developing countries, provides disaster and food assistance, and collaborates with civil society, NGOs, and the private sector. USAID is the world's largest bilateral donor grant provider, representing about 14% of all Official Development Assistance in 2013. It leads in addressing challenges in health, agriculture, microcredit, democracy promotion, environment, and private sector development. USAID plays key roles in U.S. foreign policy, focusing on economic growth, good governance, and social welfare in developing countries. Political-strategic aid programs play a crucial role in addressing special U.S. economic, political, or security interests, such as the reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan. Unlike development assistance programs, humanitarian aid programs focus on immediate alleviation of emergencies and reflect the charitable impulse of the American people. USAID's mission statement, revised in January 2014, emphasizes partnering to end extreme poverty and promote resilient, democratic societies. The agency works with various entities, including bilateral and international donor agencies, the private sector, and foundations, to achieve these goals. USAID's mission is to partner to end extreme poverty and promote resilient, democratic societies. The agency's strategies are guided by key documents, including the President's Policy Directive on Global Development and the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The 2015 QDDR builds on previous initiatives, emphasizing the importance of development in U.S. national security. USAID plays a key role in strategic goals, focusing on areas such as food security, health, and economic growth. Operational principles are outlined to enhance effectiveness. The framework document outlines USAID's goals to promote gender equality, use science and technology strategically, measure impact, and apply integrated approaches to development. These principles are reflected in the agency's reform program, USAID Forward, and various policy directives. However, there may be a gap between policy and practice at field missions. In its early years, the Foreign Assistance Act focused on general development goals without specifying sectors or project activities. USAID adapted its aid programs based on specific country needs and changing development theories over the past five decades. The evolution of USAID's development theories and practices is influenced by various factors such as shifts in development theory, new technologies, successful assistance initiatives, and presidential and congressional mandates. These elements shape current Administration and agency strategies, with a historical emphasis on economic infrastructure and policy reform in the agency's programs. USAID's Development Loan Fund, a 1950s initiative for infrastructure support, was a key source of credit for developing countries until the mid-1970s. The agency also introduced economic policy reform, promoting export, exchange rate realism, public enterprise reform, subsidy elimination, tax reform, and private sector strengthening in aid programs for countries like South Korea and Taiwan. Infrastructure and policy reform lost favor temporarily when the focus shifted to government's role in overall growth. The New Directions strategy in U.S. development aid, implemented in the 1970s, focused on helping the poor satisfy their basic human needs. This shift shaped USAID's operations, leading to a focus on projects benefiting the poor and a transition from a loan to a grant agency. Assistance was provided based on grants rather than functional basis. The shift in U.S. development aid in the 1970s led to a change in how aid was provided, with a focus on specific sectors important to the rural poor, such as agriculture and nutrition. This resulted in an increase in the percentage of aid allocated to these sectors, as well as a shift towards smaller technical assistance projects. Additionally, there was a shift in focus from higher-income to lower-income countries, with new programs established in the latter. Africa saw a significant increase in USAID missions during this period. The New Directions in U.S. development aid in the 1970s led to changes in planning practices, focusing on the poor majority and employing social soundness and beneficiary analysis. This shift also accelerated USAID's transition from operational responsibilities to planning and financing projects, requiring different technical skills. The New Directions in U.S. development aid in the 1970s led to changes in planning practices, focusing on the poor majority and employing social soundness and beneficiary analysis. This shift also accelerated USAID's transition from operational responsibilities to planning and financing projects, requiring different technical skills. The agency's U.S. direct hire workforce was reduced by 17% between 1974 and 1977, leading to increased reliance on contractors and grantees, including Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and other NGOs. USAID has a long history of supporting scientific research and innovation, funding International Agricultural Research Centers and agricultural research activities at universities. In 2011, USAID spent over $192 million on health research, leading to successful dissemination of innovative practices. The agency played a crucial role in introducing new high-yield grains to farmers through rice kits in the 1960s and 1970s. Additionally, USAID utilized satellite data in the 1980s for forecasting crop failures and identifying mineral deposits and groundwater resources. USAID has been involved in various innovations over the past decades, including more efficient cook stoves, drip irrigation technologies, vaccines for diseases like rinderpest, measles, and HIV, improved contraception, and anti-malarial nets. Currently, the agency is focusing on research for a malaria vaccine, new tuberculosis drugs, and addressing vitamin A deficiency. Presidential initiatives have also emphasized shifting towards market forces and private sector involvement in USAID activities. Private sector program funding increased from 4% to 13% between 1982 and 1988. USAID shifted focus to private sector growth in countries like Jamaica, Kenya, and Senegal. The George H.W. Bush Administration's PEPFAR program significantly increased funding for HIV/AIDS, with USAID implementing three-fifths of the program. HIV/AIDS funding implemented by USAID rose from $407 million in FY2003 to $3.8 billion in FY2010. Between 2008 and 2012, USAID's funding for agriculture aid doubled, with the Food Security Initiative playing a significant role. The Obama Administration's aid initiatives on global health, food security, and climate change have shaped USAID's program, representing roughly 17% of USAID's total budget in FY2010. Congressional priorities have also influenced USAID's program, with legislative authorizations in the 1960s and 1970s playing a key role. Presidential initiatives can be decisive in determining the composition and budget of mission programs at the country level. In the 1960s and 1970s, legislative authorizations influenced USAID's program, with Congress periodically authorizing sector or regional programs. Congressional support has helped shape funding and strategy, with appropriations legislation often directing funding levels for various sectors. In the foreign aid portions of the FY2015 State, Foreign Operations appropriations legislation, Congress directed funding levels for various sectors including health, education, environmental protection, food security, and water and sanitation, totaling about $12.5 billion. Congressional control over the total USAID budget plays a significant role in shaping its programs. The USAID annual budget is provided through multiple funding accounts with different rules and flexibilities. Most accounts are authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, but funding levels are time-limited and often not renewed. Congressional control over the total USAID budget is significant in shaping its programs. The USAID annual budget is funded through various accounts with different rules and flexibilities. Most accounts are authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with funding levels often not renewed. Congressional control over the total USAID budget significantly shapes its programs, including appropriations for specific sectors, purposes, and aid methodologies. Some accounts have been exclusive to countries or regions in the past. Since 2006, the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources in the State Department jointly manages all accounts with USAID at the policy and allocation level. Total USAID budget figures are estimates due to shared accounts with the State Department. Some funds pass through USAID to international programs and governments, making budget estimates challenging. The USAID budget figures may be distorted by large \"transient\" funds passing through the agency, such as the Global Fund contribution. The core program accounts include USAID Global Health Programs focusing on combating infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, maternal and child health, vulnerable children, and family planning. The Development Assistance (DA) account funds programs in agriculture, private sector development, microcredit, water and sanitation, education, environment, democracy, and governance, among others. The International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account managed by USAID aids nations struck by disasters with flexible funding for rapid response. The Transition Initiatives account supports short-term projects in countries transitioning from conflict to peace. The Complex Crises Fund (CCF) allows USAID to respond quickly to unforeseen crises. The Complex Crises Fund (CCF) enables USAID to swiftly address emerging crises by targeting root causes of conflict or instability. For instance, in 2010, the CCF provided agricultural aid to newly resettled Sri Lankans affected by the civil war, and in 2014, it tackled governance challenges in Ukraine. The Development Credit Authority (DCA) allocates funds to subsidize U.S. loan guarantees for various development programs. P.L. 480 Title II, also known as the Food for Peace program, distributes U.S. agricultural commodities to address global food insecurity. The Food for Peace program, P.L. 480 Title II provides U.S. agricultural commodities for emergency and non-emergency food needs, targeting vulnerable populations in response to malnutrition, famine, natural disasters, civil strife, and relief requirements. It is provided through multilateral organizations and private voluntary organizations. Non-emergency food is often \"monetized\" to support development projects. Congress allows a portion of the account to be provided in cash form for purchasing food on local markets. USAID also receives funding from the Global Health-State component of the Global Health Programs account. The Global Health Programs account, managed by the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, is the largest source of funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Programs funded from this account are implemented by USAID, Department of Defense, CDC, and Peace Corps. USAID's share averages over 60% of the funding, with the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund passing through USAID. The Economic Support Fund advances U.S. political goals in key countries, with USAID receiving over 90% of the funding. The Democracy Fund supports democratization programs. The Democracy Fund supports democratization programs run by the State Department and USAID, with USAID receiving over 90% of the funding. Congress directs a specific dollar portion of the funds to USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance. Additionally, USAID has received funding transfers from other agencies, such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation, for implementing threshold programs. Several accounts are exclusively for USAID administrative purposes, including the Operating Expenses account for operational costs like salaries, benefits, and security. The Capital Investment Fund and Office of Inspector General account support USAID operations. Estimated FY2013 obligations are often used due to detailed country and account information. USAID activities make up over half of total foreign assistance. USAID manages a significant portion of the International Affairs budget in the federal budget, representing about 0.7% of total federal budget authority. Agency funding levels have shifted over five decades, reflecting sentiments towards foreign aid, Cold War strategy, and humanitarian response. Inconsistent data prior to 2001 makes tracking difficult. Since its inception, USAID's funding levels have fluctuated, with peaks in the early to mid-1960s due to involvement in Latin America and the Vietnam War. Funding has increased again in recent years, driven by spending on health, humanitarian emergencies, and development assistance in conflict zones. USAID's funding levels have fluctuated over the years, with peaks in the 1960s and a significant spike in the mid-1980s during the Reagan Administration. Funding levels fell in the late 1960s and early 1970s but were reconstituted by policy and management reforms. The fall of communism led to a collapse in the chief rationale for foreign aid, despite increased assistance to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. USAID budgets were substantially slashed post-1994, reaching their lowest level in FY2000. Only 4% of USAID assistance goes directly to recipient governments, with most funds channeled through U.S. partners like universities and NGOs. Assistance may bypass government institutions to benefit farmers and civil society organizations. USAID provides aid to 125 countries, with 23 receiving under $1 million, mainly small island nations or one-time funds recipients. In FY2013, USAID funding mainly benefited countries of special political/strategic interest, with Afghanistan and Pakistan being prominent recipients. Syria received funds for refugees, not the government. Sub-Saharan Africa countries received aid for strategic importance and HIV/AIDS assistance. Israel, a major recipient of U.S. funding, now receives most aid as security assistance. Sub-Saharan Africa received nearly 40% of USAID funding in FY2013. In FY2013, USAID funding was mainly directed towards countries of special political or strategic interest, with a significant portion going to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Sub-Saharan Africa received the largest share of funding, accounting for nearly 40% of USAID assistance. Comparing regional allocations over a 10-year period highlights the shift in aid beneficiaries, with the Middle East/North Africa region's share decreasing significantly. Afghanistan and Pakistan's importance to U.S. strategic interests grew substantially, with their share of total assistance tripling and nearly quadrupling in dollar terms. In FY2013, USAID's Europe/Eurasia program declined significantly, accounting for less than 3% of total programs. USAID focuses on low-income and lower-middle income countries, with 44% going to low income and 41% to lower-middle income in FY2013. Additionally, 15% of total funding is allocated to upper-middle income countries, with some programs in high-income countries reflecting U.S. political interests or responding to natural disasters. In FY2013, USAID provided assistance in response to natural disasters, focusing on challenging political and social environments. The top 10 countries in crisis received 32% of total funding. USAID conducts programs in various sectors, with health being the largest assistance sector since the early 1990s. In FY2013, USAID allocated $5.7 billion for health activities, representing over one-third of total sector spending, with 42% of the health budget directed to sub-Saharan Africa. Humanitarian programs have historically fluctuated in response to crises, with overall support for aid increasing over time. In FY2013, USAID allocated $1.2 billion for International Disaster Assistance in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Humanitarian support represented 19% of agency sector funding and is expected to increase significantly with the FY2015 Ebola crisis funding. Agriculture assistance received $1 billion in FY2013, accounting for 6% of sector aid. Agriculture was the largest sector until the 1990s, emphasizing rural development under the New Directions strategy. Support for agriculture aid has increased with the Administration's Global Food Security Initiative, focusing on training farmers, introducing new technologies, developing markets, and providing credit. The largest recipients of agriculture aid were Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Colombia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Mali, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda. In FY2013, USAID allocated nearly $2 billion for democracy and governance programs, supporting rule of law, anti-corruption efforts, civil society development, and elections processes. The main beneficiaries of this aid were Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan, and South Sudan. In FY2013, USAID allocated funds for economic growth programs in Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan, and South Sudan. These programs aimed to increase economic growth by providing access to credit, organizing business associations, encouraging policy reforms, and developing market chains. Infrastructure development, including roads, power plants, and communications, was a significant part of the economic growth strategy for countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and West Bank/Gaza received the majority of funds for economic growth programs in FY2013. In FY2013, USAID allocated funds for economic growth programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and West Bank/Gaza, representing about 11% of sector funding. Education assistance accounted for 4% of programs, with a focus on improving reading skills and school access in crisis countries. Environment programs made up about 3% of sector assistance. Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Liberia, and Pakistan were key recipients of education funding in FY2013. In FY2013, USAID allocated 3% of sector assistance to environment protection programs. Key beneficiaries included Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Sudan, Ukraine, and Vietnam. Programs focused on land rights management, biodiversity protection, climate change mitigation, and ending deforestation. USAID's assistance process involves various individuals ensuring effective project formulation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The agency is divided into field missions and headquarters, each with specific functions and personnel. USAID staff are mainly U.S. direct-hire civil service in Washington and Foreign Service Officers in missions. As of September 2014, there were 9,355 staff, with 70% in aid recipient countries. The missions are crucial for development, while humanitarian and research functions are at headquarters. The USAID mission's hands-on presence in formulating country development strategies, designing projects, and ensuring accountability sets it apart from other donors. A 1992 study highlighted the mission's potential to influence country programs and policy reforms, while also emphasizing the need for accountability in managing financial resources. The USAID supports over 60 bilateral missions, varying in size based on funding levels, program range, and security. Missions are now colocated with U.S. embassies and staffed by U.S. FSOs and local nationals, focusing on development work abroad. USAID's FSOs work abroad under modified administrative rules, specializing in development sectors or administrative functions. FSOs typically spend 2-4 years in a country before rotating. Foreign nationals, representing 69% of the USAID overseas workforce, work in program professional and administrative support roles. Foreign nationals play a crucial role in USAID missions, bringing deep knowledge of local language, culture, and politics. They provide institutional memory and continuity, unlike FSOs who rotate frequently. Central bureaus and independent offices in Washington also contribute significantly to program activities, focusing on technical sectors and policy development. The central bureaus and independent offices in Washington provide policy, technical, and administrative support for USAID missions, coordinating resources and disseminating guidance developed at headquarters. The technical bureaus at USAID provide expertise across development sectors to mission personnel, managing grants and contracts for additional support. Regional bureaus have their own technical offices, potentially duplicating existing expertise. Bureaus and independent offices lead in designing and implementing projects, especially those that are cross-sectoral or regional. In the past, the Microenterprise Office funded innovative projects and research, directing funds to microcredit NGOs like ACCION. The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) at USAID provide direct assistance in international disaster relief and post-conflict environments, respectively. OFDA addresses emergencies in various countries, pre-positions relief supplies, and coordinates response efforts. OTI conducts rapid assessments of country needs in post-conflict settings. OTI, working in post-conflict environments, conducts rapid assessments of country needs and awards small grants to address specific concerns. The short-term grants allow for a rolling analysis of impact and strategy adjustments. As of early 2014, OTI was active in about a dozen countries, including Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Burma, and Kenya. The Global Health Bureau manages Washington-based program activities, including U.S. government contributions to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Global Health Bureau manages HIV anti-retroviral drugs procurement and neglected tropical diseases programs. USAID spends over $200 million on health research annually. Development projects are mainly conducted at the country level through missions, with a program cycle that includes project design, implementation, and evaluation. The conglomeration of individual projects in a country program is influenced by decision-making centralization, the role of the Department of State, and budget requirements. USAID's responsibilities were transferred to the Department of State between 2006 and 2009, impacting mission plans and procedures. Despite gradual regaining of some responsibilities, mission programs must align with Administration initiatives and strategies. The USAID mission plays a vital role in developing country strategies, such as the Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), which involves collaboration between mission and headquarters. By 2015, 51 country missions and six regional missions had completed their strategies, with six more expected that year. The Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) aims to identify and prioritize development objectives where USAID can have the most impact. It is based on extensive research and discussions with various stakeholders, including government, civil society, and the private sector. USAID missions use a Results Framework to connect sector-specific results to overall development objectives and the CDCS goal, with measurable indicators to track progress. The CDCS goal is the highest-level impact to be achieved by USAID and partners. Development Objectives (DOs) are the most ambitious results USAID can affect and be held accountable for. Selection of DOs considers available funding, reform opportunities, and civil society status. The CDCS goal is to achieve the highest-level impact, with Development Objectives (DOs) being the most ambitious results USAID can affect. Progress is measured by performance indicators, but some missions prioritize funding over local priorities in drafting their CDCS. The audit found that some missions drafted their CDCS based on funding expectations, while others were told to revise theirs to reflect budget realities. However, mission development objectives were not always supported due to limited flexible funding. The CDCS serves as a methodology for planning and measuring USAID's intentions in a country. The goal is to focus agency efforts where they can have the most impact. Between 2010 and 2014, USAID reduced country program areas by 42%, phasing out aid in food security, agriculture, and health in multiple countries. New projects are designed around the CDCS, using a logical framework method to achieve development results. A project appraisal document outlines factors, implementation plan, budget, and monitoring and evaluation plan. The project design process involves considering various factors such as the project's relationship to other programs, partner country involvement, monitoring and evaluation plans, and long-term sustainability. The project design process involves analyzing sustainability, gender, and environmental impacts. USAID assistance includes food, medical supplies, cash, expert advice, training, and infrastructure like roads and power plants. Projects combine multiple inputs for optimal results, such as textbooks, teacher training, and curriculum guidance. Different delivery methods have varying management burdens and control levels. Consideration is given to implementation instruments during project design. Consideration is given to different implementation instruments, such as grants, during the project design process. Grants allow grantees to carry out their own programs that align with USAID's purpose with minimal oversight. Grants are advantageous in locations with limited access but have less accountability compared to contracts or cooperative agreements. Grants and cooperative agreements are key funding mechanisms for USAID, with grants also provided to international organizations. Cooperative agreements involve more agency involvement in program implementation. Contracts are for specified goods and services with high operational control by USAID. USAID maintains high operational control over contracts, with a focus on accountability. Contracts outline specific purposes and benchmarks, often awarded to for-profit firms. Host Country Contracts allow local governments to compete for infrastructure projects. Government to Government Assistance involves direct financing for agreed-upon results, requiring thorough risk assessments. Non-Project G2G Assistance includes various forms of budget and balance of payments support to partner governments, often with U.S. funds matched by the recipient. USAID is updating its guidance on non-project assistance to focus on outcomes-based aid. Types of non-project G2G assistance include Cash Transfers, Commodity Import Programs, and Sector Program Assistance tied to specific policy reforms in a development sector. Public-Private Partnerships, including USAID's Global Development Alliance (GDA), have formed over 1,500 partnerships with the private sector since 2001 to support mutually agreed upon goals. Loan Guarantees, such as Development Credit Authority loan guarantees, have been used to leverage private sector bank funds for development purposes. The United States has also guaranteed sovereign loans to countries like Ukraine and Tunisia. Project authorization initiates a competitive selection process for project partners, agreements, and fund obligations. Project agreements are made with various development partners, including nonprofit organizations, for-profit contractors, universities, foundations, and government agencies. USAID oversees the implementation of projects and ensures accountability for financial resources and project performance. Throughout the project design and implementation process, steps are taken to monitor financial resources and project performance. Projects are designed to address potential risks and vulnerabilities, with management training and sustainability measures included. USAID follows procurement procedures to ensure contractors and grantees are qualified, with payments made in tranches based on specific actions and documentation. To ensure adequate performance and fair competition, USAID evaluates contractors and grantees. Project managers and contracting officers oversee progress through reports and site visits. Financial audits are conducted annually by the Defense Contract Audit Agency for U.S. contractors. The USAID Inspector General oversees financial audits for U.S. nonprofits with certain funding levels. The Contractor Compliance Task Force monitors contractor compliance, enforces actions, and tracks partner compliance. Special measures are in place to prevent fraud and mismanagement in high-risk countries like Afghanistan. To ensure accountability, measures such as limiting subcontract layers, vetting non-U.S. companies, using electronic funds transfers, employing third-party monitors, conducting local audits, deploying more field staff, and training on-site monitors are implemented by USAID. Additional procedures are adopted for funds provided directly to governments and local entities to address added risks. The OIG conducts audits to ensure accountability and adequacy of mission procedures. Financial audits examine contractor and grantee financial statements and agreements, while performance audits assess project outputs. The USAID IG selects audit subjects based on country risk, funding amount, and other factors. Oversight aims to identify problems during project implementation for mid-course corrections or termination if needed. Independent evaluations are conducted to assess project progress. In 2010, USAID initiated reforms to regain its status as a global development leader after facing setbacks in the late 1980s. These setbacks included funding cuts, mission closures, staff reductions, and increased ties to the Department of State. The agency now emphasizes evaluations to measure project effectiveness and gather lessons for future projects. The reforms initiated by USAID in 2010 aimed to address concerns such as reliance on contractors, establishment of rival agencies, consolidation of administrative functions, and loss of budget planning. These reforms, led by Administrator Rajiv Shah, were based on input from mission directors and recommendations from Presidential Policy Directive-6 and QDDR. They represent significant changes to the agency since the 1970s. The USAID underwent significant reforms in 2010 to address issues such as reliance on contractors, administrative consolidation, and budget planning. Staff numbers decreased between 1990 and 2008, leading to a loss of expertise and increased outsourcing of work. This decline in staff accelerated in the 1990s, impacting monitoring and evaluation practices. The USAID underwent reforms in 2010 to address issues like reliance on contractors and loss of expertise due to staff reductions. Management capacity worsened in the 2000s, with increased outsourcing of work and a rise in retirements draining experienced personnel. The Bush Administration launched Development Leadership to restore agency capabilities. The Bush Administration launched the Development Leadership Initiative in 2008 to double the number of FSOs by 2012 and rebuild technical expertise. However, funding cuts slowed hiring, leading to a shortage of experienced personnel at USAID. The new hiring at USAID has brought in younger staff, with about half having less than five years of experience. This has increased the agency's training needs. However, a decline in operational expenses may impact the agency's ability to prepare new staff. USAID is shifting towards more direct funding through local systems to promote \"country ownership\" of assistance, moving away from relying solely on U.S. organizations for implementation. USAID is channeling 30% of total mission program assistance directly through local entities by FY2015. The agency's Local Solutions reform focuses on sustainability and aims for development to be locally owned, led, and resourced. The 30% target is now seen as \"aspirational,\" with FY2012 and FY2013 levels at 9.9%. Excluding Afghanistan and Pakistan, USAID continues to monitor its progress towards direct financing of local systems. In FY2010, USAID's assistance to partner governments and local organizations increased by 32% to $1.1 billion by FY2014. Funding through local organizations rose significantly by 176%, reaching $1.1 billion. USAID implemented reforms to streamline procurement processes and reduce contract award times by 48%. In FY2010, USAID increased assistance to partner governments and local organizations by 32% to $1.1 billion by FY2014. Funding through local organizations rose by 176% to $1.1 billion. USAID implemented reforms to streamline procurement processes and reduce contract award times by 48%. In 2013, an extensive study of procurement processes led to recommendations for more cost-effective awards, with USAID applying these recommendations in the health sector to save more lives. In 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reorganized foreign aid management, integrating USAID's policy and budget processes with the Department of State. This led to USAID losing policy formulation capacity to the State Department's new Foreign Aid \"F\" Bureau. USAID Forward reforms have since rebuilt the agency's policy and programming capacity with the establishment of a new USAID Bureau of Policy, Planning, and Learning (PPL). The USAID Forward reforms have rebuilt the agency's policy and programming capacity through the establishment of a new Bureau of Policy, Planning, and Learning (PPL). This includes the reformed Program Cycle at the field level and the release of sector strategies and policies. Additionally, a new Office of Budget and Resource Management was reestablished to enhance budget capacity, with the agency developing its first comprehensive budget proposal since 2005 in June 2011. Some question whether the new budget office fully restored autonomous budget decisions to USAID. The USAID Forward reforms have substantively restored autonomous budget decisions to USAID, with the \"F\" Bureau in State still needing to sign off on the budget. USAID had neglected its evaluation processes for over a decade, with a shift in evaluation policy in 1995 leading to a decrease in evaluations. The quality of evaluations was also questioned, with some being brief \"fly-in\" assessments. Since the early 2000s, there has been a push for improved evaluation practices among international donors and aid organizations. USAID introduced an Initiative to Revitalize Evaluation in 2005, focusing on staff training and new requirements. The USAID Forward reform further enhanced evaluation efforts with the establishment of an Office for Learning, Evaluation, and Research in 2011, issuing a new evaluation policy with improved project progress indicators. USAID introduced a new evaluation policy in January 2011, requiring more evaluations and better measuring impacts. They now commit 3% of major program funds to evaluation purposes and completed 224 evaluations in FY2014. Evaluations are used for learning and improvement, leading to mid-course and budgetary changes in programs. Under the USAID Forward initiative, the agency aims to scale up science and technology innovations for development. USAID historically led in applying S&T to development issues but faced challenges in spreading pilot projects widely due to limited funds and leadership. The agency is now focusing on disseminating and applying new solutions more broadly to address this issue. USAID is seeking to encourage new approaches to development and foster dissemination of promising ideas through the U.S. Global Development Lab. The Lab collaborates with the scientific community to address specific development problems, such as through the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) program. The agency has made progress in identifying new technologies and approaches, but it is too early to determine if these innovations can be scaled up effectively. The U.S. Global Development Lab collaborates with scientific community to address development problems. Programs like Global Research and Innovation Fellows Network and Higher Education Solutions Network aim to provide technical expertise and solutions. Competitions like Grand Challenges for Development focus on saving lives, improving education, agriculture, governance, water sustainability, and healthcare. The Pratt Pouch technology is one of the innovations supported. The Pratt Pouch, a technology from the Saving Lives at Birth Challenge, is being refined to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission. Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) supports innovative proposals for health delivery systems. DIV has attracted over 6,000 applications since 2010 and invests in solutions like a self-test for pre-eclampsia and a mobile platform for health organizations. The agency has invested in over 100 solutions in 17 sectors and 35 countries, emphasizing leveraging private sector funding. The Development Credit Authority guarantees a portion of bank loans for development activities, with $25.7 million obligated in FY2014. USAID aims to expand the program further. USAID collaborates with private sector entities through the Global Development Alliance program to implement projects that support development and business objectives. The agency aims to leverage private sector resources to achieve development goals and promote program sustainability. For example, USAID is working with international coffee companies to combat coffee rust, with $95 million provided by USAID and $250 million from private sector organizations in FY2014. The USAID agency has a complex history spanning over 50 years, facing challenges related to accountability, sustainability, project partners, and development methods. Congress focuses on executive branch accountability, especially with USAID due to funds going to unfamiliar locations with unpredictable outcomes. Insufficient accountability can undermine trust, but measures to ensure it may hinder the agency's mission according to some observers and practitioners. Public attention is occasionally drawn to examples of assistance failure, such as fraud and poor planning at USAID. In FY2014, the USAID Inspector General found $186 million in questioned costs, funds recommended for better use, and recoveries from investigations. In FY2014, the USAID Inspector General identified $186 million in questioned costs, funds recommended for better use, and recoveries from investigations, representing 1.0% of USAID's appropriated funding for that year. This amount is comparable to the 1.5% of total U.S. budget authority accounted for by all inspector generals across the federal government in FY2013. The accountability risk in conducting USAID's business must be weighed against assessments of its aid programs. Countries of special foreign policy interest receive generous portions of aid, leading to higher levels of waste and fraud due to inadequate monitoring. USAID faces pressure to quickly spend funds in Afghanistan and Pakistan, raising concerns about the effectiveness of aid projects in challenging environments. Despite some success stories, observers question the impact of aid programs in such circumstances. Development aid in challenging environments may not always result in significant project outputs or long-term stability. While USAID staff design projects carefully, it is difficult to ensure broad development accountability and impact in these situations. Despite some success stories, observers question the overall effectiveness of aid programs in such circumstances. Development aid in challenging environments may not always result in significant project outputs or long-term stability. USAID faced criticism in the 1980s and 1990s, leading to a focus on measuring and demonstrating success. \"Managing for results\" shifted the aid program's focus to achieving higher level strategic objectives and program outcomes. USAID's focus shifted to achieving higher level strategic objectives and program outcomes, emphasizing measurable indicators and targets for progress evaluation. Some critics, like former Administrator Andrew Natsios, argue that the emphasis on financial and performance accountability may have negative effects on agency operations and program effectiveness. The emphasis on accountability in USAID's management practices may discourage risk-taking, leading to caution and limited innovation in funding new partners and approaches to development. While reforms aim to promote risk-taking, old habits and fear of failure still prevail, impacting where assistance dollars are invested. Compliance regulations prioritize short-term planning and quantifiable health outcomes in aid projects, neglecting long-term development goals and local participation. This approach hinders innovation and adds complexity to project implementation. Natsios argues that measurable indicators have been misused by IGs to claim programs are not working, leading to project delays and inadequate paperwork. He suggests that in war zones and high-security areas, where political aims are paramount, the same performance standards should not be applied as in developmental projects. The USAID procurement reform aims to provide more funds directly to host countries and local organizations to promote country ownership and sustainability. This has raised concerns about impacts on U.S. contractors, achieving country ownership, and maintaining accountability standards. Controversy arose in 2010 over the proposed effort to move 30% of contract and grant missions. The proposed effort aimed to move 30% of contract and grant mission funds through recipient country governments and private sector institutions by FY2015. Critics argued that it undervalued the expertise and track record of U.S. contractors and grantees in achieving aid objectives and representing U.S. values abroad. The proposed effort aimed to move 30% of contract and grant mission funds through recipient country governments and private sector institutions by FY2015. Critics argued that it undervalued the expertise and track record of U.S. contractors and grantees in achieving aid objectives and representing U.S. values abroad. U.S. entities and their supporters, especially in the community of charitable organizations, generate constituent and congressional backing for foreign aid. InterAction, representing U.S. humanitarian and development NGOs, argued that USAID's 30% objective should include U.S. NGO programs that build local capacity. The controversy surrounding USAID's 30% localization objective has lessened over time as the agency has become less strict on meeting set targets. Some NGOs support the objective, citing lower costs and better local knowledge, while others, including a consortium of for-profit development companies, argue against it. The development community appears divided on the issue. In 2010, USAID's focus on meeting specific targets has decreased, leading to a more flexible approach towards U.S. organizations. The agency's procurement reform faced criticism for poor management. Despite the shift towards \"local solutions,\" U.S. organizations still implement 70% of mission program funds, aligning with USAID's historical emphasis on local participation. USAID's \"local solutions\" reform aims to strengthen the capacity of government and private sector entities in developing countries to manage their own development. This approach involves funneling aid funds through host governments and local organizations to build their capacity and ensure long-term program sustainability. This shift towards local solutions differs from USAID's historical role of building institutional capacities in developing countries. The USAID's \"local solutions\" reform focuses on building the institutional capacities of developing countries by placing technical experts, training bureaucrats, and supporting local organizations. The development community debates the effectiveness of achieving \"country ownership\" through localization of aid. Capacity building in this context involves helping local organizations undertake USAID projects and meet financial requirements, but some argue that this approach may create dependence on donor funding without developing institutional capacities. Concerns also arise about local NGOs potentially needing to restructure or losing grassroots support with increased USAID assistance. Some believe that many governments and organizations may not be ready to independently implement U.S. aid programs. Critics argue that building capacity in U.S. aid programs should focus on transferring knowledge rather than just funds. They suggest open competition for better development outcomes, utilizing U.S. NGOs to develop local organizations' management capacity. Simplifying application and reporting requirements would help local organizations implement programs successfully. The concept of local ownership in aid programs is debated, with some concerned about increasing funds before organizations are ready, while others believe developing country organizations already have the capacity. A USAID study found many organizations could compete with U.S. NGOs. Changes in USAID behavior may be necessary for local ownership efforts to succeed. Staff incentives and job descriptions at USAID Missions may need to be reformed to prioritize getting to know local organizations. USAID is facing challenges in promoting local engagement due to security concerns, paperwork, and other priorities. While the agency has incentivized staff to work with local organizations, restrictive security rules and limited resources may hinder a culture of localization. To increase participation of local entities in USAID programs, the agency has sought to limit competition. USAID has sought to limit competition in favor of local organizations or provide sole source awards. Congress supported a pilot effort to limit competition for awards under $5 million to local entities if it would result in cost savings or develop local capacity. However, language in FY2014 and FY2015 appropriations may constrain USAID's localization efforts. The FY2014 and FY2015 appropriations may constrain USAID's efforts to promote local solutions by requiring documented assessments of local capacity and effective monitoring systems to prevent fraud. Congressional concerns about accountability for funds going to foreign entities have been raised. The FY2014 and FY2015 appropriations require assessments of partner capacity to implement aid programs to prevent waste, fraud, or abuse. USAID has processes in place to monitor project performance and financial accountability for both foreign and U.S. entities. Many contractors and NGOs already use local personnel and organizations to implement programs. USAID has implemented a \"local solutions\" reform to address concerns about country performance and accountability in providing aid. They use a Public Financial Management Risk Assessment Framework (PFMRAF) to assess partner governments' capacity to handle development funds. By March 2015, 35 countries had completed the initial risk appraisal, with 27 moving on to identify gaps in specific government entities' capacity. This assessment informs project design and the decision to provide direct government-to-government assistance. The PFMRAF is applied to relevant government parts like the Ministry of Health and Finance for projects. By March 2015, 147 risk assessments were done or ongoing, to be updated every three years. While weaknesses were found in implementation, fiduciary risk assessments were conducted, but risk mitigation measures were not always integrated into project planning. USAID also assesses local capacity for non-government entities. USAID assesses local capacity and identifies risks using a Non-U.S. Organization Pre-Award Survey. Mission officers work closely with local organizations to ensure accountability standards are met. A 2013 USAID IG examination found no weaknesses in the survey implementation. To reduce risk with partner governments, USAID now uses financing mechanisms like Fixed Amount Reimbursement Agreements (FARA) and Fixed Obligation Grants (FOG) to have more control over funds and project outcomes. USAID uses Fixed Obligation Grants (FOG) to measure progress and provide funds to local NGOs, especially those with limited experience. In special cases like Afghanistan, where corruption is widespread, USAID follows different methods to enable oversight, such as funneling aid through the government. The Reconstruction Trust Fund in Afghanistan moves assistance into government salaries or community development programs, monitored by the World Bank. USAID provides funds to vetted ministries for specific projects, with health program funds going through the Afghan Ministry of Health to international NGOs. SIGAR has highlighted vulnerabilities in USAID's risk mitigation measures but acknowledges their efforts in protecting direct assistance funds. USAID has been praised for protecting direct assistance funds better than other U.S. agencies. Risk assessment procedures help mitigate fraud, but cannot eliminate it entirely. Directing funds through local entities poses unique disadvantages, such as fewer legal remedies in case of financial misuse. Reform supporters argue that transparent aid to governments allows local watchdog organizations to combat corruption and strengthen democratic institutions. U.S. for-profit and nonprofit NGOs are the main implementers of USAID programs, representing nearly 50% of assistance in FY2014. USAID's procurement reform efforts aimed to broaden aid implementers to include more U.S. small businesses and NGOs, causing opposition from larger for-profit contractors. This led to tensions between different groups within the agency, affecting the way USAID conducts its business. Rajiv Shah emphasized the need for USAID to shift away from traditional contracting practices towards a more diverse range of partners. Senate appropriators supported this procurement reform in FY2014, urging USAID to reduce reliance on large contracts. This reform aimed to address issues stemming from a decline in staff during the 1990s, leading to a shift towards awarding larger contracts to fewer implementers. The increase in Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts at USAID allowed for faster and more efficient contracting by awarding larger contracts to fewer implementers, reducing the need for multiple individual contracts. This shift was seen as limiting the role of smaller contractors and nonprofit NGOs. The growing role of contractors at USAID, particularly through Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, was criticized by the HELP Commission for giving too much power to a narrow set of contractors. The commission recommended limiting the size, range of activity, and number of umbrella awards to address this issue. The U.S. NGO community also expressed concerns about the growth of IDIQs, stating that it restricts the pool of expertise and resources available for developmental solutions. In 2004, Congress required microenterprise assistance to emphasize nonprofit PVO/NGOs. Steps have been taken to decrease large contracts and increase awards to small businesses and NGOs. USAID reviewed 67 awards between FY2010 and FY2014, restructuring 27 to increase the number of awards. In a move to increase awards to small businesses and NGOs, USAID restructured 27 awards, leading to a decrease in amounts awarded for IQCs. Despite the discontinuation of the board overseeing IQCs, a $1 billion IQC was awarded to Tetra Tech Inc. in 2015 for water programs. The debate between for-profits and nonprofits in USAID projects extends to the use of contracts and grants/cooperative agreements. In FY2013, grants and cooperative agreements accounted for two-thirds of awards ($9 billion) while contracts made up one-third ($4.5 billion) at USAID. This marked a shift from previous years when contracts were more prevalent. The procurement reform agenda at USAID was influenced by a debate between for-profit and nonprofit firms regarding their capabilities in achieving development goals. In response to USAID's procurement reform, members formed the CIDC and called for a transparent process in selecting implementing mechanisms for projects. They emphasized the importance of equal focus on accountability for contractors and grantees. Concerns were raised about the agency's increased reliance on grant awards over contracts, with a belief that contracts are inherently more transparent and accountable. The CIDC raised concerns about USAID's procurement reform, particularly the agency's increased reliance on grant awards. InterAction, representing NGOs, argued that NGOs use taxpayer dollars more effectively than contractors due to their in-country presence and institutional knowledge. This highlights the debate between grants and contracts in terms of transparency and accountability. The type of contract used by USAID varies, with fixed-price contracts requiring specific outputs while cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts focus on \"best effort.\" InterAction argues that NGOs are treated as implementers rather than partners with expertise, as cooperative agreements have become more prescriptive over the years. In FY2003, USAID's procurement awards increased from 22% to 46% by FY2013. InterAction and CIDC criticized USAID's guidelines on implementing mechanisms, urging clarity and consistency in choosing between grants and contracts. CIDC's parent body highlighted a Supreme Court decision emphasizing adherence to federal procurement laws distinguishing grants and contracts. In 2014, a USAID-sponsored study recommended improving procurement efficiency. The Obama Administration emphasized rebuilding USAID as the lead development agency due to its weakened status within the U.S. government. The weakened status of USAID within the U.S. government has hindered its ability to meet development objectives, coordinate assistance, allocate resources effectively, and function independently. Throughout its history, USAID's autonomy has been challenged and changed, leading to shifts in its institutional position. The State Department initially led foreign aid policy, but there have been reevaluations of aid policy over the past 50 years, impacting USAID's role. The Secretary of State has continuous supervision over assistance programs. In 1961, President Kennedy established the Agency for International Development under the State Department. The degree of State Department's supervision over USAID in its early years is not well documented. In its early years, USAID operated with autonomy. In 1973, it chaired the Development Coordination Committee and its subcommittee on bilateral aid. President Carter established the International Development Cooperation Administration in 1979, giving it primary responsibility for development assistance policy. The IDCA scheme under the Reagan Administration diminished in power and prestige, with the USAID Administrator taking over as the IDCA Director. This led to USAID becoming a more autonomous entity, separate from the Department of State. In 1997, the Clinton Administration proposed a foreign affairs reorganization to address congressional critics and absorb USAID's functions. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 reorganized foreign affairs by absorbing the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency into the State Department. USAID remained a separate agency but reported to the Secretary of State. IDCA was abolished through an amendment to Executive Order 12163, with economic assistance functions delegated to the Secretary of State. Delegation of Authority No. 145 revised on March 31, 1999, delegated USAID functions to the Administrator under the Secretary of State's authority. The Secretary reviews USAID's strategic plan, budget submissions, and significant reprogramming of economic assistance. The Clinton Administration's Reorganization Plan and Report in 1998 outlined the framework for coordinating development and economic assistance, with USAID consulting with the State Department. This set the stage for the Bush Administration's actions in 2006, including the creation of the Director of Foreign Assistance position to increase coordination of foreign aid programs with foreign policy. The Bush Administration's initiative in 2006 created the Director of Foreign Assistance position, giving the new DFA concurrent roles as USAID Administrator and a State Department Deputy Secretary equivalent. This move sparked controversy in the foreign assistance community, with some believing it diminished USAID's status while others argued it strengthened USAID's access to foreign policy decision-making. USAID also chaired the International Development Policy Coordination Committee for the first time, increasing its program responsibilities, particularly in national security conflicts. The creation of the Director of Foreign Assistance in 2006 led to increased responsibilities for USAID, particularly in national security conflicts like Afghanistan and Iraq. However, USAID lost its budget and policy functions to the new DFA entity in the State Department. The reform shifted decision-making to a more centralized planning process, the country assistance strategy (CAS), which lacked substantive details on achieving objectives. The reform in USAID during the transition period added uncertainty to mission planning and implementation, making long-term agreements with host country governments challenging. The establishment of new assistance programs like PEPFAR and MCC bypassed USAID, leading to congressional pressure for USAID to have a role in the MCC Board of Directors. Despite lacking policy responsibility, USAID implements a significant portion of PEPFAR's program. Additionally, new competitors in the development field emerged, including non-traditional aid providers. The erosion of support for USAID in the past two decades was influenced by various factors, including the rise of non-traditional aid providers within the U.S. government. Funding cuts in the mid-1990s led to staff reductions, while the agency's powers were absorbed by the State Department. Blame for aid failures, anti-foreign aid rhetoric in Congress, and instances of waste also contributed to USAID's challenges. The USAID agency faced funding cuts in the mid-1990s, leading to staff reductions and decreased morale. Negative impressions of the agency being bureaucratic and slow persisted, reaching an institutional low point by 2007. Under the Obama Administration, USAID's fortunes improved, with efforts to make it the lead development agency and endorse reforms like USAID Forward. The State Department's role in USAID's business became less expansive. The State Department's role in USAID's business was somewhat reduced, with the Director of Foreign Assistance now leading the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources. The country assistance strategy was replaced with a mission-focused country development cooperation strategy. Despite plans for USAID to take over leadership of the Global Health Initiative, the Administration decided to keep it under the State Department. Some question USAID's budget recovery. Some question the extent to which USAID has regained its budget function, with concerns that its independence may be challenged in the future by the State Department's diplomatic imperatives. The development point of view of USAID is often overshadowed by the State Department's priorities, leading to potential misuse of funds. The tension between USAID and the State Department is evident in the prioritization of funds, with a focus on visible projects like bridge construction over less visible investments in education. The ICASS program was initiated to cut overseas costs by consolidating administrative services at embassies, leading to complaints from USAID FSOs about its management and impact on their operating budget. The GAO highlighted issues with USAID's operating budget, including the unavailability of ICASS motor pool vehicles for travel to project sites. The consolidation of staff salary systems has also impacted USAID's effectiveness, with foreign national staff taking on roles similar to U.S. direct hire personnel. The consolidation of employment systems at USAID has limited pay levels for foreign nationals, leading to difficulties in retaining skilled staff. Security concerns post-1998 Kenya embassy bombing have affected operations, with State Department security measures being perceived as more stringent than necessary by USAID staff. Missions have been consolidated into U.S. embassy compounds, resulting in isolation from clients. The 2015 QDDR addresses concerns about security measures potentially hindering State Department and USAID objectives. It promises a review to identify obstacles, recommend policy flexibility, devise better operating options in challenging environments, and maximize field input for policy deliberations. National Security Decision Directive 38 gives the Chief of Mission final say on staff size and composition at diplomatic missions abroad. The State Department's efforts to reduce the number of USAID staff in East Africa, particularly in Kenya, have led to a 40% reduction in the regional mission office in Nairobi. This has raised concerns as the regional office is responsible for cross-border programs in countries like Burundi, Somalia, and Djibouti. USAID's localization efforts involve hiring more staff to oversee fund management by local organizations, requiring close proximity for effective interaction. The State Department wanted to move USAID staff outside Africa, but USAID managed to disperse them to other African countries. Congress influences USAID operations through authorizing and appropriating funds. The language authorizing USAID activities is broad and dates back to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The annual appropriations legislation and oversight hearings by Congress shape USAID's programs and operations, with some negative consequences noted by development analysts. Congressional directives, known as earmarks, can limit USAID's mission flexibility in achieving development goals. Funding mandates can restrict mission flexibility and alignment with country priorities. Additional funding announcements at the end of the fiscal year lead to projects being shoehorned into programs, favoring health sector programs like HIV/AIDS prevention. Critics argue that this focus limits funding for other activities. Critics argue that USAID has too many legislative objectives, hindering its ability to focus on priority issues. Despite efforts to narrow its focus in the past, Congress continues to add objectives, leading to criticism and recommendations to streamline goals. Critics have raised concerns about the multitude of legislative objectives at USAID, which hampers its ability to prioritize key issues. Efforts to streamline goals have been hindered by funding mandates imposed by Congress, known as \"barnacles,\" which include prohibitions, restrictions, and reporting requirements. The conclusion highlights the significant resources spent on ensuring compliance with legislative restrictions at USAID. One specific requirement, regarding food aid procurement and shipping, has been a topic of debate. The 2014 farm bill provided some flexibility for USAID to provide cash-based assistance for local commodity purchases. Subsequent proposals aim to further increase the agency's flexibility in delivering aid. Proposals aim to increase USAID's flexibility in delivering emergency aid, but Congress did not approve more ambitious food aid reforms. Some question if Congress micro-manages USAID more than other agencies. The Millennium Challenge Corporation was created to establish a program free from constraints. Congress has historically pressured USAID to disburse funds quickly to avoid unobligated funds being used elsewhere. The need to disburse funds rapidly to prevent them from being redirected for other purposes by Congress has led to challenges in providing aid effectively through local organizations. Uncertainty in future funding and the pressure to demonstrate quick results have resulted in shorter project time frames, hindering long-term planning. The reduction in USAID's staff and capacity to design, administer, and monitor programs has been attributed to Congress. Budget cuts since FY2012 may be affecting administrative accounts unequally, hindering long-term engagement for sustainable development. The reduction in USAID's staff and capacity to design, administer, and monitor programs has been attributed to Congress. Budget cuts since FY2012 may be affecting administrative accounts unequally. Ensuring sustainability has been more an aspiration than an achievement of USAID, with lack of capacity in developing countries being a major obstacle. The failure to align agency projects with partner government interests has also hindered sustainability efforts. Examples of unsustainable projects include a water and sanitation project in Lebanon with non-functional water meters due to lack of government funds for repairs. The USAID has faced challenges in ensuring sustainability of projects due to budget cuts and lack of capacity in developing countries. Examples include non-functional water meters in Lebanon, schools in West Bank/Gaza, and road construction in South Sudan. Similar issues have been seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, where projects were implemented without considering the recipient country's ability to maintain them. In response, sustainability guidance was issued in Afghanistan in 2011 to align projects with local priorities. In 2014, the SIGAR criticized USAID for not consistently addressing sustainability issues in Afghanistan. USAID implemented new project design guidance in 2011 to include sustainability objectives in all projects. A mandatory sustainability analysis is now conducted during project development to identify potential challenges. Through its \"local solutions\" initiative, USAID aims to address sustainability challenges in projects by engaging local systems and promoting domestic resource mobilization. This helps governments expand their tax base, reduce tax evasion, and raise revenue to support development, ultimately mitigating future issues highlighted in the USAID IG report. The challenging environment in which USAID operates includes multiple lines of authority, shifting priorities, uncertain budgets, and unpredictable partners. Despite addressing old challenges with reforms, new ones have emerged. Key challenges include shortages of specific skill sets among Foreign Service Officers, such as contract officers for aid localization efforts and specialists for policy initiatives like the Feed the Future initiative. USAID faces difficulties in deploying personnel to critical priority countries like Afghanistan and Sudan. USAID faces challenges in deploying personnel to critical priority countries like Afghanistan and Sudan, as well as unanticipated crisis countries like Haiti after the earthquake. Providing sufficient training to new personnel amidst declining budgets is a concern, along with retaining recruited staff due to lack of language and skill training, travel funding, and a constraining environment. Retaining quality foreign national staff is also a challenge due to low salaries and limited promotion opportunities. Scaling up USAID innovations in development practice and science and technology is another issue. The history of USAID is filled with pilot programs that were not fully developed. Efforts to scale up Lab innovations may require a longer time horizon and funding for follow-up projects. Disseminating knowledge of innovations agency-wide is crucial for success. USAID is focusing on improving the quality of evaluations and using results as lessons learned for future projects. To ensure evaluation results are used as \"lessons learned\" for future programs, USAID works with local governments and the private sector, committing personnel and funds with flexibility to reflect country priorities. Building \"country ownership\" and resource mobilization efforts aim to sustain development beyond USAID interventions, but a clear path to sustainability is still in progress. Lack of security for agency personnel overseas presents significant obstacles. Security concerns, especially in non-permissive environments like South Sudan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, hinder successful project implementation for USAID. Overcoming security obstacles to meet with government and civil society representatives and ensuring safe access to project sites are major challenges. Additionally, program flexibility is crucial for USAID staff to navigate various imperatives and mandates while working towards sustainable development. USAID faces challenges in reconciling congressional mandates, presidential initiatives, State department directives, partner government priorities, and international community influence to create a coherent development program in priority countries."
