The Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct studies on enlarging Pueblo Dam and Reservoir, Sugar Loaf Dam and Turquoise Lake in Colorado. It also allows the Secretary to enter into contracts for the use of excess storage and conveyance capacity for various purposes. The Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct studies on enlarging Pueblo Dam and Reservoir, Sugar Loaf Dam, and Turquoise Lake in Colorado. It also allows the Secretary to enter into contracts for the use of excess storage and conveyance capacity for various purposes, as outlined in the Final PSOP Implementation Committee Report. The Act aims to amend the Act of August 16, 1962, without interfering with the project's authorized purposes or existing contractual obligations. It does not intend to increase diversions of project water from the natural basin of the Colorado River or nonproject water from the natural basin of the Colorado River within Colorado into another river basin for delivery or storage, except as provided in the Act. The Act prohibits interference with existing contracts between the Board of Water Works of Pueblo, Colorado, and the United States, as well as any impact on other congressionally authorized water projects. The Secretary is authorized to conduct studies for the enlargement of Pueblo Dam and Sugar Loaf Dam. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to engage in storage space studies for enlarging Pueblo Dam and Reservoir and Sugar Loaf Dam and Turquoise Lake in Colorado, including determining costs, benefits, and environmental impacts as described in specific reports. Before funds are expended for the studies authorized by this section, the Southeastern Colorado Water Activity Enterprise must agree to participate in and fund the costs of the studies, which may be provided in the form of services related to the studies. The Secretary is authorized to enter contracts for excess storage and conveyance capacity of certain East Slope facilities of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project in Colorado. The Act of August 16, 1962 is amended to authorize the Secretary to enter into contracts with agencies or entities for excess water storage and conveyance capacity within project boundaries, as described in specific reports. These contracts should not interfere with the project's authorized purposes or the ability of project contractors to meet their obligations. The project contractors must meet Federal repayment obligations, adhere to storage allocations and limitations in Contract No. 5-07-70-W0086, and consider the project's yield from water rights and capacity in Reclamation facilities. The contract term under this section must not exceed the remaining term of Contract No. 5-07-70-W0086 between the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District and the United States. The Secretary will renew the contract at the end of the term under just and equitable conditions, with a duration no less than the original contract term. The Secretary will not execute a contract with any entity that has not agreed to reimburse the Southeastern Colorado Water Activity Enterprise for implementation and development costs. Compensation for spilled water under the Winter Water Storage Program will be in the form of a credit financed by a surcharge on contracts executed under this section. The United States will be reimbursed for excess storage capacity by municipal water providers within project boundaries. They must also cooperate in a flow management program, participate in a water quality monitoring program, and pay any necessary surcharges determined by the Southeastern Colorado Water Activity Enterprise Board of Directors. The Storage Options Plan Report, published in 2000, outlines the payment process for excess capacity use to the Southeastern Colorado Water Activity Enterprise. The Secretary can enter temporary contracts with agencies for nonproject water storage for various purposes. The Secretary can enter contracts for irrigation, municipal, industrial, and other beneficial purposes, ensuring they do not interfere with project purposes, repayment obligations, or storage allocations as per contract agreements. The Secretary can enter contracts for various purposes, subject to certain conditions such as project yield, capacity in project facilities, and agreement to pay surcharges determined by the Southeastern Colorado Water Activity Enterprise Board of Directors. The Southeastern Colorado Water Activity Enterprise Board of Directors may impose conditions on water bank usage, prioritize water use within the Arkansas River basin, and determine limitations on water use. Revenue from contracts will first cover operational costs and then repay the project until fully paid off. Once project costs are repaid, revenue from contracts under sections 8 and 9 will be used for operations, maintenance, and project facility replacements. Nonproject water under contracts is exempt from acreage limitations. Nonproject water under contracts shall be exempt from acreage limitations and farm unit size limitations. If nonproject water is commingled with project water and used for irrigation, it must adhere to the same limitations unless specific contract provisions are in place for separate accounting. Excess water storage capacity in certain east slope facilities for nonproject water diversion is restricted unless authorized by a pre-existing decree. Charges for project water usage must be paid as determined by the Secretary, including an interest component for excess capacity. The section outlines conditions for water diversion, including the need for infrastructure, existing agreements, and future agreements or arrangements. The section outlines conditions for water diversion, including the requirement for agreements between the beneficiary of the diversion and a water conservation district or water conservancy district within whose boundaries the waters are proposed for diversion. Alternatively, compensatory storage or alternate water supply must be provided equal to the quantity diverted out of the basin. The section outlines conditions for water diversion, requiring agreements with a water conservancy district within whose boundaries the waters are proposed for diversion."
