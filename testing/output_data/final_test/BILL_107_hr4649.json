    "content": "ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS OF CERTAIN HAITIAN NATIONALS. Adjustment of Status: The status of certain Haitian nationals can be adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident if they apply before April 1, 2005, and meet eligibility criteria, excluding specific grounds for inadmissibility. An alien present in the United States who has been ordered excluded, deported, or removed may apply for adjustment of status without needing to file a motion to reopen the order. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains effective. Aliens eligible for adjustment of status under subsection (a) must be nationals of Haiti, physically present in the US since December 1, 1995, and have been physically present for at least 1 year when filing for adjustment. The Attorney General can provide regulations for aliens with final deportation orders to seek a stay of removal. The Attorney General can authorize an alien in deportation proceedings to work in the US if they apply for adjustment of status under subsection (a) and raise it as a defense. The Attorney General may authorize an alien to work in the US during the pendency of their application for adjustment of status. If the application is pending for over 180 days without denial, the Attorney General must authorize employment. Additionally, spouses and children of aliens whose status is adjusted to permanent residence may also have their status adjusted by the Attorney General. The alien must establish physical presence in the US for at least 1 year, apply for adjustment while present in the US, and meet eligibility and admissibility requirements for permanent residence. The Attorney General shall provide applicants for adjustment of status with the same administrative review rights and procedures as applicants under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or aliens in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act. (f) Limitation on Judicial Review.--The Attorney General's decision on adjusting an alien's status under this subsection is final and not subject to court review. When an alien is granted permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act definitions apply, and this section does not change any existing provisions. The Attorney General's powers in immigration enforcement are not affected by this section. Eligibility for permanent residence status under this section does not prevent seeking it under other laws."
