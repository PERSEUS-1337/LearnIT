    "content": "The \"Raise Wages, Cut Carbon Act of 2009\" introduces a new subchapter in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, focusing on reducing social security taxes and implementing a tax on combustible fossil fuels. This includes sections on carbon tax revenues to offset social security taxes, a tax on combustible fossil fuels, a tax on certain imported substances, and a requirement for a supermajority to change revenue neutrality. The \"Raise Wages, Cut Carbon Act of 2009\" appropriates net revenues from taxes to the social security trust funds in proportions defined by existing laws. It also mandates a reduction in social security taxes based on a specified formula. The Secretary determines the reduction percentage for each year to ensure trust fund deposits equal to the amount that would be appropriated for social security taxes. Additionally, there is an increase in payments to social security recipients in 2010 to offset the cost of a carbon tax. The reduction percentage for each year is determined by the Secretary to match trust fund deposits with the amount appropriated for social security taxes. In 2010, payments to social security recipients increase to offset the cost of a carbon tax. Definitions for social security tax are provided in the subchapter. The term 'social security trust fund' includes the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account. Determinations under subsections (a) and (b) are based on estimates by the Secretary, with adjustments made for accuracy. The social security tax rates adjustments for any calendar year must be published in the Federal Register by November 1 of the preceding year. \"PART II--TAX ON COMBUSTIBLE FOSSIL FUELS includes the imposition of tax, refunds or credits, and other definitions and special rules.\" The tax imposed on taxable carbon substances is based on the carbon dioxide emissions potential per ton, determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Energy. The tax amount for any fraction of a ton is calculated proportionally. The applicable amount for each calendar year is determined from a table and adjusted accordingly. The tax amount for taxable carbon substances is determined based on carbon dioxide emissions potential per ton, adjusted annually according to a table. The tax amount for taxable carbon substances is adjusted annually according to a table, with the applicable amounts ranging from $15.00 in 2010 to $28.23 in 2020. The tax amount for taxable carbon substances is adjusted annually according to a table, with the applicable amounts increasing from $28.23 in 2020 to $60.30 in 2032. The tax amount for taxable carbon substances increases annually according to a table, reaching 100.00% in 2040 or thereafter. The tax amount for taxable carbon substances increases annually after 2010 based on the cost-of-living adjustment, rounded to the nearest amount. The term 'taxable carbon substance' includes coal, petroleum, and natural gas extracted or imported into the US. No additional tax will be imposed if a prior tax has already been paid on the substance. \"SEC. 4693. REFUNDS OR CREDITS.\" Under regulations set by the Secretary, a person using a taxable carbon substance to prevent carbon emissions can receive a credit or refund equal to the tax amount. If a taxable carbon substance previously taxed is used to make another taxable substance, a credit or refund may also be allowed. Under regulations set by the Secretary, a person using a taxable carbon substance to prevent carbon emissions can receive a credit or refund equal to the tax amount. No tax shall be imposed on the sale of taxable carbon substances for export or resale for export. Proof of export is required for tax-free sales. If a person exports a taxable carbon substance or a product using such substance as an energy source, they can receive a credit or refund for the tax paid, upon proving the portion of cost attributable to the tax. The Secretary will establish necessary regulations for implementing this subsection. SEC. 4694 defines other definitions and special rules. Definitions for the terms 'United States,' 'importer,' and 'ton' are provided in this subchapter. If a person manufactures, produces, or imports a taxable carbon substance and uses it, they are liable for tax as if the substance were sold. Special rules apply for inventory exchanges. The paragraph discusses the treatment of inventory exchanges involving taxable carbon substances. It states that such exchanges are not considered sales, and the receiving party is treated as the manufacturer, producer, or importer for tax purposes, provided both parties are registered with the Secretary. The term 'inventory exchange' refers to the exchange of property between two parties, where the property is considered taxable carbon substances. This exchange is not treated as a sale, and the receiving party is regarded as the manufacturer, producer, or importer for tax purposes if both parties are registered with the Secretary. The tax on certain additional imported products is imposed under Section 4695. The tax imposed on imported taxable products is based on the amount of taxable carbon substances or carbon dioxide emissions attributable to the product's manufacture. Interested parties can challenge information provided by importers regarding the tax. The term 'imported taxable product' refers to articles described in the same Harmonized Tariff Schedule heading as domestically produced articles in industries accounting for 95% of taxable carbon substances in the US. An industry cannot be omitted from the list if it uses more taxable carbon substances per unit of output than any listed industry. During 2010 through 2012, the term 'listed industry' includes industries with the highest average use of taxable carbon substances per unit of output. In 2011 and 2012, it also includes a portion of the remaining industries with high carbon substance use. During 2010 through 2012, the term 'listed industry' includes those with the highest average use of taxable carbon substances per unit of output. In 2011 and 2012, it also includes a portion of the remaining industries with high carbon substance use. The terms 'importer', 'taxable carbon substance', and 'United States' have specific meanings as defined in part II. PART IV--SUPERMAJORITY REQUIRED TO CHANGE REVENUE NEUTRALITY\n\nSEC. 4697.
