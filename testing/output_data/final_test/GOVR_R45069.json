    "content": "Drug compounding is the process of combining or altering drug ingredients to create customized medications for individual patients when FDA-approved products are not suitable. Pharmacists or physicians may compound nonsterile (e.g., capsules) or sterile products (e.g., injectables) based on specific patient needs. FDA regulates drug manufacturing and sale in the US, including compounded drugs. The FDA regulates drug manufacturing and sale in the US, including compounded drugs. Compounded drugs are considered new drugs but are not evaluated by the FDA for safety or effectiveness before marketing. Oversight and regulation of drug compounding have historically been left to state regulatory bodies. In the 1990s, concerns arose about compounding pharmacies acting like drug manufacturers, leading to the FDA issuing a Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) in 1992. This guide was later partially incorporated into the FDA Modernization Act in 1997, which introduced FFDCA Section 503A to regulate compounded drugs. Section 503A of the FDA Modernization Act established conditions for drug compounding to be exempt from certain requirements, including the need for a valid prescription and limitations on advertising specific drugs. The Supreme Court found the advertising provisions of Section 503A unconstitutional in 2002, but did not address the issue of severability. FDA interpreted this ruling to invalidate Section 503A entirely, but in 2008 another court ruled that it was severable, leaving much of it in force. As a result, FDA considered some provisions of Section 503A effective in certain states. In 2012, contaminated compounded drugs from the New England Compounding Center led to a deadly outbreak of fungal meningitis, highlighting the confusion over authority between states and the FDA in regulating compounding pharmacies. This incident was not isolated, as FDA studies had also found quality issues with drugs from other pharmacies. The FDA found quality problems with drugs compounded by pharmacies, leading to serious illnesses and deaths. The Compounding Quality Act (CQA) was passed in response to these issues, clarifying FDA's authority to regulate pharmacy compounding practices. The Compounding Quality Act (CQA) was enacted to regulate pharmacy compounding practices under FFDCA Section 503A and added a new FFDCA Section 503B for outsourcing facilities. Unlike 503A compounding pharmacies, outsourcing facilities must comply with CGMPs and have specific registration, reporting, and inspection requirements. FDA has issued guidance documents and rules to implement these provisions. The FDA has communicated with stakeholders and state regulators regarding compounding provisions, with some states finding the communication helpful while others facing challenges. Various stakeholders have expressed concerns with FDA guidance and interpretation of compounding-related statutory provisions, leading to Congressional letters and legislative amendments being proposed. This report outlines the requirements for compounding pharmacies under FFDCA Section 503A. The report discusses the requirements for compounding pharmacies under FFDCA Section 503A and outsourcing facilities under Section 503B. It also covers FDA activities related to implementing compounding provisions, stakeholder concerns, and considerations for policymakers. FDA historically regulated pharmacy compounding at the state level, with varying levels of oversight. In 1992, FDA issued guidance on compounding practices subject to enforcement action, with Congress later providing statutory authority in FFDCA Section 503A. A compounded drug can be exempt from certain FFDCA sections if it meets the conditions of Section 503A, including being compounded by a licensed pharmacist or physician for an identified patient with a valid prescription. If not, the drug must comply with CGMP, labeling, and new drug approval requirements like conventional manufacturers. Compounded drugs can be exempt from certain FFDCA sections if compounded by a licensed pharmacist or physician for an identified patient with a valid prescription. The compounding must be based on a history of the pharmacist or physician receiving prescription orders and complying with specified requirements. The USP chapter on pharmacy compounding prohibits compounding drugs that are on the HHS Secretary's list of withdrawn or unsafe drugs, or essentially copies of commercially available drugs. Compounded drugs must not present demonstrable difficulties for compounding that affect safety or effectiveness, and must be compounded in a state with an MOU for interstate distribution oversight. Compounding pharmacies are not required to report adverse events or register with FDA. FDA may inspect pharmacies for cause, with limitations on inspections. Pharmacies must not distribute compounded drugs outside the state in quantities exceeding 5% of total prescriptions dispensed. FDA has authority to inspect pharmacies and equipment. The CQA established FFDCA Section 503B, creating outsourcing facilities for compounding sterile drugs in bulk for hospitals. The compounding of sterile drugs is done by outsourcing facilities that register under Section 503B and comply with its requirements. These facilities are exempt from certain sections of the FFDCA, but must adhere to CGMP requirements. If drugs are not compounded according to Section 503B, they are subject to the same regulations as conventional drug manufacturers. Outsourcing facilities can compound drugs under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist, following specific limitations and using ingredients that comply with recognized standards. The drugs must not be on the Secretary's list of unsafe or ineffective drugs, be essentially copies of approved drugs, or be on a list of drugs that present compounding difficulties likely to affect safety or effectiveness. Outsourcing facilities can compound drugs under specific limitations, ensuring ingredients comply with standards. Compounded drugs must not be on the unsafe or ineffective list, copies of approved drugs, or present compounding difficulties affecting safety or effectiveness. Compounded drugs must meet various conditions to prevent adverse effects and must be labeled accordingly. Outsourcing facilities must adhere to specific requirements when compounding drugs, including providing detailed labeling information such as lot number, drug name, dosage form, expiration date, and active/inactive ingredients. Additionally, entities registering as outsourcing facilities must meet certain criteria to qualify for exemptions under Section 503B. Entities registering as outsourcing facilities under Section 503B must annually register with the Secretary, submit reports on compounded drugs, undergo inspections based on risk factors, and report adverse events to the FDA. They can compound drugs with or without a prescription, must compound sterile drugs, and may compound nonsterile drugs. Since the enactment of the CQA, FDA has issued guidance documents, conducted inspections, issued warning letters, and overseen recall events related to drug compounding. Over 400 inspections have been conducted, with more than 150 warning letters issued for violations of federal law. FDA has also engaged with stakeholders and state regulators through various means. As of December 2017, 73 entities have registered as outsourcing facilities. In December 2017, FDA's website listed 73 entities registered as outsourcing facilities. It is challenging to determine the total number of 503A compounding pharmacies as they are overseen by state regulatory bodies. A 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted communication challenges between state pharmacy regulatory bodies and FDA, with some states reporting satisfaction and others dissatisfaction with the communication process. Stakeholders have raised concerns about challenges with FDA, including timeliness and difficulties in obtaining information. Congress has responded by sending letters, issuing directives, and introducing legislation to address these issues related to compounding provisions. This is not a comprehensive list of all the issues raised. Selected issues related to compounding provisions have been the subject of congressional letters, report directives, and legislation. The three main issues discussed are: (1) prescription requirements and compounding for office-use, (2) draft MOU for interstate distribution of compounded drugs, and (3) inspections under CGMP requirements. To qualify for exemptions under FFDCA Section 503A, a drug product must meet specific statutory conditions, including compounding based on a valid prescription or a history of prescription orders within an established relationship. Anticipatory compounding allows for limited quantity compounding before receiving a patient-specific prescription. FDA's position is that anticipatory compounding does not authorize compounding for office-use, which is for keeping compounded drugs in stock for hospitals or clinics. This is in contrast to compounding based on a valid prescription or history of prescription orders within an established relationship. FDA has generally taken the position that 503A pharmacies may not compound for office-use. In FY2016, the House Committee on Appropriations directed FDA to issue guidance on office-use compounding within 90 days. The draft guidance stated that compounding is allowed in response to a patient-specific prescription or in limited quantities under section 503A. Office-use compounding is not permitted under this guidance. The FDA allows hospitals, clinics, and health care practitioners to obtain non-patient-specific compounded drugs for office-use from registered outsourcing facilities under Section 503B. This type of compounding is subject to additional FDA requirements to ensure quality and safety, such as compliance with CGMPs, registration, reporting, and inspections. The House Appropriations Committee directed the FDA to issue final guidance for office-use compounding of drugs, as it is authorized in most states and intended under the CQA. The FDA finalized guidance in December 2016, stating that compounding for office-use is not allowed under Section 503A. The prescription requirement is deemed necessary to ensure compounding is based on individual patient need and distinguish it from conventional manufacturing. FDA's policies implement statutory provisions for compounding by outsourcing facilities under section 503B and anticipatory compounding by compounders under section 503A. The resolution of compounding for office-use remains uncertain despite FDA's stance. Legislation introduced in Congress may allow compounding for office-use if permitted by the state, despite FDA's current stance against it. A GAO survey found that compounding for office-use is authorized in 27 states, with some requiring only FDA-registered outsourcing facilities to do so. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about FDA's draft MOU on interstate distribution of compounded drugs. The FDA prohibits distributing compounded drug products interstate in quantities exceeding 5% of total prescription orders unless an MOU is in place with the Secretary. The MOU must address interstate distribution of compounded products and allow for state agency investigation of complaints. FDA issued a draft MOU in February 2015 for use by states. The FDA issued a draft MOU in February 2015 to regulate interstate distribution of compounded drug products. The draft MOU proposes a 30% limit for 503A pharmacies operating in states that enter into the agreement. One criticism is the inclusion of dispensing in the definition of distribution, which is not defined in FFDCA Section 503A. FDA defines distribution in the draft MOU as the compounded drug leaving the facility. This includes delivery to healthcare settings for administration. A pharmacy group argues that FDA is overreaching by regulating interstate dispensing, traditionally overseen by states. They believe FDA should only address interstate distribution of large amounts of compounded drugs. The FDA's regulation of interstate distribution of compounded drugs by 503A pharmacies has raised concerns about adequate oversight and regulation, especially in cases of multistate outbreaks like the 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak. Congress has highlighted the challenges in regulating drugs distributed outside of state borders and the need for improved oversight to prevent similar incidents. In the FY2017 omnibus, Congress clarified that the FDA should only regulate the distribution, not the dispensing, of compounded drugs across state lines. Legislation in the 115th Congress aims to exclude dispensing compounded drugs from the definition of distribution under Section 503A. There is debate over whether the FDA's draft MOU aligns with congressional intent regarding compounding for office-use. The FDA's implementation of CQA has raised concerns about the inspection of compounding entities under CGMPs. Unlike outsourcing facilities, 503A compounding pharmacies are not subject to CGMP requirements or FDA registration. Most compounding facilities in the US are overseen by state regulatory authorities, with FDA only becoming aware of issues if a complaint is received. Compounding pharmacies can be inspected by FDA for drug preparation under insanitary conditions. Since June 1, 2017, the FDA has conducted over 400 inspections of compounding entities, mainly 503A pharmacies, issuing 150 warning letters for violations of federal law. They have also overseen 125 recalls of compounded drugs and collaborated with the Department of Justice on enforcement actions. Stakeholders have raised concerns about FDA inspecting 503A pharmacies under CGMP standards, to which they are exempt. FDA issues an FDA Form-483 listing inspection observations, including insanitary conditions or drug deviations. The FDA issues FDA Form-483 listing inspection observations for compounding pharmacies, including deficiencies related to insanitary conditions or drug production deviations. Some pharmacy groups have raised concerns about FDA inspecting 503A pharmacies under CGMP standards, which they are exempt from. House appropriators have reminded the FDA that compounding pharmacies are not drug manufacturers but state licensed and regulated healthcare providers. The FDA issues FDA Form-483 listing inspection observations for compounding pharmacies, including deficiencies related to insanitary conditions or drug production deviations. FDA identifies CGMP deviations on the 483 only when evidence suggests the pharmacy does not qualify for exemptions under Section 503A. FDA will now make a preliminary assessment of a facility's compliance with Section 503A before closing the inspection. The FDA issues FDA Form-483 listing inspection observations for compounding pharmacies, including deficiencies related to insanitary conditions or drug production deviations. The 483 will not include observations that represent CGMP deviations unless the investigator determines that the pharmacy does not meet the conditions of Section 503A. Despite this notice, at least one pharmacy stakeholder group alleges that FDA has continued to apply 503B outsourcing facility standards during inspection of 503A compounding pharmacies and to cite CGMP noncompliance. Policymakers may consider issues such as patient access to compounded drugs, drug quality, and necessity of compounding. Some patients require compounded drugs for medical reasons not met by FDA-approved products, highlighting the importance of timely access to these medications. Pharmacies compounding under Section 503A are exempt from certain FDA regulations, leading to potential quality and safety concerns. FDA believes compounded drugs carry a higher risk compared to FDA-approved drugs due to limited oversight and reporting requirements. FDA maintains that compounded drugs pose a higher risk than FDA-approved drugs, with some stakeholders arguing for compounding for office-use by 503A pharmacies. However, FDA and outsourcing facility groups generally disagree, as outsourcing facilities can produce in bulk with more stringent regulations. Allowing 503A pharmacies to compound for office-use may not be necessary, as hospitals and healthcare practitioners can generally obtain compounded drugs for immediate administration. FDA has issued a list of drugs that registered outsourcing facilities have produced for office-use, which helps healthcare providers determine where to obtain non-patient-specific compounded drugs. The pharmaceutical industry generally supports FDA's prescription requirement guidance for compounded drugs."
