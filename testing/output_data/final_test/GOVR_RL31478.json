    "content": "The budget is a central issue in American politics, reflecting decisions on the size of the federal government and its priorities. The framework for budgeting has remained stable, but there is ongoing reexamination to meet changing government demands. William F. Willoughby emphasized the importance of an efficient financial system in public administration, a sentiment still relevant today. The budget process in the US has garnered significant attention in recent years, with numerous proposals for reform. This report focuses on five key reform issues that Congress has shown interest in, including biennial budgeting. These proposals are part of a larger discussion on improving the budget process, with a focus on specific reform options. The report excludes more conceptual reform issues, such as authorization/appropriations and reconciliation process concerns. The report addresses key reform issues in the budget process, including reconciliation process, impoundment reform, and budget presentation. It excludes proposals for specific program reforms like off-budget status for trust funds. The report excludes reform proposals based on amending the U.S. Constitution, such as presidential item veto authority, limitations on federal government tax authority, or a balanced budget requirement. The Constitution is silent on specific guidelines for revenue or spending legislation, but grants Congress authority to lay and collect taxes. For a more detailed overview of budget process reform measures, refer to CRS Report RL31479. The Constitution grants Congress the \"power of the purse\" to collect taxes and pay debts for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 established the executive budget process, giving the President responsibility for submitting a proposed budget to Congress each year. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 established the executive budget process, giving the President responsibility for submitting a proposed budget to Congress each year. It also created the Bureau of the Budget (later reorganized as the Office of Management and Budget) and the General Accounting Office. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established the congressional budget process, including the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget, the House and Senate Budget Committees, and the Congressional Budget Office. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 established the sequester mechanism to enforce budget requirements. Separate mechanisms control direct spending and revenues (PAYGO) and discretionary spending (spending caps). OMB scores the budgetary impact of legislation three times a year. The President must issue across-the-board cuts if either the PAYGO or spending caps are breached. A proposed budget is submitted to Congress by the first Monday in February, marking the start of interactions with Congress. The budget submission is the result of a process that begins 10 months earlier, with federal agencies preparing budget requests under OMB coordination. The President's budget submission process involves agencies preparing budget requests under OMB coordination, which are then reviewed and revised based on OMB director's recommendations. Agencies may appeal these recommendations and testify at congressional hearings. The President also submits a mid-session budget review by July 15 and can make additional budget requests during the year. The President's budget submission process involves agencies preparing budget requests under OMB coordination. Congressional committees must submit their \"views and estimates\" within 6 weeks of the budget submission. The budget resolution, although not legally binding, sets congressional budget priorities and parameters for future actions. The budget process involves separate laws for spending, revenue, and public debt limits. Discretionary spending must be enacted annually before October 1. The reconciliation process can change laws on direct spending or revenues. Other budget legislation, like changes in public debt limits, are not tied to the annual budget cycle. Once budget laws are enacted, the executive branch takes over the budget process. The executive branch takes over the budget process after budget laws are enacted. The President determines if a sequester is necessary to address breaches of budget limits. The Antideficiency Acts ensure funds are apportioned correctly, while the Impoundment Control Act allows the President to propose adjustments, including deferrals and rescissions of budgetary resources. Deferrals delay spending, while rescissions permanently cancel funds unless overturned by Congress. The President can propose adjustments to budgetary resources through deferrals and rescissions, which require Congress approval. The budget resolution sets the federal budget size and composition, with allocations to committees for spending. Legislation must align with these allocations and overall spending levels. The budget resolution sets federal budget size and allocations to committees for spending. Reconciliation instructions may direct committees to recommend changes in laws affecting revenues or spending programs. Committees must submit legislative language to the Budget Committee for consideration in an omnibus measure. Reconciliation bills are considered under special rules in the House and under limitations in the Senate. The annual appropriations process funds discretionary spending through 13 bills, with appropriations originating in the House and potentially amended by the Senate. Congress may also enact supplemental funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are organized into 13 subcommittees responsible for developing regular appropriations bills, which are constrained in purpose and funding. Authorizations are required prior to appropriations, and may be temporary or permanent. Constraints exist on the amount of funding for individual items or programs, as well as total spending for a fiscal year. Discretionary spending has been limited by caps since FY1991. Additionally, appropriations must be authorized before funding can be provided. The allocations from the budget resolution to the Appropriations Committees must adhere to discretionary spending caps and are subdivided among subcommittees. These suballocations determine spending levels for the 13 regular appropriations bills and exceeding them is subject to a point of order. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 provides mechanisms to limit discretionary spending and changes in revenues and direct spending. These mechanisms are enforced during congressional consideration and by a presidential sequester order. Violating the spending caps or PAYGO process can result in a point of order. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 establishes mechanisms to limit discretionary spending and changes in revenues and direct spending. If legislation violates these limits, the President must issue an across-the-board spending cut. Congress can also enforce these limits through points of order during budgetary legislation consideration. The discretionary spending caps have been in place since FY1991 and have been extended on two occasions. Adjustments to these caps may occur automatically. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 establishes mechanisms to limit discretionary spending and changes in revenues and direct spending. Adjustments to spending caps may occur automatically under procedures provided in the Act. Discretionary spending has been divided into multiple categories in different fiscal years, with separate categories for defense, international, domestic spending, and violent crime reduction. Separate categories for defense and nondefense spending were established for certain fiscal years. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established mechanisms to limit discretionary spending and changes in revenues and direct spending. Discretionary spending limits are enforced through a presidential sequester order, with categories for highway, mass transit, and conservation spending. There are no general discretionary spending limits for fiscal years beyond FY2002, and the PAYGO process focuses on the net impact of legislation. The PAYGO process tracks the budgetary impact of legislation changing direct spending or revenues. If there is a positive balance on the PAYGO scorecard for a fiscal year, the President must issue a sequester order to reduce spending in nonexempt accounts. PAYGO provisions apply to legislation enacted before October 1, 2002. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 enforcement procedures are set to expire at the end of FY2002, prompting Congress to consider extending or adding new mechanisms to the budget process. Proposed reforms address diverse viewpoints on budgetary decision-making. The report discusses five specific options that Congress is interested in to improve the budget process. These options include extending budgetary control mechanisms, establishing a joint budget resolution involving the President, and creating an emergency reserve fund. Establishing an emergency reserve fund, creating an automatic continuing resolution for funding, and changing to a biennial budget cycle are proposed to improve budget management. Budget enforcement mechanisms under the Congressional Budget Act are permanent, while key procedures from the Budget Enforcement Act expire in FY2002. The BEA includes constraints on discretionary spending and a \"pay-as-you-go\" requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation. The Budget Enforcement Act includes constraints on discretionary spending and a \"pay-as-you-go\" requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation. Sequestration enforces spending caps and the PAYGO requirement, with automatic spending cuts and points of order in the Senate. The discretionary spending sequestration process and Senate points of order expire at the end of FY2002, while the PAYGO sequestration process covers the effects of new legislation through FY2006. President Bush proposed extending the BEA enforcement procedures in his FY2002 budget, but did not explicitly advocate for it in his FY2003 budget. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 modified budget enforcement procedures established by the Balanced Budget Act, tying sequestration to deficit targets. Automatic spending cuts would be triggered if the deficit exceeded target levels, incentivizing Congress and the President to reduce the deficit through legislative action. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 changed sequestration to new statutory limits on discretionary spending and a \"pay-as-you-go\" requirement for new legislation. Adjustable discretionary spending limits exist for various categories, and the PAYGO requirement focuses on the net effect of new direct spending and revenue legislation. The PAYGO requirement ensures that new legislation does not increase the deficit, enforced through sequestration with automatic spending cuts if limits are exceeded. The President must issue a sequestration order to cancel budgetary resources in non-exempt programs if the PAYGO requirement is violated. Within-session sequestration can occur if a supplemental appropriations bill causes spending levels to exceed the statutory limit. Discretionary spending limits and PAYGO requirements can also be enforced through points of order on the Senate floor. The Senate enforces budget limits through points of order, which can be waived by a three-fifths vote or unanimous consent. These enforcement mechanisms expire at the end of FY2002 and are seen as promoting fiscal discipline. The Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) of the 1990s led to a unified budget surplus in FY1998. There is a debate on the necessity of fiscal discipline mechanisms even during surpluses, with interest in extending the BEA beyond FY2002. The success of the BEA is attributed to enforcing multiyear budget agreements, indicating that consensus on budget policies is crucial for any extension. Simply extending the BEA is unlikely to create a budget policy consensus where none exists. Congress and the President need to decide whether to extend the budget enforcement mechanisms of the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) and if so, how to modify them. Questions to consider include the time frame of the extension, such as basing it on the number of fiscal years needed to achieve a specific budget goal. The initial BEA of 1990 and its extensions in 1993 and 1997 each covered 5 fiscal years, with different goals in mind. Under an overall discretionary spending cap, any breach would result in a sequester in all non-exempt discretionary programs. Separate caps for different categories would only trigger a sequester in non-exempt programs within the violating category, preventing harm to other categories but reducing flexibility for tradeoffs between programs. Adjustments to the spending caps are a key consideration. Adjustments to spending caps, including \"safety valves,\" are deemed necessary to ensure compliance and realism. Amid uncertainties like future demands for resources in the war on terrorism and homeland security, adjustments may be crucial. Critics suggest reevaluating existing adjustments, particularly the one for emergency spending, which has been criticized as a costly loophole. Suggestions include eliminating the emergency designation adjustment, setting criteria for emergencies, or a combination of measures. Proponents argue for adjusting spending caps to prevent misuse of emergency designations. There is a debate on modifying the PAYGO requirement for new spending and revenue legislation to allow for direct spending increases or tax cuts without causing an on-budget deficit. Opponents suggest applying the requirement only to legislation that would increase the deficit. Proponents argue that budget surpluses should be used for debt reduction or to extend the solvency of trust funds, rather than for direct spending increases or tax cuts. There is a consensus that ongoing constraints on budget policy are necessary even in times of surpluses, with ad hoc modifications made to avoid sequesters. The Defense Appropriations Act for FY2002 prevented a sequester by increasing discretionary spending limits and changing the PAYGO scorecard balance to zero for FY2001 and FY2002. Congressional actions on budget process reform are detailed in the CRS Report RL31479. Budgeting involves conflicts over who receives benefits and who pays, with differences in goals between Congress and the President. Some Members of Congress propose transforming the annual congressional budget from a concurrent resolution to a joint resolution to involve the President early in the budget process. This change aims to improve cooperation between Congress and the President in enacting spending and tax legislation. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established the annual concurrent resolution on the budget as the centerpiece of the congressional budget process. It sets forth spending and revenue levels for at least 5 fiscal years and may contain reconciliation instructions for committees to recommend legislative changes. The budget resolution, a concurrent resolution, serves as an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget plan, independent of the President's influence. It provides Congress with its own budget policy statement, separate from the President's budget proposal. Critics argue that this process may highlight potential conflicts. Critics argue that the budget resolution process may discourage early cooperation between Congress and the President, leading to difficulties in enacting regular appropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year. Some propose transforming the concurrent resolution into a joint resolution requiring the President's signature. Advocates propose transforming the budget resolution into a joint resolution, involving the President early in the process to foster cooperation between branches and reduce conflict during budget policy implementation. This formalized approach aims to replicate the success of past budget summits and bipartisan agreements. Advocates argue that a joint budget resolution would formalize early negotiations between Congress and the President, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement on budget policies. Critics, however, believe that formalizing these negotiations may not guarantee agreement on budget policies. Opponents argue that transforming the concurrent budget resolution into a joint resolution may not lead to more timely enactment of budgetary legislation, as intended by supporters. They believe that interbranch negotiations and agreements depend on consensus on budget policy, rather than procedures. The 1997 bipartisan budget agreement is cited as an example where broad budget policies did not prevent disagreements over details in subsequent legislation. Despite a 5-year plan to balance the budget by FY2002, budgetary legislation was delayed, with only one regular appropriations measure for FY1998 enacted by October 1. Critics argue that a joint budget resolution would give the President too much power, while proponents believe it would not change the President's existing authority in the budget process. The push for a joint budget resolution involves obtaining the President's approval at the beginning of the budget process. This proposal has been a recurring theme in budget process reform discussions in Congress since the late 1980s. Numerous bills have been introduced to convert the concurrent budget resolution into a joint resolution. The Task Force on Budget Process of the House Budget Committee held hearings on converting the concurrent budget resolution into a joint resolution. Legislation was introduced in the 105th and 106th Congress, with H.R. 853 proposing an annual joint resolution on the budget. Hearings on the bill were conducted by the House Rules Committee and the House Budget Committee in May 1999. In May 1999, H.R. 853 was reviewed and amended by the House Budget Committee and the House Rules Committee. The legislation was ultimately defeated on the House floor in May 2000. Some Members of Congress have expressed interest in changing the way emergency funds are budgeted, currently provided through supplemental appropriations exempt from budget constraints. Some Members of Congress and President George W. Bush have proposed creating a reserve fund for emergencies to change the current practice of providing additional federal spending for natural disasters and emergencies without comprehensive analysis. This practice may lead to unnecessary or wasteful spending. Prior to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, there was no formal mechanism in place for Congress to budget for unanticipated spending. The act established the annual budget resolution as a way for Congress to propose an overall budget plan, including provisions for emergency situations. This helped prevent the misuse of emergency funds for non-emergency purposes. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established the annual budget resolution to include provisions for emergency spending. However, the requirement for contingency spending was removed in 1985. The current budgetary treatment of emergency spending stems from agreements in 1987 and 1989 between congressional leaders and the President to limit appropriations and only use supplementals in dire emergencies. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established spending caps and a \"pay-as-you-go\" requirement for new legislation, enforced by sequestration. These mechanisms were modified and extended in 1993 and 1997, expiring in FY2002. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established spending caps and a \"pay-as-you-go\" requirement for new legislation, enforced by sequestration. The act also exempts discretionary spending designated as \"emergency requirements\" from statutory caps, as well as provisions in new direct spending and revenue legislation designated as emergency requirements. This exemption allows such spending or tax cuts to bypass congressional budget constraints. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 exempts emergency requirements from spending caps, allowing essential, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and temporary expenditures to bypass budget constraints. Criteria set by the Office of Management and Budget guide the President in determining emergency provisions. Rules in the House and Senate discourage the use of emergency designations. The House and Senate have rules in place to prevent non-emergency spending from being designated as emergency in appropriations bills. Critics argue that the emergency designation has been misused to bypass budget constraints. Critics argue that emergency-designated spending has increased significantly in recent years, with FY1999 and FY2000 seeing a substantial rise compared to the previous average. Proposals for reform include establishing a reserve fund for emergencies, with specific criteria for what qualifies as an emergency. Supporters believe this approach can help predict annual emergency spending based on past trends, even though specific emergencies cannot be foreseen. Critics argue that emergency spending has increased significantly in recent years. Proponents suggest incorporating an expected amount of emergency spending into the overall budget, based on historical averages. Some critics question setting aside funds for unknown emergencies, especially during a federal budget deficit. The budget deficit may require limiting spending on ongoing programs to set aside funds for an emergency reserve. Congress would need to make tradeoffs between ongoing programs and emergency situations without knowing specific needs. Critics argue that this process may lead to unnecessary spending, while proponents suggest incorporating expected emergency spending into the budget based on historical averages. The current process for emergency reserve fund proposals requires specific criteria for what constitutes an emergency, such as situations involving loss of life, property, or national security. Critics argue that enacting specific criteria into law could hinder Congress and the President's ability to respond to emergencies. Critics argue that implementing specific criteria for emergency reserve funds could impede quick responses to emergency situations by giving a few decision-makers control, potentially causing delays. They believe that meeting all criteria may overlook unique circumstances where urgency outweighs criteria failure. Proponents suggest eliminating the emergency designation process. Proponents of an emergency reserve fund mechanism propose eliminating the emergency designation process associated with the Budget Enforcement Act. They argue that new discretionary spending limits should account for historical average emergency spending, making adjustments for emergency-designated spending unnecessary. Critics, however, believe that allowing adjustments for unanticipated spending is a necessary safety valve within spending constraints. The Task Force on Budget Process of the House Budget Committee held a hearing on the budgetary treatment of emergencies, leading to the introduction of a budget process reform bill with an emergency reserve fund during the 105th Congress. The Comprehensive Budget Process Reform Act of 1998 (H.R. 4837) was reintroduced in the 106th Congress as H.R. 853, requiring the budget resolution to include an emergency reserve fund. Hearings were held in May 1999, and the bill was reported by the House Budget Committee and House Rules Committee in June 1999. However, the legislation was defeated on the House floor in May 2000. The House and Senate have rules to discourage the use of emergency designations in budget bills. The House added a rule in 1995 to prevent non-emergency spending with emergency designations. The Senate created a point of order in 1999 against emergency designations, except for defense appropriations, requiring a three-fifths vote to waive it. This point of order became permanent in the FY2001 budget resolution. Delays in appropriations have been a chronic issue in the budget process. Delays in appropriations have been a chronic issue in the budget process, leading to stop-gap funding through continuing resolutions. One proposed reform is the automatic continuation of appropriations at the start of a fiscal year to prevent agency shutdowns. This serves as an alternative to biennial budgeting for dealing with delays in budget legislation. Continuing resolutions provide temporary funding for federal agencies and programs, with no set duration requirement. They have been used since 1876 and are a regular part of the annual budget cycle. Only three years since FY1977 have not had continuing resolutions enacted. Funding can range from a single day to the end of the fiscal year. Continuing resolutions are temporary funding measures for federal agencies and programs, with no set duration requirement. They can vary in length and are often framed in terms of spending rates rather than specific amounts of money. Continuing resolutions typically provide funds based on a formula-driven rate, with exceptions for specific agencies or programs. They only fund existing initiatives to prevent agency shutdowns due to funding gaps. In the event of a funding gap, federal agencies must shut down non-emergency functions. The Budget Enforcement Act excludes ongoing government functions that do not immediately threaten life or property. Automatic continuing resolutions are seen as direct spending, impacting budgetary control. The cost estimate for H.R. 853 and S. 558 prepared by CBO could impact the PAYGO process. Bills for automatic continuing resolutions may face points of order enforcing PAYGO. Enactment of direct spending measures without offsets could trigger a sequester. Different funding levels are being considered for automatic continuing resolutions. Some observers suggest automatic continuation of current appropriations to avoid government shutdowns, allowing for orderly budget process. Proponents highlight costs of shutdowns, including pay for federal workers without work performed. Opponents argue that an automatic continuing resolution could hinder lawmakers from reaching budget agreements by removing the incentive provided by the threat of a government shutdown. They also believe that it could give an advantage to those opposed to new legislation by guaranteeing a level of funding without new negotiations. An automatic continuing resolution could hinder budget negotiations by providing a guaranteed funding level, removing the incentive for reaching agreements. This could undermine Congress's ability to deliberate on appropriations. The idea has been discussed for years but formally considered by Congress only a few times. In the 105th Congress, a proposal for an automatic continuation of appropriations was considered in both the House and Senate as part of a supplemental appropriations measure for FY1997. The proposal aimed to continue funding in FY1998 at 100% of the FY1997 level, with an amendment to strike the provision being tabled in the Senate by a vote of 55-45. The FY1997 supplemental appropriation bill (H.R. 1469) was vetoed by President Clinton on June 7, 1997 due to funding disagreements with Congress. A subsequent appropriations measure was passed without the automatic continuing resolution provision. In the 106th Congress, budget process reforms were considered, leading to the introduction of The Budget Enforcement Act of 1999 by Senator Pete V. Domenici. The Governmental Affairs Committee and the Committee on the Budget held a joint hearing on budget process reform in 1999. S. 558, also known as the Government Shutdown Prevention Act, proposed continuing appropriations during FY2000 and FY2001. In the House, H.R. 853, The Comprehensive Budget Process Act of 1999, was introduced for consideration. Subtitle D of Title VI of H.R. 853 proposed a permanent automatic continuing resolution tied to the prior-year funding levels. The bill underwent hearings and was reported adversely by the Appropriations Committee, with a recommendation to drop the automatic continuing resolution provision. The provision was modified to exclude funding for one-time increases in response to emergencies from calculations of the prior-year level. H.R. 853, under H.Res. 499, was considered by the House without an automatic continuing resolution provision. An amendment for the provision was rejected. Congress has concerns about the time-consuming annual budget cycle despite its influence on spending legislation. One proposed reform to reduce the time-consuming annual budget cycle is to change it to a 2-year cycle. Delays in budget legislation can impact various budget measures, such as regular appropriations and revenue bills. Budgetary legislation, particularly final action on regular appropriations measures, has led to extended congressional sessions. In recent years, final action on the last regular appropriations bill has occurred an average of 75 days after the start of the fiscal year. Biennial budgeting is suggested as a way to reduce the need for extended sessions. The idea has received support from past four Presidents, including the Clinton Administration. During the Clinton Administration, the National Performance Review suggested moving budgets and appropriations to a biennial cycle to save time and improve efficiency in government. Biennial budgeting can involve 2-year budget resolutions, appropriations, and authorizations, requiring executive branch planning to be based on a 2-year cycle. Proposed legislation like H.R. 981 includes these aspects of congressional budgeting. Advocates of biennial budgeting propose reducing the number of times Congress considers budget questions to save time and increase efficiency. Options include 2-year budget resolutions, multiyear authorizations, and biennial appropriations for the entire 2-year fiscal period. This approach aims to streamline the budgeting process and allocate funds more flexibly over the biennium. Supporters of a 2-year budget cycle believe it would provide more time for oversight, budget planning, and long-range planning, as well as greater flexibility with deadlines. They argue that this approach would lead to more efficient coordination of budget decisions and timely enactment of necessary legislation. Critics of biennial budgeting argue that reducing the frequency of budget considerations may increase conflict and delays. They also suggest that the benefits of a 2-year cycle may only be realized in the second year, leading to challenges in anticipating future conditions and making necessary adjustments. Critics argue that biennial budgeting may lead to increased conflict and delays, with potential challenges in anticipating future conditions and making necessary adjustments. Congressional interest in budget process reform, including biennial budgeting, has been ongoing since the 95th Congress in 1977-1978. Hearings and surveys have demonstrated this interest. During the 106th and 107th Congresses, there were hearings and proposals for biennial budgeting reform in the House, including the consideration of H.R. 853 and H.R. 981. The Efficiency Act, introduced by Representative Charles F. Bass, was referred to the Committee on the Budget and other committees. The bill proposed creating a Commission on Federal Budget Concepts instead of a 2-year budget cycle. It was reported with amendments on September 5, 2001. The Committee on Rules reported H.R. 981, which included 2-year budget resolutions, appropriations, and authorizations. The Senate shares jurisdiction over the budget process with the Committees on Governmental Affairs and the Budget. Previous proposals for a 2-year budget cycle were made in 1988, 1990, and 1997, all including comprehensive biennial budgeting approaches. In 1993, proposals for a 2-year budget cycle were also included by the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress. The Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress recommended a 2-year budget cycle in their reports to the Senate and House. Senate bill S. 1824 introduced in 1994 included 2-year budget resolutions and multiyear authorizations but not 2-year appropriations. Senator Pete V. Domenici introduced bills in 1999 for biennial budgeting provisions. The Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Committee on the Budget held a joint hearing on budget process reform, including biennial budgeting, in January 1999. Senate bill S. 92 was considered by the Committee on Governmental Affairs in March 1999 but did not progress further in the 106th Congress."
