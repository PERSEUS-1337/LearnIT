    "content": "Congress is questioning existing policies regarding the use of domestic advanced biofuels, including algae-based biofuels. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) mandates increasing volumes of renewable biofuels in transportation fuel, with cellulosic biofuels being the fastest-growing category. Algae is not included in the RFS2 as a feedstock. EPA data shows small production of cellulosic biofuels since 2013, leading to a decrease in the mandate for the fourth consecutive year. The EPA has been lowering the cellulosic biofuel mandate for several years due to low production. Concerns exist about the future of the U.S. cellulosic biofuels industry without federal support. Legislation supporting multiple biomass feedstocks for transportation needs has been introduced in Congress. Algae-based biofuels have not been addressed in the current Congress. Algae-based biofuels, if successfully commercialized, could offer advantages such as higher biomass yields per acre and the potential use of undesirable water sources and carbon dioxide from stationary sources. However, there are concerns about the cost and feasibility of producing other biofuels from algae. Algae-based biofuels face drawbacks such as high production costs, resource availability issues, technological immaturity, and sensitivity to environmental changes. Despite substantial research and development efforts since the 1950s, algae biofuels have not gained traction in the transportation fuel market due to economic challenges. However, advancements in technology, rising oil prices, and potential fuel mandate failures could increase the relevance of algae biofuels in the U.S. transportation sector. This report discusses the status of algae-based biofuels (ABB) research and development, federal funding, and legislative concerns. ABB faces challenges in meeting annual RFS2 mandates and has limited eligibility compared to other biomass feedstocks. Congressional and public interest are focused on algae use for transportation fuel. The RFS2 regulations define two biofuel categories: unspecified biofuel and advanced biofuels, which include subcategories like cellulosic biofuels, biomass-based diesel, and others. The cellulosic biofuels subcategory is the largest component of the RFS2, with a carve-out increasing from 0.5 billion gallons in 2012 to 16 billion gallons in 2022. The biomass-based diesel carve-out had a 2013 mandate of 1.28 billion gallons. EPA proposes mandates for 2014 and 2015. The EPA proposed a 2014 and 2015 mandate of 1.28 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel. The volume for 2016 to 2022 will be determined by the EPA, but must be no less than 1 billion gallons. Algae can be converted to a diesel/jet fuel substitute, but currently cannot compete cost-effectively with soy biodiesel. Production of algae biodiesel could cost $9.84 to $20.53 per gallon, compared to $2.60 per gallon for petroleum diesel. In 2011, the U.S. Navy and USDA purchased 450,000 gallons of advanced biofuel made from non-food waste and algae. 450,000 gallons of advanced drop-in biofuel, made from non-food waste and algae, can be mixed with aviation or marine fuel. The EPA struggles with meeting cellulosic biofuel mandates due to limited production facilities. Congress may consider including algae as a feedstock to boost biofuel production. Some doubt the cost competitiveness of algae-based biofuels. Technology exists to convert algae into various forms of energy, including liquid fuels, electric power, and biogas. However, there is currently no cost-effective technology to convert algae into transportation biofuel at a commercial scale. Microalgae, macroalgae, and cyanobacteria are being considered for biofuel production, each with their unique characteristics. Algae can be converted into energy through photosynthesis, requiring light, nutrients, water, land, and CO2 or sugar. Algae components like lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins can be used for energy production. Cultivation, harvest, processing, and biofuel conversion are the main processes involved. Algae cultivation can be photoautotrophic or heterotrophic, with advantages and challenges for each method. Open pond cultivation is simpler and less expensive compared to closed systems like photobioreactors. Algae can be cultivated in open ponds or closed systems, each with advantages and challenges. Closed systems offer better control over cultivation conditions but are more expensive and less scalable. Heterotrophic cultivation in fermentation tanks can use inexpensive sugars for algae growth. Various methods like flocculation, filtration, and centrifugation are used for algae harvest. Algae can be harvested multiple times throughout the year. Processing algae involves dewatering or drying to separate its components. The algae is processed for biofuel conversion by extracting components like lipids and oils. The challenge lies in achieving economical production at a commercial scale. Algae cultivation requires significant amounts of CO2, raising questions about its sourcing for processing facilities. The siting and permitting of algae processing facilities near existing CO2 sources may involve local, state, and federal government agencies. Uncertainty exists regarding the treatment of CO2 use from power plants under the Clean Air Act. Concerns about supply and demand for algae-based biofuels persist, with debates over the allocation of resources like land, water, and CO2 for biodiesel production. The National Research Council (NRC) highlights water usage as a major concern for algae-based biofuel (ABB) production. Open-pond algae cultivation requires more water than petroleum-derived fuels, but some algae can use waste or brackish water. Techniques to reduce water usage include locating ABB facilities in areas with low water use per liter of biofuel and using unsuitable water sources. Algae competes for water and nutrients like phosphorus, raising concerns about resource allocation. Large-scale ABB production may involve genetically modified algae, raising concerns about potential environmental impacts. Algae cultivation for biofuel production offers benefits such as high oil yields using less land, with nearly 4 million acres of suitable land identified by the DOE. Algae cultivation minimizes water use and could support approximately 5 billion gallons per year of algal oil production. Algae cultivation for biofuel production offers advantages such as high oil yields using non-freshwater and non-arable land, potential for \"drop-in\" fuel, reuse of CO2 emissions, and control over feedstock supply. Federal funding for algae-based biofuels (ABB) has fluctuated over time, with the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD) being the primary agencies investing in ABB. DOE has allocated funds for ABB through various programs, spending approximately $43.0 million in 2012 and $52.8 million in 2013. The DOE OBP invested about $236 million in algae R&D by December 2010. From FY2009 to FY2011, roughly $183 million was spent on algae R&D, with $146 million from the ARRA and $37 million from program funding. The ARRA funding supported three algae-related IBR projects, including two at pilot scale (Algenol and Solazyme) and one at demo scale. The DOE OBP invested $236 million in algae R&D by December 2010. $49 million from ARRA was spent on the NAABB algae biofuels R&D consortium project. DOE also supported algae R&D through a 20-year Aquatic Species Program at a total cost of roughly $25 million. The ASP focused on producing biodiesel from high lipid-content algae using waste CO2 from coal-fired power plants. DARPA and DLA funded algae-related efforts for Navy ship engine testing and JP-8 jet fuel surrogate production. DARPA provided funding for algal fuel projects by SAIC and General Atomics in 2009. In 2009, a scalable process for cost-effective production of algae oil and JP-8 jet fuel surrogate was developed. The Department of Defense spent $12 million on algae-based biofuels in FY2012. Approximately $11 million was allocated for 13 congressionally directed projects between FY2008 and FY2010. The Department of Energy issued an algal biofuels technology roadmap in 2010 outlining challenges and opportunities for production. In 2011, research and development challenges were being addressed for large-scale algal-based biofuel production. The Algal Biomass Organization reported ongoing projects in 44 U.S. states, with a focus on finding cost-effective methods for harvesting, dewatering, and converting algae to fuel. The main challenge identified was the lack of comprehensive published research on algae species' cost-effectiveness for commercial viability. The challenges in large-scale algal-based biofuel production include determining cost-effective algae species and processing techniques, as well as scaling up cultivation processes. Research has not yet provided optimal solutions for commercial viability. Comprehensive studies on energy balance, emissions, and water demand are necessary for policymakers. Certain production steps are energy-intensive and costly, requiring research into more efficient processes. Research is needed to reduce energy costs in ABB production and develop standards for uniformity and regulatory compliance. Additional research is required for distribution, utilization, and availability of inputs like water and CO2 sources. Location analysis is necessary for siting ABB facilities, considering factors like sunlight, agriculture, and water supply concerns in different regions. Congress has debated the potential of algae-based biofuel to diversify the U.S. transportation fuel portfolio, with policies like RFS2 and tax credits supporting alternative fuel production. However, federally funded research for algae is lower compared to other biofuels, limiting the ability to predict future developments. Private companies invest in ABB but rarely disclose scientific breakthroughs, hindering policymakers and analysts in assessing the industry's progress. Consideration of CO2 sources and location analysis are crucial for siting ABB facilities. Congress has debated the potential of algae-based biofuel to diversify the U.S. transportation fuel portfolio, with policies like RFS2 and tax credits supporting alternative fuel production. Legislation and tax provisions for alternative transportation fuel are limited to specific feedstock and fuel types, but Congress may reevaluate to expand qualifying types. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 amended tax credits for cellulosic biofuels to include algae-based biofuels, which expired in 2013. Some in Congress are interested in algae-based biofuels due to their potential for lower greenhouse gas emissions. Algae-based biofuel (ABB) could help reduce U.S. dependence on petroleum and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Stakeholders suggest long-term policy support, further research, and development. Proposed policies include modifying RFS2, creating a federal low-carbon fuel standard, or implementing a carbon tax. Advocates recommend tax parity, additional federal funds, and feedstock-neutral RFS2 to boost the U.S. algae industry. Tax incentives could accelerate ABB research and development. Tax incentives could accelerate ABB research, development, and testing, potentially shortening the timeline for commercial production. However, concerns exist about issuing tax breaks to an industry with limited commercial facilities. Opponents argue against Congress selecting biomass feedstock types for biofuels before commercial success is proven, suggesting that tax breaks for renewable energy may phase out under fiscal discipline. The federal budget situation may lead Congress to expand the cellulosic biofuel definition for the RFS to include algae, giving the ABB industry a long-term goal and guaranteed market. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to incorporate these ideas, potentially providing federal funding or support for ABB production after pilot projects yield data on feasibility. Algae-based biofuel, potentially included in the Clean Air Act and tax code, offers benefits like high yields and growth in non-traditional water sources. Concerns include production costs, energy requirements, and emissions. The costs and energy requirements of large-scale algae-based biofuel (ABB) production, along with concerns about CO2 usage, genetically engineered algae, and federal support for ABB research. Currently, there are no commercial-scale ABB plants, but pilot facilities have shown potential. Multiple commercial-scale facilities will require time to develop infrastructure and address regulatory issues. Regulatory issues and public perception are concerns for ABB, which is less developed than established biofuels industries like corn-starch ethanol. Lessons from previous industries show that technology development and long-term contracts for feedstock supply are crucial for economic viability. Policy support uncertainties, such as inclusion in the RFS2 and mandates, also impact biofuel production. Uncertainties surrounding policy support and competition from other fuels could impact ABB production and its bottom line."
