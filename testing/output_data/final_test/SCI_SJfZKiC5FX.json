    "content": "In this paper, a new control framework called moving endpoint control is proposed for image restoration. The framework, known as dynamically unfolding recurrent restorer (DURR), utilizes an RNN to model restoration dynamics and a policy network to determine the moving endpoint. DURR achieves state-of-the-art performance in blind image denoising and JPEG image deblocking, even generalizing well to higher degradation levels not seen during training. Image restoration, encompassing denoising, deblurring, and inpainting, is crucial for obtaining high-quality reconstructions of corrupted images. Image restoration has been a key research area, with various models and algorithms developed over the years. Before the rise of deep learning methods, two main approaches were widely used: transformation-based (including wavelet methods, dictionary learning, etc.) and PDE-based (variational models, nonlinear diffusions, etc.). Recently, connections between wavelet methods and PDE approaches have been established. One of the main challenges in image restoration is dealing with corrupted images and subtle objects within them. Recent advancements in image restoration have seen the development of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for tasks like image denoising. These models offer better expressive power compared to traditional methods like MRF models. Inspired by nonlinear diffusions, deep neural networks have been designed for image denoising, with improvements in capacity through deeper networks with residual connections. The use of CNNs allows for simulating a wide range of image processing operators, leading to significant progress in the field. Recent advancements in image restoration have led to the development of deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tasks such as image denoising. These models offer better expressive power compared to traditional methods and have been designed with deeper networks and residual connections for improved capacity. However, challenges remain in creating a light-weight yet effective model for blind image denoising, as deep learning models trained on simulated noise often struggle with real-world noise. Deep learning models trained on simulated noise struggle with real-world noise, as seen in JPEG image deblocking. While deep learning methods have been proposed for JPEG deblocking, they are limited by being trained on specific quality factors. A new single image restoration model is proposed in this paper to robustly restore images with varied degradation levels, even beyond those in the training set. The proposed image restoration model is inspired by the relation between deep learning and optimal control. It considers the residual block as an approximation to continuous dynamics. The training process of deep models can be understood as solving a control problem, where the input, regression target, deep neural network, regularization term, and loss function are key components. In the context of image restoration, the control dynamic can be a diffusion process. The proposed image restoration model incorporates a deep diffusion-like network and a separate network to determine the optimal terminal time for each input image, addressing the issue of varied noise levels in images. This approach differs from previous works that fixed the terminal time as a hyper-parameter, showing that the optimal terminal time varies for different images and noise levels. The proposed architecture, called the dynamically unfolding recurrent restorer (DURR), aims to learn a time-independent dynamic system to restore degraded images. The optimal terminal time for each input image is determined to avoid over-fitting and address varied degradation levels. This learning process is framed as a moving endpoint control problem. The dynamic system is modeled by a recurrent neural network with a residual connection, referred to as the restoration unit. A policy network is used to determine an optimal stopping time for learning the terminal time of the dynamics. This moving endpoint control problem is a penalized version of the fixed endpoint control problem in optimal control. The proposed model, DURR, utilizes convolutional RNN for image restoration with unknown degradation levels. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and better efficiency. The relationship between generalization power and unfolding time of the RNN is explored through experiments. DURR shows strong generalization to varied degradation levels and can handle real image denoising effectively, producing visually superior results. The proposed architecture, DURR, consists of an RNN for image restoration and a policy network to determine the RNN's terminal time. Training involves optimizing the restoration unit based on a given policy, which greatly influences performance and generalization. A good policy leads to better training of the restoration unit. The proposed architecture, DURR, includes an RNN for image restoration and a policy network to determine the RNN's terminal time. Training involves optimizing the restoration unit based on a policy, which greatly influences performance. The \"refined policy\" assigns unfolding times for each degradation level during training, leading to better performance compared to the \"naive policy\". The peak PSNRs of restoration units trained with different policies are compared, showing that the refined policy outperforms the naive policy on all noise levels. The restoration unit trained with a refined policy outperforms the one trained with a naive policy on all noise levels. Generalization ability is reflected in the loop times of the restoration unit, with steeper slopes indicating better performance. The DURR architecture uses a refined policy for image denoising and JPEG image deblocking, setting specific noise levels and loop times. Two approaches for policy units are discussed: Handcraft policy. The handcraft policy proposed in previous work selects a terminal time to optimize signal and noise correlation in filtered images. However, this criterion may not hold for tasks like real image denoising and JPEG image deblocking. Another potential stopping criterion is no-reference image quality assessment, but its performance is not satisfactory. Due to limitations, handcraft policies are not included in experiments. In experiments, handcrafted policies are excluded. A reinforcement learning-based policy is used for the moving endpoint control problem, where a policy network determines the terminal time to stop the iteration for image restoration. The policy unit's reward function is crucial for achieving ideal image restoration results. The policy unit's reward function is defined to achieve ideal image restoration results. Two networks are optimized simultaneously: the restoration unit approximates controlled dynamics, and the policy unit determines terminating conditions. Reinforcement learning techniques, such as Deep Q-learning, are used to train a neural network as the policy unit. Different learning strategies, like Policy Gradient, can also be employed. The restoration unit uses a U-Net style convolutional neural network for image restoration, trained on gaussian noise levels of 25, 35, 45, and 55. Images are processed in 64x64 patches with a batch size of 24. The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 is used, and the learning rate is reduced by a factor of 10 on plateaux. The policy unit consists of two ResUnit and an LSTM cell for determining terminating conditions in image restoration. The policy unit, composed of two ResUnit and an LSTM cell, is trained using a reward function with an RMSprop optimizer. Various network structures were tested, and detailed structures are provided in supplementary materials. JPEG deblocking experiments follow BID40 settings, evaluated using mean PSNR on the LIVE1 dataset BID36. Training and evaluation are done on the Y channel of the YCbCr color space using PIL module in Python for generating JPEG-compressed images. Quality factors 20 and 30 are used for training. The de-blocking performances are evaluated on quality factors QF = 10, 20, 30, and 40. DURR model outperforms DnCNN on most noise levels despite having fewer parameters. It maintains performance even with noise levels beyond those used in training. Noise levels \u03c3 = 65, 75 were not included in the training. The noise levels \u03c3 = 65, 75 were not included in the training set. DnCNN shows significant drops in PSNR with these noise levels, while DURR only shows small drops. UNLNet 5 results are not provided due to code unavailability. Different models' restored images on the BSD68 dataset are compared qualitatively in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The comparison of different models on the BSD68 dataset in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 shows that DURR preserves more details than other models. Despite unseen noise levels during training, DURR achieves nearly 1 dB gain over DnCNN and excels in restoring texture. The strong generalization ability of DURR is evident in real image denoising without additional training. Results from testing on images from BID23 are presented in Fig. 7, with more in the supplementary materials. Additionally, the model is trained for blind color image denoising. The DURR model outperforms DnCNN-3 in most cases, with significant gains on seen QFs and comparable performances on unseen QFs. Results on the LIVE1 dataset show that DURR generates clean and accurate details. Additional experiment details can be found in the supplementary materials. In this paper, a novel image restoration model based on moving endpoint control was proposed to handle varied noise levels using a single model. The model achieved state-of-the-art results in blind image denoising and JPEG deblocking. The restoration unit used an RNN for dynamics, while a policy unit determined loop times for optimal results. The model showed strong abilities in various image restoration applications. The flexibility of the policy allowed DURR to generalize well in experiments."
