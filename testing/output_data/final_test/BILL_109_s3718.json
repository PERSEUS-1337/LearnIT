    "content": "The \"Pool and Spa Safety Act\" includes provisions such as a federal swimming pool and spa drain cover standard, a state swimming pool safety grant program, minimum state law requirements, an education program, definitions, and a CPSC report. The Act may be cited as the \"Pool and Spa Safety Act\". The Congress finds that drowning is a significant cause of injury-related deaths in children, with many incidents occurring in pools and spas. Research shows that proper barriers and supervision can help prevent these tragedies. Federal Swimming Pool and Spa Drain Cover Standard: This section establishes a consumer product safety rule requiring all swimming pool and spa drain covers in the US to meet entrapment protection standards. State Swimming Pool Safety Grant Program: This section creates a grant program to improve swimming pool safety measures. The Commission will establish a grant program to assist eligible States in enforcing laws that apply to all swimming pools and meet minimum State law requirements. States must demonstrate compliance with the law and submit an application to the Commission to be eligible for the grant. The Commission will determine grant amounts based on state population and enforcement needs, prioritizing states that have not received a grant in the previous fiscal year. States must use at least 50% of the grant to hire and train enforcement personnel for swimming pool safety laws. The Commission is authorized to appropriate $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to educate pool construction companies, pool owners, and the public about swimming pool safety laws and to cover administrative costs for training programs. SEC. 5. MINIMUM STATE LAW REQUIREMENTS. State law requirements for safety standards for residential pools and spas include enclosure by barriers, prevention of entrapment by drains, and the installation of multiple drains for pools and spas built after a certain date. State law requires pools and spas to have multiple drains, including unblockable drains, or no main drain. Pools with main drains must have a cover meeting safety standards. States must also meet additional requirements set by the Commission. The Commission establishes minimum State law requirements for pool and spa safety to determine eligibility for grants under section 4 of this Act, based on national performance standards and guidelines. The Commission establishes minimum State law requirements for pool and spa safety based on national standards and guidelines, including safety pool covers. The requirements for pool and spa safety include safety pool covers, gates with self-closing devices, doors with audible alarms, and pool alarms for rapid detection of water entry. Minimum State law requirements also include entrapment, entanglement, and evisceration prevention standards. The safety requirements for pools and spas include safety vacuum release systems, suction-limiting vent systems, gravity drainage systems, and automatic pump shut-off systems. These systems are essential for preventing accidents and ensuring pool safety. The safety requirements for pools and spas include various systems such as safety vacuum release systems, suction-limiting vent systems, gravity drainage systems, and automatic pump shut-off systems. Additionally, there are standards that these systems must meet to ensure pool safety. The Commission will establish an education program to prevent drowning and entrapment in pools and spas. This program includes developing educational materials for pool industry professionals and owners, as well as a national media campaign for pool and spa safety awareness. $5,000,000 is authorized for this program annually from 2008 to 2012. In this Act, terms like ASME/ANSI standard, ASTM standard, barrier, Commission, and main drain are defined. These definitions are crucial for understanding safety standards and regulations related to swimming pools and hot tubs. A suction outlet in a pool or spa conducts water to a pump. A safety vacuum release system provides vacuum release in case of blockage. An unblockable drain is one that a human body cannot block. Swimming pools and spas include various structures for swimming and bathing. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is required to submit a report to Congress evaluating the effectiveness of the swimming pool safety grant program within one year after grants are issued. This is part of an act aimed at increasing pool and spa safety by mandating proper anti-entrapment drain covers and drainage systems, as well as establishing a grant program to improve state laws and educate the public on pool safety."
