    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Traveling Exotic Animal and Public Safety Protection Act\". The Congress finds that traveling performances with exotic and wild animals compromise animal welfare, pose health and safety risks, and have complex regulatory oversight that is costly for taxpayers. The mobility of traveling performances hinders proper monitoring and evaluation of animal conditions and facilities. Traveling exotic and wild animal performances pose safety risks due to collapsible, temporary facilities and allowing public contact. Animals suffer from being unable to fulfill natural behaviors in unpredictable environments. Exotic and wild animals in traveling performances suffer from severe confinement, chronic stress, and physical coercion to perform unnatural tricks. It is unnecessary to use these animals in circus events, adding nothing to the experience. Exotic and wild animals in traveling performances face confinement, stress, and coercion to perform. This undermines conservation efforts, restricts natural behaviors, and poses safety risks. Regulation is necessary to ensure humane treatment. Regulating the use of exotic and wild animals in traveling performances is crucial for ensuring humane treatment and safety for animals, workers, and the public. Regulating the use of exotic and wild animals in traveling performances is crucial for ensuring humane treatment and safety for animals, workers, and the public. SEC. 3.

The term \"domestic animal\" refers to any animal kept as a companion or pet in or near the household of the owner, such as a domestic dog, cat, ferret, horse, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, or hamster, excluding exotic or wild animals. An \"environmental education program\" is an animal exhibition designed for educational or conservation purposes about the animal's natural behavior, habitat, life cycle, conducted by a qualified individual without unnatural behavior performances. An exotic animal is defined as any animal that is not a domestic or farm animal, native to a foreign country, not native to the United States, or introduced from abroad. This includes certain species like cetartiodactyla, felidae (excluding domestic cats), marsupialia, nonhuman primates, perissodactyla (excluding horses, donkeys, and mules), and pinnipedia. The term 'farm animal' refers to domestic species like alpacas, cattle, sheep, swine, goats, llamas, poultry, or horses used for food, fiber, breeding, or production efficiency. It also includes animals like rabbits, mink, and chinchilla used for meat or fur, and horses and llamas used solely for specific purposes.

It also encompasses horses and llamas used for specific purposes, excluding exotic or wild animals. Additionally, a 'mobile or traveling housing facility' refers to vehicles used to transport or house animals during travel for performance purposes, while 'performance' and 'traveling animal act' involve animals performing tricks or providing entertainment for an audience. The term 'wild animal' refers to any non-domestic animal found in the wild within the United States, including hybrids with domestic animals. This includes various animal groups like cetartiodactyla, felidae (excluding domestic cats), and marsupials. The term 'wildlife sanctuary' refers to an organization that does not engage in commercial trade or breeding of exotic or wild animals, and does not permit unescorted public visitation. It includes specific animal groups like marsupialia, perissodactyla (excluding horses, donkeys, and mules), pinnipedia, ratites (excluding ostriches, emus, and rheas), and ursidae. The regulations prohibit unescorted public visitation, direct contact with exotic or wild animals, and removal of animals for exhibition or performance. Non-compliance may result in enforcement and penalties under specified sections. SEC. 4. RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER LAW.

The provisions of this Act are in addition to other laws protecting animal welfare and do not limit stricter federal, state, or local laws. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
