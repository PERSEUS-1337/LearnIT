    "content": "The private health insurance market consists of three segments: large-group, small-group, and individual markets. Large- and small-group plans are offered through employers, while individual plans are for individuals and families. States regulate health insurance through unique rules under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The federal government and states regulate health insurance, covering aspects like licensing, business practices, market conduct, insurance products, and consumer protections. Federal standards apply to health coverage, especially in employer-provided benefits. The ACA follows a federalism model, with states responsible for monitoring compliance. The ACA establishes federal requirements for private health insurance, affecting both group and individual plans. States can add additional requirements as long as they don't conflict with federal law. Market reforms under the ACA are currently in effect, with variations in scope and specificity across states. The ACA market reforms are currently effective, with variations in application based on plan type and grandfathered status. Certain plans, like retiree-only health plans, are not required to comply with federal health insurance requirements. Specific details on which reforms apply to different types of plans can be found in the Appendix. The ACA market reforms include guaranteed issue requirements for health insurance plans, ensuring that plans accept all applicants as long as they agree to the terms. Group plans can be purchased at any time, while individual plans have specific enrollment periods. Plans may deny coverage in certain circumstances. Plans can deny coverage based on network or financial capacity, but not on health status. Premium discounts can be offered for wellness program participation. Dependent coverage must be available for children under a certain age. The plan must offer dependent coverage to unmarried and married adult children under 26, but not their children or spouse. Employers cannot base eligibility on salary and must not discriminate in favor of higher-wage employees. Waiting periods cannot exceed 90 days. Compliance is not required until regulations are issued. The waiting period for health insurance coverage cannot exceed 90 days. Guaranteed renewability allows for the renewal of individual or group coverage at the option of the policyholder or plan sponsor, with exceptions for non-payment of premiums or fraud. Rescission is the retroactive cancellation of medical coverage. Rescission is the retroactive cancellation of medical coverage, permitted in cases of fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Plans must provide 30 days notice for cancellation. Adjusted community rating rules determine premiums based on key characteristics like age, not health factors. Premium variation is restricted to four factors. States can vary premiums based on individual or family enrollment, with uniform family tiers in some cases. Geographic rating areas can be established based on counties, zip codes, or metropolitan areas. If not established, default is one area per metropolitan area. The rating areas can be based on metropolitan areas or non-MSAs. Plans can charge tobacco users up to 1.5 times the premium. Premiums for adults aged 21 and older can vary by a 3-to-1 ratio. States must use a uniform age rating curve for adults and set a separate rate for individuals aged 20 and younger. HHS provides an age curve as a default, but states can implement their own standards. The rate review program aims to monitor proposed health insurance rate increases in the small-group and individual markets. The rate review process evaluates health insurance rate increases in small-group and individual markets to determine if they are unreasonable. States can set their own thresholds, with a 10% threshold in place for states that do not. Plans must justify proposed rate increases to CMS and states before implementation, with information publicly disclosed. The process does not give federal authority to deny rate increases but aims to expose unreasonable ones. Health insurance issuers must consider all enrollees in plans as members of a single risk pool. The ACA requires health insurance issuers to consider all enrollees in individual and small-group plans as members of a single risk pool. Plans must cover essential health benefits, with the HHS Secretary defining the specific benefits. The HHS Secretary defines essential health benefits (EHB) that must be included in plans. States choose benchmark plans, supplementing them if necessary to cover all 10 required categories. Plans must model benefits after the state's benchmark. States can maintain state-mandated benefits, but any additional benefits beyond EHB require state assumption of costs. States must defray the cost of any mandated benefits enacted after December 31, 2011. Plans are required to cover preventive health services without cost sharing, including evidence-based items, immunizations, preventive care for infants, children, and adolescents, and additional screenings for women. The ACA requires plans to cover preventive health services without cost sharing, including screenings for women. The ACA negated the USPSTF recommendation for mammograms at age 50, requiring coverage to start at age 40 based on the 2002 recommendation. Congress clarified this provision until January 1, 2018. The ACA requires coverage of preventive services without cost sharing, including mammography screenings for women starting at age 40 based on the 2002 recommendation. Plans cannot exclude coverage for preexisting health conditions. Health condition is a preexisting medical condition that must be covered by health plans without cost sharing. Plans must comply with annual limits on out-of-pocket spending for Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The limits for 2016 are $6,850 for self-only coverage and $13,700 for coverage other than self only. Cost sharing must be tailored to one of four levels of actuarial value, which measures a plan's generosity in covering medical expenses. The actuarial value (AV) of a health plan reflects the percentage of total medical expenses paid by the issuer for a standard population. AV is categorized into Bronze (60% AV), Silver (70% AV), Gold (80% AV), and Platinum (90% AV) levels. Under the ACA, lifetime and annual limits on covered benefits are prohibited, specifically for Essential Health Benefits (EHB). Plans can place limits on benefits that are not Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The HHS Secretary must establish an Internet portal for accessing coverage options, including private health plans, Medicaid, CHIP, high-risk pools, and small-group plans. The portal, www.healthcare.gov, launched in 2010. Plans must provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) to individuals at various stages. The SBC must meet requirements specified in statute and developed by Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury. It can be in paper or electronic form. Enrollees must be notified of any benefit changes 60 days in advance. Plans must provide a glossary of terms and report MLR to HHS Secretary. Minimum MLR for individual and small-group plans is 80%, and for large groups is 85%. States have some flexibility in implementation. The ACA requires health plans to maintain a minimum MLR of 80% for individual and small-group plans, and 85% for large groups. States can adjust these percentages, and the HHS Secretary can make further adjustments if necessary. Plans falling below the limit must provide rebates to policyholders by August of that year. Additionally, plans must have an effective appeals process for coverage determinations and claims, including internal and external appeals processes, notice to enrollees, and the ability for enrollees to review their files and present evidence. Health plans must comply with internal and external claims and appeals procedures, as well as state external review processes to ensure consumer protections. Plans failing to meet minimum requirements must implement processes set by the HHS Secretary. Health plans must comply with standards set by the HHS Secretary for processes and provider choice. Plans must allow enrollees to designate any available primary care provider and pediatric care provider. Obstetrical or gynecological care coverage cannot require authorization. Emergency services must be covered without prior approval. Health plans must cover emergency services in hospital emergency departments without prior authorization or coverage limitations. Cost-sharing for out-of-network emergency services must be the same as in-network providers. Plans cannot discriminate against individuals participating in approved clinical trials or health care providers acting within their scope of license. The ACA requires health plans to cover emergency services without prior authorization or coverage limitations. Plans cannot discriminate against providers within their scope of license. The HHS Secretary must develop quality reporting requirements for plans within two years of enactment, in consultation with experts. Regulations for acceptable provider reimbursement structures must be published within two years of ACA enactment. The ACA requires health plans to cover emergency services without limitations. The U.S. Government Accountability Office must conduct a study on the impact of these activities on healthcare quality and cost. Plans must submit annual reports on improving health outcomes, preventing readmissions, and promoting wellness. The Secretary will make these reports public and can impose penalties for noncompliance. Wellness and health promotion activities, including personalized services for smoking cessation, weight management, stress management, physical fitness, nutrition, heart disease prevention, healthy lifestyle support, and diabetes prevention, may be provided by entities like healthcare providers conducting health risk assessments or interventions for program participants."
