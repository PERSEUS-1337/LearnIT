    "content": "This report provides an overview of U.S. arms sales to the Middle East since the end of the Cold War, including data on current arms sales by country and analysis of how arms sales shape U.S. policy in the region. The data is based on various resources, such as CRS Report R44716 and the State Department's World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers reports. Arms sales are widely recognized as an important factor in international relations. Arms sales are crucial for state power, serving various purposes like enhancing security, influencing adversaries, and supporting domestic arms industries. U.S. arms exports play a significant role in the economy, constituting 6.2% of all U.S. exports from 2007 to 2014. Deployment of manpower and resources is less emphasized in current U.S. public opinion and policy debates. Arms sales in the Middle East are becoming more important for influencing political-military outcomes, with the U.S. relying on them as a policy tool. However, this also means that responsibility for their use lies with partners who may not always align with U.S. interests or rules of engagement. Congressional oversight of arms sales plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. policy in the region. The Middle East is a highly militarized region with ongoing conflicts involving multiple states. Israeli leaders emphasize the need for a strong military due to perceived threats. Iran is viewed as a threat by the US, Israel, and neighboring countries. Arms sales in the region are driven by transnational terrorist threats and domestic security concerns. The Middle East is a key player in the global arms trade, with many countries facing terrorist threats and domestic insurgencies. Large militaries in the region play a dominant role in politics, leading to the need for new acquisitions. Arms purchases are seen as crucial for building international credibility and national pride in a region where legitimacy is often contested. The Middle East is a significant player in the global arms trade, with the United States being a major supplier. In 2016, 78% of proposed U.S. arms sales were to Middle Eastern nations, totaling over $49 billion. In FY2017, $52 billion worth of proposed sales were to Middle Eastern states, highlighting the region's increasing militarization. In 2016, Middle Eastern nations ranked high in global defense spending, with 6 out of the top 10 defense budgets as a percentage of GDP in the region. The United States has used arms sales to support key security policies in the Middle East, including ensuring Israel's security, countering terrorism, and maintaining access to energy resources. However, these arms sales have faced criticism for fueling a regional arms race and potentially harming U.S. interests. Some argue that U.S. arms sales to the Middle East empower undemocratic regimes, leading to political instability and human rights abuses. Questions have been raised about the long-term financial and political sustainability of this arrangement, as lower oil prices strain some nations' budgets. High levels of arms procurement by U.S. partners may divert funds from infrastructure, education, and services for their populations. Congressional deliberations have often focused on specific arms sales to the region, shaping the debate on U.S. arms sales policies. Specific arms sales to states in the Middle East have influenced the arms sales debate and the relationship between the executive and legislative branches over U.S. foreign policy. The Cold War rivalry between the United States and Soviet Union led to arms sales to reinforce nations within their spheres of influence. The Middle East was a contested region with the U.S. providing weapons to partners like Saudi Arabia and Iran, while the Soviet Union supplied weapons to Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. Policymakers called for a more measured approach, leading to the Arms Control and Disarmament Act in 1961. The Arms Control and Disarmament Act of 1961 established the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) to coordinate research on international arms sales and manage U.S. participation in arms control negotiations. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 laid the foundation for the current system, requiring the President to notify Congress of arms sales above $25 million for a 20-day review period. The Ford Administration's intent to sell air defense missile batteries to Jordan in 1975 led to Congressional concerns over Israel's security and lack of consultation. The sale was initially withdrawn but went through later with modifications, setting a precedent for Congressional oversight of arms sales. The International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976 refined the process for Congress to review arms sales proposed by the executive branch. The AECA requires formal notification to Congress 30 days before concluding sales over a certain valuation. Resolutions of disapproval can prevent sales, with many related to the Middle East. While no sale has been blocked, congressional scrutiny has influenced arms sales, such as in the case of Saudi Arabia in 1987. In 1987, the Reagan Administration dropped Maverick antitank missiles from a sale to Saudi Arabia to secure approval for other items. Congressional concern about Turkey's war against Kurdish insurgents delayed a sale of Cobra helicopters in 1996. In 1986, Congress almost blocked a sale of Sidewinder, Harpoon, and Stinger missiles to Saudi Arabia, but President Reagan vetoed the legislation. Proposed legislation to block weapon sales to Saudi Arabia did not receive enough votes recently. The United States has been the largest seller of arms to the Middle East for over two decades, competing with Russia as an alternative supplier. Russia's presence in the region may increase leverage with U.S. officials and exporters. Russia's interest in the region is driven by geopolitical considerations and its advantage in the arms trade. European suppliers remain involved, but some are conflicted about profit versus human rights. China is a newcomer testing the market for advanced technologies. The regional arms market is competitive with states vying for advantages in scale and innovation. The United States initially limited arms supply to Israel, relying on France for heavy weaponry. After Israel's victory in the 1967 Six Day War, the U.S. increased support, selling F-4 Phantom fighters in 1968 and quadrupling aid after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. U.S. support was also influenced by domestic Israel advocacy groups. The U.S. has been supporting Israeli military imports, particularly in fighter aircraft and missile defense technology, since the 1970s. This support, funded by U.S. aid, helps maintain Israel's military advantage over its neighbors. Israel is a partner in the development of the F-35 aircraft and was the first country outside the U.S. to receive them. The memorandum of understanding in 2016 further solidified Israeli reliance on U.S. weapons and defense technology. The U.S. has been supporting Israeli military imports, particularly in fighter aircraft and missile defense technology since the 1970s. Israel's active arms industry has been subsidized in part by U.S. support, allowing them to spend a portion of their U.S. Foreign Military Financing on domestic procurement. Israel's major purchases in recent years have been from Western European suppliers, with a 2012 deal with Italy for 30 M-346 jets worth around $1 billion. Israel's defense contractors have become competitive with global leaders, signing agreements worth $12.8 billion in arms exports from 2008 to 2015. Military exports grew by 14% in 2016, with sales to countries like India. Concerns have been raised about possible violations of U.S. assistance conditions, including unauthorized retransfer of weapons. Egypt, a major arms consumer, has signed significant arms agreements totaling over $30 billion from 2008 to 2015, surpassing most developing countries. Despite being formally at peace with its neighbors, Egypt's large military and strategic position have made it a key market for arms sales. Initially a Soviet client, Egypt shifted towards purchasing U.S. arms in the late 1970s and 1980s. The country has been a top recipient of U.S. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to exclusively buy American weapons, but political unrest since 2011 has raised concerns. Egypt's arms acquisitions have shifted away from the United States due to political turmoil and repressive measures by President Abdel Fattah al Sisi. From 2008 to 2011, 76% of arms came from the U.S., but this dropped to 49% from 2012 to 2015. Egypt has diversified its sources to include Western European and Russian suppliers, leading to a mix of American and Eastern European military assets. This diversification reduces dependence on one supplier but increases complexity in maintaining diverse defense systems. Egypt has diversified its arms acquisitions away from the United States, turning to Western European and Russian suppliers. Recent transactions include a $3 billion weapons deal with Russia in 2014 and a $5.2 billion deal with France for 24 Rafale aircraft. This shift reduces dependence on one supplier but increases complexity in managing diverse defense systems. Egypt and France signed a $5.2 billion deal for 24 Rafale fighter jets in 2015, followed by a $1 billion agreement for two Mistral helicopter carriers. In 2016, they agreed on another deal worth over $1 billion for additional ships, fighter jets, and a military satellite communication system. Saudi Arabia has been a major buyer of U.S. arms, with proposed sales totaling over $120 billion from 2009 to present. President Trump announced proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia during his first foreign trip in May. Saudi Arabia's arms sales reflect and strengthen U.S.-Saudi ties, but differences persist over Iran, Israel, governance, terrorism, and regional activities like the war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia aims to diversify its arms sources and expand its defense industry, exemplified by the creation of Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) in 2017. Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) was established to manage production of air and land systems, weapons, and defense electronics. The government aims for 50% of military procurement spending to be domestic by 2030. Plans include the assembly of Blackhawk helicopters in Saudi Arabia as part of a $6 billion agreement with Lockheed Martin. U.S. concerns remain regarding sharing sensitive military technology. Saudi Arabia has engaged in arms procurement discussions with Russia and China, including the purchase of S-400 missile defenses and the construction of a Chinese factory to manufacture military UAVs. Top military officials from Saudi Arabia and Russia met in Moscow in April 2017, followed by a state visit by King Salman to Moscow in October 2017. In March 2017, King Salman and President Xi Jinping signed agreements worth $60 billion during a state visit to Beijing. Saudi Arabia is in discussions with China to build a factory for military UAVs. Turkey, a NATO ally, has been a major recipient of U.S. arms but has diversified its suppliers and increased domestic production. Turkey has diversified its suppliers and increased domestic production, including partnering in the production of the F-35. They aim to build up their domestic defense industry while minimizing arms purchases from the United States and other countries. Recent actions show Turkey's willingness to develop indigenous defense capabilities, such as choosing a Chinese company for a missile defense system contract over other options. Turkey chose a Chinese company for a missile defense system contract over American, European, and Russian competitors, citing lower cost and technology transfer. The tender was canceled in 2015, but Turkey later expressed interest in the Russian S-400 system. A $2.5 billion agreement was reached in 2017, with Turkey making an initial deposit for the system. Reports suggest Turkey will receive two S-400 missile batteries within a year and produce two more domestically. Turkey signed a $2.5 billion agreement with Russia in 2017 for the purchase of S-400 missile batteries. The deal has raised concerns among U.S. officials, with some describing it as a potential violation of a law calling for sanctions on defense transactions with Russia. Turkey also announced a preliminary deal with Eurosam to develop an air missile defense system. Turkey signed a $2.5 billion agreement with Russia in 2017 for the purchase of S-400 missile batteries, raising concerns among U.S. officials. A preliminary deal with Eurosam for an air missile defense system was also announced, with Turkey emphasizing the importance of building domestic industrial capacity. Russia may not be inclined to share technology with Turkey, given past geopolitical rivalry. Political tensions between the U.S. and Turkey could influence future decisions. Turkey aims to boost its indigenous arms production capabilities, with a target of $25 billion in military exports by 2023. Despite challenges, research and development efforts have increased significantly, with 68% of military needs now met locally. The motivation behind this push is debated, with some suggesting domestic political factors play a role. Human rights concerns have lessened, and Turkey's focus on self-sufficiency may impact its response to U.S. objections on non-NATO deals. Turkey is aiming to enhance its defense industry by cooperating with the UK on the TF-X combat aircraft. The UAE has significantly increased its military capabilities through major arms purchases from the US, including F-16s and the THAAD missile defense system. The UAE is diversifying its arms imports and building domestic production capacity due to concerns about US policy. They have shown interest in purchasing F-35s, but concerns about Israeli security have led them to explore options with Russia for advanced combat aircraft, including a fifth-generation fighter jet and Sukhoi Su-35 fighters. The UAE is exploring options with Russia for advanced combat aircraft, including a fifth-generation fighter jet and Sukhoi Su-35 fighters. They have also purchased Chinese surveillance drones and are working on building their domestic arms industry through the Emirates Defense Industries Company (EDIC). The Emirates Defense Industries Company (EDIC) is diversifying the UAE's economy by signing contracts with foreign customers and using UAE equipment in conflicts like the Saudi-led coalition's war in Yemen and operations in Libya. The United States has proposed over $28 billion in foreign military sales to Iraq since 2011, including sales of F-16s and Apache helicopters. Iraq has purchased major weapons systems from the United States, but has also shown interest in diversifying its sources. It has finalized arms purchases from South Korea and the Czech Republic, and has Russian-origin equipment. A $4.2 billion arms deal with Russia was announced in 2012, with an order of Mi-28 Havoc attack helicopters delivered and in use against IS forces. Additionally, there are details of a potential $2.5 billion deal with China. Iraq has purchased weapons from various countries including the United States, South Korea, the Czech Republic, Russia, and potentially China. In 2014, Iraq agreed to buy $200 million worth of weapons from Iran due to delays in U.S. deliveries. This deal raised concerns as it violated a U.N. ban on Iranian weapon sales. Iraqi officials have welcomed Iranian military assistance since 2014. Iran has received support from Iran since 2014, including supplying Shia militias fighting the Islamic State alongside Iraqi forces. The U.S. role in Iraq is shifting towards training and equipping Iraqi forces, with security assistance becoming a prominent issue in the bilateral relationship. The United States provides FMF assistance to Iraq for U.S. equipment purchases, and also sells arms to the forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government. The Iraqi national government has approved the sale of U.S. arms to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), but sales to both entities could face scrutiny if KRG-Baghdad relations deteriorate. Concerns about Iraq's human rights record have been raised by some Members of Congress, especially after the behavior of the Iraqi military during the 2014 offensive by the Islamic State. Qatar, located between Iran and Saudi Arabia, has been working to strengthen its relationship with the United States. Qatar has a strong relationship with the United States, seeking U.S. support as compensation for being seen as a close ally. They have a defense cooperation agreement since 1992, hosting U.S. military assets at Al Udeid Air Base. Despite its small size, Qatar is influential in the region due to its significant resource wealth, making it the largest customer of U.S. foreign military sales in 2014 and concluding $17.5 billion worth of arms deals in 2015. In 2015, Qatar concluded $17.5 billion worth of arms transfer agreements, including contracts with the United States and France for fighter jets and missiles. The United States and Qatar proposed a transaction for F-15QA aircraft worth over $21 billion, with initial deliveries expected in mid-2018 and 2019. The recent arms deals with Qatar, including the purchase of F-15QAs and warships from Italy, are expected to enhance Qatari air and sea capabilities. Qatar's interest in U.S. fighters stems from the need for interoperability, especially after difficulties with French-made aircraft in coalition operations. These arms sales impact U.S. foreign policy objectives and congressional interests, highlighting the importance of maintaining a qualitative military edge. The term \"qualitative military edge\" (QME) refers to Israel's advantage in military technology over its adversaries, codified as U.S. policy in 2008. This policy requires notification to Congress for any proposed U.S. arms sale to countries in the Middle East other than Israel to ensure it does not affect Israel's QME. The term \"qualitative military edge\" (QME) refers to Israel's advantage in military technology over its adversaries. Congress has considered Israeli concerns about arms transfers to some Arab states during reviews of planned sales, including sales of surveillance planes and missiles to Saudi Arabia. Israel's concerns over arms sales to Saudi Arabia delayed a major package in 2007. However, Israel now sees Iran as a top security challenge, aligning with Arab states against shared threats. QME concerns influenced the sale of F-15s to Qatar in 2016, which Israel opposed due to Qatari support for Hamas. Some suggested that \"Israel sought to leverage the Qatar sales\" to boost military assistance negotiations with the United States. The new U.S.-Israel 10-year memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in September 2016. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker mentioned that the Qatar sales would be completed around the same time as the MOU. The State Department notified Congress about the Qatar sale in November 2016. Israeli concerns were raised over a large arms sales package to Saudi Arabia announced during President Trump's May 2017 visit, with advocacy groups and ministers expressing unease about lack of consultation with Israel. U.S. policy in the Middle East aims to constrain Iran's threats to U.S. partners and energy commerce. Arms sales to regional partners, including aircraft and missile defense systems, are crucial for countering Iran. Gulf Cooperation Council states possess BMD capabilities, mainly from the U.S., to address the threat of ballistic missiles. The U.S. has proposed arms sales to Gulf countries to enhance their defense capabilities against ballistic missile threats. Deals include the sale of PAC-3 and THAAD systems to countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia to increase security and interoperability with U.S. forces. These sales aim to counter regional threats, particularly from Iran, and support the Gulf Cooperation Council's efforts in missile defense. The Gulf Cooperation Council faces barriers to a unified missile defense approach due to reluctance to share intelligence and disputes over command location. Smaller Gulf states are hesitant to cede power to Saudi Arabia. Congressional focus on GCC unity is evident, with arms sales to GCC states being withheld until the rift among leading countries is resolved. U.S. strategy includes sales of naval systems to enhance defense capabilities against regional threats. Sales of naval systems to GCC states, including Multi-Mission Surface Combatant Ships (MMSCs) and warships, aim to counter Iran's threats in the Gulf. The Trump Administration's $6 billion arms package to Saudi Arabia included MMSCs, with potential additional purchases. Qatar also signed a $6 billion deal with Italy for warships. Strengthening GCC navies could help pressure Iran and reduce the U.S. burden in the region amidst increased Iranian confrontations. Some argue that outsourcing U.S. deterrence to Gulf partners may increase instability and unintended conflict. Iran blames U.S. arms sales for militarizing the region, leading to a \"missile race.\" Gulf states find U.S. assistance conditions burdensome, while some U.S. officials support faster arms procurements to enhance security. The ongoing war in Yemen, fueled by U.S.-supplied weapons to the Saudi-led coalition, has led to a severe humanitarian crisis with millions at risk of famine and cholera. Lawmakers are concerned about the coalition's bombing campaign, criticized by the U.N. and NGOs. The U.N. implicated the Saudi-led coalition for killing and maiming children, with 510 deaths and 667 injuries attributed to them. In 2016, the Senate voted against blocking sales of defense equipment to Saudi Arabia, but a significant number of senators sought to block the sale, indicating a potential decline in support for arms sales to Saudi Arabia. In 2017, the Senate narrowly rejected a measure that would have blocked sales to Saudi Arabia. In June 2017, the Senate narrowly rejected a measure (S.J.Res. 42) to block sales of air-delivered weapons systems to Saudi Arabia. Proponents argued for minimizing civilian casualties and combating Iranian influence, while opponents raised concerns about Saudi Arabia's reliability as an ally and human rights issues. Members have sought to impose conditions on future arms transfers. Two measures (S.J.Res. 40 and H.J.Res. 104) aim to restrict the transfer of air-to-ground munitions to Saudi Arabia unless the President certifies certain conditions are met. Legal analysis questions the permissibility of arms sales to Saudi Arabia under existing laws due to concerns about civilian harm and use of the weapons. The United States may sell arms with limitations on countries violating human rights or misusing weapons. In response to concerns about Saudi Arabia's use of U.S. weapons in Yemen, the State Department cited Saudi's right to self-defense and efforts to reduce civilian casualties. In the UK, a court ruled in July 2017 that arms exports to Saudi Arabia could continue despite legal challenges. The British government presented secret information to justify arms exports to Saudi Arabia, despite legal challenges. Members of Congress balance human rights concerns with security implications of limiting assistance to partner nations. The increase in restrictions on assistance to partner nations for acquiring U.S. equipment based on human rights and political oppression raises questions about the effectiveness of using FMF and FMS for behavior change. The tension between values and security, particularly in the Middle East, is exemplified in the debate over arms sales in Bahrain, where the U.S. has maintained a naval command since before its independence in 1971. Bahrain, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, has faced scrutiny over human rights violations against its Shiite majority. In 2016, Bahrain sought to purchase F-16s worth $4 billion, but the sale was contingent on improving its human rights record. The Trump Administration later dropped these conditions in 2017. In March 2017, U.N. investigators reported a \"sharp deterioration\" of human rights in Bahrain. General Votel mentioned concerns about human rights abuses in Bahrain affecting FMS cases for F-16 aircraft sales. Critics argue that U.S. weapons sales to Bahrain's Defense Force exacerbate instability. Legislation was introduced in Congress to restrict the transfer of weapons for crowd control purposes. The transfer of weapons for crowd control purposes, including small arms, ammunition, and Humvees, is restricted unless Bahrain implements recommendations from the BICI report. In Egypt, the Obama Administration suspended delivery of certain defense articles after President Sisi's seizure of power, but later allowed deliveries with a different form of military assistance. Congress has also sought to tie arms transfers to Egypt's adherence to democratic principles. The US has tied arms transfers to Egypt to democratic and human rights standards since FY2012. The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act withholds 15% of Egypt's $1.3 billion FMF allocation unless progress on human rights is certified by the Secretary of State. The Trump Administration announced withholding $195 million of Egypt's military aid, citing concerns about human rights and democracy. Turkey has also faced scrutiny for human rights issues, despite not receiving significant US aid since the 1990s. Despite not receiving significant US economic aid since the 1990s, Turkey has faced scrutiny for human rights issues. Members of Congress have attempted to limit arms transfers to Turkey, particularly in response to incidents involving Turkish security personnel. The House passed a provision in the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act calling for continued scrutiny of proposed US sales of handguns to Turkish presidential security personnel. Congress may revisit prohibitions on transferring US weapons to units and personnel involved in human rights violations. Many US arms transfers to Turkey are funded through the Foreign Military Financing account. Many U.S. arms transfers are funded through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) account, managed by the State Department and implemented by the Department of Defense. President Trump's FY2018 budget proposes cuts to FMF for several regional governments, while maintaining funding for Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. Pakistan is the only country not mentioned in the budget request. The FY2018 budget proposes cuts to FMF for several regional governments, with Israel, Egypt, and Jordan receiving the majority of the funding. There are concerns about converting FMF grants to loans, as it could impact the U.S. defense industry and lead countries to seek weapons from other providers like Russia or China. The 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed the Administration to report on the potential impact of transitioning to more FMF loans. The report on the transition to more FMF loans discusses the potential impact on foreign policy and the FY2018 budget proposals. It acknowledges the possibility of FMF recipients turning to other suppliers like China and Russia but highlights the high quality of defense articles and services provided by the United States. The House and Senate committee reports differ on the support for transitioning FMF. The committee bill (S.Rept. 115-152) does not support transitioning FMF assistance from grants to loans, citing concerns about the impact on U.S. national security interests and allies. Congress may consider additional reporting requirements to track arms sales in the Middle East. Congress has a long-standing interest in ensuring responsible use of arms sold to foreign countries. In 1996, Congress amended the AECA to include Section 40A (P.L. 104-164), directing the President to establish a program for end-use monitoring to improve accountability for defense articles sold, leased, or exported. The goals include preserving U.S. technological superiority and ensuring arms are used by intended recipients. Recipient countries agree to permit observation and review by U.S. Government representatives. End-use monitoring is crucial in evaluating arms sales to Iraq. In evaluating arms sales to Iraq, Members of Congress must consider the risk of weapons falling into the wrong hands, including groups supported by Iran. Challenges in tracking U.S. weaponry in Iraq have grown due to the significant amount of arms provided in the past decade. The United States has faced challenges in tracking the whereabouts of U.S. arms transferred to Iraq, particularly in monitoring equipment provided to Iraqi forces through the Iraq Train and Equip Fund. A DOD audit found that the Army lacked effective controls to track these transfers, leading to inconsistent recordkeeping and susceptibility to human error. The current conflict in Iraq further complicates monitoring activities, making it difficult to track equipment taken by ISIL. End-use monitoring is crucial for ensuring recipient governments in the Middle East comply with human rights standards. The Government Accountability Office has recommended strengthening monitoring of military equipment sold to Egypt due to issues with access to storage sites. Similar reports have been published on aid to Lebanon and GCC countries, with common recommendations including better coordination between the Departments of State and Defense and more thorough vetting of security assistance recipients. The text discusses the importance of end-use monitoring for ensuring compliance with human rights standards in the Middle East. It highlights the need for better coordination between the Departments of State and Defense, thorough vetting of security assistance recipients, and the development of guidance for documenting monitoring efforts and violations. Members of Congress are urged to assess the adequacy of existing frameworks and consider additional support or directives to strengthen these efforts."
