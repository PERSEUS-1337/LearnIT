    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Action Plan for Public Lands and Education Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that Western States are lagging in education funding compared to other states, leading to higher pupil-per-teacher ratios and larger class sizes. Over the next 10 years, enrollment growth in Western States is projected to be much higher than in other States, with Western States experiencing a dramatic increase while other States see a decrease. Despite similar tax rates and budget allocations for education, Western States have lower growth in per pupil expenditures and higher pupil-per-teacher ratios. The Federal Government is seen as the potential solution due to the significant amount of land it controls. The Federal Government is seen as the potential solver of the problem in Western States due to the large amount of land it owns in the region. Western States have significantly more federally owned land compared to Eastern States. The Acts enabling Western territories to form their constitutions and State governments included provisions for the proceeds of public land sales. The United States sold public land in Western States after their admission into the Union, with proceeds to be used for common schools. However, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 changed this policy to retain public land in Federal ownership. The United States has failed to fulfill its obligation to Western States by not providing funding for public education, leading to a need for Congressional action. Granting 5 percent of federal land to each Western State is seen as the most efficient solution. The United States will grant unappropriated public land within Western States to satisfy the funding obligation for public education. The United States will grant unappropriated public land within Western States to satisfy the funding obligation for public education through quantity grants. The United States will grant unappropriated public land within Western States to fulfill the funding obligation for public education through quantity grants. Each Western State will select land equal to 5 percent of federally owned land within the state as of July 1, 2005, in a manner determined by the state legislature. The Secretary will calculate the exact acreage of federally owned land for notification to the state. The Secretary will calculate the acreage of federally owned land in each Western State as of July 1, 2005, and designate unappropriated public land eligible for selection by the State. This selection and transfer of land will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act. Mineral, oil, and gas rights to the selected land will belong to the Western State unless specified otherwise. The relevant Western State will own the mineral, oil, and gas rights of selected land if the Federal lessee is making royalty payments. Western States can select surface rights only if the land has subsurface mineral deposits generating royalty payments. Upon termination of the Federal lease, the mineral, oil, and gas estate will become the property of the Western State. The Western States can select land with mineral rights if Federal lessees pay royalties. Upon lease termination, mineral rights become state property. Western States hold land in trust for education funding. The term \"unappropriated public lands\" refers to land managed by the Bureau of Land Management or US Forest Service, excluding land held in trust, within military reservations, National Park System units, Wildlife Refuges, designated Wilderness Areas, or National Historic Sites."
