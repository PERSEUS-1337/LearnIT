    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), giving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to regulate industrial chemicals to protect health and the environment. Stakeholders agree that TSCA needs updating, with proposed legislative changes to its core provisions. Legislation to amend TSCA Title I was introduced in the 111th and 112th Congresses. In the 113th Congress, Senator Lautenberg reintroduced the reported bill as S. 696 and introduced a second comprehensive bill, the Chemical Safety Improvement Act (CSIA), S. 1009. This report compares key provisions of S. 696 and S. 1009 with provisions of TSCA Title I that would be affected if either bill became law. Neither S. 1009 nor S. 696 would affect Titles II through VI of TSCA. S. 696 and S. 1009 would amend TSCA Title I provisions significantly, with S. 696 adding new provisions and directing the EPA Administrator to establish \"minimum information sets\" for different chemical substances. The bill S. 696 would direct the EPA to establish \"minimum information sets\" for different chemical substances, including necessary information for risk assessments and safety standard determinations. Manufacturers and processors would be required to submit this information, with EPA authorized to order additional testing if needed. EPA could take regulatory action if a manufacturer or processor fails to comply. S. 696 authorizes EPA to take regulatory action if manufacturers or processors fail to submit required information. It directs EPA to accommodate quick, low-cost testing methods with reduced animal testing. S. 1009 focuses on developing a framework for collecting, evaluating, and integrating data for new and existing chemicals, authorizing EPA to require new data development under certain circumstances. S. 1009 requires EPA to publish a statement explaining the need for data, specify a reasonable period for test data submission, and penalize failure to submit required information. It also directs the Administrator to minimize animal testing and promote the development of non-animal-based testing methods. S. 1009 authorizes the EPA to adapt or waive animal-testing requirements for manufacturers or processors under specific circumstances. The EPA can require data submission if a chemical poses a risk to health or the environment, is produced in large volume, or has potential for human exposure. Failure to submit required information is prohibited. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), EPA maintains an inventory of chemicals in U.S. commerce since 1976. Manufacturers must notify EPA before producing a new chemical. EPA has 90 days to assess the risk of new chemicals. Additionally, EPA can require notification for significant new uses of chemicals through a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR). The proposed bills S. 696 and S. 1009 aim to continue the requirement for new chemical pre-manufacture notification under the Toxic Substances Control Act. S. 1009 aligns with current regulations by mandating notice for significant new uses of chemicals subject to a SNUR. S. 696 expands notification to all chemicals on the inventory before manufacturing for new uses or at new production volumes. Additionally, both bills require EPA to categorize chemicals based on available information within 90 days of receiving a pre-manufacture notice. S. 696 and S. 1009 require EPA to categorize chemicals within 90 days of receiving a notice. S. 696 establishes categories for new chemicals, while S. 1009 categorizes new substances and uses based on safety standards. EPA's Interagency Testing Committee advises the EPA Administrator on chemicals for priority consideration. The EPA biannually prioritizes up to 50 chemicals based on factors like health and environmental risks, with a focus on those linked to cancer, gene mutations, or birth defects. The EPA Administrator maintains a list of chemicals of concern that pose unreasonable risks, which must undergo rulemaking for public input. S. 696 would eliminate ITC provisions and direct the EPA Administrator to establish a system for prioritizing chemicals for testing and regulation based on risk assessment and safety standards. EPA would assign chemicals to batches, with the first batch including chemicals currently in commerce in the United States. The bill S. 696 would direct the EPA to categorize chemicals into four groups based on available information: Substances of Very High Concern, Substances with Insufficient Information, Substances of Very Low Concern, and Substances to Undergo Safety Standard Determinations. It would also prioritize chemicals for risk assessment and regulation, with a focus on chemicals currently in commerce in the United States. S. 696 categorizes chemicals into four groups and prioritizes them for risk assessment and regulation. S. 1009 advises EPA on testing consent agreements and test orders, eliminates the chemicals of concern listing provisions, and establishes a risk-based screening process for determining chemical priorities based on available data. EPA is directed to continually review information for potential revisions in chemical assignments. The EPA's proposed prioritization screening process and criteria for evaluating existing chemical substances on the active inventory would require timely safety determinations to remove substances from the high-priority list. Chemicals can remain in U.S. commerce until EPA determines they pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment, prompting necessary rulemaking to reduce the risk. S. 696 would require manufacturers to provide scientific data for EPA to determine if a chemical meets safety standards for human health and the environment. EPA must base safety determinations solely on these considerations, and chemicals not meeting the standard would require risk reduction measures. S. 696 would prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution of chemicals that do not meet safety standards set by the EPA. It would also restrict the production of chemicals for new uses not considered in the safety determination. However, chemicals meeting the safety standard could still be produced and used. S. 696 and S. 1009 authorize EPA to impose restrictions on chemicals that do not meet safety standards. EPA must base safety determinations on risk assessments for intended use conditions, ensuring no unreasonable risk of harm. S. 1009 would require EPA to develop a science-based framework for safety assessments of chemicals, including public comment and peer review. It would also impose restrictions on high-priority chemicals that do not meet safety standards for intended use conditions. EPA must consider feasible alternatives and relative risks before banning or phasing out a chemical. The current statute provides EPA with broad authority to require data and restrict chemical use to prevent unreasonable risk of injury. Manufacturers and processors provide data, while EPA evaluates the information for risk management decisions. EPA must follow procedures laid out in the Administrative Procedure Act. The current statute requires EPA to follow procedures in the Administrative Procedure Act, provide opportunities for input, and publish findings. TSCA Section 19 allows for judicial review of specified rules within 60 days. S. 696 aims to expedite regulatory action by authorizing changes to the process. S. 696 would expedite regulatory action by authorizing EPA to issue administrative orders for specific chemical substances instead of rules. It would exempt certain EPA decisions from judicial review and increase public access to information about chemicals. Manufacturers and processors would bear the burden of proof in legal proceedings related to safety determinations. The bill S. 696 shifts the burden of proof to manufacturers and processors in legal proceedings regarding chemical safety standards. It expands EPA oversight by allowing the agency to define different forms of substances and manage environmental risks, including the indoor environment. Additionally, S. 696 authorizes EPA activities not currently allowed under TSCA. S. 696 authorizes EPA activities to implement three international agreements on hazardous chemicals, including regulating chemicals manufactured for export. The bill prohibits production and use of chemicals that violate U.S. obligations under these agreements. S. 1009 provides EPA with broad authority to require data and restrict chemical use to prevent harm from exposure. S. 1009 grants EPA authority to collect data, evaluate risks, and make decisions on chemical substances. It allows EPA to negotiate consent agreements or issue orders instead of rules, with a requirement to justify the use of orders. The legislation directs EPA to follow a decision-making framework that includes analytic and data quality control requirements, as well as procedures from the Administrative Procedure Act and the Information Quality Act. EPA must still adhere to TSCA requirements when promulgating rules. S. 1009 authorizes judicial review of Title I rules, including data development and restrictions, but not for certain determinations under Titles II and IV. Proposed TSCA Section 19 maintains the current standard of evidence for rules requiring data development or imposing restrictions. The proposed TSCA Section 19 maintains the standard of evidence for rules requiring data development or imposing restrictions, including preemptions of state and local authority. EPA's requirements under Sections 4, 5, and 6 would limit state and local regulations unless they are identical to federal requirements or adopted under another federal law. S. 696 would simplify TSCA by not preempting state laws unless compliance with both federal and state laws is impossible. S. 1009 would preempt state laws that require testing or information likely to produce the same data. Proposed TSCA Section 18 would preempt new state prohibitions or restrictions for high-priority and low-priority substances, with exceptions for laws related to federal authority, reporting requirements, or state environmental regulations. TSCA Section 14 protects proprietary confidential information submitted to EPA about chemicals in commerce, allowing manufacturers to designate information for confidential treatment. Disclosure of confidential business information is required only in limited cases authorized by EPA. S. 696 aims to increase public access to EPA's decisions and information about chemicals currently treated as confidential. It would allow disclosure of confidential business information to other federal agencies, EPA contractors, and in cases necessary to protect human health or the environment. EPA would also be required to disclose information to state or tribal governments for enforcement purposes, with confidentiality measures in place. S. 696 categorizes types of CBI and directs EPA to disclose information to public health professionals under certain conditions. The bill requires EPA to review and respond to requests for confidentiality within 90 days, with approved information protected for up to five years. S. 1009, similar to the current statute, would protect information from disclosure for up to five years. The bill requires substantiation for claims of disclosure protection and allows disclosure in certain circumstances, such as to protect human health or the environment. It prohibits the Administrator from disclosing trade secrets and other defined information. S. 1009 would protect certain information from disclosure, including trade secrets and chemical identity, with requirements for substantiation and justification. It also allows for disclosure in specific circumstances to protect human health or the environment. S. 1009 would require the Administrator to protect confidential business information (CBI) from disclosure for the requested period or a reasonable time determined by the Administrator. It outlines a process for submitting and justifying claims for protection, with recourse if the Administrator decides to release the information. EPA cannot require more substantiation than proposed TSCA Section 14 for information submitted before the enactment of S. 1009. S. 696 includes provisions for identifying areas with high toxic chemical exposure, developing action plans to reduce exposure, creating market incentives for safer alternatives, expediting review of new chemicals if they are safer alternatives, and coordinating biomonitoring studies with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. S. 696 would conduct a biomonitoring study to determine the presence of chemicals in pregnant women and infants, with disclosure requirements for manufacturers. It also addresses children's environmental health by establishing research programs and advisory committees at EPA. The CRS report discusses the promotion of \"green chemistry and engineering\" through grants and the establishment of four research centers for safer chemical alternatives. Tables 1 through 6 summarize key provisions of S. 696 and S. 1009, as well as current TSCA regulations."
