    "content": "The \"Export Promotion Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to export promotion. The Export Promotion Act acknowledges the importance of exporting goods and services to the US economy, with 11.6 million jobs supported by exports. Despite export growth since 2010, it has not met Administration goals. Federal assistance is crucial for small and mid-size businesses to access new markets. Numerous resources are available at Federal agencies for companies looking to export. Federal agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Small Business Administration, Department of State, Export-Import Bank of the United States, and others offer programs for technical assistance, low-cost financing, and developing export markets. However, there is significant overlap among agencies, leading to confusion, inefficiency, and difficulty in tracking the success of federal efforts. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found shortcomings in Federal export assistance programs, highlighting the need for improved collaboration, communication, and coordination among agencies to enhance efforts and reduce overlap for small businesses. By consolidating functions of multiple Federal agencies into the new Export Promotion Agency in the Department of Commerce, small- and mid-size businesses will have a one-stop-shop for export assistance, reducing waste and improving access to information and resources. The new Export Promotion Agency in the Department of Commerce aims to streamline export assistance for small- and mid-size businesses by cutting bureaucracy and improving tracking and reporting to Congress. Including other agencies like the Trade and Development Agency and the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs will enhance coordination for accessing new overseas markets. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
