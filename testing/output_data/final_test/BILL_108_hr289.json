Congress recognizes the importance of the western basin of Lake Erie as the largest freshwater ecosystem in the world, vital to the economic and environmental future of the United States. Efforts have been made over the past 30 years to restore water quality and fisheries in the Great Lakes, with a shift towards a holistic ecosystem approach that includes nearshore terrestrial ecosystems. The western basin of Lake Erie is crucial for the Great Lakes ecosystem, receiving most of its flow from the Detroit River. It supports diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, with the coastal wetlands of Lake Erie having the highest species diversity in the Great Lakes. The moderate climate of Lake Erie allows for species not found in the northern Great Lakes to thrive, with over 300 plant species present. The western basin of Lake Erie is home to over 300 plant species, including 37 significant species in aquatic and wetland habitats. It contains marshes like Mouille, Metzger, and Magee, Maumee Bay wetland complex, Locust Point wetland complexes, and Sandusky Bay wetland. The wetland in the western basin is vital for waterfowl habitat and is used by various bird species. The wetland in the western basin of Lake Erie is crucial for various bird species, including raptors, perching birds, and diving ducks during migration. Lake Erie is internationally recognized for its wildlife refuges, fishing, recreational activities, and tourism, generating billions in retail sales and supporting thousands of jobs. The western basin of Lake Erie supports a significant walleye fishery driving a $2 billion sport fishing industry in Ohio. The coastal wetlands in the basin have faced intense pressure for 150 years, with a significant reduction in wetland acreage by 1951. The coastal wetlands in the western basin of Lake Erie have been significantly reduced over the years, with only approximately 5,000 hectares remaining today. Development in areas like Monroe, Michigan has had a major impact on the wetlands, with only about 100 hectares remaining unaltered. The quality of the remaining wetlands has also been degraded by various stressors. Shoreline modification, exotic species, and diking of wetlands have led to erosion along the shorelines. Protective peninsula beach systems like Bay Point and Woodtick have been eroded over the years, negatively impacting breeding and spawning grounds. The definitions are outlined in Section 3. In this Act, the term \"International Refuge\" refers to the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, and the term \"Refuge Complex\" includes the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge Complex and its associated lands and waters. The Secretary established the Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuge in accordance with the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. The term \"western basin\" refers to the western basin of Lake Erie, including the Bass Island archipelago in Ohio. The Secretary of the Interior is referred to as the \"Secretary\" in this Act. SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF BOUNDARIES. The boundaries of the Refuge Complex in Ohio are expanded to include land and water from Maumee Bay State Park to the Darby Unit, as shown on a specific map. The Secretary has the authority to revise boundaries for property acquisition within the Complex. The Secretary has the authority to acquire land and water within the Refuge Complex through donation, purchase, or exchange, in a voluntary manner without forced takings. Additionally, jurisdiction over Federal property within the Complex can be transferred to the Secretary with the concurrence of the administering agency. The Secretary has the authority to acquire land and water within the Refuge Complex through donation, purchase, or exchange. The Secretary can also transfer jurisdiction over Federal property within the Complex with the concurrence of the administering agency. Additionally, the Secretary will conduct a study of fish and wildlife habitat in dredge spoil disposal sites near the Maumee River and submit a report to Congress within 18 months. The southern boundary of the International Refuge is expanded in Michigan, east of Interstate Route 75, from Sterling State Park to the Ohio State boundary. Administration of the Refuge Complex includes land acquisition, jurisdiction transfer, and a study on fish and wildlife habitat near the Maumee River. The Secretary administers federally owned land within the Refuge Complex in accordance with relevant laws. Additional statutory authority may be used for conservation and recreation. The Refuge Complex is managed to strengthen existing resource management. The Refuge Complex aims to enhance habitat for migratory birds and wildlife, conserve native aquatic and terrestrial communities, and foster partnerships with various organizations for resource conservation in the western basin. The Refuge Complex collaborates with various entities to promote public awareness of resources in the western basin and advance collective goals established in the Great Lakes Strategy 2002. The Secretary prioritizes hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and environmental education as public uses of the Refuge Complex. Cooperative agreements may be made with Ohio or Michigan to promote conservation efforts in the western basin. The Secretary prioritizes public uses like hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and environmental education in the Refuge Complex. Cooperative agreements may be made with Ohio or Michigan for managing land within the boundaries of the Complex. Authorization of appropriations is granted for acquiring land, carrying out studies, and developing the Refuge Complex."
