    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1031 of the Government Code is amended to set minimum standards for peace officers, including being a US citizen or eligible permanent resident, at least 18 years old, fingerprinted for criminal record check, and of good moral character. To become a peace officer in California, one must be a high school graduate, pass a high school equivalency test, or have a college degree from an accredited institution. The high school attended must be accredited by a recognized educational agency. To become a peace officer in California, one must have a high school diploma from an accredited institution recognized by various accrediting associations. To become a peace officer in California, one must be free from any physical, emotional, or mental conditions that may affect their duties. Physical condition is assessed by a licensed physician, while emotional and mental condition is evaluated by a psychiatrist with specific qualifications and experience. To become a peace officer in California, a licensed psychologist with specific experience is required to evaluate emotional and mental conditions. The psychologist must have at least five years of experience, including three years postdoctorate, and meet training procedures set by the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training. Additional or higher standards may also be adopted. Section 384a of the Penal Code prohibits willful or negligent destruction of plant material on state or county highway rights-of-way. In California, it is prohibited to cut, destroy, or remove plant material from public or private land without written permission. Selling or transporting plant material obtained illegally is also forbidden. \"Plant material\" includes various types of vegetation but excludes those declared a public nuisance by law. The written permit required for cutting or removing plant material must be signed by the landowner or their authorized agent, contain specific details, and be acknowledged before a notary public. It should also be filed with the sheriff's office before any cutting or removal takes place. A permit is not required to be notarized or filed when cutting five or fewer pounds of shrubs or boughs. (d) Authorized personnel such as county or state fire wardens, Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and United States Forest Service officials can enforce and confiscate unlawfully cut plant material. (e) Exemptions include employees working on state, county, or public roads under supervision. A violation of this section, which includes cutting plant material to protect utility property or for logging/fire suppression, is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to six months. When arrested without a warrant, the individual must be taken before a magistrate without unnecessary delay. A peace officer may release a person from custody instead of taking them before a magistrate in certain circumstances: insufficient grounds for criminal complaint, arrest for intoxication only, arrest for being under the influence of a controlled substance or drug and delivered for treatment, or arrest for driving under the influence and delivered to a hospital for medical treatment. (c) The record of arrest for a person released under specific circumstances shall include a record of release, and the arrest will be considered a detention only. Section 243.15 of the Penal Code addresses battery committed by individuals confined in a city or county jail, subject to imprisonment. Section 4504 of the Penal Code defines terms for this chapter. Section 4504 of the Penal Code defines confinement in a \"state prison\" as being confined in specified prisons by order of law, regardless of the purpose or validity of the order, until a court judgment sets it aside. A person is considered \"confined in\" a prison even if temporarily outside its walls for work detail or other purposes. Being released on parole does not count as being confined. The Department of Public Resources is responsible for protecting state parks and vehicular recreation areas from damage and maintaining peace. The director can appoint department officers as peace officers to enforce specific laws and regulations within their jurisdiction, including those related to boating, vehicles, and public offenses. The peace officer's authority is limited to that of peace officers listed in the Penal Code. The department appoints officers as peace officers to protect property in the California recreational trail system and enforce rules. Violators face misdemeanor charges or fines. Section 1403 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is repealed."
