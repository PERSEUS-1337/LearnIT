    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biased IRS Audit Systems Prevention Act\" and aims to ensure audit transparency and fairness. The \"Biased IRS Audit Systems Prevention Act\" mandates audit transparency by requiring the IRS to provide taxpayers with reasons for audit selection and disclose information used in the selection process. The IRS must disclose to taxpayers the data used in selecting tax returns for auditing, whether provided by the taxpayer or obtained from other sources. The IRS must disclose the method and data sources used in selecting tax returns for auditing, including the methodology for validating sources. The identity of other taxpayers selected for audit does not need to be disclosed. The Secretary must document and record the selection of tax returns for auditing based on various methods, including randomized selection, scoring under the Discriminant Index Function System, examiner determination, and other undisclosed methodologies. Additionally, tax returns may be selected for audit based on internally obtained information. The Secretary must document and record the source of information obtained by the Internal Revenue Service from sources other than the taxpayer. Definitions for \"applicable oversight entity\" and \"Secretary\" are provided in this subsection. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury or their delegate. This subsection applies to tax returns selected for audit after the enactment of the Act. The IRS is prohibited from conducting audits primarily for research purposes. Resources from the National Research Program will be redirected to combat tax refund fraud and identity theft. A report on this repurposing must be submitted within six months. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue must report to Congress within 6 months on resources repurposed as per the Act."
