    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 6377.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code exempts gross receipts from the sale of hydrogen refueling station equipment to a qualified grant recipient from taxes until January 1, 2030. A qualified grant recipient is defined as a person who has received a grant for developing hydrogen refueling stations in California. A \"hydrogen refueling station\" provides hydrogen fuel for fuel cell electric vehicles. \"Hydrogen refueling station equipment\" includes machinery and parts for distributing, dispensing, and storing hydrogen fuel. Personal property such as software, hardware, and equipment necessary for operating a hydrogen refueling station for fuel cell electric vehicles is defined. A fuel cell is a device that generates electricity using hydrogen and oxygen. For taxable years starting in 2016 and before 2017, a credit is allowed to qualified grant recipients for sales tax and use taxes paid for hydrogen refueling station equipment. The terms \"qualified grant recipient\" and \"hydrogen refueling station equipment\" are defined in Section 6377.5. The credit under this section is allowed to pass-thru entities like partnerships or \"S\" corporations, and can be passed through to partners or shareholders. Any excess credit can be carried over to future taxable years until exhausted. The Franchise Tax Board may establish rules to implement this section. For taxable years between January 1, 2016, and December 1, 2017, a credit is allowed to qualified grant recipients for sales tax reimbursements and use taxes paid for hydrogen refueling station equipment. Qualified grant recipients and equipment are defined in Section 6377.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. (c) A credit is allowed to pass-thru entities, such as partnerships, and can be passed through to partners or shareholders. Any excess credit can be carried over to future taxable years until exhausted. The Franchise Tax Board can establish rules to implement this section, and Section 41 does not apply to this credit. Section 41 does not apply to the credit allowed by this section, which will be in effect until December 1, 2017, and then repealed. No appropriation is made by this act, and the state will not reimburse any local agency for lost sales and use tax revenues. This act constitutes a tax levy and will take immediate effect."
