The \"Spread Pricing Liquidity Act of 2013\" establishes tick size options for certain issuers with specific criteria regarding public float and trading volume. The board of directors of eligible issuers can choose to have their securities quoted and traded using an increment of either $0.05 or $0.10.

The board of directors must consult with the issuer's primary listing market before selecting a tick size option of $0.05 or $0.10 for securities. Once chosen, all quotes and trades must use the selected increment, and exchanges cannot charge varying fees for trades of the issuer's securities. The issuer can opt out of the tick size selection after 6 months by informing the appropriate parties.
