The Secretary of Defense must ensure retired pay reductions under section 1460 of title 10, United States Code, align with the Act's objectives. Starting October 1, 2004, an open enrollment period for Survivor Benefit Plan begins. An eligible retired or former member may elect to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan during the open enrollment period. They can also choose to participate in the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan if they elect the maximum level of coverage. An eligible retired or former member can participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan during the open enrollment period if they are entitled to retired pay or would be entitled to it under certain conditions. Making an election under specific eligibility criteria will result in providing a standard annuity under the plan. During the open enrollment period, a retired or former member can elect to increase coverage under the Survivor Benefit Plan by choosing a higher base amount or providing annuity coverage for a dependent child. During the open enrollment period, a person eligible for the Survivor Benefit Plan can elect to participate in the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan for their spouse or former spouse at a base amount not less than that provided for a dependent child. During the open enrollment period, eligible individuals can increase their participation level in the Survivor Benefit Plan to provide annuity coverage for their spouse or former spouse. However, individuals cannot make an election if the annuity of their spouse or former spouse will be computed under a specific section of the law, but they can waive this right during the open enrollment period. Any election made is irrevocable. Any election under this section must be made in writing, signed, and received by the Secretary before the open enrollment period ends. The election allows for the same conditions and opportunities for beneficiaries as the Survivor Benefit Plan. An individual electing to provide a reserve-component annuity must make a specific designation as described in section 1448(e) of title 10, United States Code. The open enrollment period for elections begins on October 1, 2004. If a person dies within two years of making an election, the election becomes void, and any reduction in retired pay must be paid in a lump sum to the designated beneficiary. The provisions of sections 1449, 1453, and 1454 of title 10, United States Code, apply to elections made under this section as if made under the Survivor Benefit Plan. The Secretary of Defense may require an additional premium for elections under subsection (a)(1) or (b), not exceeding 4.5 percent of the base amount. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress by July 1, 2004, regarding the open season for the Survivor Benefit Plan. The report should detail plans for implementation, cost estimates, and any recommendations for further legislative action."
