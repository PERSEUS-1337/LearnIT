    "content": "The Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 mandated explosives detection screening of checked baggage, but did not address the threat of bombs in the aircraft cabin. Several terrorist plots have highlighted the danger of concealed improvised explosive devices, leading to increased policy focus on aviation security. The 9/11 Commission recommended prioritizing the detection of explosives on passengers, with secondary screening individuals undergoing explosives screening at airport checkpoints. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed TSA to focus on developing technologies to detect various weapons and explosives on passengers and in carry-on items. Initial trials of \"puffer\" machines for explosives trace detection in 2004 had reliability issues, leading to TSA suspending further deployment. TSA invested in whole body imaging (WBI) technologies after suspending \"puffer\" machines due to reliability issues. AIT systems generate images to detect concealed items like explosives and weapons. Following the 2009 bombing attempt, TSA accelerated AIT deployment for primary screening of selected passengers. Since 2007, TSA has been using X-ray backscatter and millimeter wave imaging systems for screening airline passengers. X-ray backscatter systems use a low-intensity X-ray beam to scan the body, with improved resolution and privacy algorithms to generate front and back images resembling chalk outlines. TSA implemented privacy filtering to address concerns over raw X-ray backscatter images. Millimeter wave imaging systems emit non-ionizing electromagnetic radio waves in the 30-300 gigahertz spectrum to create images underneath clothing. Privacy filters blur faces in the images, and TSA is testing automated target recognition algorithms to replace human analysis. All future TSA millimeter wave systems will come equipped with ATR technology. TSA plans to deploy 1,800 AIT units by the end of FY2014, with 700 units already deployed at 180 airports. Each unit costs about $175,000, and additional costs include installation, maintenance, training, and operational expenses. TSA hired 8,000 screeners to handle the workload increase from the AIT deployment. The annual cost of deploying and operating AIT systems is estimated to be $455 million currently, increasing to $1.17 billion once 1,800 units are fully deployed. TSA argues that the operating cost per traveling passenger is roughly $1, but the cost per scan cannot be accurately estimated due to undisclosed passenger screening percentages. TSA uses random and targeted selection techniques for AIT screening. The TSA uses random and targeted selection techniques for AIT screening, with a shift towards favoring millimeter wave systems over X-ray backscatter units due to public health concerns and technological advancements. Polls show that 75% to 80% of Americans support the use of AIT at airports. The use of AIT at airport checkpoints is supported by 75% to 80% of Americans, but remains controversial due to privacy, health risks, and security delays concerns. Privacy advocates, like the ACLU, have urged Congress to ban whole body imaging technologies for primary screening, citing privacy issues. Courts have ruled that routine airport searches are considered warrantless searches and are generally not subject to constitutional prohibitions against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has found that these searches are acceptable as long as they are no more intrusive than necessary to detect weapons or explosives, are confined to that purpose, and individuals can choose not to fly to avoid the search. In a 2007 ruling, the court also stated that airport searches of passengers are reasonable and do not require consent. The Supreme Court has not specifically addressed the constitutionality of airport screening searches, including the use of Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT). Further legal and policy analysis may be necessary to determine the legality of AIT and alternative screening procedures. The TSA has implemented policies to address privacy concerns with AIT screening, including disabling image storage, setting up remote imaging locations, and installing privacy filters. Despite these safeguards, reports of alleged abuses have surfaced, with complaints from female passengers in February 2012. In February 2012, female passengers complained about being asked to go through TSA scanners multiple times due to their attractiveness. TSA denied the practice but concerns remain about children being selected for AIT screening, including image viewing, health effects, and safety issues. TSA has modified procedures for children but they can still be chosen for screening, with the option for a parent or guardian to choose the method. TSA began installing ATR software in millimeter wave machines in FY2011. The TSA has implemented Automated Target Recognition (ATR) software in millimeter wave machines to address privacy concerns and improve screening efficiency. ATR automatically reviews and analyzes images for concealed threats, displaying only a generic body outline on the monitor. TSA plans to rely primarily on ATR for threat detection, with all millimeter wave scanners upgraded with ATR software in 2011. The TSA plans to include Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capabilities in all future millimeter wave AIT procurements. There is debate over the implementation of a similar system for X-ray backscatter imagers due to concerns about ionizing radiation and its potential health impacts. TSA states that the radiation levels emitted by certified X-ray backscatter systems are below unsafe limits, with exposure equivalent to two minutes of naturally occurring radiation during a commercial flight. The X-ray aperture in certified backscatter units is very small, emitting continuously for about 10 to 20 seconds to scan the entire human body. Safety measures include redundant monitors and automatic shutdown circuits. TSA-approved backscatter systems comply with radiation safety standards and have been evaluated by various institutions. The controversy over exposure to X-ray backscatter persists despite independent evaluations concluding that TSA-certified units meet national health and safety standards. Concerns raised by researchers include the concentration of radiation on the skin and underlying tissue, posing potential risks for older travelers and those with compromised immune systems. The potential health risks of full-body screening using approved systems include concerns for compromised immune systems, higher risk of breast cancer in some females, effects on children, adolescents, pregnant women, and fetuses not fully assessed, possible sperm mutation due to testicle proximity, and undetermined effects on the cornea and thymus gland. TSA and FDA assert that the risks are minimal and independent data confirm the systems do not pose significant health risks. The European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging Health Risks found that while individual health risks from millimeter wave scanners are minimal, there may be potential effects at the population level, especially for children. The scanners do not emit ionizing radiation, unlike X-ray systems, and current exposure levels are below recommended guidelines. TSA accommodates individuals with special needs. In May 2012, a diabetic teenager's insulin pump was damaged by an AIT system at Salt Lake City International Airport despite a doctor's note advising against body scanner screening. TSA advises individuals with medical devices to request a pat down inspection if AIT screening is not recommended. TSA has created a disability notification card for individuals with health conditions or medical devices. TSA Cares hotline (1-855-787-2227) provides support for individuals with disabilities. AIT screening has not caused significant delays as TSA selects only a small percentage of passengers for screening. The TSA uses AIT screening for a small percentage of passengers, with over 99% choosing AIT over pat-downs due to its speed. AIT technology aims to accurately detect threats while minimizing false alarms, undergoing certification testing like other TSA screening technologies. The TSA uses AIT screening technology, which undergoes certification testing by the DHS. Experts are divided on its effectiveness, especially in detecting certain explosives. Concealment tactics could potentially evade detection by AIT systems. The TSA uses AIT screening technology, which experts are divided on its effectiveness in detecting certain explosives. Certain items, including explosives used in past terrorism attempts, could be difficult to detect using X-ray backscatter systems. The DHS Office of Inspector General has raised concerns about the adequacy of TSA's training and calibration procedures for AIT units. The TSA provides on-the-job training and classroom instruction for AIT screeners, with additional time for proficiency. However, inconsistencies in applying procedures were found by the DHS Inspector General. Recommendations were made for assessing training requirements and ensuring proper calibration of AIT systems. TSA currently assigns three screeners per AIT unit per shift and hired 8,000 additional screeners through FY2011 to meet workload demands. TSA hired 8,000 additional screeners through FY2011 to meet workload demands associated with deploying AIT units. The migration to ATR is expected to reduce screener staffing needs by up to one-third by eliminating human image viewers. However, the impact on overall TSA staffing is uncertain, as additional staff may be needed for secondary screening due to potential ATR alarms. TSA aims to acquire 1,800 AIT units by the end of FY2014 for U.S. airports. Currently, only about 180 airports have AIT machines, with a focus on larger airports and those in high-security categories. Smaller airports may not have AIT, potentially allowing terrorists to exploit this gap in security measures.

Smaller airports may not have AIT machines, potentially allowing terrorists to exploit this gap in security measures. The Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2011 (H.R. 1279) would require the National Academy of Sciences to determine that AIT does not pose a threat to public health and would further restrict AIT or pat-down screening from being used as a primary screening method. The Checkpoint Images Protection Act of 2011 (H.R. 685) and the Transportation Security Administration Authorization Act of 2011 (H.R. 3011) aim to establish penalties for unauthorized recording or distribution of security screening images and require certification of ATR software on AIT machines. The Traveler Screening Act (S. 2207) would improve tracking of public complaints about screening and accommodate individuals with special needs during screening. The bill requires TSA to appoint passenger advocates at busiest airports to assist individuals with special needs at screening checkpoints. Advocates must have no disciplinary history, receive conflict resolution and medical training."
