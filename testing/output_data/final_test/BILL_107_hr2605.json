    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Ordnance and Explosives Risk Management Act\" and establishes a single point of contact for policy and budgeting issues related to former military ranges. Section 2701 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to establish a UXO Program Manager within the Department of Defense for policy and budgeting issues related to unexploded ordnance and abandoned military munitions at former military ranges. The Secretary of Defense is required to appoint the program manager and may only delegate authority to the Secretary of the Army and the Under Secretary of the Army. Additionally, there is a provision for an inventory of explosive risk sites at former military ranges. Sec. 2710 of title 10, United States Code, defines former military ranges as sites owned or used by the Federal Government for military purposes, including disposal or training with munitions. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop and maintain an inventory of former military ranges known or suspected to contain abandoned military munitions, including unexploded ordnance and chemical weapons. This inventory must include specific information for each range. The inventory of former military ranges must include a unique identifier, location details, ownership information, and land use controls that may affect public and environmental exposure to abandoned military munitions. The Secretary of Defense assigns relative priorities to former military ranges for response activities based on conditions, safety, and environmental hazards. Factors considered include the presence of abandoned munitions, types of munitions, and control of public access to the range. The factors considered for response activities at former military ranges include potential human contact with abandoned munitions, ongoing response actions, transfer dates, documented incidents, drinking water contamination, and ecosystem destruction. The Secretary of Defense updates the inventory annually to reflect new information and works with communities to provide information on former military ranges. Immediate notification is given to affected individuals and officials in case of emergency. Section 2710 of title 10, United States Code requires an inventory of former military ranges with explosive risk sites to be completed within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a separate Department of Defense account is established for the removal and cleanup of abandoned military munitions. An account named the 'Abandoned Military Munitions Account, Defense' is established under section 2703 of title 10, US Code, to fund activities required by section 2710 and clean up abandoned military munitions. The 'Abandoned Military Munitions Account, Defense' is established to fund cleanup of abandoned military munitions at former military ranges. Amendments include budget requests for deposit in the account for specified use. SEC. 5. Enhanced security measures at former military ranges and public awareness efforts regarding dangers associated with such ranges. Section 2710 of title 10, United States Code, requires the Secretary of Defense to prepare a site security plan for former military ranges to restrict public access to abandoned military munitions and educate the public on the risks involved. Cooperation with various entities is encouraged for effective implementation. The Secretary of Defense collaborates with federal agencies, non-federal entities, and other organizations to develop and implement a site security plan for former military ranges, as mandated by Section 2710 of title 10, United States Code. This includes restricting public access to abandoned military munitions and educating the public on associated risks. The Program Manager for UXO will establish an independent oversight panel including the National Academy of Sciences, a NGO with UXO expertise, the EPA, and a State representative. The panel will report annually to Congress on Department of Defense progress and provide recommendations for UXO program improvement."
