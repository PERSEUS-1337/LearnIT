    "content": "The Constitution imposes restraints on the government to ensure fair enforcement of laws. Fairness depends on legal objectives and individual liberties. Criminal law aims to discover truth, punish proportionately, acquit the innocent, and prevent crime. Military justice enhances discipline for national defense. International criminal law considers foreign policy and treaty obligations. The Fifth Amendment prohibits unfair treatment. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution ensures that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, including the opportunity to be heard. Criminal proceedings provide a chance to contest guilt and challenge government conduct that may violate the rights of the accused. The system of procedural rules in criminal hearings serves as a safeguard against violations of constitutional rights. The Bill of Rights applies to all citizens and aliens in the United States, with various remedies available for those whose rights may have been infringed. The jurisdiction of entities trying a person accused of a crime can impact procedural rights. International law guarantees rights of criminal defendants and prisoners, incorporated into U.S. law. The law of war applies to cases from armed conflicts. The law of war applies to cases from armed conflicts, including those involving non-state terrorists. The Supreme Court has ruled that Al Qaeda fighters are entitled to baseline protections under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The federal judiciary, established by Article III of the Constitution, is a separate and co-equal branch of the government. The federal judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative branches, interpreting and deciding disputes under the law. Federal criminal law is enacted by Congress, with the Supreme Court establishing procedural rules for criminal trials. The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate the armed forces, while making the President Commander-in-Chief. The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate the armed forces and makes the President Commander-in-Chief. The judiciary does not have an explicit role in the military, and courts-martial are not considered Article III courts. Military personnel have rights under the Bill of Rights, but discipline is also a key objective of military justice. Military members accused of a crime are exempt from the Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury indictment. Courts-martial jurisdiction is limited to certain persons and offenses the military has an interest in regulating, mainly service members on active duty, prisoners of war, and violators of the law of war. Congress regulates the armed forces through the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in title 10 of the U.S. Code. The Supreme Court has found the UCMJ procedures to meet constitutional requirements for maintaining national defense. The President has the authority to make procedural rules for the military justice system. The President has the authority to make procedural rules for the military justice system, including creating the Rules for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) and the Military Rules of Evidence (Mil. R. Evid.). Defendants cannot appeal courts-martial directly to federal courts but may seek relief through a writ of habeas corpus. Congress has established a separate system for reviewing court-martial convictions, which includes a civilian appellate court. The Court of Criminal Appeals must review cases involving certain severe sentences or discharges for legal errors. The Court of Criminal Appeals reviews cases for legal error, factual sufficiency, and sentence appropriateness. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has appellate jurisdiction over the services' Courts of Criminal Appeals. The CAAF is an Article I court with five civilian judges appointed for 15-year terms. Its jurisdiction is discretionary except in death penalty cases. The President has the authority to convene military commissions as Commander in Chief. The President has the authority to convene military commissions to try offenses against the law of war during times of war. Military commissions are externally directed at the enemy to punish and deter offenses, with jurisdiction limited to non-citizens as per the Military Order of November 13, 2001. The President has the authority to convene military commissions to try offenses against the law of war during times of war, with jurisdiction limited to non-citizens. Military commissions are not subject to the same constitutional requirements as Article III courts and the rules of procedure and evidence are set by the President. Military commissions were first used in 1847 and made heavy use of them in the Civil War, but had not been convened since World War II before the President's Military Order. Military commissions have been used since World War II, with procedures lacking standards for comparison. Before the twentieth century, war crimes were tried by belligerent States in their own courts or military tribunals. After World War I, a commission was appointed to investigate legal liability for war crimes. After World War I, a commission investigated war crimes and recommended an international military tribunal to prosecute those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Germany initially refused to comply with turning over accused war criminals, leading to a compromise where Germany agreed to prosecute them in its national courts. However, only 13 out of 901 cases referred to the German Supreme Court resulted in convictions, largely seen as a failure due to German nationalism hindering the prosecution. Lessons learned from this experience led to the formation of special international tribunals for the European and Asian theaters after World War II. The International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg was established in 1945 by the United States, France, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union to try war criminals. Control Council Law No. 10 authorized national military tribunals to handle less high-profile war crimes. The evidentiary rules allowed for the admission of various types of evidence, including hearsay and coerced confessions. While some argue that the tribunals violated principles of legality, the historical consensus is that the Nuremberg Trials were conducted fairly. Some argue that the Nuremberg Trials were conducted fairly, but the malleability of rules led to unjust results. The Tokyo tribunal decisions faced criticism, and procedural safeguards may not meet today's standards of justice. The Nuremberg Tribunal's jurisdiction was based on international law and the combined sovereignty of the Allies and Germany's surrender. The defendants' argument that the tribunal violated legal principles was rejected. The tribunal adopted the doctrine of individual responsibility. The Nuremberg Tribunal established individual responsibility for war crimes, indicting twenty-four Nazi leaders. The defendants faced four counts: crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and conspiracy. Nineteen were found guilty, with sentences ranging from death to imprisonment. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo was also established for similar purposes. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) was established by General Douglas MacArthur to try serious crimes against peace. Eleven judges from victorious Allied nations were appointed, and all twenty-five people indicted were convicted, with seven executed. Additionally, 300,000 Japanese nationals were tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity in national military tribunals. The UN Security Council established two ad hoc criminal courts under its Chapter VII authority. The UN Security Council established two ad hoc criminal courts, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), under its Chapter VII authority. Both tribunals operate in The Hague, Netherlands, with jurisdiction over crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. They can assert primacy over national courts and provide important precedent for interpreting Common Article 3. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established in 1994 by the UN Security Council to address genocide and other serious violations of humanitarian law in the context of armed conflict. It consists of sixteen permanent judges elected by the UN General Assembly, with an Appeals Chamber of seven judges. The Prosecutor, appointed by the UN Security Council, investigates and prosecutes individuals responsible for covered offenses. The ICTR is based in Arusha, Tanzania. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established in 1994 to address violations of humanitarian law in the context of armed conflict. It has tried 28 accused, convicting 25 and acquitting three, with twenty-seven defendants currently on trial and fourteen awaiting trial."
