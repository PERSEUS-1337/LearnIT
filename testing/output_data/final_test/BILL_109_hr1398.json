The Congress finds that the United States' heavy reliance on imported petroleum poses a significant strategic vulnerability, with almost half of the nation's energy supply coming from foreign sources. Economic instability, such as the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s and rising oil prices causing recessions, has been a recurring issue. Rising fuel prices have particularly impacted small businesses like truckers and farmers. The Act aims to reduce America's dependence on foreign petroleum by promoting domestic agricultural sources for renewable energy. It seeks to shift the petroleum trade deficit to a trade balance through increased production of biobased fuels. The number of vehicles running on E-85 ethanol is increasing, with 20 different models available in 2005. Biodiesel production is increasing significantly, with Daimler-Chrysler planning to use a biodiesel blend in the Diesel Jeep Liberty. Currently, the United States consumes a large amount of petroleum annually. The United States imports a large amount of petroleum and its derivatives, leading to a significant trade deficit. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently holds 670,700,000 barrels, mostly purchased from foreign sources, with none of the fuel being bio-based. Domestic production should be encouraged to reduce reliance on imports. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently holds 670,700,000 barrels, with a significant portion purchased from foreign sources. A proposal suggests exchanging some reserves for biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel to diversify energy sources and address dependence on foreign energy. This move could double ethanol products and enhance energy security. In the current economic climate, agricultural surpluses have led to record low commodity prices while global petroleum prices are soaring due to dwindling reserves. Utilizing domestic biobased oils can bolster the nation's energy security. Biofuels have the potential to meet a significant portion of the United States' fuel demand in the short term with existing technologies, and further advancements in plant research and processing technologies can enhance this capability. Biofuels can enhance economic security by reducing dependence on imported oil and providing significant economic benefits to rural and urban areas. Increased cultivation and use of biofuels can yield even greater results and can be integrated with existing petroleum infrastructure and equipment. According to the Department of Agriculture, a sustained annual market of 100,000,000 gallons of biodiesel alone would result in $170,000,000 in increased income to farmers. Farmer-owned biofuels production has already improved income for farmers, as seen in State-supported rural development efforts in Minnesota where corn prices have increased by $1.00 per bushel. The use of grain-based ethanol and biomass ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 46 percent compared to conventional gasoline. Ethanol-blended gasoline has reduced smog-forming emissions by 25 percent since 1990, and ethanol can reduce tailpipe carbon monoxide emissions by up to 30 percent. Ethanol and biodiesel have significant environmental benefits:\n- Ethanol reduces exhaust volatile organic compounds emissions by 12% and toxic emissions by 30%.\n- It also reduces particulate emissions, especially fine-particulates that are harmful to health.\n- Biodiesel contains no sulfur or aromatics linked to air pollution and provides a 78.5% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to petroleum diesel. Biodiesel, when burned in a conventional engine, significantly reduces unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter compared to petroleum diesel. ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL FUEL REQUIREMENTS. Section 211 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include definitions for ethanol and biodiesel as renewable fuels derived from various sources including lignocellulosic matter, animal wastes, and municipal solid waste. The Clean Air Act is amended to include definitions for ethanol and biodiesel as renewable fuels, with regulations ensuring that gasoline contains at least 10% ethanol and diesel contains at least 5% biodiesel after December 31, 2010."
