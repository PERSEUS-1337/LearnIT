The agreement allows transit of personnel and non-lethal cargoes at Manas airport, with an increased yearly rent payment of $60 million. The United States pledged funds for infrastructure improvements and air traffic. The Kyrgyz government agreed to allow transit of personnel and non-lethal cargoes at Manas airport for security in the region. The United States pledged $36 million for infrastructure improvements, $30 million for air traffic control upgrades, $20 million for economic development, $21 million for counter-narcotics, and $10 million for counter-terrorism efforts. The agreement also includes stricter host-country conditions on U.S. military personnel. President Obama had sent a letter to Kyrgyz President Bakiyev prior to the agreement. In mid-June, Afghan President Hamed Karzai urged Kyrgyzstan to keep the Manas airbase open for U.S. forces supporting operations in Afghanistan. Kyrgyzstan announced the termination of the agreement allowing U.S. forces to use the airbase, leading to concerns about logistics for U.S. troop deployments and security ties. The U.S. faced leaving the airbase by late August 2009. The planned surge in U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan and potential cooler security ties with Kyrgyzstan could hinder U.S. counter-terrorism efforts in Central Asia. The United States intensified talks with Kyrgyzstan to persuade them to keep the Manas airbase open. The 111th Congress faced decisions on security and foreign assistance appropriations for Kyrgyzstan based on the airbase's status. After 9/11, the U.S. negotiated security agreements with Central Asian states. The U.S. negotiated security agreements with Central Asian states to use their airstrips for Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan was opened in December 2001, hosting troops from multiple countries. Kyrgyzstan also agreed to host a Russian airbase at Kant in 2003. The Kant airbase in Kyrgyzstan, part of the CSTO, is near the Manas airbase. In 2005, a declaration by SCO members called for the end of OEF coalition use of airbases in Central Asia. Uzbekistan ended a basing agreement with the US due to criticism of its actions. Kyrgyzstan later demanded increased fees for the Manas airbase or its closure, leading to negotiations and an agreement in 2006. In July 2006, an agreement was reached to increase the leasing fee for the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan from $2 million to $17.4 million for a five-year period. The United States pledged $150 million in assistance to Kyrgyzstan, with controversy over whether this amount would continue in subsequent years. Gen. David Petraeus stated that the US provides around $150 million per year in aid to Kyrgyzstan through various programs. The Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan contributed over $64 million to the local economy in FY2008, with $17.4 million as a lease payment. The base serves as a key air mobility hub for coalition forces in Afghanistan, with 1,000 personnel from Spain, France, and the US stationed there. Total US assistance to Kyrgyzstan in FY2008 was around $96 million. The 376th Air Expeditionary Wing at the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan flew 3,294 refueling missions over Afghanistan in 2008, serving as a key transit point for NATO and coalition troops. The airbase also plays a role in off-loading supplies for Bagram airbase in Afghanistan and has the capability to serve as an alternative route for lethal supplies under the SOFA agreement. C-17 Globemasters at the airbase are used for troop airlift, emergency medical evacuation, and airdrops. The 376th Air Expeditionary Wing at the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan conducts refueling missions over Afghanistan and serves as a communications hub. The Spanish and French detachments provide airlift and aerial refueling support for coalition aircraft. Russia intensified efforts to convince Kyrgyzstan to close the airbase due to alleged environmental damage and safety concerns. Russian media praised the benefits of Russia's Kant airbase while the pro-Moscow Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan led anti-American demonstrations. A new Russian law on migrant workers raised concerns in Kyrgyzstan, prompting Kyrgyz legislative speaker Marat Sultanov to visit Russia in May 2007. Sultanov reportedly urged Moscow to facilitate the inflow of Kyrgyz migrant workers in exchange for a boost in Russian military presence and the closure of the Manas airbase. In August 2007, then-President Vladimir Putin offered to invest up to $2 billion in Kyrgyzstan's economy. In late 2008, Kyrgyzstan and Russia worked on identifying investment projects, including hydro-electricity production. Talks expanded to include a $300 million loan to support Kyrgyzstan's budget amid the global economic downturn. Allegations surfaced that Russian aid was tied to closing the Manas airbase, which Kyrgyz President Bakiyev announced in early 2009 during a meeting with Russian President Medvedev. During a meeting with Russian President Medvedev, Kyrgyz President Bakiyev announced the closure of the Manas airbase due to inadequate U.S. compensation, strong Kyrgyz public opinion against its operation, and the conclusion of counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan. Medvedev pledged $1.7 billion for a dam and hydroelectric power station, $450 million for budget stabilization, and canceled a $180 million debt in exchange for properties. He also suggested that CSTO member-countries could offer land transit for NATO supplies in Afghanistan. The Kyrgyz legislature, dominated by Bakiyev's party, voted overwhelmingly to close the airbase on February 19, 2009. The Kyrgyz legislature, dominated by the president's Ak Zhol Party, voted overwhelmingly on February 19, 2009, to close the Manas airbase. President Bakiyev signed the bill into law the next day, and the United States is to turn over the airbase facilities by late August 2009. Legislation annulling airbase access agreements with multiple countries was also signed. Opposition leader Bakyt Beshimov argued against the closure, citing national interests. The closure of the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan has raised concerns about worsening relations with the United States and other Western countries. Critics argue that maintaining a balance between hosting the U.S. and Russian airbases is crucial for Kyrgyzstan's foreign policy. The potential increase in dependence on Russia and China for security ties is also a point of concern, especially with Russia planning to expand its presence in the region. The upgraded airbase in Central Asia would support CSTO rapid reaction forces. Railroad repair work at Kant in February 2009 was seen as preparation for a major influx of weaponry and personnel. Russia's push to close the Manas airbase was to reduce U.S. influence in the region, not to hinder U.S. and ISAF operations in Afghanistan. Concerns arose that the Manas airbase could become a permanent U.S. presence in the region, prompting Russia to support ongoing U.S. and ISAF operations in Afghanistan. Russia supported ongoing U.S. and ISAF operations in Afghanistan by granting transit rights for NATO supplies, downplaying the significance of the Manas airbase. The CSTO efforts were deemed more significant in ensuring stability in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Russia also announced sending more warplanes to the Kant airbase. In April 2009, the SCO conducted a military exercise in Tajikistan to simulate repelling a terrorist incursion from Afghanistan. Pierre Morel, the EU's Special Representative for Georgia and Central Asia, visited Kyrgyzstan and warned about the country's security being affected by a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan if NATO operations were hindered. He also disagreed with the idea that the closure of the airbase would not impact EU ties with Kyrgyzstan. Observers noted rising public discontent in Kyrgyzstan due to the global economic downturn, energy shortages, and upcoming presidential elections in July 2009. The closure of the airbase in Kyrgyzstan was initially ordered by Bakiyev to gain electoral support, but he later reversed his decision due to the economic benefits. Some opposition parties raised concerns about Bakiyev's relationship with Russia potentially leading to authoritarianism. Bakiyev emphasized the airbase's importance for regional security during a campaign stop. The United States signed security agreements with Central Asian states, not seeking permanent bases but maintaining regional access for Afghanistan operations and future contingencies. The Obama Administration reaffirmed these interests, emphasizing the economic and security roles of the region in stabilizing Afghanistan. Assistant Secretary Boucher highlighted these points during a visit to Tajikistan in April 2009. The U.S. aims to strengthen relations with Central Asia to support stability in Afghanistan. Negative incidents at the Manas airbase have strained U.S.-Kyrgyz relations, including the shooting of a Russian truck driver in 2006. In late 2008, a Kyrgyz opinion survey showed that 84% viewed Russia as friendly to Kyrgyzstan, while almost 50% saw the U.S. airbase at Manas negatively. Despite initial lack of concern by the U.S. military in October 2008, Gen. David Petraeus offered to boost U.S. assistance by January 2009 in response to concerns about the status of the airbase. Bakiyev announced the closure of the Manas airbase, prompting U.S. Defense Secretary Gates to express willingness to negotiate larger payments. Talks with Kyrgyzstan are ongoing, with operations at the airbase unaffected. The U.S. is not actively seeking another airbase in Central Asia, considering distributing functions to various locations instead. The closure of the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan could complicate President Obama's troop deployment to Afghanistan. The airbase has been a key access point for U.S. military personnel and supplies. Finding alternative facilities for refueling, communications, and medical evacuation may be challenging. Retired Gen. Richard Myers has warned about the impact on maintaining supply routes to Afghanistan. The closure of the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan could affect supply routes to Afghanistan, leading to higher operational costs. Some believe Russia is using this as leverage for concessions from the U.S. Analysts suggest the U.S. should provide more assistance to Central Asian states for independent security decisions. Analysts raise concerns about U.S. influence in Central Asia affecting security and supply routes to Afghanistan. Agreements with Russia and Central Asian states allow for overland transit of non-lethal goods. Routes include Latvia to Afghanistan through Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, and Georgia to Afghanistan via Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Tajikistan also serves as a transit point for goods to Afghanistan. The first shipment of U.S. non-lethal military supplies, including camouflage, food, and civil engineering equipment, traveled from Latvia to Afghanistan through Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan in late March 2009. U.S.-led coalition actions in Afghanistan in 2001-2002 weakened terrorist groups in the region, while Russia and China were unable to provide sufficient military support in the 1990s. Analysts question whether Russia and China can provide enough military support to prevent attacks in Central Asia. Concerns are raised about terrorists finding safe havens in the region and launching attacks into Afghanistan. Congress supports the U.S. airbase at Manas to enhance security in the area. The U.S. Congress supports the airbase at Manas in Kyrgyzstan, with discussions ongoing to keep it open. Funding was allocated for a hazardous cargo pad at the airbase in FY2009. Concerns arise about the declining democratization progress in Kyrgyzstan and whether the benefits of keeping the airbase open outweigh this. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $30.3 million for a parking ramp at the airbase in Kyrgyzstan. A parking ramp for strategic airlift is being built at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. Concerns were raised about the impact of possibly closing the Manas airbase on transportation and logistics risks. Representative Chet Edwards inquired about a new $30 million request for supplemental appropriations in late April 2009. Representative Chet Edwards questioned the need for a new $30 million request for air traffic control upgrades at the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan, considering the demand for its closure. Gen. David Petraeus mentioned that if the airbase were to close, investments in the control system would not be made. Discussions were encouraged to keep the airbase open and foster regional partnerships against extremism and illegal activities. The Obama Administration's FY2010 foreign assistance request includes $30 million for air traffic control upgrades at the Manas airbase and $21.52 million for drug interdiction in Kyrgyzstan. The aid for Kyrgyzstan is set to increase from $29.06 million in FY2009 to $48.23 million in FY2010, with a focus on stabilizing and reforming the economy. Foreign military financing is also set to increase from $800,000 in FY2009 to $2.9 million in FY2010."
