The National Immunization Improvement Act of 1993 aims to increase vaccination rates for children under 2 by addressing inadequate delivery systems and lack of public education on risks. It also seeks to assist states in monitoring and ensuring children receive recommended vaccinations. The National Immunization Improvement Act of 1993 aims to improve vaccination rates for children under 2 by enhancing delivery systems, increasing coordination among federal programs, and revising the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The National Immunization Improvement Act of 1993 aims to enhance vaccination rates for children under 2 through improved immunization efforts, including a voluntary state registry grant program. The Secretary will establish a grant program for States to develop computerized registries to collect immunization data for children. States must submit an application including a plan to provide necessary information to the registry. The Secretary will set data standards for the registries. State registries developed under this section are designed to collect and track immunization information for children from birth, including their complete immunization history, vaccine details, and healthcare provider information. State registries collect and track immunization information for children, including vaccine history, healthcare provider details, and data for monitoring vaccine safety and effectiveness. The Secretary provides technical assistance to States for registry development, and States must submit annual reports to the Secretary. The State shall annually report on the progress of operating a State registry to the Secretary. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1995, with additional funding for fiscal years 1995 through 1999. Improved immunization delivery, outreach, and education are addressed in Section 2132. The Secretary, in collaboration with State health officials and other organizations, will develop and distribute standard immunization educational materials for providers, including recommended vaccines and schedules for children. The Secretary, in collaboration with State health officials and other organizations, will develop and implement a National Immunization Public Awareness Campaign to assist parents in making informed decisions about vaccines. This includes recommended criteria for vaccine administration, determining when vaccines should not be given, screening children before immunization, providing informed consent materials, and any other relevant information deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary, in collaboration with State health officials and other organizations, will develop and implement a National Immunization Public Awareness Campaign to assist parents of children under 2 years old and expectant parents in understanding the importance of immunization. This includes identifying vaccines, schedules, and provider locations. Innovative methods will be used for public advertising. The Secretary, along with other government agencies, utilizes various media channels to disseminate immunization information to the public, targeting pregnant women and parents of children under 2. An Interagency Committee on Immunization is established to integrate immunization assessments into the application process for assistance programs like the food stamp program. The Secretary conducts immunization outreach activities, including research on alternative delivery systems and utilization of the National Health Service Corps. This includes assistance programs like the food stamp program, Child Nutrition Act, Head Start Act, Social Security Act, housing assistance laws, and other relevant programs. The Secretary utilizes the National Health Service Corps for immunization outreach in underserved areas and populations. Research is conducted on innovative methods to contact parents, refer them to providers, and follow up on children's immunization status. The Secretary may award grants to States for developing and implementing immunization action plans, including coordinating vaccine outreach with other programs and any other activities deemed appropriate. The State immunization action plan is designed to improve immunization delivery, outreach, education, and coordination within the State. It includes a vaccine provider education campaign to distribute standard immunization criteria and other materials to providers for better vaccination opportunities and to educate them on reporting obligations. The State immunization action plan aims to enhance immunization delivery by expanding vaccine availability through various methods, such as increasing facilities, utilizing mobile health clinics, and extending vaccine hours. The Secretary has the authority to waive certain requirements. The State immunization action plan includes population-based assessment criteria, a public awareness campaign for parents, coordination of outreach activities with other health programs, and the Secretary may waive requirements if State immunization efforts are deemed sufficient. The State immunization action plan must include immunization rate goals for children, which need approval from the Secretary before grant funds are distributed. The Secretary will review the State's progress in achieving these goals periodically. The State must annually report to the CDC on the implementation of the immunization action plan. Insufficient progress may result in a reduction of grant funds by the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1994-1999 totaling $200,000,000.
