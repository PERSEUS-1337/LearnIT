    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Bill Emerson English Language Empowerment Act of 1996\". It includes Title I - English Language Empowerment, with Section 101 outlining the findings. The Congress declares that the United States benefits from its diverse population, with a common language being crucial for unity. The Federal Government should maintain English as the common language to prevent division along linguistic lines and help immigrants assimilate for economic opportunities. By learning English, immigrants can become responsible citizens and productive workers in the United States. Using a single common language for official Federal Government business promotes efficiency and fairness. English should be recognized as the official language for Federal Government business, with any cost savings used for teaching English to non-English speaking immigrants. The text proposes English as the official language of the Federal Government to promote efficiency and fairness. The official language of the Federal Government is English, and representatives have an obligation to preserve and enhance its role. This includes encouraging individuals to learn English for official government activities. The Federal Government conducts official business in English, and no one can be denied services for communicating in English. Every person in the US has the right to communicate with the government, receive and provide information, and be informed in English. Violations can lead to civil action for appropriate relief. Sec. 165 of the document emphasizes the importance of fluency in English for full citizenship in the United States and requires all naturalization ceremonies to be conducted in English. Sec. 166 states that the provisions of this chapter supersede any existing Federal law that contradicts them. Sec. 167 clarifies that nothing in this chapter prohibits Members of Congress or Federal Government officials from using languages other than English for official business. Sec. 168 of the document affirms constitutional protections and states that nothing in the chapter contradicts the Constitution of the United States. Sec. 169 provides definitions, including that the term 'Federal Government' encompasses all branches of the national Government and all employees. The term 'Federal Government' includes all branches and employees of the national Government while conducting official business, which refers to enforceable governmental actions, documents, or policies. Exclusions from official business are teaching languages, requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, actions for national security or international relations, and documents protecting the public. The term 'United States' excludes actions or documents that protect public health and safety, facilitate Census activities, are unenforceable in the US, protect crime victims' rights, involve civil lawsuits initiated by the US, or use non-English terms. The table of chapters for title 4, United States Code, is amended by adding a new item. SEC. 201 repeals bilingual voting requirements under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, while SEC. 202 includes conforming amendments. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is amended to remove references to Section 203 and Section 4 in various sections. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is amended to remove references to Section 203 and Section 4 in various sections, specifically regarding denials or abridgements of the right to vote in contravention of certain guarantees.
