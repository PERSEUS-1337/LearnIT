    "title": "SB 1006",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Title 12.2 (Section 14230) is added to the Penal Code, establishing the California Firearm Violence Research Act to address the public health and safety issue of firearm violence in California and nationwide. Rates of fatal firearm violence have remained steady, with declines in homicide offset by increases in suicide. California has experienced infamous mass shootings, but public mass shootings make up less than 1% of firearm violence. In 2014, there were 2,939 firearm-related deaths in California, including suicides, homicides, deaths by legal intervention, and unintentional deaths. Communities with frequent firearm violence are significantly impacted in their daily lives. In 2012, the annual societal cost of firearm violence nationwide was estimated at $229 billion. California bears a significant portion of this burden, with government-sponsored insurance programs covering most of the costs of hospitalizations for firearm assaults and unintentional injuries. Despite California's efforts to address the crisis, rates of fatal firearm violence remain higher than desired. Research on firearm violence prevention is lacking due to insufficient funding and support, leading to a limited number of trained investigators available. Federal funding for research through the CDC has been drastically reduced since 1996, creating a gap that needs to be filled by other sources. In contrast, effective responses to other health and social problems have shown the benefits of expanded research efforts and policy reforms in the public's interest. The Legislature aims to establish a research center at the University of California focused on firearm-related violence. The center will conduct interdisciplinary research on the nature of firearm violence, its consequences, and prevention strategies at various levels. The research will provide evidence for effective firearm violence prevention policies, including addressing it as a form of terrorism. The research center at the University of California will focus on firearm violence prevention policies, including addressing it as a form of terrorism. The center will work with policymakers to implement innovative prevention programs and provide training opportunities for new researchers in the field. The Legislature intends to fund the Firearm Violence Research Center at the University of California through an appropriation. The center will also seek additional funding sources. It will administer a grants program for research on firearm violence, with funds awarded based on scientific merit through a peer review process similar to the National Institutes of Health. The Legislature intends for the University of California to provide programmatic and financial reports every five years regarding grants made, program accomplishments, and future directions. State agencies must provide necessary data to the Firearm Violence Research Center for research purposes. The Legislature requests the University of California to establish a Firearm Violence Research Center and provide research publications to the Legislature and data agencies. The Regents of the University of California will administer the center and grant program in accordance with the stated principles and goals."
