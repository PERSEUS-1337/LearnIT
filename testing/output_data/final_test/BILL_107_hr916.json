    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Stop Tax-Exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act\" and addresses the tax-exempt financing of professional sports facilities. The \"Stop Tax-Exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to include bonds used for professional sports facilities as private activity bonds if the proceeds exceed 5% or $5,000,000. These bonds are not considered qualified bonds. The term \"professional sports facilities\" refers to real property used for professional sports events, regardless of public admission or payment. Any use of these facilities that benefits a person involved in professional sports is considered a use of professional sports facilities. The Secretary will create regulations to prevent abuse and ensure the subsection's purposes are met. The effective date for the amendments is for bonds issued after the first date of committee action, with exceptions for specific uses like construction or approved projects. Bonds issued for construction or rehabilitation projects before September 30, 2001, are exempt from certain regulations. Bonds issued for construction or rehabilitation projects before September 30, 2001, are exempt from regulations if they meet specific criteria, including being the subject of official action taken by relevant government officials before that date. Bonds issued for construction or rehabilitation projects before September 30, 2001, are exempt from regulations if they meet specific criteria, including significant expenditures exceeding 10 percent of the anticipated cost. This exemption does not apply to bonds used solely for refunding qualified bonds. The refunding bond must meet certain criteria, including not exceeding the outstanding principal amount of the refunded bond, having an average maturity date not later than the bonds being refunded, and using the net proceeds to redeem the refunded bond within 90 days. Average maturity is determined according to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term \"qualified bond\" refers to a tax-exempt bond used to finance a professional sports facility, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, issued before the first date of committee action."
