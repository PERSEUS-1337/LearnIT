The \"Grand River Bands of Ottawa Indians of Michigan Referral Act\" defines key terms such as Bands, Tribe, date of recognition, Indian tribe, and Secretary. It also includes a section on the purpose of the Act. The purpose of the \"Grand River Bands of Ottawa Indians of Michigan Referral Act\" is to expedite the review of the Bands' petition for recognition as a Federal Indian tribe. This title aims to ensure a timely and just determination under the rules governing tribal recognition. The Secretary must review the Bands' petition and report to Congress by August 31, 2007, determining if the majority are descendants of signatories to specific treaties with the United States. The Bands' petition, reviewed by the Secretary, must determine if the majority are descendants of signatories to specific treaties with the United States, including the Ottawa and Chippewa nations of Indians in 1836 and the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan in 1855. The history of the Bands parallels that of Indian tribes descended from the treaty signatories. The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Bay Mills Band of Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians, and Little River Band of Ottawa Indians reside in the ancestral homeland in Michigan. The Bands filed for tribal government reorganization in 1935 under the Indian Reorganization Act. The Bands of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians in Michigan sought reorganization under the Indian Reorganization Act, but were denied due to lack of Federal appropriations. They maintained political and social existence through the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association, successfully pursuing a land claim. The Bands of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians in Michigan have had continuous dealings with government officials since 1836. They were included in the Michigan Indian Land Claims Settlement Act and needed to submit a petition by December 15, 2000, to qualify for land claim funds. The Secretary holds funds in trust for the Bands pending recognition. The Secretary is required to consult with elected leaders of the Bands, as well as anthropologists, ethno-historians, and genealogists associated with the Bands. The Secretary will consult with experts and attorneys of the Bands to determine if they meet the conditions. A positive or negative report will be submitted to Congress by August 31, 2007. If the report is not submitted by November 30, 2007, consequences will follow. The Secretary will recognize the Bands as an Indian tribe by November 30, 2007, and title II will apply to them. SEC. 103. ACTION BY CONGRESS. If Congress acts on the Secretary's report within 60 days, positive reports lead to recognition of Bands as an Indian tribe and application of title II, while negative reports return the Bands' petition for federal acknowledgment. If Congress fails to act within 60 days on the Secretary's report, positive reports lead to the recognition of the Bands as an Indian tribe and application of title II, while negative reports result in the return of the Bands' petition. The Bands' petition will be returned if Congress does not act within 60 days on the Secretary's report. The Bands will be granted an opportunity to prove their status as an Indian tribe. SEC. 201. The Secretary must recognize the Tribe by November 30, 2007, and publish notice in the Federal Register. SEC. 202. Membership.
