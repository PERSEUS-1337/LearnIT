The Act aims to address the crisis in identifying and treating mental illness in elderly patients by promoting integrated care models in primary settings and improving access to mental health services in the community. The Act aims to enhance access to mental health services for the elderly by implementing projects to integrate mental health services in primary care settings through demonstration projects specified in section 520K. The Secretary will provide grants for integrating mental health services for geriatric patients into primary care settings through evidence-based projects. Projects must include collaborative care within a primary care setting and involve mental health professionals with appropriate training.
