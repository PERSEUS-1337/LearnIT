    "content": "The Act is titled the \"First State National Historical Park Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The State of Delaware contains nationally significant resources related to the early settlement of the United States, including landmarks in Wilmington such as Fort Christina, constructed in 1638 by colonists led by Peter Minuet. Delaware was also the first state to ratify the Constitution on December 7, 1787. The historic sites in Delaware include the focal point of New Sweden, the first Swedish settlement in North America, Old Swedes Church, Fort Casimir constructed by the Dutch in 1651, the New Castle Historic District, and the Lewes Historic District in Lewes. The Lewes Historic District in Delaware, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was significant for early Dutch settlement and nationhood. It is the oldest town in Delaware and includes the Ryves Holt House, built in 1665, the oldest building in the state. In New Castle, Delaware, there are nationally significant resources related to English settlement and the birth of the United States. In New Castle, Delaware, there are historic landmarks such as the Old New Castle Courthouse, the home of John Dickinson, the Jacob Broom House, Lombardy Hall, and Stonum, associated with key figures in American history. Dover Green in Delaware, laid out in 1717, was where the state voted to ratify the Constitution, mustered a Continental Regiment during the Revolution, and celebrated the reading of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The State Archives in Dover contains records and documents that contribute to public knowledge and understanding. The Zwaanendael Museum in Lewes, Delaware commemorates the founding of the first European settlement in the State by the Dutch in 1631 and provides exhibits on the maritime, social, and military history of the area. It is fitting to establish the first unit of the National Park System in Delaware to recognize these resources and their contributions to US history. The purpose of the Act is to establish the First State National Historical Park in Delaware to preserve cultural and historic resources related to early Dutch, Swedish, and English settlement, as well as events, places, and people associated with Delaware as the \"First State.\" SEC. 3.
