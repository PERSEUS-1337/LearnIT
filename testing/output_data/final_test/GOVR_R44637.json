    "content": "Congress appropriates foreign affairs funding primarily through annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations. Prior to FY2008, Congress provided funds for the Department of State and international broadcasting within the Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations (CJS) and separately provided foreign aid funds within Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs appropriations. The transition between the different alignments occurred in the 109th Congress, with a change in appropriations subcommittee jurisdiction. For that Congress, the House of Representatives appropriated State Department funds separately from foreign aid, but the Senate combined State and foreign aid funds in one bill\u2014the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations. The House and Senate jointly fund Department of State and foreign aid appropriations within the SFOPS appropriations. SFOPS appropriations include State Department Operations, Foreign Operations, various international commissions, and International Broadcasting. Foreign Operations funding is typically about twice as much as State Operations funding. Since FY2012, Congress has approved emergency supplemental funding for State Department and USAID war-related expenses, in addition to regular SFOPS appropriations. Foreign affairs appropriations in the past 25 years were mostly passed within omnibus or consolidated resolutions after the start of the fiscal year. Stand-alone appropriations legislation could improve debate on foreign policy activities and funding for new initiatives. Experts argue that the practice of passing continuing resolutions and delaying appropriations has hindered program planning and funding for new initiatives in foreign affairs. Before 2003, Congress authorized State and foreign operations funding in a biannual bill, allowing for more rigorous debate on foreign policy and aid policies. Since FY1995, Congress has struggled to pass foreign affairs funding on time, resorting to including it in omnibus bills or continuing resolutions 21 out of the past 25 years. The last freestanding State Department and foreign operations appropriations bills were enacted in FY2006. Since FY1995, Congress has faced challenges passing foreign affairs funding on time, often resorting to omnibus bills or continuing resolutions. State Department and foreign operations appropriations bills have been sent to the President six times in the past 25 years, typically in March, April, or May. The SFOPS appropriations measures since FY2008 include State Department Operations, Foreign Operations, international commissions, and International Broadcasting. Funding for State-Foreign Operations has generally increased since FY2001, with a notable spike in FY2004 due to supplemental funding for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The rise in foreign affairs funding levels from FY2004-FY2009 can be attributed to supplemental funding for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). OCO funding became regular starting FY2012, with additional funding for Ebola in FY2015, Zika in FY2016, and OCO in FY2017. Despite a general increase in constant dollars, funding levels off after FY2012. The Budget Control Act of 2011 has kept foreign affairs funding below inflation levels from FY2013 to FY2020. The Administration categorizes funds as enduring, emergency supplemental, or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Emergency or OCO funds are not subject to spending limits set by the Budget Control Act. Prior to FY2012, additional funding requests were submitted as emergency supplementals for war-related or off-cycle budget needs. The Obama Administration requested emergency supplemental appropriations for international crises like Ebola, Zika virus, and famine relief. Trump Administration did not request funding for unexpected crises. In FY2012, Obama Administration included war-related funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. Congress appropriated OCO funds for State Department and USAID activities beyond the requested level. In FY2012, Congress included OCO funds for State Department and USAID activities in frontline states and other countries like Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, and the Philippines. The Obama Administration requested OCO funds for Syria in FY2015. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested OCO funds for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and \"High Threat/High Risk\" areas including Syria, Yemen, Nigeria, Somalia, and South Sudan. Initially requested for FY2019, OCO funds were later moved to enduring funds after the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Trump Administration requested no OCO funds for foreign affairs agencies in FY2020, following a trend of fluctuating OCO funding levels since FY2012. The Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2015 and 2018 have influenced OCO funding decisions, with Congress appropriating $8.0 billion in FY2019 despite the Administration not requesting OCO funds. The FY2020 budget request also excludes OCO funds for State-Foreign Operations appropriations. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and Bipartisan Budget Acts have impacted foreign affairs funding levels. The BCA sets limits on discretionary spending through FY2021, leading to a shift of funds from enduring/base accounts to OCO-designated accounts. The 2015 BBA increased OCO funding for foreign affairs, while the 2018 BBA allowed lawmakers to shift OCO funds back into enduring/base accounts."
