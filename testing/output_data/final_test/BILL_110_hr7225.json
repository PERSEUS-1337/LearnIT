The Congress finds that parents have limited time to volunteer at schools, with a primary responsibility to their children's health and safety. A significant number of adolescents in the US use illicit drugs, and smoking cigarettes can lead to alcohol and drug use. Adolescent deaths are often linked to accidents, homicides, and suicides related to alcohol and drug use. The Office of National Drug Control Policy emphasizes the importance of early intervention by friends, parents, or loved ones to help teens stop drug use. The White House introduced the Parents Corps initiative in 9 States to empower parents in keeping their children, schools, and communities drug-free. The National Parents Corps Program is introduced as part of the White House's initiative to empower parents in keeping their children, schools, and communities drug-free. The Administrator will award a grant to an eligible nonprofit entity to establish the National Parents Corps Program (NPCP) to promote safety, combat youth violence, and drug and alcohol abuse in schools. The NPCP Nonprofit Partner will employ Parent Leaders at selected schools to carry out the Program activities. The National Parents Corps Program (NPCP) aims to promote safety, combat youth violence, and address drug, alcohol, and tobacco abuse in schools by collaborating with schools, parents, nonprofit organizations, and law enforcement agencies. The National Parents Corps Program (NPCP) collaborates with schools to promote safety, combat youth violence, and address substance abuse. SEC. 4 focuses on the participation of schools. The NPCP Nonprofit Partner solicits applications from eligible schools to host a Parent Leader for the Program, addressing cultural, social, and crime prevention needs of students. The NPCP Nonprofit Partner selects eligible schools to host Parent Leaders based on geographical diversity, including urban, rural, and suburban areas, as well as ethnically and economically diverse communities. SEC. 5. PARENT LEADERS. Parent Leaders are hired by the NPCP Nonprofit Partner for eligible schools in the Program to combat criminal and gang activity, prevent substance abuse, and mobilize parents. They are trained, supervised, and supported using grant funds provided under the Act. The Parent Leaders program aims to combat criminal and gang activity, prevent substance abuse, and mobilize parents at eligible schools. They provide information on early recognition of behaviors leading to drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, and assist in developing programs to treat and prevent addiction among students. They also help parents find professional assistance for children using drugs. The Parent Leaders program aims to combat criminal and gang activity, prevent substance abuse, and mobilize parents at eligible schools. They recruit and train volunteers for drug and violence prevention programs, consult with various stakeholders to develop best practices, and require parent leaders to be eligible parents. To qualify as a Parent Leader, individuals must be a parent of a student at the school, not employed full-time elsewhere, pass background checks, and enter into an agreement with the NPCP Nonprofit Partner. The agreement with the NPCP Nonprofit Partner requires the Parent Leader to serve for the same number of years as it takes for a student to complete all grade levels at the school, with exceptions for extreme circumstances. If a Parent Leader is unable to complete their term, the NPCP Nonprofit Partner will consult with the host school to fill the vacancy promptly. The NPCP Nonprofit Partner requires the Parent Leader to serve for the same number of years as a student's grade levels at the school. If a Parent Leader is unable to complete their term, the host school must promptly hire a replacement. SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. Parent Leaders must submit quarterly reports detailing their activities, results, best practices, and any other relevant information to the NPCP Nonprofit Partner and the school. The NPCP Nonprofit Partner is required to submit reports to the Administrator every six months on the Program's progress and effectiveness, including statistical analysis. The Program's effectiveness in preventing school violence and substance abuse by students is analyzed through statistics, trends, and data. Parent Leaders submit reports summarizing their activities and best practices at each school. The Administrator must submit annual reports to the Attorney General and Congressional committees on the Program's progress and effectiveness. The Congress believes that schools hosting a Parent Leader should secure funding to continue the Program after Federal funding ends. Definitions are provided in Section 8. The Act defines \"Administrator\" as the head of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and \"eligible nonprofit entity\" as a qualified organization with experience in administering federal grants and programs related to addiction and parenting. The Act defines \"eligible school\" as a public middle or secondary school committed to increasing parental involvement and reducing drug abuse among students. The school must have a focus on child and youth drug prevention. The term \"appropriate Congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $5,500,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2009-2019. Funding can also come from State, local, and private sources for Program expenses."
