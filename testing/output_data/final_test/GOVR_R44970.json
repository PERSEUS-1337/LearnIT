    "content": "The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) aims to reduce health workforce shortages in underserved areas through federal scholarships, federal loan repayment, and state-operated loan repayment programs. Participants commit to serving at NHSC-approved facilities in designated shortage areas. NHSC facilities are typically nonprofit or government-operated organizations providing care regardless of ability to pay. The programs are managed by the Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW). The NHSC, managed by the BHW in the HRSA, was created in 1970 to address health provider shortages in HPSAs. It has been reauthorized multiple times, with the latest reauthorization in the ACA. The ACA made funding for the NHSC permanent and introduced a part-time service option. This report outlines the NHSC's funding, supported providers, and service locations. The NHSC, managed by the BHW in the HRSA, consists of three programs: federal scholarships, federal loan repayment, and state-operated loan repayment. The federal scholarship program offers scholarships in exchange for a service commitment, while the loan repayment programs provide clinicians with loan repayment for an immediate service commitment. HRSA administers the federal programs and provides funds to states, which match these funds for state loan repayment programs. The federal loan repayment program is the largest, followed by the state program and the scholarship program. The NHSC consists of three programs: federal scholarships, federal loan repayment, and state-operated loan repayment. All programs require a minimum service commitment of two years in a HPSA and are restricted to U.S. citizens or nationals. They provide awards exempt from federal taxes and allow various healthcare providers to participate. The NHSC Scholarship Program offers scholarships for full-time education in accredited U.S. schools. NHSC Scholarship Program offers scholarships for full-time education in specified programs at accredited U.S. schools. Recipients must commit to completing their training in primary care and provide additional years of service in a HPSA for each year of scholarship support received. The maximum required years of full-time service at an approved facility is four years. The NHSC Scholarship Program requires recipients to complete full-time education in primary care and provide additional years of service in a HPSA for each year of scholarship support received. Participants must have obtained a professional license before beginning their service commitment and fulfill their service commitment on a full-time basis in a HPSA of \"greatest need.\" Each year HRSA determines the HPSA score indicative of \"greatest need.\" The NHSC Federal Loan Repayment Program allows part-time service in areas with lower HPSA scores for scholars. Scholars can apply for continuation awards if they still have educational debt and are willing to continue service at an NHSC-approved facility. Dental hygienists and behavioral/mental health providers are also eligible for loan repayment. Recipients must have a needed license, be employed at an NHSC-approved site, and have qualifying educational debt. The NHSC Federal Loan Repayment Program offers loan repayment for government and private student loans obtained for education expenses. Repayors have a service commitment of two years and can receive up to $50,000 for full-time service at sites with a HPSA score of 14 or above, or up to $30,000 for sites with a score of 13 or lower. Continuation awards are available for those with remaining educational debt after the initial commitment. The Students to Service (S2S) Loan Repayment Program offers up to $120,000 to medical students in their final year of school. Recipients must complete a primary care residency and serve in a HPSA for at least three years full-time or six years half-time. Repayors can also do a one-year geriatrics fellowship before their service commitment. In 2016, HRSA introduced a new loan repayment program funded by the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act. The new loan repayment program funded by the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act offers up to $70,000 in loan repayment in exchange for a three-year service commitment at NHSC approved sites in Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories affected by Zika. Health professionals eligible for the federal loan repayment program are also eligible for this program, including licensed professionals in medical specialties and allied health fields who can provide Zika-related care. The state loan repayment program is authorized in PHSA Section 338I and is a matching grant between the state and the NHSC. States may choose to expand or contract the types of clinicians eligible to participate and may require more than two years of service in exchange for loan repayment. States have the option to expand the types of professionals eligible for their loan repayment programs, such as registered nurses and pharmacists. Participants must serve a minimum of two years in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) and states determine the approved service sites. The NHSC's funding level determines the number of awards available. The NHSC's funding is now provided by the mandatory Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) instead of HRSA's discretionary appropriation. The CHCF was created by the ACA and initially funded the NHSC from FY2012 to FY2017. It was extended for two years in FY2016 and FY2017. At the start of FY2018, no mandatory funds were appropriated for the NHSC, but a temporary extension provided funding for the first two quarters of FY2018. The NHSC's funding is now provided by the mandatory Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) instead of HRSA's discretionary appropriation. The CHCF initially funded the NHSC from FY2012 to FY2017 and was extended for two years in FY2016 and FY2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 later provided full-year funding for FY2018 and FY2019. Funding for the program between FY2011 and FY2019 is presented in Table 1, with funds directed towards supporting health care providers for opioid and substance use disorder treatment in HPSAs. The NHSC program's funding is now provided by the mandatory Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) instead of HRSA's discretionary appropriation. The program size is measured in three ways: funding, recruitment, and field strength. Recruitment is generally smaller than field strength, which includes loan repayors and individuals fulfilling service commitments. The NHSC offered over 39,000 loan repayment agreements and scholarships from FY2011 to FY2017 for individuals serving in HPSAs. Funding increased in FY2011 with the ACA's CHCF, leading to more awards. Recruitment varied, with an increase in FY2016 and similar numbers in FY2017 compared to FY2015. Table 2 shows NHSC clinician recruitment activity by award type during this period. Not all awardees are currently serving as NHSC providers. In FY2017, NHSC field strength was 10,179 with 8,256 total providers as of April 2018. Majority were loan repayors, reflecting NHSC's focus on immediate service commitment fulfillment. The NHSC prioritizes clinicians for immediate service in HPSAs, while HRSA awards scholarships in advance. Despite increased field strength, there are more open NHSC positions than providers available. The NHSC has a diverse set of health professionals, with a shift towards behavioral/mental health providers over physicians and nurse practitioners. In FY2017, health providers, including mental and behavioral health providers, nurse practitioners, and physicians, made up 73% of the NHSC workforce. Legislation has been proposed to include chiropractors and physical therapists in federal scholarship and loan repayment programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 expanded eligibility for the NHSC loan repayment program to substance use disorder counselors and increased funding to support substance use disorder providers, addressing concerns about competition for awards. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 expanded NHSC eligibility to substance use disorder counselors and increased funding for providers. NHSC awards are competitive, based on participant commitment to primary care and likelihood of staying in shortage areas. The HHS Secretary can add disciplines without new laws, as seen in exchanges with Congress. In 2012, the Senate Appropriations Committee urged the Secretary to include pharmacists and chiropractors in the NHSC for loan repayments. However, in 2013, the Secretary declined, citing that these services were outside the core intent of providing \"primary health services.\" Despite being part of primary care teams, pharmacists remain ineligible for loan repayment under the NHSC. Similar discussions have taken place with the House Appropriations Committee. HHS has not agreed to expand NHSC eligibility to optometrists and chiropractors due to concerns about shifting focus from primary care for underserved populations. Adding new providers may redirect funds from identified shortage areas and limit the number of individuals served. Congress has clarified eligible providers in the past, such as through the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016. The 21st Century Cures Act clarified that child and adolescent psychiatrists are eligible for the federal loan repayment program, but did not expand the list of NHSC providers. NHSC providers can serve at various facility types, including community mental health centers and correctional facilities, located in HPSAs. Eligible sites also include critical access hospitals and facilities funded by the Indian Health Service. NHSC providers can serve at correctional facilities, critical access hospitals, Indian Health Service-funded facilities, federal health centers, free clinics, rural health clinics, and school-based health centers. Sites must be part of a care system, have sound fiscal management, accept Medicare/Medicaid/CHIP beneficiaries, offer sliding scale discounts, and have community support. NHSC providers often serve at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and Indian Health Service-funded facilities. As of August 2017, 492 providers were fulfilling their service commitment at IHS-funded facilities. Some providers may also serve at critical access hospitals (CAHs) part-time. NHSC providers split their time between inpatient and outpatient services at critical access hospitals (CAHs) in rural areas. Legislative efforts aim to expand eligible provider sites to include facilities for opioid addiction treatment. The NHSC provides outpatient and inpatient services, including medication-assisted treatment. Proposals to expand eligible sites may face challenges due to the program's field strength limitations. Data shows that less than half of NHSC providers remain at their service site after fulfilling their commitment, but nearly 80% practice in a HPSA one year later."
