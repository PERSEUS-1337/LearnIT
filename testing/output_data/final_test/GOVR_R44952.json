Recent incidents like the 2017 fire at the Arkema plant in TX and the 2013 explosion at the West Fertilizer Company have spurred government efforts to reduce chemical accidents. Federal agencies have programs in place to prevent accidents, protect workers, and share information with the public. This report examines the EPA's authorities on risk management, emergency planning, and release notification at chemical facilities, including requirements under the Clean Air Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. State, local, and tribal authorities also play a crucial role in managing risks from chemical facility accidents through zoning, siting, and emergency response planning. The report focuses on EPA's authorities on risk management, emergency planning, and release notification at chemical facilities, including requirements under EPCRA, CERCLA, CAA, and toxic release inventory reporting. It does not cover other federal agencies' safety, planning, and notification requirements. In the CAA Amendments of 1990, Congress enacted the General Duty Clause (GDC) under Section 112(r)(1) for facilities with extremely hazardous substances. The GDC requires owners and operators to prevent and mitigate chemical accidents. Section 112(r)(7) authorizes EPA to establish risk management planning requirements for facilities managing certain toxic or flammable substances. EPA must develop regulations and guidance for Risk Management Plans (RMPs) to prevent chemical accidents. Facility owners and operators must develop Risk Management Plans (RMPs) to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances into the air. Plans should include measures to respond to such releases, as defined by Section 112(r)(2)(A) as unanticipated emissions. RMPs must assess potential hazards, implement prevention measures, and establish response protocols. Facility owners and operators must prepare and implement Risk Management Plans (RMPs) to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances. RMPs must be submitted to EPA, the Chemical Safety Board, and emergency response officials, with limited public availability for security reasons. Non-compliance with RMP requirements is unlawful. Section 112(r)(7)(H) limits public access to off-site consequence analysis in Risk Management Plans (RMPs) for security reasons. RMPs must be revised and resubmitted to EPA every five years. EPA may require facilities to update RMPs to ensure compliance with federal regulations. Some states have additional RMP requirements for listed chemicals. EPA revised RMP requirements under Executive Order 13650 in response to chemical facility incidents, including the West, TX fertilizer plant explosion in 2013. EPA delegated RMP oversight to states and localities. The incident in 2013 in West, TX was a catalyst for Executive Order 13650, leading to revisions in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements. These revisions include safer technology analysis, third-party audits, emergency preparedness enhancements, and increased public access to chemical hazard information. The EPA Administrator under the Trump Administration delayed the effective date of the RMP rule amendments until February 19, 2019. The EPA delayed the effective date of Risk Management Program Amendments to consider petitions for reconsideration and potential regulatory actions. Stakeholders cited reasons such as lack of notice for comments, safety concerns, cost burdens, and insufficient coordination with OSHA and stakeholders. EPCRA, enacted in 1986, requires facilities to report hazardous chemicals. EPCRA, enacted in 1986 (P.L. 99-499), requires facilities to report hazardous chemicals or extremely hazardous substances to state and local emergency response officials. This information helps officials develop emergency response plans. EPCRA applies to a broader range of chemicals than RMP requirements under the CAA. Section 311 of EPCRA covers hazardous chemicals requiring a material safety data sheet under the OSH Act, including substances commonly found in workplaces. EPCRA requires reporting of hazardous chemicals in workplace settings based on federal regulations. Section 312 mandates reporting for facilities storing over 10,000 pounds of hazardous chemicals to SERC, LEPC, and local fire department. Tier I reporting involves reporting this information independently. EPCRA requires reporting of hazardous chemicals in workplace settings. Reporting thresholds vary based on the presence of hazardous chemicals and their designation as extremely hazardous substances. EPA determines reporting thresholds taking into account various factors like toxicity and flammability. EPCRA requires reporting of hazardous chemicals based on their dispersability, combustability, or flammability. Facilities storing extremely hazardous substances must report to SERC and LEPC, designate a representative for LEPC, and disclose information to the public, with exceptions for confidential business information. For security reasons, facility owners may choose not to disclose the exact location of chemicals. Reporting requirements for hazardous substance releases are outlined in EPCRA and CERCLA. EPCRA mandates reporting to SERC and LEPC to inform local officials, while CERCLA requires reporting to the National Response Center for federal involvement. CERCLA also establishes liability for response costs and damages. The reporting of hazardous substance releases under EPCRA and CERCLA depends on the quantity of the release. CERCLA Section 103 requires notification to the National Response Center for releases exceeding specified thresholds. EPA designates hazardous substances and reporting thresholds. Some releases may not require reporting under CERCLA, even if they exceed the threshold. CERCLA exempts federally permitted releases of hazardous substances from reporting requirements and liability under the statute. This exemption is based on the premise that permit requirements address potential risks and avoid conflicts between federal laws. EPCRA Section 304 requires reporting of releases of extremely hazardous substances into the environment. The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) investigates and reports on accidental releases causing fatalities, injuries, or property damage. EPCRA requires reporting of releases of extremely hazardous substances, while CERCLA exempts federally permitted releases from reporting requirements and liability. The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) investigates accidental releases causing fatalities, injuries, or property damage. CSB recommends measures to reduce future accidents but cannot enforce compliance. Other agencies like EPA and OSHA may develop enforceable requirements based on CSB recommendations. EPA also maintains a Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) for certain facilities. The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) identifies facilities that handle toxic chemicals but does not track environmental risks or violations. Facilities must report quantities of toxic chemicals to the EPA and state officials annually. The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) requires facilities to report quantities of toxic chemicals to the EPA and state officials annually. Section 313 of federal regulations outlines reporting requirements based on chemical toxicity and potential health impacts. Reporting thresholds are set at 10,000 pounds for chemicals used and 25,000 pounds for chemicals manufactured, imported, or processed at a facility in a calendar year."
