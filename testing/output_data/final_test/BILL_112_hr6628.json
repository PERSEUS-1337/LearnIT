    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry Act of 2012\" or the \"SAFER Act of 2012\". It includes provisions for Debbie Smith grants to address sexual assault evidence backlogs. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 is amended to include provisions for conducting audits on sexual assault evidence samples awaiting testing. Grant awards for audits will receive 5-10% of the grant amounts distributed for fiscal years 2014-2018. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 is amended to allow grants for auditing sexual assault evidence backlogs. The Attorney General may award grants to States or local governments for this purpose if they submit a plan including an estimate of the number of samples to be audited. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 allows grants for auditing sexual assault evidence backlogs. States or local governments receiving a grant must complete the audit within 1 year and cannot contract with non-governmental labs for this purpose. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 allows for auditing sexual assault evidence backlogs. Within 21 days of receiving possession of new evidence, it must be entered into the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 requires timely updates on the status of samples in the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry by the chief law enforcement officer of the State or unit of local government. The Attorney General may grant an extension of the deadline for compliance with the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 to a State or unit of local government if more time is needed. The designee of the chief law enforcement officer can fulfill registry requirements as long as they are an employee of the State or unit of local government, not a governmental or non-governmental laboratory employee. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 allows for extensions if more time is needed for compliance. Certain samples of sexual assault evidence are exempt from registry requirements under specific conditions. The term 'testing' refers to the collection of sexual assault evidence by a State or local government, where DNA and forensic analyses have not been conducted, and the sample is related to an unresolved criminal case. 'Final disposition' in this context means the conviction or acquittal in a criminal case linked to sexual assault evidence. The term 'possession' in the context of sexual assault evidence refers to the State or local government holding the sample, including possession by an individual acting as an agent. This possession can be terminated if the case is deemed unfounded, the victim declares the act did not occur, or all suspected perpetrators are convicted or acquitted. The term 'possession' in sexual assault evidence refers to the State or local government holding the sample through an agent. This does not create Federal rights for non-governmental vendor laboratories. SEC. 3. SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EVIDENCE REGISTRY. The Attorney General shall establish a Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry for storing information about sexual assault evidence awaiting testing. The Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry stores information about sexual assault evidence, including the date of the assault, location, sample collection date, and entry date into the Registry. The sample of untested sexual assault evidence was entered into the Registry, including details about possession, identification, and submission by the State or local government. The State or local government submits untested sexual assault evidence to a lab for analysis or decides not to submit it. The completion of analysis or decision to indefinitely refrain from analyzing the evidence is also noted. Dates for when the analysis or refraining from analysis would occur are specified. The Registry for sexual assault evidence prohibits prosecution after statute of limitations. It does not include identifiable information. States assign unique numbers to samples entered into the Registry. The Registry for sexual assault evidence requires a unique numeric or alphanumeric identifier for each sample entered. States must update the status of the sample within 30 days of any changes. The Attorney General provides internet access to the Registry. The Attorney General provides internet access for the Registry and offers technical assistance for entities without internet access to enter information. States and local governments can compare backlog data on an online platform. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 is amended to allow States or local governments to participate in the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry if they accept a grant or agree to the conditions. Funding for the Act is extended until 2018 and includes provisions for carrying out the registry. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 is amended to allocate at least 1 percent of the authorized funds for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for carrying out subsection (o). SEC. 4. REPORTS TO CONGRESS. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress within 90 days after each fiscal year detailing states and local governments awarded grants under the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act. The report must also include the number of extensions granted and the processing status of sexual assault evidence samples in the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry. The Attorney General is required to report to Congress on grants awarded under the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act, including the number of untested samples. SEC. 5. REDUCING THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 is amended to ensure that not less than 75 percent of total grant amounts for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 are awarded for various specified purposes."
