    "content": "The process of nominating lower federal court judges by the President and confirming them by the Senate has been a topic of interest in recent Senate debates. Different perspectives have been expressed on the success of a President's nominees compared to nominees of other Presidents. Concerns have been raised about the delays or rush in filling judicial vacancies. This report analyzes various aspects of the judicial nomination and confirmation process during President's tenure. The report analyzes the judicial nomination and confirmation process during President Donald Trump's first year in office, as well as his three immediate predecessors. Statistics are based on an internal CRS database and focus on nominations to U.S. circuit and district court judgeships. The Constitution grants life tenure to Supreme Court Justices and lower court judges established by Congress under Article III. The U.S. circuit courts of appeals and district courts, along with the Supreme Court, have judges with life tenure under Article III. This report focuses on nominations to these courts by President Trump and previous Presidents. Appeals from district court decisions go to the courts of appeals, which also review administrative agency decisions. Judges in the courts of appeals typically sit in three-member panels. The U.S. circuit courts of appeals, also known as \"circuit courts,\" have judges with life tenure under Article III. There are 13 courts of appeals divided into 12 geographic circuits, with an additional nationwide circuit for specialized subject matter jurisdiction. Altogether, there are 179 judgeships authorized for these courts. The First Circuit has the fewest judgeships with 6, while the Ninth Circuit has the most with 29. U.S. district courts are federal trial courts of general jurisdiction, with 91 Article III district courts in total. There are 91 Article III district courts in the U.S., with each state having at least one district court. Some states have as many as four district courts. Currently, there are 673 authorized U.S. district court judgeships. The number of judgeships authorized for each district court ranges from 1 to 28. Vacancies in judgeships provide opportunities for Presidents to make appointments. Factors influencing the number of judicial vacancies a President inherits include the frequency of judicial departures, new judgeships created before a new presidency, outgoing President's nominations, and Senate confirmation rates. Table 1 shows the vacancies at the start of a presidency. The number of U.S. circuit court vacancies decreased by 1, from 17 to 16, during the first year of the Trump presidency. The percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships was 9.5% at the beginning of his first year and 8.9% at the beginning of his second year. Meanwhile, the number of U.S. district court vacancies increased by 38, from 86 to 124, during the same period. The percentage of vacant district court judgeships was 12.8% at the start of his first year and 18.4% at the start of his second year. During President Trump's first year in office, U.S. circuit court vacancies decreased by 5.9% from 17 to 16. The largest increase in circuit court vacancies occurred during the Obama presidency. U.S. district court vacancies increased by 44.2% from 86 to 124 during Trump's first year. During the Obama presidency, there was a significant increase in district court vacancies from the first to the second year, with a 102.5% rise from 40 to 81. This was higher compared to the increases during the George W. Bush and Clinton presidencies. Long-lasting judicial vacancies, defined as those that became vacant during a prior presidency, continued to exist at the beginning of each president's second year in office. During the Obama presidency, there was a significant increase in district court vacancies from the first to the second year. Vacancies that became vacant during a prior presidency continued to exist at the beginning of each president's second year in office. During the Clinton presidency, 22 judgeships were vacant for an average of 741 days. In the Obama presidency, 79 judgeships were vacant for an average of 612 days. In the George W. Bush presidency, 32 judgeships were vacant for an average of 410 days. And during the Clinton presidency, 38 judgeships were vacant. During President Trump's first year in office, he nominated 19 individuals to U.S. circuit court judgeships, with 12 (63%) being confirmed. This was a higher number and percentage of confirmations compared to his immediate predecessors - Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton. The number and percentage of individuals confirmed as U.S. circuit court judges in 2017 were higher than those confirmed during the first year of the previous three presidencies. The range of confirmations in those years was from 3 to 6 individuals, with percentages ranging from 21% to 60%. President Trump had the most circuit court nominees confirmed in his first year compared to his predecessors. During President Trump's first year in office, the highest number of circuit court judges were confirmed since 1945. The percentage of nominees confirmed in 2017 was also the highest since 1981. Additionally, 6 out of 49 individuals nominated for U.S. district court judgeships were confirmed during his first year, with lower numbers compared to previous presidencies. During President Trump's first year in office, the number of U.S. district court judges confirmed was the lowest since 1945, with only six nominees confirmed, representing 12% of the total nominees. During President Trump's first year in office, only 6 out of his district court nominees were confirmed by the Senate, the lowest number since 1945. This is the second instance since 1945 of a President having fewer than half of his first-year district court nominees confirmed. During President Trump's first year in office, only 6 out of his district court nominees were confirmed by the Senate, the lowest number since 1945. The demographic diversity of individuals nominated to U.S. circuit and district court judgeships during a President's first year in office has varied across recent presidencies. Figure 1 provides the breakdown in the number and percentage of men and women appointed to U.S. circuit court judgeships during a President's first year in office. Of individuals nominated during President Trump's first year in office, 79% were men and 21% were women.

He had the greatest percentage and number of Asian American individuals among his first-year nominees. President Trump also had the smallest percentage of non-white nominees, with only Asian Americans nominated. President Clinton had fewer non-white nominees but also nominated fewer individuals overall. President Obama had the highest percentage and number of non-white nominees among the four Presidents.

Since 1953, most presidential administrations have sought ABA pre-nomination evaluations for U.S. circuit and district court nominees. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary evaluates nominees based on professional qualifications like integrity, competence, and judicial temperament, without considering political affiliation or ideology. Some have disputed this evaluation process. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary evaluates judicial nominees based on integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament. The committee considers factors such as character, reputation, intellectual capacity, judgment, and compassion. Post-nomination evaluations are provided for U.S. circuit and district court judgeships, with candidates rated as \"well qualified\" at the conclusion of the process. The ABA committee rates judicial nominees as \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified\" based on integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament. If a nominee is found \"not qualified,\" it means they do not meet the committee's standards in one or more areas. The committee's official rating is determined by the majority, and statistics show the breakdown of ratings for nominees in each President's first year in office. The ABA rates judicial nominees as \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified\" based on various criteria. The President has discretion on how much weight to give to these ratings. President Trump's circuit court nominees had mostly \"well qualified\" ratings, with a small percentage rated as \"qualified\" or \"not qualified.\" President Trump's circuit court nominees had mostly \"well qualified\" ratings, with a small percentage rated as \"qualified\" or \"not qualified.\" Among the four Presidents examined, President Trump had the second greatest number of nominees rated as well qualified, with President George W. Bush having the most nominees rated as well qualified. The ABA rates judicial nominees as \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified\" based on various criteria. President Trump's U.S. district court nominees had varying ratings from the ABA, with 53% rated as well qualified, 41% as qualified, and 6% as not qualified. This was the lowest percentage of well qualified nominees among the four Presidents examined. President Obama had the highest percentage of well qualified nominees at 86%. Overall, a majority of district court nominees from all Presidents received a rating of \"well qualified.\" President Trump had the highest number of district court nominations in his first year, with the second highest number of nominees rated as well qualified. He also had the highest percentage and number of first-year nominees rated as not qualified. President Clinton had the second highest number of nominations and the highest number of well qualified nominees. President Trump had at least one circuit court nominee and one district court nominee rated as not qualified during his first year in office. The average number of days from nomination to confirmation for his nominees was 115 days, with a median of 109 days, the second longest among the four Presidents compared. President Trump's first-year nominees had shorter average and median wait times for confirmation compared to President Obama's nominees. This decline was partly due to nominees spending less time on the Executive Calendar before confirmation. During President Trump's first year in office, his nominees had shorter average and median wait times for confirmation compared to President Obama's nominees. Table 4 shows the number of U.S. circuit and district court nominees confirmed during Trump's first year, with varying wait times from nomination to confirmation. During President Trump's first year in office, his nominees had shorter average and median wait times for confirmation compared to President Obama's nominees. Trump's circuit court nominees were confirmed within 100 days, with James C. Ho and Amul R. Thapar having the shortest wait times since 1993. District court nominees had varying wait times, with some waiting less than 100 days and others waiting up to 200 days. President Trump's nominees had quicker confirmation processes compared to previous Presidents. During President Trump's first year in office, his nominees had shorter average and median wait times for confirmation compared to President Obama's nominees. Trump's district court nominees had varying wait times, with some waiting less than 100 days and others waiting up to 200 days. President Trump was the only President to have at least one-third of his district court nominees wait 150 or more days for confirmation. The confirmation process for Trump's nominees often involved the cloture process and roll call votes. The Senate confirmation process for U.S. circuit or district court nominations can proceed through unanimous consent agreements or cloture motions to end floor debate. While most nominations historically have been confirmed through unanimous consent, at times, cloture motions are required when unanimous consent is not attainable. During the first year of the Trump presidency, cloture motions were the primary method for reaching confirmation votes on U.S. circuit and district court nominations. This contrasts with previous presidencies where cloture was rarely used for such nominations. During the Obama presidency, cloture motions were used 85 times over 13 months to reach confirmation votes on U.S. circuit and district court nominations, becoming the primary procedural tool for these nominations until the last day of the 113th Congress. During the Obama presidency, cloture motions were used 85 times over 13 months to reach confirmation votes for circuit and district court nominations. The Senate may confirm nominations by unanimous consent, voice vote, or by recorded roll call vote. Roll call votes have become more common for confirmations, especially during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. During the Trump presidency, all first-year circuit and district court nominees were confirmed by roll call vote, unlike Obama and George W. Bush presidencies where some nominees were confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent. During the Clinton presidency, district court nominees were confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent, but since the mid-1990s, roll call votes have become more common for U.S. circuit and district court nominees. This shift may be due to the contentious confirmation process, with Senators using roll call votes to slow down the process or express concerns about judicial appointments. During President Trump's first year in office, U.S. circuit court nominees faced significant opposition, with 11 out of 12 nominations receiving more than 20 nay votes at the time of confirmation. The average number of nay votes for these nominees was 43. This trend of opposition through roll call votes reflects Senators' efforts to express concerns and influence the appointment process. During President Trump's first year in office, two out of six district court nominees were confirmed without any nay votes, while the other four received at least one nay vote. Among the 22 district court nominees confirmed by roll call vote in the first years of the Trump, Obama, and Bush presidencies, Scott L. Palk and Trevor N. McFadden were the only two who received nay votes at the time of confirmation. President Clinton's first-year district court nominees were not confirmed by roll call vote."
