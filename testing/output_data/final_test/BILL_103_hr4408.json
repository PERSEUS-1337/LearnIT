    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Russian River Fisheries and Riverbed Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to the Russian River. The Congress finds that the Russian River and its tributaries are vital for anadromous fish resources, including salmon and steelhead, which have historically supported local economies. The river once had a productive steelhead fishery and still has a remnant population of coho salmon proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act. The Russian River serves as a crucial resource for drinking water, irrigation, recreational activities, agriculture, aggregate resources, and hydroelectric power. However, development for these purposes has led to the degradation of riparian areas, streambeds, water quality, and stream flows. This degradation is a result of various activities such as dam construction, water diversions, gravel mining, timber harvesting, road building, and residential/agricultural development. The construction of Coyote Dam and Warm Springs Dam, along with the Russian River Flood Control Project, has significantly degraded fish habitat in the River, leading to a major decline in salmon and steelhead populations. The overlapping jurisdictions of Federal, State, and local authorities have hindered conservation efforts, preventing the protection of the River's anadromous fishery resources. The California Department of Fish and Game and the California State Coastal Conservancy are working on restoration plans for the Russian River's anadromous fishery resources. The California Department of Fish and Game and the California State Coastal Conservancy are collaborating on restoration plans for the Russian River's anadromous fishery resources. The purposes of this collaboration are outlined in Section 3. The Act aims to protect and restore the River's anadromous fish habitat, promote cooperation between different agencies, conduct a pilot project for river restoration, review dam operations' environmental impacts, provide funding for program development and implementation. The curr_chunk focuses on the implementation and monitoring of the program plan. SEC. 4. PILOT PROJECT TO REESTABLISH RIVER CHANNEL AND FLOODWAY; FISH HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS. The Administrator will conduct pilot projects on the main channel of the River to reestablish a channel and floodway in equilibrium with the River, prevent down cutting of the River bed, create fish and wildlife habitat, reduce bank erosion, and accommodate high flows without damage to land. Activities will be integrated with tributary projects and basin-wide water management, with a focus on physical and ecological interdependency within the watershed. The project will only proceed with willing landowners and may involve the California State Coastal Conservancy. The Chief will work with the California State Coastal Conservancy on pilot projects and with other agencies like the California Department of Fish and Game for fish habitat restoration projects. They will also collaborate with agencies like the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and award grants to State or local agencies for carrying out activities under this section. The Administrator and the Chief will report to Congress on progress made in implementing monitoring activities. The Secretary will review the effects of Coyote Dam's operation on bank erosion, water supplies, and habitat, and identify alternative release schedules for reducing adverse impacts and providing fisheries habitat benefits. The Secretary will review measures along the Alexander Valley reach of the River channel for adverse environmental effects on fisheries habitat. Alternative measures to reduce bank erosion and promote habitat restoration will be identified. The effects of Warm Springs dam operation on fish habitat in Dry Creek and downstream reaches will also be reviewed. A report on the results will be submitted to Congress by September 30, 1996. The Secretary will report to Congress the results of the reviews on adverse environmental effects on fisheries habitat and alternative measures identified for habitat restoration. SEC. 5. RUSSIAN RIVER BASIN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. Establishment of an advisory committee composed of up to 20 members selected by the Chief in consultation with the Administrator. The committee will represent various groups interested in the Russian River and will include members from the Russian River Enhancement Plan Technical Advisory Committees, organized fishery groups, and State and Federal agencies managing river natural resources. Membership will be geographically balanced between Mendocino and Sonoma Counties. The advisory group, consisting of up to 6 members, advises the Administrator and Chief on implementing activities authorized by the Act. The chairman, chosen by a river fishery group majority vote, serves a 2-year term and must call meetings at least 4 times a year. The advisory committee can establish its own order of business in consultation with the Administrator and Chief. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, such as Administrator, Chief, Program Plan, Resource Plan, River, and Secretary. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. This section authorizes appropriations for the Act. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $7,000,000 for fiscal years after September 30, 1993. $4,000,000 for tributary restoration with $500,000 for Program Plan and $100,000 for Basin Advisory Committee. $3,000,000 for riverbed restoration as per Resource Plan. Funds to remain available until expended, with a portion for Federal staff."
