    "content": "Exposure to ozone, known as \"smog,\" is linked to negative health effects like respiratory issues and premature death, particularly affecting children, the elderly, and those with respiratory illnesses. EPA estimates over 15,000 premature deaths in the US in 2007 were due to ozone exposure. Ozone also harms plants and reduces crop yield. Ground-level ozone, formed from nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in sunlight, is now recognized as a global issue. The formation of ozone depends on NO x and VOCs emissions, with ozone having a lifetime of hours to weeks in the atmosphere. Local emissions are the main source of ozone, but background ozone from external sources poses a challenge to air quality agencies. Long-range transport of pollutants presents both challenges and opportunities for cooperation among different jurisdictions and countries. The Clean Air Act directs the EPA to address these issues. The Clean Air Act mandates the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and welfare. These standards set limits for six common pollutants in ambient air. While the standards aim to limit adverse impacts, EPA acknowledges that concentrations below these levels still pose some risk. Ozone exposure below 20 parts per billion (ppb) shows increased uncertainty in health response. Air quality monitoring stations measure concentrations of six criteria pollutants to determine NAAQS compliance. Areas with pollutant levels above standards may face nonattainment designation, requiring a State Implementation Plan for EPA approval. State regulators develop plans to reduce emissions within their borders, while background pollution may hinder attainment in some regions. The Clean Air Act's \"good neighbor provision\" addresses interstate transport of human-caused air pollution contributing to nonattainment. EPA reviews and revises NAAQS every five years, with the ozone standard lowered from 75 ppb to 70 ppb in 2015. EPA is currently conducting a review for the next ozone NAAQS, aiming to complete it by 2020. The procedure for setting NAAQS does not consider background pollution sources. EPA is addressing background pollution sources in the NAAQS review process, including concerns about meeting standards due to background levels of pollution. A task force has been created to provide states with more flexibility to comply with the ozone standard. Members of Congress may have an interest in better understanding ozone transport and control beyond domestic sources. The report defines background ozone from natural and international sources, focusing on understanding and addressing contributions to air pollution, particularly in the context of ground-level ozone. It discusses limitations in scientific understanding and options for deepening that understanding, with 52 areas in the US designated as \"nonattainment\" for ozone as of 2018. The report focuses on understanding and addressing contributions to air pollution, particularly ground-level ozone. 52 areas in the US are designated as \"nonattainment\" for ozone. EPA defined natural background (NB) and U.S. background (USB) in the final 2015 ozone rule. Natural background ozone, or NB, is the ozone that would exist without any manmade precursor emissions. This includes ozone that would exist without any manmade emissions within the U.S. Natural background ozone is influenced by natural emissions from sources like lightning, vegetation, wildfires, and methane. Transport of ozone from the stratosphere to ground level also contributes to natural background ozone levels. Air pollution monitors cannot measure true present-day natural background ozone due to human contributions to ozone levels. Pollution monitors today cannot measure true present-day natural background ozone (NB) due to widespread human contributions to ozone levels globally. Estimating NB requires global atmospheric chemistry simulation models, with uncertainties in contributions depending on location and timing. The five major contributors to NB include lightning (NOx), which generates NOx molecules through natural reactions in the atmosphere primarily during warmer months. Lightning emissions occur in the free troposphere above the well-mixed ground layer. Challenges and uncertainties in estimating background ozone are discussed in detail. The free troposphere, above the well-mixed ground layer, contains data suggesting lightning contributes to ozone concentrations. Vegetation releases VOCs, with biogenic VOCs being the largest source in the US. Wildfires release VOCs and NOx, with emissions depending on fuel type and burn conditions. Controlled fires release fewer pollutants. Fires burn cooler and release fewer pollutants. Active fires contribute to ozone concentrations. Stratospheric intrusions transport ozone to lower levels during certain weather events. Methane is not traditionally considered an ozone precursor. Methane, although not traditionally seen as an ozone precursor, eventually reacts to contribute to background ozone levels. With a long atmospheric lifetime, methane becomes well-mixed globally, leading to increasing ozone concentrations. Major sources include natural production in wetlands, fossil fuel emissions, and biomass combustion. The estimated concentration of ozone that excludes human-caused emissions in North America, known as North American background (NAB), is best estimated through modeling due to unreliable air quality monitors on the western coast. Asian emissions dominate human-caused sources outside of North America, contributing significantly to background ozone levels in the United States. Estimates show that Asian emissions significantly contribute to background ozone levels in the United States, with the impact being more pronounced in late winter and early spring. This pollution travels across the Pacific Ocean at higher elevations, affecting cities in the western United States. The maximum impact from Asian pollution is expected during late winter/early spring due to seasonal variability in circulation patterns. The term \"background\" O3 refers to ozone originating from natural sources, wildfires, and man-made international emissions. EPA defines USB as ozone that would exist without man-made emissions in the U.S., with Mexican and Canadian emissions impacting border cities. Model estimates show USB contributes to total ozone levels. The contribution of background ozone to local ozone concentrations varies by location and is influenced by pollutant emissions and weather patterns. Estimating source contributions relies on computer models using emissions and meteorological data. Estimates and simplifications are often made due to limited atmospheric and pollutant measurement data, increasing uncertainty in evaluating model performance in capturing ozone formation and movement. Modeling studies present results as seasonal averages or time periods not useful for regulators. Retrospective and forecasting studies face challenges in evaluating ozone concentrations. According to EPA, NOx emissions from electricity generating units have decreased 81% nationally compared to 1990 levels due in part to the acid rain program and ozone transport rules. While reductions in total ozone concentrations have occurred in the eastern United States between 1990 and 2010, many western monitors do not show similar trends despite reductions in NOx emissions. Temperature increases in many areas of the United States have offset potential additional ozone benefits. The lack of decreasing ozone trend in the West may be due to various factors such as increasing temperatures, more wildfires since 1986, emissions from oil and gas development, international air pollution transport, and rising global methane levels. The 2017 U.S. National Climate Assessment reports a significant increase in wildfires since 1986, with quadrupled numbers and six-fold increase in acres burned compared to 1970-1986. NOx emissions from fires are expected to rise with fire intensity, duration, and area burned. Figure 3 illustrates the annual count and total area burned by wildfires larger than 1,000 acres from 1984 to 2015. Asian emissions, including NOx, have potentially peaked and may impact U.S. air quality. Ozone levels flowing into the U.S. from the west have stopped increasing since the mid-2000s, but have been increasing in Alaska since 2000, partly due to transport of East Asian air. High ozone levels related to wildfires and stratospheric intrusions may be excluded from ozone attainment calculations under the Exceptional Event Rule of the CAA. EPA released guidance documents in 2016 and 2018 for preparing demonstrations of exceptional events for wildfires and stratospheric ozone intrusions. State, local, and tribal co-regulators recommended similar guidance for international emissions. Demonstrating contribution by international sources may reduce attainment demonstration under Section 179B of the CAA. Several issues may arise for congressional deliberations with regard to background ozone pollution. Stakeholders suggest challenges with meeting the NAAQS, in part due to the difficulty of reducing ozone in areas with potentially large contributions from background sources and in part due to lack of data availability to conduct demonstrations of those background contributions. Congress may seek to understand the progress of research on background ozone as EPA revisits the NAAQS for ozone. EPA released a state of the science background ozone white paper to stakeholders and requested feedback on major issues. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology revisited the issue when its Subcommittee on Environment held a hearing on background ozone on June 21, 2018. The Subcommittee on Environment held a hearing on background ozone on June 21, 2018. Stakeholders highlighted challenges in addressing natural and non-U.S. sources of ozone due to cost-prohibitive technical requirements. Modeling results are uncertain in quantifying source contributions, with local sources playing a significant role in urban areas. The whitepaper published by EPA shows that local sources contribute significantly to total local ozone. The U.S. Court of Appeals is considering whether EPA should consider background ozone when setting NAAQS. Congress may address gaps in scientific understanding of background ozone through research and development, including international cooperation and increased monitoring. Increased monitoring at ground level and higher levels in the atmosphere, state or federal regulatory air quality monitoring projects, research campaigns to analyze background ozone trends, improve model performance. Research into model estimates of background ozone, including weather patterns like El Nino/La Nina. Congress may consider methane's role in air quality, as a precursor to ozone. EPA's review of ozone NAAQS ongoing. The EPA is currently reviewing the ozone NAAQS, with background ozone contributions being a key topic. Congress may oversee this process as it unfolds. Ozone is also noted as a potent greenhouse gas."
