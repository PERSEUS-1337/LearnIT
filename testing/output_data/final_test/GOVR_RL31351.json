A new measure allowed the President to propose reorganization plans and appoint six administrative assistants. The House and Senate quickly adopted the bill, clearing it for Roosevelt's signature in April 1939. President Roosevelt worked with the Brownlow committee on reorganization plans, leading to the presentation of two proposals. Plan 1 transferred agencies to the Executive Office without explanation, while Plan 2 abolished a presidential emergency council. Both plans were accepted by Congress, with an effective date of July 1, 1939. Roosevelt then issued E.O. 8248 on September 8, formally organizing the Executive Office. The Executive Office, organized by E.O. 8248, included the White House Office, Bureau of the Budget, National Resources Planning Board, Office of Government Reports, and Liaison Office for Personnel Management. It could establish an Office for Emergency Management in a national emergency. The Office for Emergency Management was created by an administrative order in 1940 and served as a parent unit for subordinate emergency management bodies. The Executive Office of the President increased the number of presidential advisers by providing an enclave for various agencies that assisted the President, including the White House Office and the Liaison Office for Personnel Management. The Executive Office of the President included agencies like the Bureau of the Budget and the Office of Management and Budget, with leaders responsible for advising the President. Senior White House Office staff supervised other Executive Office entities, such as the National Security Council and the Domestic Council. President Nixon appointed his Secretary of the Treasury and director of the Office of Management and Budget as Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs and Assistant to the President for Executive Management. In the aftermath of World War II, Congress chartered most agencies within the Executive Office of the President and appropriated funds for their operating expenses. Congress also adopted an amendment in 1944 to restrain the creation of Executive Office agencies by executive order. President Nixon appointed key officials to dual White House Office positions, giving added emphasis to their roles as presidential advisers. The 1944 amendment restricted the creation of Executive Office agencies by executive order. It stated that agencies in existence for more than one year cannot use funds without specific appropriation. This amendment was repealed in 1982 and replaced with new language in Title 31 of the United States Code. Senior staff members of the White House Office and certain Executive Office agencies became of interest to congressional committees for accountability in policymaking and administrative actions. Some, like Donald M. Nelson and James F. Byrnes, cooperated or avoided appearing before committees during World War II. During World War II, presidential advisers avoided testifying before congressional committees but communicated with key members and acted as liaisons between the President and Congress on war matters. In the closing years of the war, some advisers testified before committees, while others refused invitations due to potential privilege concerns.

Congress has a right to access information for its legislative and oversight functions, especially when conducting authorized investigations. The executive branch has limited Congress's right to information by asserting separation of powers and executive privilege when requested to appear before committees. This includes the principle of absolute immunity for presidential advisers, preventing them from testifying before Congress. The executive branch asserts separation of powers and executive privilege to limit Congress's access to information, including absolute immunity for presidential advisers from compelled testimony to protect the President's independence and autonomy. The Department of Justice argues that compelled testimony by presidential advisers would threaten executive branch confidentiality and autonomy, necessary for the President to receive candid advice. They believe that allowing advisers to appear before Congress and invoke executive privilege is not sufficient to protect sensitive information. The DOJ points out that close presidential advisers have testified voluntarily in the past, as an accommodation to Congress's legitimate interest. The Department of Justice argues that voluntary testimony by presidential advisers to Congress is an accommodation to legitimate investigative interests. The issue of compelled testimony and executive privilege remains unresolved, with a court ruling against immunity for close presidential advisers in the past. The Miers case involved a subpoena issued to former White House Counsel Harriet Miers by the House Committee on the Judiciary during an investigation into the termination of U.S. Attorneys. Despite a DOJ conclusion of immunity, Miers refused to testify, leading to a civil lawsuit. The district court rejected the executive's claim of absolute immunity for presidential advisers, marking a significant shift in the interpretation of executive privilege. The court rejected the Executive's claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides, stating that they must testify before the Committee and can only invoke executive privilege when necessary. The argument that close advisers are the \"alter ego\" of the President was also dismissed, citing Supreme Court precedent in Harlow v. Fitzgerald. The district court in Miers questioned presidential immunity from compelled congressional testimony, leaving open the possibility of immunity for advisers in national security or foreign policy roles. It rejected the argument that lack of absolute immunity would hinder advisers' candid advice to the President, citing the use of executive privilege as a check against public disclosure. The Miers court's reasoning rejected the executive's claim of absolute immunity for presidential advisers, emphasizing Congress's oversight role. The executive branch disagrees with the decision, maintaining that close presidential advisers have absolute immunity from compelled testimony by Congress. Congress can request or demand the testimony of a presidential adviser, but the Miers opinion has limited precedential value. Congress may face legal and political challenges when trying to enforce a subpoena for a presidential adviser's testimony. Conflicts often involve negotiations and compromises on the scope of information provided. If the executive branch refuses to comply, Congress can use inherent contempt or statutory criminal contempt authority, but these methods may not guarantee the information sought. When faced with a refusal by the executive branch to comply with a demand for information, Congress has alternatives such as seeking relief in the courts, using appropriations riders, impeachment, or delaying presidential appointees. Additionally, if a presidential adviser declines to testify before a committee, Congress may consider enacting legislation. Congress may wish to enact legislation establishing an entity for presidential advisers to testify before committees, subject to Senate confirmation. Legal and policy factors explain why advisers do not regularly testify. Committees have the right to information from the executive branch, but enforcing subpoenas may not always be successful. Negotiations may be needed for information production. Negotiations may be necessary for committees to obtain desired information from the executive branch."
