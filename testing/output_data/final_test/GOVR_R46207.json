    "content": "Edge providers, creators of websites and apps, are individuals and entities offering content and services over the internet. The FCC does not regulate their activities but they may be examined by the DOJ and FTC for potential violations. Federal agencies and Congress are investigating competition among edge providers, such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, for potential antitrust violations. Concerns have been raised about the dominance of a few edge providers harming competition and the need for regulations to address this issue. Some edge providers operate in multiple industries through vertical and horizontal integration, affecting relationships with ISPs and competition. The FCC defines edge providers as entities offering content, applications, services, and devices over the internet. This includes search engines, streaming services, social media platforms, retailers, and personal websites. The report focuses on companies operating as edge providers, serving as conduits for content created by others. These providers generate revenue through product sales, subscriptions, or advertising. Facebook is highlighted as one of the largest edge providers. In the third quarter of 2019, Facebook and Google reported significant advertising revenue, with Facebook making $17.4 billion (98% of total revenue) and Google making $33.9 billion (84% of total revenue). Edge providers connect with users through apps and browsers, requiring a data plan or wireless connection from ISPs and mobile carriers. In a simplified example, edge providers like Content Providers A and B interact with ISPs and users. They pay termination fees to ISPs to deliver content to users, who in turn pay subscription fees to access the data. The process can involve different ISPs, internet backbones, and direct connections between edge providers and ISPs. Edge providers rely on ISPs and mobile carriers to deliver content to users, leading to competition among companies that generate and deliver content. Some companies operate as both edge providers and ISPs, creating vertical integration. Popular edge providers in the US include Google, Facebook, Amazon, PayPal, Twitter, and the Weather Company. AT&T, Comcast, and other companies operate as both edge providers and ISPs, creating vertical integration. AT&T owns part of the internet backbone and acquired Time Warner in 2018. Comcast is an ISP, cable television service, and voice service provider, with majority ownership of NBCUniversal. In 2019, Walt Disney Company gained \"full operational control\" of Hulu, while Comcast retained a 33% financial stake. Comcast also plans to launch its own streaming service, Peacock, offering free, premium, and ad-free subscription options. Verizon, a Tier 1 ISP and mobile carrier, acquired AOL and Yahoo in recent years. In 2017, Oath was created by combining edge provider products acquired from Yahoo. Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, offers various products including search engine, email, video streaming, and Google Fiber internet service. Facebook expanded its platform to include fundraising, messaging, and commerce activities. In 2018, Facebook pursued Project Athena, an experimental satellite for internet access. Amazon also planned Project Kuiper in 2019 to launch satellites for broadband internet. Edge providers compete by offering new content, advertising, and acquiring competitors. Subscription-based providers can lower fees or offer discounts to attract users. This report examines the effects of vertical and horizontal integration on competition in a market, focusing on market concentration and changes in the number of establishments as indicators. Market competition can be measured by analyzing the concentration of sales among firms and changes in the number of stores. Decreasing store numbers may indicate a decrease in competition. The scope of measuring competition in a market is defined using the NAICS system. Two industries with only edge providers are \"Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services\" and \"Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals.\" The number of establishments in these industries has increased over the past decade. However, a few edge providers dominate specific content types, such as social networking websites where 95% of visits in the US go to Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter. Similarly, the most popular mobile social networking apps in the US are Facebook, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger. Edge providers like Facebook, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger compete for users by offering high-demand content and seamless delivery. Previously, content was delivered on a \"best effort\" basis, causing issues for time-sensitive content due to interruptions and delays in data transfer. Latency and delays in data transfer lower the value of time-sensitive content like video programming. Edge providers can pay network managers for priority access, bypass congestion points, and use CDNs like Microsoft's Azure or Amazon's CloudFront for better service quality. CDNs reduce bandwidth needed for content delivery and act as intermediaries between ISPs and edge providers. Net neutrality debates focus on ISPs treating data equally, with concerns over blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. FCC banned these practices in 2015 but lifted restrictions in 2017. Congress has considered bills on net neutrality. The 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom Order has led to debates in Congress regarding paid prioritization by ISPs. This practice could impact competition among edge providers, with concerns about potential discrimination and competitive imbalance. Vertical mergers are also contributing to the competitive challenges faced by nascent edge providers. Vertical integration among edge providers and ISPs can impact competition. Companies that operate as both an ISP and edge provider may have a competitive advantage in content delivery quality. This advantage comes from direct connections to the ISP's network, which can be a disadvantage for edge providers that have not paid for such connections. Additionally, edge providers that also operate as CDNs may benefit from better connections to ISPs without incurring extra costs. Edge providers not integrated with CDNs or ISPs incur costs. Vertically integrated companies may prioritize their own content. Mobile carriers offering edge provider services can include their apps for free, giving them a competitive advantage. Nonaffiliated edge providers face fees for app inclusion, unlike affiliated providers. Google acquired Android in 2005, an operating system for mobile devices, and was fined by the EU for anticompetitive practices related to bundling its Play app store with Search and Chrome apps. This reduced the ability of rival search engines and web browsers to compete effectively. Some ISPs offer \"zero rating\" plans allowing free access to specific content or services. Critics argue these plans favor affiliated edge providers, while supporters claim they encourage trying new services. AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner in 2018 aimed to leverage customer data for targeted advertising. Some states have passed laws restricting ISP data collection, while California's Consumer Privacy Act grants residents rights over their personal information. Consumers could benefit from economic efficiencies through vertical integration between edge providers and ISPs, resulting in faster content delivery and lower prices. This integration may increase competition among ISPs, offering consumers more provider options and potentially lowering prices. Edge providers entering the ISP market may lead to lower prices and faster speeds, but their competitive advantage could be hindered by reduced competition among themselves due to mergers and acquisitions. Companies like Facebook and Google have made numerous acquisitions, potentially limiting competition. The need to review such acquisitions for antitrust enforcement is a topic of debate, with some suggesting limits on mergers or breaking up companies. Some commentators debate limiting mergers among edge providers to increase competition, while others see mergers as a natural outcome of a competitive market. Edge providers benefit from acquiring others to expand their online markets and content. Google gained a stronger position in online video with YouTube acquisition, while Facebook improved its photo-sharing platform with Divvyshot acquisition. Acquisitions can enhance user experience but also reduce competition. Some criticize Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and advocate for breaking up the two platforms. Horizontal integration can increase an edge provider's customer base, giving them more bargaining power with ISPs. Edge providers with large user bases can have greater leverage over ISPs, potentially improving their market position and advertising capabilities. Edge providers can enhance their advertising capabilities by acquiring firms that control digital advertising tools, giving them a competitive advantage. Alphabet, through Google, has acquired tools like DoubleClick, AdMob, and Admeld, becoming the largest seller of digital advertising. Controlling these tools allows edge providers to target advertisements more effectively and potentially increase revenue from selling ad spaces. Google has waived fees for using multiple components of its advertising services, bundling them together, potentially hindering rivals. The DOJ and state attorneys general are investigating Google's use of its advertising products, including the use of data collected from its edge provider services. Consumer Watchdog has petitioned the FCC to regulate edge providers and prevent them from tracking personal information without consent. The FCC dismissed a petition to regulate edge providers tracking personal information without consent, citing the 2015 Open Internet Order. Oversight of edge providers is left to other agencies like the FTC and DOJ, who deal with consumer privacy and antitrust issues. The FTC has expanded its focus to include vertical integration by ISPs. The FTC issued orders to ISPs to investigate their privacy practices due to vertical integration, allowing them to provide advertising-supported content. Antitrust investigations were opened against \"Big Tech\" firms like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. State attorneys general also launched investigations into Facebook and Google for possible antitrust violations. The market for edge providers is a key focus in these investigations. Determining the market for edge providers is complex due to the variety of goods and services they offer, making it difficult to classify them into specific industries. Competition analysis involves defining the market of a product, which is particularly challenging for edge providers. This complexity is evident in questions about products sold on Amazon and whether they should be considered separate markets. The market share for edge providers relying on digital advertising is complex due to difficulties in defining their market and determining revenue sources. Questions arise about comparing them based on advertising revenue or user data collected. The House Judiciary Committee announced an investigation into competition in digital markets on June 3, 2019. The House Judiciary Committee announced an investigation into competition in digital markets, holding five hearings to discuss topics related to edge providers. Key questions include how vertical integration among ISPs and edge providers impacts competition and how to measure its effects. Price effects may not be a sufficient measure due to many users not paying for edge providers' services. Consumer data obtained by edge providers could impact competition in the future as it becomes more crucial for machine learning and AI technologies. The regulation of competition among edge providers is being considered to prevent anticompetitive practices, but it may also hinder innovation and disadvantage new entrants. The wide range of products and services offered by edge providers complicates the establishment of a regulatory framework.
