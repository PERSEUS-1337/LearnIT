    "content": "The Act titled \"Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Security Authorization Act of 2011\" adds new regulations under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 for chemical facility anti-terrorism security. The Secretary is required to maintain regulations for protecting chemical facilities against terrorism, including risk-based performance standards, security vulnerability assessments, and site security plans. These regulations apply to facilities with high security risks, excluding those owned or operated by the Department of Defense. The regulations for protecting chemical facilities against terrorism include security measures for facilities owned or operated by the Department of Energy, regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or subject to chapter 701 of title 46, United States Code. These facilities must develop site security plans with layered security measures to address vulnerability assessments and risk-based performance standards. The Secretary reviews and approves vulnerability assessments and site security plans for chemical facilities to ensure they meet risk-based performance standards. Disapproval is based on failure to satisfy these standards, not specific security measures. Notification must be given within 180 days of receiving the plan. After receiving a security vulnerability assessment or site security plan, the Secretary must review and approve or disapprove it within 14 days. If disapproved, the facility will receive a written notification with clear explanations of deficiencies. The Secretary must review and approve or disapprove security assessments or plans within 14 days. If disapproved, the owner must revise and resubmit the plan to address deficiencies. The Secretary will report annually to Congress on instances where the 180-day notification requirement was deemed impracticable. The Secretary may approve alternative security programs established by private sector entities or authorities if they meet the requirements of the regulations. Security background checks for covered chemical facilities can be partially met by submitting information on individuals with valid transportation security cards. The Secretary may approve alternative security programs for covered chemical facilities established by private sector entities or authorities. This includes alternate security background checks conducted by private sector entities, non-profit personnel surety accrediting organizations, or under other applicable laws. The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to small businesses for security vulnerability assessments or site security plans if requested. SEC. 2102. INFORMATION PROTECTION. Information developed under this title, including vulnerability assessments and security plans, will be protected from public disclosure similar to regulations for chemical facilities. The sharing of this information with State and local government officials with appropriate security clearances is allowed for the purpose of implementing this title. In any proceeding to enforce this title, vulnerability assessments, site security plans, and other information submitted to or obtained by the Secretary under this title shall be treated as classified material. Congress cannot withhold information from Congress or any committee. \"SEC. 2103. ENFORCEMENT.\" The Secretary audits and inspects chemical facilities for compliance with regulations. Non-compliant facilities receive written notification and must comply by a specified date. Violators may face civil penalties. Title 46, United States Code allows the Secretary to issue an order for a chemical facility to cease operation if it remains in noncompliance. Only the Secretary has the right to enforce provisions of this title against facility owners or operators. The Secretary must provide annual reports to Congress estimating job impacts of regulations on private sector and gathering feedback on potential job creation or losses. SEC. 2105 states that this title does not override any federal laws regarding chemical substances. SEC. 2106 allows states to enforce stricter regulations on chemical facility security. SEC. 2107 mentions the termination date of the authority provided in this title. SEC. 2108 authorizes appropriations. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to carry out the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Security Regulations is set at $89,928,000 for each fiscal year from 2012 through 2018. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 is amended by repealing section 550. The Secretary of Homeland Security must report on the harmonization of security requirements under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 with those for facilities regulated under title 46, United States Code."
