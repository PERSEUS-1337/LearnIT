Congress does not intend this section to provide the exclusive remedies with respect to the conduct prohibited by it, nor to preempt the legislation of the States that may provide such remedies. Definitions for terms like 'reproductive health services', 'facility', and 'physical obstruction' are provided. The term 'obstruction' refers to blocking access to reproductive health services, making it difficult to enter or exit a facility. The definition of 'State' includes various regions within the United States. 'Intimidate' means causing someone to fear bodily harm. The Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to conduct occurring after that date. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the United States Code."
