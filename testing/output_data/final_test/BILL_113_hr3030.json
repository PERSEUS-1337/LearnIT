    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2013\". The Congress recognizes the unique legal and political relationship between the United States and Indian tribes, acknowledging tribes' authority to provide governmental programs, develop economies, and maintain infrastructure on reservation lands. Federal laws and regulations affirm tribes as governments with the authority to tax, issue bonds, and receive tax exemptions. Indian tribes face historic disadvantages in accessing capital for infrastructure and job creation. Certain statutory restrictions hinder tribal governance and economies. Tribes are sometimes excluded from key provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, leading to unfair tax treatment. Congress has the authority to regulate commerce with Indian tribes. The United States government exercises authority to promote tribal self-governance and affirm the government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes. SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF INDIAN TRIBES AS STATES WITH RESPECT TO BOND ISSUANCE. Section 7871 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include special rules for tax-exempt bonds issued by Indian tribal governments. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a national bond volume cap based on tribal population estimates and adjusted State ceiling amounts. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to allocate a national bond volume cap among Indian tribal governments. Essential governmental function requirements are repealed, with effective dates specified for obligations issued in subsequent calendar years. SEC. 4.

Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to grandfather certain deferred compensation plans for Indian tribal governments, their subdivisions, agencies, and entities owned or controlled by them.

The amendment includes Indian tribal governments, agencies, and entities under Federal, State, or tribal law in the definition of \"governmental unit\" for tax purposes. This also applies to certain supporting organizations under Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments made by this section expand the definition of \"governmental unit\" for tax purposes to include Indian tribal governments, agencies, and entities under Federal, State, or tribal law. The effective date for these changes is for taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. IMPROVING TRIBAL CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES' ACCESS TO FEDERAL PARENT LOCATOR SERVICE AND TAX REFUND OFFSETS.

Additionally, the amendment includes Indian tribes in the Internal Revenue Code for the purpose of distributing funds. SEC. 7. APPLICATION OF CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY BONDS TO TRIBES. Section 54(j) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include Indian tribal governments as defined by section 7701(a)(40). This encompasses subdivisions, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities wholly owned or controlled by Indian tribal governments. Additionally, a special rule for Indian tribal governments is added to the allocation of clean renewable energy bond limitations. The clean renewable energy bond limitation for Indian tribal governments is $200,000,000 for each of calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016. The Secretary will allocate this amount among qualified projects, with a maximum of 20 percent for any one project. These amendments apply to obligations issued after December 31, 2014."
