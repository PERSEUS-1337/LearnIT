Information on the energy required for water pumping, transportation, and treatment is limited. The Electric Power Research Institute estimated that around 4% of the nation's electricity is used for water and wastewater treatment. EPRI's analysis projected a 23% increase in electricity consumption by public and private water supply agencies and wastewater treatment facilities by 2020 and a 63% increase by 2050. The 4% estimate of electricity used for water services is considered a good starting point but lacks future projections and data on the thermoelectric sector. The EPRI analysis projected a significant increase in electricity consumption by water supply agencies and wastewater treatment facilities. A 2009 report by the River Network found that over 380 billion kWh of energy is used for water heating in the United States. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin quantified the energy embedded in the U.S. public water supply, which accounts for 4.1% of the nation's annual primary energy consumption and 6.1% of national electricity consumption. Electricity consumption by public drinking water and wastewater utilities for various processes was 56.6 billion kWh, representing 11.5% of primary energy and 21.6% of electricity consumption for water end-use. The researchers at the University of Texas at Austin analyzed the energy consumption of the U.S. public water supply, which makes up 4.1% of the nation's primary energy and 6.1% of electricity consumption. They found that direct water-related energy use accounted for 12.6% of national primary energy consumption in 2010, equivalent to 12.3 quadrillion BTUs or the annual energy consumption of 40 million Americans. Energy losses during electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, as well as end-use, represented 58% of total primary energy consumed for water-related purposes. The estimate of waste heat losses in water-related energy consumption is uncertain due to inadequate data. Energy used for water in various sectors like power plants, industrial uses, and agriculture is often not fully accounted for in analyses. This includes energy for pumping water in residential wells and agricultural irrigation, which is generally self-supplied. The transportation sector consumes energy for petroleum-based fuels, reflected in water-for-energy analyses. The bottled water industry in the United States consumes energy for collection, treatment, bottling, and distribution. Energy use for water depends on variables like water source, treatment, end-use, distribution, water loss, and wastewater treatment. The intensity of energy use for water varies based on factors like topography, climate, and rainfall. A 2005 study in California found that water-related energy use consumes a significant amount of electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Pumps moving water in the state are the largest power load. Regional differences make it challenging to generalize water-related energy use in the United States. The energy intensity of water in cities nationally varies from 2,700 to 5,000 kWh per million gallons, with California showing a range of 4,000 to 12,700 kWh per million gallons. The embedded energy of water activities can have disproportionate impacts, such as pumping water over long distances. Water supply practices that focus on pumping and distributing water over long distances, rather than promoting water conservation, can negatively impact certain sectors. The EPA's WaterSense program emphasizes that saving water also saves energy. Energy efficiency initiatives can lead to significant water savings, while water efficiency initiatives can result in significant energy savings across various sectors. In commercial, industrial, and institutional sectors, potential water savings through energy efficiency measures could reach 15%-30% without reducing water services. Similar opportunities for water and energy savings exist in agriculture. Water-related carbon emissions in 2005 were approximately 290 million metric tons, equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 53 million passenger vehicles. Water heating accounted for 70% of these emissions, wastewater treatment for 18%, water supply for 8%, and agricultural activities for 6%. Saving water not only saves energy but also reduces carbon emissions. There are about 200,000 drinking water treatment systems in the United States, with 52,000 serving 25 or more year-round residents. Most U.S. drinking water is provided by large community water systems, with smaller systems serving a small percentage of the population. Public agencies mostly own and operate these systems, with smaller utilities paying more for electricity due to economies of scale. Wastewater treatment plants in the U.S. serve over 75% of the population, with large facilities serving the majority. Wastewater systems in the U.S. serve over 85% of the population and consist of collection systems, treatment facilities, and effluent disposal. Electricity is the main energy source consumed, with aeration, pumping, and solids processing accounting for most of the electricity used. Energy requirements increase with more advanced treatment levels and as systems and equipment age, resulting in decreased efficiency. Public water supply agencies and wastewater treatment facilities accounted for 1.8% of total U.S. electricity use in 2013, totaling 69.4 billion kWh. The energy consumption of public drinking water systems and municipal wastewater industry has increased significantly, accounting for 1.8% of total U.S. electricity use in 2011. This is due to population growth and the adoption of more energy-intensive treatment technologies. Utilities spend about $4 billion annually on energy, with consumption comprising 30%-40% of a municipality's total energy bill. Energy efficiency is crucial for these highly regulated entities to meet regulatory requirements and provide services at reasonable rates. The energy efficiency of public drinking water and wastewater utilities is becoming increasingly important as populations grow and environmental regulations become stricter. Demand for electricity at these plants is expected to increase by 20%, making energy conservation crucial. Opportunities for efficiency exist, with potential energy savings of 8% by 2030. Optimizing system processes through SCADA systems can help increase equipment efficiency. EPRI estimates that drinking water facilities can save 5%-15% energy with adjustable speed drives, high-efficiency motors, and process optimization. Wastewater facilities can save 10%-20% energy through process optimization. Upgrading to efficient equipment and right-sizing can also lead to energy savings. Leaky pipes contribute to energy losses in water systems. Projects to address water loss and improve end-use efficiency can be promoted as both water- and energy-savings investments. Water utilities need to develop a better understanding of their current energy use, with programs in place to help them manage energy use effectively. For example, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has initiatives to benchmark energy use for water utilities, while the California Energy Commission is also active in promoting energy efficiency. The California Energy Commission has reported on energy efficiency measures in water facilities, resulting in energy and cost savings. The California Public Utilities Commission directed electric utilities to partner with water agencies for conservation programs. Energy companies in California are collaborating with the water sector to reduce energy use. The EPA has developed tools for water utilities to manage energy effectively. Some water utilities are implementing energy efficiency measures, such as on-site energy generation and biogas recovery from municipal waste. DC Water in Washington, DC, is an example of a wastewater utility using these methods to reduce energy costs and even sell electricity back to the grid. Energy Star offers a Portfolio Manager tool for utilities to benchmark their energy use, while various organizations provide research on best practices for energy conservation in the water sector. Some water utilities, like DC Water in Washington, DC, are converting wastewater residuals into fuel for combined heat and power operations, saving millions annually on electricity and solid waste management. The Gloversville-Johnstown, NY Joint Wastewater Treatment Facilities also save money by accepting dairy whey as a fuel. Other plants use renewable energy sources like solar panels to meet their energy needs. Water utilities face barriers to improving energy efficiency, such as limited resources and reluctance to adopt new technologies. Funding sources for energy projects may not be well-known, and federal and state funding is limited. Municipalities that own water utilities are risk-averse and hesitant to change practices. Water utilities are slow to adopt new technology due to concerns about environmental and public health risks, as well as economic and regulatory consequences. Facility operators are often disconnected from those who pay the electricity bill, leading to a lack of advocacy for energy efficiency. Most facilities were built decades ago with little consideration for energy costs, and there is a tendency to wait until equipment fails rather than being proactive. Utility managers may not understand how to reduce energy costs, and regulatory barriers also hinder energy efficiency efforts. Regulatory barriers exist for biogas use projects in wastewater treatment plants, as state policies often do not recognize biogas as a renewable energy source. This results in projects being ineligible for incentives, and some utilities restrict the sale of excess power to the grid. Lack of coherence and coordination between water and energy policies further hinders on-site energy generation projects. The lack of coherence and coordination between water and energy policies hinders on-site energy generation projects. Water and energy decisions are historically made independently, leading to a mismatch in planning objectives by different actors. Water policy in the United States is structured in a bottom-up fashion, while energy policy is structured in a top-down fashion. The 2013 report recommends fostering cross-sector communication and collaborative planning in the electricity, water supply, and wastewater sectors to overcome barriers in energy policy. States could incentivize wastewater plants to install energy projects and give credits to electric utilities for incorporating those sources. New policies are needed to build confidence in leaders and motivate them to \"go beyond compliance.\" Research and information needs in energy for water uses have been identified by researchers and stakeholders. Researchers and stakeholders have identified data gaps in energy needs for water use, with limited detail in national water use data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey and energy data collected by the Department of Energy. There is a lack of systematic collection of energy data from public water utilities and other end users of water, leading to scattered and unavailable information for decision makers. Integrated research is needed to address these issues in the water industry. Research is needed to quantify energy use in the water industry, understand where energy is used in water infrastructure, identify opportunities for improvement, and establish priorities for action. Consistent data collection methodology and standards are lacking, and more research on advanced technologies for energy and water savings is necessary. Partnerships between government and the private sector are needed to move research from bench-scale to implementation, particularly in energy recovery from wastewater generation. In the early stages of development, more research and onsite demonstration are required to understand the linkages between energy, water, land, and agriculture, as well as the risks of climate change and extreme weather events on water availability and energy supply. Policies and approaches are needed to promote integrated resource management in the water and energy sectors. Analyzing incentives, disincentives, and regulatory barriers to investing in cost-effective energy or water efficiency measures is crucial. Education and outreach efforts are necessary to raise awareness about the water-energy nexus and the benefits of improving efficiency in both sectors."
