    "content": "As natural language semantics evolve, sentence embedders have become crucial. A new comparative approach, N2O, measures similarity between embedders task-agnostically. N2O compares 21 sentence embedders, highlighting design choices and architectures. Continuous embeddings are prevalent in NLP due to self-supervised pretraining methods. The focus is on sentence embedders and their evaluation using the N2O approach, which compares embedders in a task-agnostic manner. N2O measures similarity by comparing nearest neighbor sets from a large unannotated corpus. This method can help inform embedder choices in various applications like text clustering and information retrieval. The N2O method is applied to 21 sentence embedders, revealing high functional similarity among word type embeddings, the impact of subword information, and identifying BERT and GPT as outliers. The robustness of N2O is demonstrated across different query samples and probe sizes, allowing for additional analyses like identifying stable neighbors in the embedding space and evaluating embedders' ability to find paraphrases. The N2O method compares sentence embedders for semantic similarity, applicable to various types of embedders. It quantifies overlap between nearest neighbors for different queries, indicating how embedders treat similarity. The method was applied to 21 embedders, highlighting functional similarities and outliers like BERT and GPT. The comparison of sentence embedders focuses on using naturally-occurring text and evaluating task-agnostic embeddings learned from large unannotated corpora. The evaluation is based on nearest neighbors to reflect similarity in embedding space. The comparison of sentence embedders involves evaluating embeddings learned from unannotated corpora based on nearest neighbors to reflect similarity in embedding space. Different sentence embedders are compared by computing the overlap in nearest neighbors of sentences from a corpus segmented into sentences. The comparison of sentence embedders involves evaluating embeddings learned from unannotated corpora based on nearest neighbors to reflect similarity in embedding space. The algorithm computes the overlap in nearest neighbor sentences, averaged across multiple queries, using cosine similarity. The N2O procedure compares sets of sentences recovered by probes in the sentence vector space. In this section, the text discusses the methods behind sentence embedders, including tf-idf and word embedding methods. Static embeddings are defined as fixed representations of word types. Contextual embeddings, such as ELMo and GPT, provide word representations dependent on context, showing improvements in various tasks. Static embeddings, like word2vec, GloVe, and FastText, offer fixed representations of word types regardless of context. The curr_chunk discusses different types of embeddings such as GPT and BERT, how they incorporate subword information, and the composition of word embeddings. Despite the simplicity of averaging word embeddings for obtaining a sentence's embedding, it performs well on various tasks. In the case of contextual embeddings like BERT, the [CLS] token representation is used as a sentence representation. Different pretrained sentence embedders are tested, with ELMo embeddings averaged across bi-LSTM layers and BERT/GPT embeddings from the final hidden layer. Learning an encoding function for sequence of tokens is another way to obtain sentence embeddings. The curr_chunk discusses encoder-based methods for learning embeddings, including InferSent and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and a broad comparison using N2O. The N2O computation allows for situating each method in terms of functional similarity. The curr_chunk describes the computation of N2O for sentence embedders using cosine similarity, with results averaged across samples of queries. The corpus used is English Gigaword from 2010, containing approximately 8 million unique sentences. Queries consist of 100 ledes randomly selected from news articles in the corpus. The curr_chunk discusses the selection of sentence embedders for experiments, including using popular pretrained versions and training/finetuning models. The average query length is 30.7 tokens, with examples provided. Various methods are detailed in Table 1. The curr_chunk presents results from an experiment using different sentence embedders, showing N2O values between pairs ranging from 0.04 to 0.62. The overlap is computed over two draws of k = 50 sentences from a large dataset. The experiment analyzed N2O values among different sentence embedders, showing high N2O for variations of the same embedder with different dimensionality but trained with the same method and corpus. Subword information had a significant impact on N2O, with fasttext-cc-sub and fasttext-wiki-sub showing a high N2O value compared to other embedders. The experiment analyzed N2O values among different sentence embedders, showing high N2O for variations of the same embedder with different dimensionality but trained with the same method and corpus. Subword information had a significant impact on N2O, with fasttext-cc-sub and fasttext-wiki-sub showing a high N2O value compared to other embedders. Without subword information, subword methods find near neighbors with lower token overlap, while tf-idf has low N2O with other embedders. Averages of ELMo embeddings were also tested, showing high N2O for different capacities and training data combinations. The experiment analyzed N2O values among different sentence embedders, showing high N2O for variations of the same embedder with different dimensionality but trained with the same method and corpus. Specific-token representations for BERT or GPT were outliers compared to other embedders, with lower N2O values. This effect held even for the MultiNLI-finetuned version of BERT, decreasing N2O with other embedders further. The experiment analyzed N2O values among different sentence embedders, showing high N2O for variations of the same embedder with different dimensionality but trained with the same method and corpus. Notably, taking averaged BERT and GPT embeddings yields higher N2O with other embedders, especially ELMo-based ones. InferSent has the highest N2O with the embeddings based on averaging, despite being trained using a NLI task. The USE variants (DAN and Transformer) have distinct nearest neighbors compared to other methods, with the highest N2O between each other. The study computed ranked lists of N2O output for different values of k, finding high Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between embedder pairs. Results were consistent across different k values and query samples, indicating stable embedder similarity rankings. The study analyzed N2O values across samples, showing small differences due to query samples. Spearman's \u03c1 was computed with an average of 0.994. Concerns about N2O computation being linear in corpus size were addressed. The study compared sentence embedders using N2O and demonstrated analysis enabled by it. The study explores how sentence embedders capture semantic similarity by analyzing which sentences from the corpus are consistently neighbors of a given query. Outlier sentences are thematically similar but with different participants, while popular neighbors have high lexical overlap with the query. The analysis is inspired by the phenomenon of paraphrase. The study investigates how sentence embedders capture paraphrase by using a \"needle-in-a-haystack\" experiment with the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark. The experiment involves sentence pairs with human judgments of semantic similarity. One query discusses Britain's mortgage lender reporting a 3.6 percent fall in house prices in September. Different sentence embedders rank sentences based on similarity, with varying interpretations of market strength. German machinery orders were down 3 percent on the year in January, but foreign demand is improving. The economy rebounded and grew 8.9 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, with growth expected to exceed six percent for the full year. The study focuses on sentence pairs from the dataset, with the first sentence as the query and the second sentence temporarily added to the corpus. Results show that larger ELMo models and Infersent perform well in placing paraphrase pairs close together, while averaged BERT and GPT embeddings outperform [CLS]/final token ones. Recent comparisons of sentence embedders have primarily focused on linguistic probing tasks and downstream evaluations. Linguistic probing tasks test if embeddings can distinguish surface, syntactic, and semantic properties. Downstream evaluations involve classification tasks like NLI. Evaluations include RepEval 2017 shared task, SentEval toolkit, and GLUE benchmark. Nearest neighbor overlap (N2O) is introduced as a comparative approach to quantifying similarity between sentence embedders. It complements existing tools like SentEval toolkit and GLUE benchmark by providing a task-agnostic way to compare embedders' functionality. The study compares 21 embedders using N2O and reveals high variation in how embedders treat semantic similarity. Different sets of standard pretrained GloVe embeddings and FastText embeddings are used for the analysis. The curr_chunk discusses the use of various pretrained embeddings such as FastText, ELMo, and BERT in natural language processing tasks. Different sets of embeddings are utilized, and specific implementations like FastText's Python port and Hugging Face's pytorch-transformers for BERT are mentioned. The embeddings are used for tasks like tokenization, embedding lookup, and computing out-of-vocabulary embeddings. The curr_chunk discusses the use of pretrained models like WordPiece tokenization for BERT on MultiNLI, GPT with Hugging Face library, InferSent with GloVe model, and Universal Sentence Encoder with TensorFlow Hub. The curr_chunk discusses experiments with various pretrained models like ELMo, BERT, GPT, and Universal Sentence Encoder, comparing their token overlap and N2O values. The curr_chunk discusses outlier nearest neighbors and N2O values between different embedders, including information on house prices in Britain, Japanese consumer prices, Sweden's GDP growth, and Australia's central bank interest rate. Australia's central bank surprised investors by leaving its key interest rate unchanged at 3.75 percent, defying predictions of further rate hikes as the economy rebounds. Table 3 and Table 4 show outlier nearest neighbors and results for a query-paraphrase experiment, respectively. In a query-paraphrase experiment, the top-5 queries had the paraphrase as the nearest neighbor in the 5-nearest neighborhood."
