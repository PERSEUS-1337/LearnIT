    "content": "During its first session, the 114th Congress addressed international trade and finance policy issues, including granting time-limited U.S. Trade Promotion Authority to the President. Legislation was considered for reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, Trade Adjustment Assistance, U.S. trade preference programs, and governance reforms at the International Monetary Fund. Congress also oversaw ongoing U.S. trade agreements, negotiations, and economic sanctions against various countries. The second session of the 114th Congress will focus on U.S. trade policy and international economic issues, including the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. Other trade negotiations of interest include those at the World Trade Organization (WTO), international trade in services, and free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. These issues are crucial as they impact the U.S. economy, businesses, workers, and standard of living. The second session of the 114th Congress will focus on U.S. trade policy and international economic issues, including the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. This report provides an overview of trade and finance issues that may come before Congress, impacting the U.S. economy, businesses, workers, and standard of living. Geopolitical tensions, risks, and opportunities can also affect international trade and finance. Congress plays a key role in addressing these complex issues. Global trade growth is slower post-2008 financial crisis, impacting Japan, Canada, Europe, and emerging markets. Vulnerabilities include declining trade, currency depreciation, lower commodity prices, and volatile markets. China is managing a slowdown towards a consumer-oriented economy. Uncertainties in financial markets raise concerns about business investment and long-term productivity gains. The global economy faces challenges due to declining trade, currency depreciation, and lower commodity prices. The U.S. economy remains a bright spot, driving global economic growth. Concerns arise from uncertainties in financial markets and potential spillover effects onto major trading partners of emerging markets. The United States is a main driver of global economic growth, with improved conditions such as lower unemployment and projected GDP growth. The drop in oil prices impacts the global and U.S. economy, affecting consumer incomes and industry competitiveness. Exchange rates are volatile, with several currencies depreciating against the U.S. dollar. The Russian ruble and other major economies face uncertainties in global financial markets, potentially complicating the U.S. Federal Reserve's efforts to raise interest rates. Volatile currencies, low commodity prices, and sovereign debt issues could lead to sovereign defaults. Current account imbalances have significantly decreased since 2006. Current account imbalances, as a share of world GDP, have decreased significantly, with the deficit in the United States and surpluses in China and Japan shrinking. Concerns over a global trade slowdown and the United States' role in supporting global growth may overshadow worries about imbalances. The global economy has seen transformative changes, with increased integration of markets and production due to advances in technology, communication, and transportation, leading to growth in trade, especially of intermediate goods. Global trade in goods has significantly increased over the past 20 years, with trade accounting for a larger percentage of global GDP. This growth has led to debates on trade and employment policies, questions about the definition of \"American-made\" products, and considerations on who benefits and loses from trade. The rise of China and other emerging markets, along with a more digitally-driven economy, present both opportunities and challenges for the United States. The United States faces opportunities and challenges in achieving open markets, transparent trade, and financial stability in the global economy. The inability to conclude the 2001 Doha Round poses a threat to the WTO's role in trade liberalization. The US is pursuing mega-regional trade agreements like TPP and T-TIP to set new trade rules. Topics include intellectual property rights, digital trade, and investment in US trade. Global economic integration has increased trade and economic growth, exposing U.S. firms to competition from lower-cost producers and state-owned enterprises. This may lead to costly adjustments for U.S. firms, including worker displacement and production shifts abroad. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar could impact U.S. trade by slowing export growth and increasing imports, leading to potential benefits for consumers but also creating trade tensions. The debate on trade policy goes beyond free trade versus protectionism. The trade policy debate in the United States extends beyond free trade versus protectionism to involve various macroeconomic policies, foreign market participation, competitiveness of U.S. firms and workers, global value chains, and international financial stability. The goal is to maintain a high standard of living through innovation and responsiveness to global competition while protecting stakeholders from noncompetitive trade practices. Congress has the authority over foreign trade according to the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate foreign trade through tariffs. Congressional debates often revolved around high tariffs benefiting northern manufacturing regions and low tariffs benefiting southern raw material exporting regions. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 raised U.S. tariff rates, leading to a decline in world trade and worsening the Great Depression. Since then, Congress has delegated some trade authority to the executive branch. The Tariff Act of 1930 delegated trade authority to the executive branch. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, allowing the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 aimed to open markets and address nontariff barriers. Congressional approval is required for changes in nontariff barriers in trade agreements. The Act has been renewed and amended five times, including granting \"fast-track\" trade negotiating authority. Trade negotiating authority, known as trade promotion authority (TPA) since 2002, is exercised by Congress through laws authorizing trade programs and overseeing trade policies. This includes U.S. trade agreement negotiations, tariffs, trade remedy laws, import/export policies, economic sanctions, and federal trade policy functions. Congress also plays a role in international investment and finance policy, overseeing bilateral investment treaties, U.S. financial commitments to multilateral development banks, and authorizing agencies like the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment. Congress has oversight over agencies like the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, as well as the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. Legislation to renew TPA was signed by President Obama in 2015, allowing expedited procedures for trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress oversight over U.S. trade policy negotiating objectives and consultation requirements for trade agreements. TPA aims to preserve Congress's role in implementing legislation for trade agreements and ensure the credibility of the executive branch in negotiations. Congress has renewed TPA five times since 1974, with the latest authority expiring on July 1, 2021. The United States has historically led in establishing multilateral agreements under the World Trade Organization. The United States has historically led in establishing multilateral agreements under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to reduce barriers to trade. It has concluded 14 free trade agreements with 20 countries since 1985, including negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the potential Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) with the European Union. The United States is engaged in trade liberalization efforts within and around the WTO, including negotiations to expand the WTO Information Technology Agreement and a potential Trade in Services Agreement. Congress may wish to examine agreements reached during the WTO Ministerial in Bali, Indonesia. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed free trade agreement among 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, seen as significant for the U.S. If ratified, it would be the largest U.S. FTA by trade flows to date. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed free trade agreement among 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Japan. Negotiations concluded in October 2015, with President Obama releasing the text of the agreement in November and the ministers signing it in February 2016. The 114th Congress is expected to review the TPP text and consider implementing legislation for the agreement to enter into force in the United States under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aims to liberalize trade and investment beyond WTO agreements. It is a \"living agreement\" open to new members and issues, potentially leading to a wider Asia-Pacific free trade area. South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Colombia are interested in joining. The TPP is a key part of the U.S. \"rebalance\" towards the Asia-Pacific region, evolving from a smaller agreement in 2006 to a 12-country proposed FTA. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has evolved from a smaller agreement in 2006 to a 12-country proposed FTA, with the United States joining in 2008 and Japan joining in 2013. Japan's participation significantly increased the potential economic significance of the agreement to the United States. Proponents argue that the TPP will boost economic growth and jobs through expanded trade and investment with countries accounting for 37% of total U.S. trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aims to deepen U.S. trade and investment integration in the Asia-Pacific region. Proponents believe it allows the U.S. to set trade rules and show economic leadership. Opponents fear job losses and limitations on government regulation in areas like health and the environment. The U.S. International Trade Commission will assess the economic impacts of the agreement in a report due in May 2016. The TPP negotiations have raised controversial issues such as market access, intellectual property protection, environment and worker rights provisions, treatment of SOEs, investor-state dispute settlement, government procurement, and currency valuation. Congress may consider how the TPP aligns with U.S. negotiating objectives, its economic impact on U.S. firms, workers, and consumers, its geopolitical impact in the region, and its influence on the multilateral trading system. The T-TIP is a potential FTA between the U.S. and EU. The United States and European Union are in negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) to enhance trade rules and market access by addressing barriers. The timing for concluding T-TIP is uncertain due to unresolved issues and the U.S. focus on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Core components of T-TIP include reducing tariffs, enhancing cooperation in regulations, opening government procurement markets, and developing new rules in various areas. The T-TIP negotiations cover various key areas such as property rights, investment, digital trade, labor, environment, and state-owned enterprises. Regulatory cooperation and investor-state dispute settlement are active debates due to differing U.S. and EU cultural preferences. Other debated areas include geographical indications and data facilitation across borders. T-TIP is economically and strategically significant for the U.S. and EU, with global implications. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) is a significant agreement between the United States and the EU, with global implications. Supporters believe it will boost economic growth, strengthen bilateral relations, and promote trade liberalization. Opponents raise concerns about its impact on import-sensitive sectors, U.S.-EU relations, and regulatory abilities. Congress plays a key role in approving future implementing legislation for T-TIP negotiations. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) is a significant agreement between the United States and the EU with global implications. Congress oversees the negotiations and may examine how T-TIP aligns with U.S. trade objectives. Other issues for Congress include T-TIP's impact on the economy, U.S.-EU relations, and its relation to other trade agreements. The WTO administers trade rules and agreements for 162 members, with the U.S. playing a major role in its establishment. The United States played a key role in establishing the WTO in 1995 after the Uruguay Round of negotiations. The Doha Round, initiated in 2001, has been deadlocked for years. The Bali Ministerial Conference in 2013 saw the first successful conclusion of negotiations in nearly 20 years, focusing on trade facilitation, agriculture, and development measures. The 10th Ministerial Conference in Nairobi in 2015 concluded without significant progress. The 10th Ministerial Conference in Nairobi in December 2015 ended without a clear path forward for the WTO Doha Round. While some consensus was reached on limited deliverables, the future of the WTO as an effective multilateral trade negotiating organization remains uncertain due to differences between developing and advanced countries. Developing countries want to address a broad spectrum of issues under the Doha Round, while advanced countries are divided on the continuation of the round. The Nairobi Declaration emphasized the importance of a rules-based trading system with regional agreements as a complement to the multilateral forum. Some WTO members, like the US and EU, support addressing outstanding issues from the Doha Round but suggest new approaches. This could involve separating agriculture from non-agriculture issues or pursuing sectoral agreements. The WTO is working on non-agriculture issues through plurilateral agreements, such as the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) and the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA). The TFA aims to streamline the flow of goods across borders and has been ratified by 69 members so far. The WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA) provides tariff-free treatment for covered IT products on a most-favored-nation (MFN) basis. The updated version of the ITA, finalized in 2015, will eliminate tariffs on 201 additional goods over a seven-year period. The goods represent $1.3 trillion in annual global sales, with $180 billion by U.S. companies. Turkey did not join the revised version, and China maintained lengthy staging timeframes on tariffs for 40% of the items covered. The WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) provides market access for non-defense government projects to signatories. Negotiations to expand the GPA were concluded in 2012, and a revised GPA entered into force in 2014. The United States is among the 45 WTO members in the GPA. Several countries, including China, are in negotiations to join. Armenia, Montenegro, and New Zealand joined in 2015. The WTO Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) aims to liberalize trade in environmental goods. The WTO is conducting negotiations to liberalize trade in environmental goods and services through tariff elimination. The talks are based on a list of 54 environmental goods from APEC members and aim to achieve a \"critical mass\" of participation. Negotiators are working on finalizing the scope of products to be covered under the potential tariff-cutting Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA). Additionally, the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) is being discussed as a potential agreement outside of the WTO structure. The TiSA is a potential agreement outside of the WTO structure that aims to liberalize trade in services among its signatories. It includes developed and advanced developing members negotiating to expand economic activities such as construction, retail, e-commerce, financial services, and telecommunications. The impetus for TiSA arose from the lack of progress in the WTO Doha Round on services trade liberalization. Led by the United States and Australia, informal discussions began in 2012 to explore a separate agreement focused on trade in services. The United States Trade Representative notified Congress of the intention to engage in negotiations for a plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) in 2013. Negotiations have been ongoing since then, with the aim to conclude in 2016. TiSA involves the US and 22 other participants, accounting for over 70% of global trade in services. China has shown interest in joining TiSA. Discussions on services trade focus on creating trade rules applicable to various economic activities, with the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) being the only multilateral set of rules under the WTO. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is the only multilateral set of rules on trade in services under the WTO. Many experts argue that GATS needs to be updated and expanded for effective governance. The TiSA negotiations are of interest to Congress due to the significant role of the services sector in the US economy, accounting for almost 78% of GDP and over 80% of civilian employment. Services not only function as end-user products but also support the economy by enabling transportation, financial services, e-commerce, and cross-border data flows. The TiSA negotiations are important for Congress as they aim to open services markets globally, aligning with U.S. trade policy objectives. Congress would need to approve implementing legislation for TiSA to enter into force in the United States. NAFTA, a comprehensive FTA among the United States, Canada, and Mexico, entered into force on January 1, 1994. The NAFTA agreement, in force since 1994, remains of interest to Congress due to strong trade ties with Canada and Mexico. The proposed TPP could impact NAFTA, with potential changes in trade rules, labor, and environmental provisions. The increasing number of global trade agreements and China's presence in Latin America may also affect U.S. trade policy. The growing presence of China in Latin America could impact U.S. trade policy with NAFTA partners. Proponents advocate for deeper trade ties for economic growth, while critics fear negative effects like outsourcing and lower wages. Both sides agree on the need to evaluate NAFTA's strengths and weaknesses for future trade relations. The proposed TPP may address considerations such as border infrastructure, regulatory cooperation, research and development, and income differentials within North America. If approved, the agreement could lead to modified commitments in areas like IPR, state-owned enterprises, and labor provisions. U.S.-Chinese economic ties have grown significantly since China's economic liberalization in 1979, with total bilateral trade reaching $604 billion in 2015. China's economic rise has made it the United States' second-largest trading partner, with total bilateral trade reaching $604 billion in 2015. U.S. exports to China doubled from 2006 to 2015, reaching $115.7 billion. China's large population, infrastructure needs, and rising middle class make it an important market for U.S. businesses. Boeing predicts China will need 6,020 new airplanes worth $870 billion in the next 20 years. Concerns arise over China's economic challenges, including stock market declines, currency depreciation, and slowing growth rates. Despite growing U.S.-Chinese commercial ties, trade tensions persist due to China's incomplete transition to an open-market economy. China's economic and trade policies, despite efforts to align with WTO standards, still include state-directed measures that impact U.S. economic interests and job sectors. China aims to boost domestic industries for future growth, shifting towards innovation and reducing reliance on foreign technology, leading to trade tensions with the U.S. The Chinese government denies discrimination against foreign firms amid trade tensions with the United States. U.S. business leaders remain skeptical despite China's pledge to separate indigenous innovation from government procurement. Concerns are raised about Chinese pressure on U.S. firms to establish production facilities, share technology, and set up R&D centers in exchange for market access. Foreign business groups criticize China's enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, suggesting bias against foreign firms. The Obama Administration initiated WTO dispute settlement cases against Chinese industrial policies, including preferential tax policies for domestically-produced small planes. American firms in China face challenges due to lack of effective protection and enforcement of U.S. intellectual property rights. Despite improvements, piracy rates remain high, with surveys showing dissatisfaction with China's enforcement regime. A study estimated that China accounts for a significant portion of the annual cost to the U.S. economy due to intellectual property theft. China accounts for up to 80% of the annual cost to the U.S. economy from global IPR theft. Cyberattacks by Chinese entities against U.S. firms have raised concerns over potential theft of U.S. IPR, especially trade secrets, and its implications for the U.S. economy. A report by Mandiant documented economic cyber espionage by a Chinese unit with alleged links to the PLA against 141 firms since 2006. The U.S. Department of Justice issued an indictment against five members of the PLA for cyber espionage targeting U.S. firms, marking the first federal action against state actors. President Obama authorized sanctions against persons engaging in cyber-enabled activities. Before Chinese President Xi's visit, there were reports of possible sanctions on Chinese entities for cyber-theft. This led to high-level talks between China and the U.S. on cybersecurity. An agreement was reached between President Obama and President Xi on cybersecurity, stating that neither country would support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property. Both the U.S. and China agreed not to conduct or support cyber theft of intellectual property for competitive advantage. They established a high-level dialogue mechanism to address cybercrime and improve communication on cyber-related concerns. Analysts have varying opinions on how effective the agreement will be in addressing cyber theft issues. The U.S. and China have agreed not to support cyber theft of intellectual property. Analysts have differing opinions on the effectiveness of this agreement. Identifying hackers and tracing cyber theft to a government entity is challenging. U.S. economic policy towards China aims to rebalance its economy by boosting domestic consumption and eliminating distortive economic policies. This could increase China's demand for imports, promote competition, improve living standards, and reduce trade tensions with the U.S. The Communist Party of China held the 3rd Plenum of its 18th Party Congress in November 2013, aiming to initiate new economic reforms to improve living standards and reduce trade tensions with the United States. The market was highlighted to play a \"decisive\" role in allocating resources, with some economic reforms implemented post-Plenum, such as removing interest rate controls and allowing market forces to influence the currency exchange rate. However, the impact on foreign firms doing business in China has been limited. The business climate in China has worsened in recent years, with the economy slowing down. Economists warn of stagnation without new economic reforms. The US engages China through various fora to resolve trade disputes and expand bilateral relations. The Chinese government's upcoming five-year plan may contain extensive reforms. The S&ED is a high-level bilateral forum between the US and China where China committed to various outcomes in the most recent talks, including market-oriented exchange rate reforms, economic rebalancing, financial sector liberalization, and participation in multilateral discussions on export financing disciplines. China also pledged to improve transparency and consult with the US on proposed rules for information and communications. The JCCT, established in 1983, focuses on bilateral trade and investment issues. In the November 2015 session, China made commitments to address U.S. trade concerns, including boosting market access for new biotechnology varieties of U.S. soybeans and corn, increasing cooperation in biotechnology innovation, and improving market access for U.S. pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Additionally, China pledged to discuss overcapacity in its steel and aluminum industries and allow banks to purchase ICT products of their own choosing. In 2008, the United States and China began negotiations for a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) to expand investment and trade opportunities. U.S. negotiators aim to improve the business climate for U.S. firms in China by opening up closed sectors, enhancing investor protections, and ensuring equal treatment for U.S. investors. China agreed in 2013 to negotiate a \"high standard\" BIT with a \"negative list\" approach for market access commitments. This agreement would be significant for U.S. firms in China and signal China's commitment to liberalizing its economy. China's interest in liberalizing its economy is evident through its negotiations to join the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Despite not being a member of the GPA, China is one of the world's largest public procurement markets. While China expressed interest in joining the TPP in the future, it is not currently a part of the agreement. China has expressed interest in joining the TPP in the future, which could accelerate its market reforms and improve the business climate for U.S. firms. The TPP aims to balance China's economic influence in Asia, while China is also negotiating trade agreements with multiple partners, including the RCEP with ASEAN countries, Australia, India, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand. The U.S. government seeks to expand exports and investment to support U.S. jobs and economic growth through various assistance programs for businesses. The Ex-Im Bank, the official U.S. export credit agency, provides assistance to U.S. businesses through direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance. This raises issues for Congress regarding economic justifications, impact on the U.S. economy, alignment with policy goals, resource adequacy, and organizational efficiency. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) provides support to U.S. businesses when alternative financing is not available or to counter government-backed export credit financing from other countries. Its activities are backed by the U.S. government's full faith and credit, and it operates based on statutory and policy requirements. Ex-Im Bank assesses credit and other risks, charges interest and fees for its services, and is demand-driven based on U.S. commercial interests. Congress sets an annual appropriation for its operating expenses. The Export-Import Bank Reform Reauthorization Act (Division E, P.L. 114-94) renewed Ex-Im Bank's authority through FY2019 with bipartisan support. Debate continues over Ex-Im Bank's impact on U.S. exports and jobs, with proponents citing its role in filling financing gaps and critics raising concerns about crowding out private sector activity and posing risks to taxpayers. The nomination of members to Ex-Im Bank's Board of Directors may also be considered in the second session of the 114th Congress. The Ex-Im Bank's Board of Directors nominations are crucial for approving transactions, but current vacancies prevent financial commitments above $10 million. Congress may oversee reforms required by the 2015 reauthorization act. International ECA activities also present issues, following OECD guidelines to ensure fair competition. Foreign ECAs, including China, provide significant financing outside OECD guidelines, raising competitiveness concerns for Ex-Im Bank. China alone offered $670 billion in ECA financing over two years, surpassing Ex-Im Bank's total financing in its 80-year history. Efforts are underway to establish new multilateral rules on ECA financing. Congress may need to address the effectiveness of current international ECA rules and negotiations for enhancing or developing new arrangements. OPIC, the official U.S. development finance institution, provides political risk insurance and financing to U.S. firms investing in developing economies to mitigate risks like currency inconvertibility and expropriation. Similar to Ex-Im Bank, OPIC's activities are backed by the U.S. government and it charges fees for its services. OPIC, like Ex-Im Bank, charges fees for its services and is subject to annual appropriations. Congress reauthorized OPIC in 2003 and has extended its authority through the annual appropriations process. Adjustments to OPIC's activities have been made through appropriations acts, such as environmental policies. Reauthorization of OPIC could provide Members with greater opportunity to consider other aspects. Consideration of OPIC's reauthorization could allow Members to address issues like aligning its activities with U.S. foreign policy objectives. The debate over Ex-Im Bank could influence future discussions on OPIC reauthorization. Congress may also be interested in the changing landscape of international development finance, including the rise of emerging markets and new multilateral institutions. ITA, part of the Department of Commerce, aims to enhance U.S. industry competitiveness and promote trade while ensuring compliance with trade laws. The Global Markets unit of ITA provides export assistance to U.S. companies seeking foreign business opportunities, including export counseling, market research, business matching services, and advocacy. ITA's network of trade promotion professionals in over 70 countries promotes U.S. exports and attracts investment to the United States. Possible issues for Congress include ITA's organizational structure alignment, funding levels, and role in U.S. export promotion efforts. The Trade and Development Agency (TDA) operates under a dual mission of advancing economic development and U.S. commercial interests in developing and middle-income countries by linking U.S. businesses to export opportunities overseas through infrastructure development. Congress may want to examine TDA's role in supporting U.S. trade and foreign policy goals. The Departments of Commerce, State, and Defense administer programs for nuclear materials, defense articles, and dual-use goods. Congress legislates country-specific sanctions to address proliferation, regional stability, and human rights concerns. Balancing foreign policy and national security with commercial interests is a challenge. The Obama Administration initiated a review of the export control system in 2009. Control of exports is divided among Commerce, State, and Treasury based on product nature. The Obama Administration initiated a review of the export control system in 2009, with control divided among Commerce, State, and Treasury based on product nature. The Administration's reform agenda includes creating a single export control licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing a single enforcement coordination agency, and implementing changes in three phases. Efforts have been made to harmonize the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List. The Obama Administration initiated a review of the export control system in 2009, with control divided among Commerce, State, and Treasury based on product nature. Efforts have been made to harmonize the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List by transferring less sensitive items to the Commerce Control List. Congressional notification is required for such transfers, with rules issued for 15 of 21 USML categories. The President determined that transitioning certain satellites and related items to the Commerce Control List was in the national interest. An Export Enforcement Coordination Center (E2C2) was established by executive order in 2010. The Export Enforcement Coordination Center (E2C2) was created by executive order in 2010 within the Department of Homeland Security to synchronize enforcement efforts. An integrated information technology system based on the Defense Department's USXports platform became fully operational among various departments on October 5, 2015. The 114th Congress may examine this effort through oversight and approve proposed changes, including the creation of a licensing agency. Congress may also reauthorize or rewrite the expired Export Administration Act (EAA), the basis of dual-use export controls. Economic sanctions are coercive measures taken against a target to induce policy changes, including trade embargoes and restrictions on exports or imports. The United States applies economic trade and aid sanctions based on various factors such as human rights, terrorism, weapons proliferation, and corruption. These sanctions are used against foreign governments identified as supporters of certain activities. The United States maintains robust sanctions against foreign governments supporting terrorism, nuclear proliferation, human rights violations, and regional instability. Sanctions also target individuals involved in terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and weapons proliferation, as well as entities restricted by the United Nations Security Council. The 114th Congress faced historic foreign policy challenges in its first session. The 114th Congress faced historic foreign policy challenges in its first session, including changing relations with Iran and Cuba, tensions with Russia over Crimea and Syria, and North Korea's hydrogen bomb test. Legislative developments in the second session focused on these hotspots, such as strengthening sanctions on North Korea and reaching agreements with Iran. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-17; H.R. 1191; 129 Stat. 201) required the President to delay sanctions relief as part of the agreement between the P5+1 and Iran. Despite Congress seeking a role in assessing the agreement, they ultimately did not adopt a joint resolution to disapprove it. Interest remains in Congress to slow the implementation of the agreement with Cuba and strengthen sanctions on various targets. Efforts to normalize relations with Cuba include opening embassies, removing the terrorism designation, and easing economic restrictions. Legislative proposals in the 114th Congress focus on easing trade and travel restrictions. North Korea's recent hydrogen fusion bomb test has prompted Congress to consider strengthening sanctions due to the country's pursuit of nuclear weapons and aggressive behavior towards neighboring countries. President Obama has criticized North Korea for its destabilizing actions and policies. The United States currently prohibits most trade with North Korea to address the national security threat posed by its weapons development and illicit activities. Obama imposed additional restrictions on North Korea for its provocative actions, including cyberattacks on Sony Pictures. Congress aims to strengthen sanctions, potentially impacting Chinese banks. The US, EU, and other nations blocked assets of Russian leaders to reverse annexation of Crimea. Obama issued executive orders to isolate Putin and prohibit investments. The US imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 to isolate Putin and restrict trade in various sectors. Russia retaliated with bans on agricultural imports. Despite the stalemate, Russia plays a crucial role in global affairs. US trade policies are influenced by economic, foreign policy, and political factors. The US trade policies are influenced by economic, foreign policy interests, and political considerations. Supporting freer trade and open markets is believed to bring economic benefits, but some industries and workers may suffer from import competition. International trade rules allow for temporary protection from import surges and unfair imports. The US government provides relief to affected workers, firms, and farmers through the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. Additionally, US import policies support open trade with developing countries through trade preference programs. Trade preference programs provide nonreciprocal access to the U.S. market to support economic growth in developing countries. Congress is directly interested in trade policy areas such as trade remedies, preferences, border security, tariffs, and trade adjustment assistance. The U.S. and its trading partners use trade remedies like antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard to address unfair trade practices and protect domestic industries and workers. Trade remedy laws, administered by the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission, provide relief from import surges of fairly traded goods. Remedies include additional duties in antidumping and countervailing duty cases, and temporary import quotas or tariffs in safeguard cases. The World Trade Organization agreements also impose obligations on these measures. Congressional interest is often seen in these cases, especially when constituents are involved as domestic manufacturers or importers. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Act of 2015 requires CBP to investigate AD/CVD duty evasion allegations and negotiate with other countries' customs authorities. It also establishes obtaining a commitment for cooperation on evasion as a U.S. trade negotiating objective. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Act of 2015 requires CBP to investigate duty evasion allegations and negotiate with other countries' customs authorities. Congress has created six trade preference programs to assist developing countries, providing duty-free access to the U.S. market for select exports. The 114th Congress passed the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 to reauthorize AGOA, GSP, and HOPE programs. They also passed customs legislation for duty-free treatment on select U.S. imports from Nepal. Congress will continue oversight on these programs and may examine the impact of proposed U.S. trade agreements on preference program beneficiaries. The GSP program provides duty-free tariff treatment to products from designated beneficiary developing countries. The GSP program provides duty-free tariff treatment to products from designated beneficiary developing countries based on criteria specified by Congress. Countries must meet certain criteria, including protecting intellectual property rights and worker rights, to remain eligible. The program includes limits on product eligibility to protect U.S. manufacturers and workers, with specific exclusions for certain products and quantity/value limits for imports. The program was first authorized in the Trade Act of 1974 and was most recently extended until December 31, 2017. The GSP program was most recently extended until December 31, 2017, with retroactive renewal for eligible entries. New product categories were designated for GSP status, and countries are eligible until they reach a \"high income\" status. Seychelles, Uruguay, and Venezuela were determined to be \"high income\" countries, ending their BDC designation. Russia's GSP status was officially terminated on October 3, 2014. On October 3, 2014, the President terminated Russia's GSP status based on economic development criteria. AGOA is a U.S. trade preference program for sub-Saharan African countries, offering more extensive benefits than GSP, including duty-free treatment for textile and apparel products. Least-developed AGOA countries can export apparel duty-free regardless of fabric origin. AGOA was authorized by Congress in 2000. AGOA was authorized by Congress in 2000 to encourage export-led growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The 114th Congress extended AGOA's authorization to September 30, 2025, including textile and apparel provisions. Congressional debate prior to the 2015 reauthorization focused on concerns over underutilization of preferences and developing a more reciprocal trading framework, with resistance to expanding product coverage to sensitive agricultural goods like sugar. Reforms to the AGOA program included changes to eligibility review processes, rules of origin, and encouraging country-specific utilization strategies. Additional U.S. government staff were required to assist exporters with meeting food safety standards. South Africa's eligibility for AGOA was reviewed due to concerns over restrictions on U.S. poultry exports, but it retained eligibility and reached an agreement with the United States. South Africa has retained its AGOA eligibility and reached an agreement with the United States to resolve issues regarding U.S. exports. The U.S. declared certain South African exports ineligible for AGOA, effective March 15, 2016, pending the removal of barriers to U.S. agriculture exports. The ten-year reauthorization of AGOA, along with the apparel program and third-country fabric provision, is unprecedented in the program's history. This longer-term reauthorization aims to address investor uncertainty and give AGOA beneficiaries a competitive advantage in exporting to the U.S. market. The U.S. has enacted a new preference program for Nepal similar to AGOA and GSP. The program allows duty-free access for certain products imported directly from Nepal, subject to eligibility requirements. Congress may need to examine the implementation and effectiveness of AGOA's reforms. The International Trade Commission must determine that products imported into the US from Nepal are not import-sensitive. Nepal would follow rules of origin, graduation, and other requirements like AGOA and GSP programs. A Nepali-specific trade facilitation and capacity building program must be established by the President. The program expires on December 31, 2025. US Customs and Border Protection ensures smooth import flow through US ports of entry, handling over $2 trillion in imports in 2013. CBP's policies aim to facilitate cargo flow, enforce trade laws, protect consumers, and collect customs revenue. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 reauthorizes CBP's trade functions to protect U.S. consumers, enforce import security laws, and collect customs revenue. It provides funding for CBP's modernization efforts, including the development of the Automated Commercial Environment and the International Trade Data System. Congress plays a direct role in organizing and defining CBP's international trade functions. Many Members of Congress have introduced bills supporting importer requests for temporary tariff suspensions on non-domestically made components used in manufacturing to reduce costs and increase competitiveness. These bills are often combined into a miscellaneous tariff bill, with the most recent one expiring in 2012. Consideration of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) could be controversial due to past congressional moratoriums on \"earmarks.\" In the first session of the 114th Congress, a Senate amendment was inserted in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 proposing a process for duty suspension requests. The enacted legislation expressed the need for a regular legislative process for an MTB. TAA provides federal assistance to those affected by trade liberalization. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides assistance to workers who have lost their jobs due to increased imports or job shifts to foreign countries. It aims to help affected parties while promoting freer trade and reducing tensions among trade partners. TAA is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974 and was reauthorized in 2015. The program offers training subsidies, employment services, and income support to prepare workers for new occupations. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides training subsidies, employment services, and income support to workers affected by increased imports or job shifts to foreign countries. TAA benefits are available to workers in production and service industries, as well as to firms and farmers impacted by international competition. TAA for Firms offers technical assistance and matching funds for business recovery plans, while TAA for Farmers provides support to agricultural producers and fishermen affected by imports. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are legal rights granted by governments to inventors and artists, providing time-limited monopolies to use and market their creations. IPR infringement has adverse consequences for U.S. interests in commerce, health, safety, and security. Protection and enforcement of IPR, especially in the digital environment, is a growing concern, including cybertheft. The U.S. seeks IP commitments in trade agreements that exceed minimum standards of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. The 2015 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to ensure U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) meet high standards of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, known as \"TRIPS-plus.\" It includes objectives on digital media IPR, cybertheft, and trade secrets. IPR was a key issue in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, with provisions on pharmaceutical patents and data exclusivity. The 2015 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to ensure high standards of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs), known as \"TRIPS-plus.\" This includes patent protections, data exclusivity periods for biologics, copyright protections, trademark protection, and enhanced enforcement measures. Congress is considering next steps on TPP. The negotiated outcomes on intellectual property rights (IPR) in the proposed agreement are subject to debate as Congress considers next steps on TPP. Specific provisions, such as data exclusivity protection for biologics, and comparisons of IPR standards in TPP to existing U.S. FTAs are key areas of discussion. Other issues include addressing U.S. trade negotiating objectives on IPR and balancing right holders' protection with broader benefits in U.S. trade policy. Congressional oversight may also extend to IPR issues in other trade agreements, such as the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) negotiations, which present opportunities for cooperation on issues like trade secret theft. The United States utilizes various trade policy tools to advance intellectual property rights (IPR) goals, especially in dealing with emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil. One such tool is the \"Special 301\" report published annually by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to identify countries lacking adequate IPR protection. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 modifies the \"Special 301\" report, requiring USTR to designate countries on watch lists for inadequate IPR protection. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125) modifies \"Special 301\" to include identifying countries that deny adequate protection to trade secrets. The Section 337 process allows the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate allegations of U.S. IP infringement and issue orders to prohibit counterfeit products. The 114th Congress may review the effectiveness of Special 301 and Section 337, focusing on digital trade barriers and preserving a free internet. In the 114th Congress, key issues include oversight of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and digital trade issues in the proposed TPP, T-TIP, and TiSA. Prominent issues in negotiations include cross-border data flows, cybersecurity, forced source-code disclosure, and consumer protection. Increasing cross-border data flows could boost the U.S. GDP by 0.1% to 0.3%. The Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the Safe Harbor Agreement between the US and EU due to concerns about data privacy. A new framework agreement called the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was announced to replace the Safe Harbor Agreement. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, a replacement for the invalidated Safe Harbor Agreement, includes new obligations on the U.S. government and companies, such as a new ombudsman and data processing requirements. It also involves proactive monitoring and enforcement, with an annual joint review by the U.S. and EU. The United States' dual role as a major source and recipient of foreign direct investment highlights the impact of globalization on its economy and interests in international policies. The United States has established policies treating foreign investors equally to U.S. firms, with exceptions for national security. The President has broad authority over U.S. direct investment policy, including the ability to block investments threatening national security. Congress also plays a role in shaping foreign investment policy, especially after the 9/11 attacks raised concerns about the impact of foreign investment on national security. In July 2007, Congress established the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to oversee foreign investment transactions, including homeland security and critical infrastructure. The President can block investments threatening national security under the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 allows the blocking of investments that pose a threat to U.S. national security, without clearly defining what constitutes such a threat. The law has been used twice to prevent foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms, sparking discussions in Congress about the impact of foreign investment on the economy and national economic security. The United States negotiates International Investment Agreements (IIAs) to promote foreign investment, ensure fair treatment of investors, and advance U.S. interests through Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) or BIT-like chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs). The majority approval of trade agreement implementing legislation by Congress is crucial. U.S. IIAs are seen as comprehensive and of high standard. Trade negotiating objectives aim to reduce barriers to foreign investment. The Trans-Pacific Partnership includes core investor protections and new provisions. The Trans-Pacific Partnership includes core investor protections, exceptions for tobacco control measures, and procedures for transparency and dismissal of frivolous claims. Congress may revisit these investor protections when considering implementing legislation for TPP. Key issues include the level of protection for investors, balancing against other interests, and equal treatment of U.S. and foreign investors. The United States is examining investment rules for U.S. and foreign investors, comparing TPP commitments to past agreements, and considering implications on future IIAs and trade agreements. Issues also arise in T-TIP negotiations, BIT discussions with China and India, and potential treaties with the East African Community. These negotiations are of oversight interest during the second session of the 114th Congress. The United States is focusing on attracting investment through the Department of Commerce's SelectUSA program, which aims to coordinate federal efforts to attract and retain business investment in the country. The program operates with a budget of less than $1 million each year and seeks to be geographically neutral regarding investment locations. In March 2015, efforts were announced to enhance the program, including the establishment of a federal advisory committee. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 1007 was introduced to authorize appropriations for SelectUSA at $20 million annually over 2016-2020, with reporting requirements on program activities and impact. Congress may consider SelectUSA's authorization status, funding levels, and effectiveness in supporting U.S. investment goals. Congressional interest also includes oversight of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) like the IMF and MDBs, with Congress appropriating funds and overseeing U.S. participation in them. The United States is a member and major contributor to International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs) like the World Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Inter-American Development Bank. These institutions played a crucial role in responding to the global financial crisis in 2008 and the Eurozone crisis by increasing lending to help countries cope with reduced economic growth. Concerns about currency manipulation by other countries have also been a key issue for some Members of Congress. In the 114th Congress, legislative action was taken on concerns about currency manipulation by other countries, including in Trade Promotion Authority and customs legislation. Emerging markets like China and their role in international financial institutions are major policy issues. Recent congressional focus has been on IMF resources post-2008 crisis, proposed governance changes, and the IMF's involvement in the Eurozone debt crisis. IMF reforms in 2010 aimed to increase funding and representation of major emerging markets. The IMF reform package requires approval from three-fifths of IMF members representing 85% of the total voting power, with the United States holding a crucial 16.75% voting power. Congressional authorization is needed for the US to consent to changing its quota in the IMF. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act authorizes US participation in the reform package, transferring $56.7 billion in financial commitments to quota. The United States commitment to the IMF nearly doubled to $115.2 billion, with U.S. commitments to the NAB falling to $39.1 billion. Debate in the U.S. focuses on increasing the IMF quota, control over financial resources in the NAB, budgetary treatment of U.S. participation, and IMF policy decisions. The U.S. retains veto power and a representative on the IMF Executive Board. The FY2016 appropriations act restricts transfer from the NAB to quota until the U.S. Treasury certifies steps to seek eliminating the IMF's \"systemic exemption.\" The United States has increased its commitment to the IMF, with a focus on increasing the IMF quota and control over financial resources. The FY2016 appropriations act requires the U.S. Treasury to certify steps to seek eliminating the IMF's \"systemic exemption\" policy, which allows large-scale lending programs despite concerns about debt sustainability. IMF staff supports eliminating this policy and proposing reforms to support highly-indebted, systemically important countries. The U.S. Executive Director at the IMF must consult with Congress before approving large IMF loans. The U.S. Treasury must submit a report to Congress justifying large IMF loans and debt sustainability analysis. Policymakers emphasize U.S. participation in MDBs for veto power and support for capital increases tied to policy reforms. The Obama Administration advocates for transparency, accountability, and governance improvements in MDBs. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) was established in late 2015 with 57 founding members, including four G-7 economies. It is expected to focus on financing infrastructure projects in the region and make its first loans in mid-2016. China also has other financing mechanisms like the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The AIIB, along with other development banks like the New Development Bank, aims to finance infrastructure projects such as the \"Silk Road Economic Belt\" and the \"21st Century Maritime Silk Road.\" Concerns exist about potential duplication of existing institutions and lack of policy conditionality in financing. The United States and other major donors emphasize policy conditionality, safeguards, and governance best practices in development assistance, while developing countries view these as burdensome. The U.S. initially pressured governments not to join the AIIB and the BRICS Bank but recognizes the need for global infrastructure investment. Concerns exist about whether the AIIB will meet the high standards of existing development banks in terms of governance and environmental safeguards. The G-20 is a forum for international economic cooperation with 20 major economies accounting for 85% of global economic output. The United States may need to engage with Chinese-led regional economic institutions to maintain influence in the region. The G-20 is a forum for international economic cooperation involving 20 major economies, including the EU. Meetings focus on economic and financial issues, with discussions on development, food security, and the environment. Congress oversees the Administration's participation and may need to take legislative action to implement commitments. The G-20 has a rotating presidency, with Turkey leading in 2015 with a focus on inclusive and robust growth through collective action. In November 2015, the G-20 summit focused on strengthening global recovery, enhancing resilience and sustainability in the global economy. China held the rotating G-20 presidency in 2016, sparking debates on its leadership and priorities. Concerns were raised about currency manipulation by China, Japan, and other countries affecting U.S. companies and jobs. Japan's currency, the yen, depreciated against the U.S. dollar by about 50% between mid-2012 and the end of 2015 due to new expansionary monetary policies. Some economists question the impact of \"currency manipulation\" on the U.S. economy. The 114th Congress addressed concerns through Trade Promotion Authority legislation. The Trade Promotion Authority legislation signed into law in June 2015 includes negotiating objectives on currency manipulation. In response, TPP countries released a joint declaration in November 2015 to address unfair currency practices, emphasizing transparency and dialogue on exchange rates. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 also addresses currency manipulation through enhanced reporting and bilateral engagement on exchange rate issues. The Senate version of the bill does not include countervailing duties on currency manipulation. The United States and Europe's economic relationship is crucial, with a focus on the economic crisis in Greece and the Eurozone. Greece's crisis stems from concerns about public finances and high debt levels, impacting its economy significantly. The economic crisis in Greece has led to a collapse in economic growth, high unemployment, and instability in the banking system. Concerns about contagion to the Eurozone and global economy have been raised. The crisis has exposed issues with the Eurozone's institutional architecture. A third financial assistance package in 2015 stabilized Greece's economy, but some analysts fear a potential resurfacing of the crisis. Eurozone members face challenges with double-digit unemployment rates. Eurozone members are grappling with high unemployment rates, near-zero interest rates, low inflation, stagnant business investment, and diminishing productivity and competitiveness gains. The launch of T-TIP negotiations aimed to boost economic growth and export opportunities. In 2001, Argentina defaulted on a significant amount of foreign debt, causing a severe financial crisis. Argentina defaulted on a large amount of foreign debt in 2001, leading to the largest sovereign default in history. While the IMF was repaid in 2006, an agreement with the Paris Club creditor governments was only reached in 2014. Argentina restructured over 90% of its debt with private bondholders, but a small group of holdouts, mainly hedge funds, have not received any payment since the default. These holdouts have pursued litigation for full repayment, affecting U.S. financial institutions' ability to transfer interest payments to restructured bondholders. Argentina defaulted on a large amount of foreign debt in 2001, leading to the largest sovereign default in history. In July 2014, funds transferred from Argentina to an intermediary bank could not be disbursed to holders of restructured bonds, leading to a default declaration by Standard and Poor's. President Mauricio Macri has indicated a potential agreement with holdout creditors in 2016. Policymakers have been frustrated by Argentina's reluctance to settle with U.S. bondholders and the Paris Club. Members of Congress can influence U.S. trade policy through legislative roles. Policy and international economic issues, including potential legislation for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and oversight of U.S. trade negotiations, are key areas of interest for the 114th Congress. Congress may also address trade relations with China, U.S. export/import policies, and monitor the Eurozone and Greek debt crisis. The 114th Congress is focused on policy and international economic issues, including the Eurozone and Greek debt crisis, U.S. trade policy, and global market dynamics. Congressional actions can impact the U.S. economy, businesses, workers, and geopolitical interests. The interconnected global economy and digital trade play a significant role in shaping the debate. The second session of the 114th Congress is engaged in a robust debate on trade and finance issues. Various CRS products provide key information on trade promotion authority and trade agreements for Congress to consider. The second session of the 114th Congress is debating trade and finance issues.
