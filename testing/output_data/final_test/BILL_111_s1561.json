    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation Act of 2009\". Key findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that the United States is an Arctic nation with a 700-mile border with the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader Arctic area including the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The Arctic region is home to an indigenous population that has relied on marine mammals, fish, and wildlife for sustenance for thousands of years. The United States Arctic region has produced over 16 billion barrels of oil and may hold an additional 30 billion barrels of oil and 220 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Temperatures in the region have warmed by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius over the past 50 years, twice the global average. The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing, with estimates that the Arctic Ocean may be ice-free in summer within 30 years, impacting the indigenous people of the region. The warming Arctic region is opening up new opportunities for offshore oil and gas development, commercial fishing, marine shipping, and tourism. The United States aims to work with Alaska and neighboring countries to ensure safe shipping in the Arctic Ocean, protect the environment, and consider the needs of indigenous Arctic resource users. (8) The United States aims to ensure secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean, protect sovereign and security interests, uphold freedom of navigation rights, allow access for research vessels, and maintain peaceful relations in the region. (9) Cooperation is sought to establish international support for reliable shipping through joint investment in navigation aids, ports of refuge, communication, weather forecasting, and ice forecasting. The United States has interests in the Arctic region including research, security, environmental, and commercial activities that rely on polar class icebreakers. Sovereign interests may increase with a potential claim for an extended continental shelf. Plans include building new icebreakers, operating bases, navigation aids, and facilities. Beginning efforts to protect United States interests in the Arctic region, the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the 8-nation Arctic Council is crucial due to the extensive use of the Arctic Ocean by vessels from various nations. This includes establishing coordinated shipping regulations and oil spill prevention capabilities through international cooperation, which requires long lead times. The Act aims to ensure safe maritime shipping in the Arctic by providing aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and search and rescue. The term \"Arctic\" is defined as per the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984. Congress expresses the importance of international agreements in the Arctic region. To promote safe maritime shipping in the Arctic, Congress urges the Secretary of State to establish agreements with Arctic nations for aids to navigation, improved charts, ocean monitoring, icebreaking capabilities, oil spill response, and vessel tracking. The curr_chunk focuses on facilities for ship generated waste, search and rescue, and tracking and communications facilities in the Arctic. The curr_chunk discusses the Coast Guard's Arctic mission analysis, focusing on facilities for ship-generated waste, search and rescue, and tracking and communications facilities in the region. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit the High Latitude Polar Ice-Breaking Mission Analysis Report to Congress within 90 days, including any related recommendations. The appropriate committees of Congress are defined as the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must contract an independent entity to analyze future mission requirements in the Arctic and Antarctic, estimating necessary resources. The analysis and estimate must be submitted to Congress and the Commandant within 120 days of the contract execution. The Commandant of the Coast Guard and the Comptroller General of the United States must provide recommendations to Congress within 90 days of the analysis and estimate submission. The recommendations should be related to the analysis and estimate. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. SEC. 7. ARCTIC VESSEL TRAFFIC RISK ASSESSMENTS. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation with the appropriate Area Committee, is required to prepare vessel traffic risk assessments for the Bering Strait, Alaska, and the Arctic Ocean waters adjacent to Alaska's North Slope. The assessments will describe the amount and character of present and estimated future shipping traffic in the region. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation with the appropriate Area Committee, is required to prepare vessel traffic risk assessments for the Bering Strait, Alaska, and the Arctic Ocean waters adjacent to Alaska's North Slope. The assessments will focus on future shipping traffic in the region and the effectiveness of various measures in reducing risk. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation with the appropriate Area Committee, prepares vessel traffic risk assessments for ecological areas, navigation aids, response plans, and area contingency plans to enhance safety and security in marine shipping. Recommendations may be included to lessen potential adverse environmental impacts. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation with the appropriate Area Committee, consults with various stakeholders including government agencies, fishing industry, Alaska Natives, conservation community, and shipping industries. SEC. 8. CENTRAL BERING SEA HARBOR OF REFUGE.\n\nThe Commandant of the Coast Guard will consult with the Secretary of the Army to assess the feasibility of upgrading the harbor at St. George Island, Alaska, for year-round use as a harbor of refuge to improve safety at sea and prevent oil pollution in the Central Bering Sea. The Secretary of the Army is required to complete the necessary improvements within 3 years of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 9. REPORT ON ESTABLISHMENT OF ARCTIC DEEP WATER PORT. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will conduct a study on the feasibility of establishing a deep water sea port in the Arctic to protect strategic US interests. The study will address the capability, potential locations, resources needed, time frame, and infrastructure required for the port. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 1 year on the findings of the study conducted on the feasibility of establishing a deep water sea port in the Arctic. SEC. 10. TRANSFER OF FUNDS FOR ICEBREAKING SERVICES: The National Science Foundation will transfer funds for polar icebreaking services to the United States Coast Guard for operating expenses, renovation, and improvement. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. In fiscal year 2011, the Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to appropriate funds for the design and construction of polar class icebreakers, seasonal operations in the Arctic, agreements implementation, vessel traffic risk assessments, and construction of forward operating bases in Barrow, Nome, and other locations. In fiscal year 2011, funds are authorized for the design and construction of polar class icebreakers, seasonal operations in the Arctic, agreements implementation, vessel traffic risk assessments, and construction of forward operating bases in Barrow, Nome, and other locations. Additionally, $10,000,000 is allocated for acquiring hydrographic data, providing hydrographic services, and conducting coastal change analyses in the Arctic for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Another $5,000,000 is designated for acquiring hydrographic data and providing services in the Arctic to delineate the United States extended continental shelf for the same fiscal years."
