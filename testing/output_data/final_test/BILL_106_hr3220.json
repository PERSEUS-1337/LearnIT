The Congress finds that electronic commerce and government transactions are crucial for economic growth, consumer choice, and civic participation. Promoting private sector e-commerce through legislation is in the national interest. A consistent legal foundation for e-commerce across jurisdictions is needed to support its growth in a technology-neutral, nonregulatory manner. The world is transitioning to an information society. The transition to an information society requires innovative legal and policy approaches. States can act as laboratories of innovation for evolving public policy, but should also adopt a national baseline to eliminate barriers to electronic commerce. Federal preemption may be necessary if state laws create undue burdens on interstate commerce in electronic commerce. The need for a consistent national baseline in electronic commerce laws is emphasized, allowing jurisdictions to determine exceptions to protect consumers. Industry has developed various electronic signature technologies, and US public policies should support innovation in this area. The United States should promote a dynamic marketplace for competing technologies. States should allow the use and development of appropriate authentication technologies between private parties and state agencies.

An electronic record is created, sent, or stored electronically. An electronic signature is a sound, symbol, or process linked to a record. The term \"record\" refers to information inscribed on a tangible or electronic medium. A \"transaction\" involves actions related to commerce between individuals or entities, excluding the government. A \"governmental agency\" includes various branches of the Federal or State government. The term \"Uniform Electronic Transactions Act\" refers to the act provided to State legislatures by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law. SEC. 5. INTERSTATE CONTRACT CERTAINTY. In any interstate commerce transaction, contracts using electronic signatures or records cannot be denied legal effect. Parties can choose electronic signature technologies and methods. If a law requires a written contract, an electronic record must be deliverable in a form that can be retained and used as proof of the agreement. This section does not apply to certain statutes, regulations, or rules of law. Contracts involving electronic agents in commercial transactions affecting interstate commerce cannot be invalidated solely because electronic agents were used in their formation. This provision does not apply to specific statutes, regulations, or rules of law related to various areas such as the Uniform Commercial Code, family law matters, documents of title, residential landlord-tenant relationships, and the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act. The provision applies to contracts involving electronic agents in commercial transactions and insurance, with exceptions in states where the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act is in effect. SEC. 6. PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES IN INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS. The Federal Government aims to facilitate international commercial electronic transactions by adopting principles from the Model Law on Electronic Commerce, allowing parties to choose authentication technologies, proving validity in court, and ensuring a nondiscriminatory approach. To facilitate international electronic transactions, the Federal Government should adopt a nondiscriminatory approach to electronic signatures and authentication methods from other jurisdictions. SEC. 7. STUDY OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY BARRIERS TO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE. Each Federal agency must report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Commerce within 6 months of this Act's enactment, identifying any laws or regulations that hinder electronic transactions or online commerce. Barriers may include requirements for non-electronic signatures or transaction records. Agencies must specify barriers needing legislative action and outline plans for regulatory changes. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, will report to Congress within 18 months on legislation and actions needed to remove barriers to electronic transactions and online commerce caused by agency regulations. Consultation with relevant agencies will be conducted for this report. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with relevant agencies, will report to Congress within 18 months on legislation and actions needed to remove barriers to electronic transactions and online commerce. The report will include findings if no recommendations are provided, explaining reasons for impracticability or inconsistency with laws."
