    "content": "Finance and technological development have a long history of being interconnected. The term fintech encompasses a wide range of technologies used in various financial industries. It generally refers to recent innovations in financial activities made possible by advancements in digital technology. Key technological advancements enabling fintech include internet and mobile technology access, Big Data utilization, cloud computing, and algorithmic decision-making. The use of cloud computing services, algorithmic decision-making, and cybersecurity evolution in delivering financial services can create cost efficiencies. This can lead to reduced prices, making services more accessible to previously underserved customers and allowing businesses to reach new markets. Fintech innovations can increase accessibility for underserved groups but also pose risks and uncertainties. Some technologies may not function as intended, leading to unexpected losses. Eliminating middlemen may not always be beneficial, as experienced professionals can provide valuable financial advice to consumers. The use of financial technology (fintech) can lead to increased accessibility for underserved groups but also poses risks. Fintech startups may lack experience in complying with consumer-protection laws, potentially exposing consumers to risks they do not fully understand. There are concerns about disparate impacts on protected groups and the exclusion of those who cannot afford high-speed internet and mobile devices. The use of digital technology in finance generates sensitive data that can be used to assess risks but also raises privacy concerns and the risk of data theft. The use of financial technology (fintech) raises concerns over data privacy and security, as well as questions about data ownership and control. Congress and policymakers need to consider if existing laws adequately address the risks and benefits of fintech. The report examines technological developments in financial services, examples of innovative technology in financial activities, and regulatory approaches to integrating new technologies. Fintech is enabled by advances in general-use technologies for financial activities, with policy issues related to regulation and online companies' rapid growth in financial markets being key considerations for Congress. The rapid growth of small fintech startups in the financial market may be facilitated by adopting information technology, but this could require significant investment. Larger technology firms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google are entering the financial services sector, potentially becoming competitors or partners with traditional financial institutions. Platforms offering access to multiple financial institutions through a single channel are predicted to dominate the delivery of financial services, raising concerns about industry concentration. Consumer disclosures for financial products are also a key consideration in this evolving landscape. Consumer disclosures for financial products are evolving as firms transition to electronic formats. Online disclosures may need to be designed differently than paper disclosures to effectively communicate with consumers. The internet also raises questions about the role of geography-based financial regulations in the future, as many regulations are currently based on geographic considerations in the dual federal-state regulatory system. Fintech companies are regulated at the state level and subject to consumer-protection laws. There is a debate over whether state or national regulators are best suited to oversee these nonbank companies. The OCC's initiative to grant special-purpose bank charters to fintechs has sparked lawsuits from state regulators. The Community Reinvestment Act is also a point of contention regarding how a bank's geographic assessment area should be defined. The assessment area for the Community Reinvestment Act is a concern due to the shift to online services. Electronic disclosures may hinder customer understanding despite cost savings. Financial regulatory agencies create form designs for compliance with consumer-disclosure laws. Financial regulatory agencies may need to update consumer testing research as more credit origination moves online. Big Data refers to vast amounts of data that require specialized hardware and software for storage and analysis, with characteristics including volume, velocity, variety, and variability. Big Data encompasses volume, velocity, variety, and variability. Volume refers to extensive data size, velocity to data flow rate, variety to different data types, and variability to changing data attributes. Big Data is used for insights, decision-making, and enabling scalable IT systems. Big Data enables new methods for analyzing extensive and complex information, such as cloud computing resources. It revolutionizes loan underwriting in the financial services industry by allowing online processing with a wider range of current data sources, improving speed and accuracy in decision-making. However, concerns arise regarding privacy and the appropriateness of data collection. New technologies in the financial services sector have led to the development of products that allow consumers to combine accounts with multiple providers on a single platform. Data aggregators compile information from various sources into a standardized form, with web scraping being a common technique used to collect account data. Financial institutions may also provide customer account information through structured data feeds or applications. Accessing customer account information through APIs may have advantages over web scraping, such as increased security in terms of cybersecurity and fraud risks. Open banking standards using APIs facilitate data sharing between financial firms, enabling new financial products that benefit consumers by allowing them to manage finances, set goals, receive personalized recommendations, apply for loans, and perform other tasks. However, increased data access may pose data security and privacy risks to consumers. Questions exist about how current laws and regulations should apply to Big Data, particularly in relation to concerns about privacy and cybersecurity. There is a debate on whether data security standards should be prescriptive or outcome-based. Additionally, there are questions about the coverage of relevant data security laws and whether they should be expanded to include all sensitive individual financial information. Alternative data, which includes non-traditional data used to calculate credit scores, is becoming more prevalent with advancements in technology. Alternative data, including non-traditional sources, is increasingly used by financial institutions to calculate credit scores. This data can range from payment information on non-loan products to consumer stability indicators like changes in residences or employment. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has identified various types of alternative data that can be utilized for this purpose. Alternative data, such as consumer behavior and social connections, can be used by financial institutions to expand credit access. However, this poses risks related to data security and consumer protection. Institutions can mitigate these risks through data encryption and governance practices. Some borrowers may not be aware that alternative data is used in credit decisions, raising privacy concerns. Alternative data used in credit decisions may raise privacy and consumer-protection concerns, as well as fair lending risks. It could potentially increase accuracy and visibility in credit reporting, allowing lenders to assess creditworthiness of previously invisible consumers. However, it may also harm existing credit scores if negative information is included. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulates the credit reporting industry, requiring consumer reporting agencies to adopt procedures that are fair and equitable to consumers. Using alternative data for credit reporting raises compliance questions under the FCRA, as some data may have accuracy issues and managing disputes can be time-consuming. These regulations may deter organizations from furnishing alternative data, even though it could potentially benefit some consumers. The CFPB and federal banking regulators have been monitoring alternative data developments and released a policy statement on its appropriate use in underwriting. This followed a 2017 request for information on alternative data use in credit processes, leading to principles for consumer-authorized financial data sharing in 2017. These principles focus on consumer access, control, consent, and data security. The CFPB issued a no-action letter to Upstart Network in 2017 for using alternative data in credit decisions. In 2018, the Treasury Department released a report on regulatory recommendations, including consumer financial data. Financial activities involve resource allocation decisions based on analysis of information. Technological advances have enabled automation of complex tasks previously done by humans. Technological advances have enabled computers to perform complex tasks previously done by humans, creating potential benefits and risks in financial regulatory implications. Financial firms have used algorithms to automate decision-making in lending and investment management industries, potentially improving risk assessment and capital allocation. Automation could reduce inefficiencies, lower prices, and increase access to financial services for consumers and small businesses. Automation in financial industries has benefits for consumers, small businesses, and the underserved but also raises concerns about market instability and discrimination. Algorithms can fail due to errors or unforeseen conditions, leading to significant losses, as seen in events like the Flash Crash of May 6, 2010. Automated decisions may also have adverse impacts on protected groups, such as in lending. Automated lending programs using artificial intelligence may unintentionally discriminate against minority loan applicants due to historical data biases. The complexity of these programs and their ability to self-adjust without human input raise policy concerns regarding fair lending practices. The use of AI in decision-making processes can be challenging for regulators and companies due to the unpredictability of AI programs. To address this \"black box\" problem, some suggest setting standards for the development, testing, and monitoring of AI programs. Congress could potentially direct financial regulatory agencies to develop and implement rules for AI programs. Cloud computing allows users to transfer their information to leased resources, eliminating the need to own and manage technical resources. Cloud and high-performance computing are better for processing Big Data than desktop computing. While many interchangeably refer to Big Data and cloud computing, they are technically distinct. Cloud computing is commonly used by financial institutions to store and process large amounts of data related to customer accounts and transactions. It may be more cost-effective for some companies to use a cloud service provider rather than managing everything in-house. However, cloud computing introduces information security considerations and risks due to data not being physically under the user's direct control. Cloud providers argue that although they have physical access to the data stored on their servers, they do not have logical access to it, nor do they own the data. This is to counter the risk of unauthorized access spreading beyond intended users. Another concern is the insider threat, where a trusted insider could manipulate encrypted files to keep information confidential but unavailable. Users may need to rely on the provider to restore functioning backups in such cases. Cloud providers offer encryption and key-management services to keep data confidential. Financial institutions face insider threats, which are heightened when using cloud services. Risk management depends on the quality of policies and the relationship with the cloud provider. Policymakers and firms must consider the regulatory framework, operational risks, and relationships with cloud providers in the context of cloud computing. The Bank Services Company Act (BSCA; P.L. 87-856) may play a role in regulating these relationships. The Bank Services Company Act (BSCA; P.L. 87-856) requires regulators to subject activities performed by bank service providers to the same regulatory requirements as if they were performed by the bank itself, potentially burdening banks and cloud service providers. Bank regulators may face challenges in supervising cloud service providers due to unfamiliarity with the industry, as seen in the Federal Reserve's examination of Amazon Web Services (AWS). The cloud computing industry poses risks to financial system stability as resources are pooled among providers, potentially leading to widespread impact. AWS's reluctance to provide requested information highlights concerns about data storage and access. Financial institutions are increasingly reliant on cloud services, which could pose a risk to the financial system if a disruption occurs. Regulators may need to assess their ability to regulate cloud service providers effectively. Cybersecurity is a major concern for banks and regulators, as they aim to protect against physical and electronic threats to their assets and operations. Maintaining the confidentiality, security, and integrity of data held by banks is crucial for trust in the banking industry. Criminals can exploit the vast amount of personal and financial information stored by financial institutions, leading to large-scale fraud and theft. Cyber attacks can result in the theft of thousands of credit cards at once, posing a significant risk to consumers and businesses. The IRS was hacked in May 2015, leading to $50 million in fraudulent tax returns. The Equifax breach in 2017 exposed data of 148 million consumers. Financial institutions must comply with various cybersecurity laws like Dodd-Frank and GLBA to mitigate risks. The framework governing financial services cybersecurity, including laws like GLBA and Sarbanes-Oxley, is complex and evolving to address increased risks from digitization. Successful hacks underscore the importance of effective oversight to protect against cyberattacks without excessive costs. The framework governing financial services cybersecurity is complex and evolving to address increased risks from digitization. Concerns about data security and privacy arise as financial institutions record and analyze individuals' transactions. Debates over the use and sharing of consumer data between institutions remain unresolved. Innovative financial technology may raise questions about existing laws. This section explores fintech innovations, their benefits, risks, and related policy issues Congress is considering. Traditional lending involved in-person interactions with human underwriters assessing creditworthiness. Automation in underwriting, starting with FICO in 1989, has become more prevalent, using algorithms to streamline the process. Automation in underwriting relies on algorithms to determine credit extension and terms, while human underwriting involves personal judgment. New lenders, known as marketplace or fintech lenders, use online platforms and alternative data to assess credit risk beyond traditional methods. Fintech lending uses alternative data to assess credit risk and extend credit to borrowers with thin credit histories or small businesses. This raises questions about data accessibility, potential disparate impacts, and consumer protection violations. Fintech lending has been growing rapidly, with personal loans totaling $17.7 billion in 2017, up from $2.5 billion in 2013. The policy questions surrounding fintech lending revolve around current regulatory issues. Many policy questions surround fintech lending, particularly regarding the regulatory framework and potential benefits and risks. Critics argue that current regulations are burdensome, especially for nonbank lenders operating in a borderless internet-based industry. State-level licensing and consumer protection laws, including usury laws, are seen as important safeguards. Partnerships between fintech companies and banks for issuing loans also raise additional policy questions. Fintech companies and banks engage in various arrangements for online lending, including underwriting, funding, and loan origination. Banks must carefully consider compliance obligations related to vendor relationships. Legal questions arise regarding federal preemption of state usury laws for loans originated by banks but sold to nonbank entities. Laws and regulations governing these arrangements need to balance credit availability with consumer protection. The debate over fintech lending revolves around the balance between expanding credit availability and protecting consumers. Proponents argue that fintech technologies can provide fair and safe credit access to individuals and small businesses. However, some consumer advocates are concerned about the lack of federal regulatory supervision, which could lead to violations of consumer protection regulations. Some lenders may unintentionally discriminate against protected groups, violating fair lending laws. When denying a loan, lenders must provide an adverse action notice to explain the reason. Questions arise on lenders' ability to understand and explain adverse actions resulting from algorithmic decisions. As banking transactions shift to digital channels, institutions without expertise in technology face challenges. Banks increasingly rely on third-party vendors for software and technical support, leading regulators to scrutinize how banks manage operational risks, especially cyber risks. Regulators require institutions using third-party vendors to ensure they meet regulatory requirements. The Bank Service Company Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act give regulators authority to supervise third-party vendors providing services to banks. These acts require banks to treat activities performed by vendors as if they were done by the bank itself and establish standards for information security to protect customer data. Regulatory guidelines issued in 2001 mandate banks to have information security programs in place. Banks are required to establish information security programs to assess and mitigate risks to consumer information, including oversight of third-party vendors like TSPs. Regulations aimed at banks' relationships with third-party vendors have benefits in reducing operational risks but can be costly for banks, especially smaller institutions. Compliance with regulator standards for third-party vendors may pose challenges for community banks and small credit unions. Some banks may struggle with expertise and resources in selecting and monitoring third-party vendors to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. Compliance costs can drive industry consolidation as smaller banks may merge to meet obligations. Consumers have various electronic transaction options. Noncash transactions, such as card payments and digital wallets, offer convenience for consumers and merchants. However, accessing electronic payment networks often involves fees, which can be a barrier for some individuals. Alternative services like prepaid cards allow for electronic payments without a traditional bank account. Cash payments may be the most affordable option for certain groups despite the convenience of electronic payment methods like prepaid cards. The evolution towards electronic payments could have both positive and negative outcomes, with proponents citing reduced costs associated with cash production and opponents warning of further marginalization of those with limited access to the financial system. While consumers prefer debit and credit cards, cash still plays a significant role in retail and person-to-person transactions, especially for smaller transactions and lower-income households. Electronic payments and cash displacement have implications for security and privacy. Not having cash on store premises can reduce theft risk but increase fees to payment processors. Consumers may be denied services if they only use cash, leading to erosion of privacy with electronic payments. As more transactions go electronic, data is exposed to cyber attacks. Policymakers must consider the benefits and costs of moving away from cash. For more information, see CRS Report R45716 by David W. Perkins. The Federal Reserve plans to introduce an RTP system called FedNow in 2023 or 2024, which would be a new interbank 24x7x365 real-time gross settlement service with integrated clearing functionality to support faster payments in the United States. The Federal Reserve plans to introduce FedNow in 2023 or 2024, a new real-time gross settlement service with clearing functionality for faster payments in the United States. FedNow will be available to all financial institutions with a reserve account at the Federal Reserve, requiring immediate availability of transferred funds to customers upon settlement notification. Private-sector initiatives are also implementing faster payment systems, including the Clearing House's RTP network with real-time settlement. The Clearing House's RTP network, jointly owned by large banks, reaches 50% of U.S. transaction accounts and aims to cover all accounts soon. Federal Reserve Chair Powell notes the U.S. lags in real-time payments. Faster payment systems benefit businesses, consumers, and low-income individuals needing quick access to funds. Some consumers use alternative financial services for immediate access to funds. Faster payments could help avoid overdraft fees. The main policy issue is whether Federal Reserve entry in the RTP market is desirable. Stakeholders question if FedNow will crowd out private systems. Treasury Department supports Fed involvement to aid private-sector initiatives. The debate over the Federal Reserve's entry into the real-time payments (RTP) market revolves around concerns of potential monopoly profits or anticompetitive behavior in the absence of FedNow. Stakeholders are divided on whether a single provider or multiple providers would be optimal for a natural monopoly, with implications for competition, user costs, and infrastructure. RTP competition between the Federal Reserve and the private sector also raises questions about innovation, ubiquity, interoperability, and equity. Cryptocurrencies are digital money in electronic payment systems that do not require government backing or intermediaries like banks. Users validate payments using public ledgers protected by cryptographic protocols. Transactions occur when parties agree to transfer digital currency between accounts. (Source: CRS Report R45927) Cryptocurrencies allow for the transfer of digital currency between accounts using private keys. Users can purchase cryptocurrencies with traditional money or earn them through work. Blockchain technology is often used to validate ledger changes in digital currency platforms. In a blockchain-enabled system, payments are validated on a public ledger by a decentralized network of users and cryptographic protocols. Cryptocurrency advocates believe that decentralized payment systems could be faster and more cost-effective than traditional systems. Central banks are exploring the possibility of issuing government-backed digital currencies. Central banks are considering the creation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to potentially offer benefits of alternative payment systems with reduced risk. The specifics of how CBDCs would operate remain uncertain, sparking debates on the appropriate regulatory measures for cryptocurrencies. Proponents argue against stifling innovation, while opponents advocate for regulations to prevent criminal activities and protect consumers. Regulatory focus is primarily on cryptocurrency exchanges facilitating the trading of digital assets for fiat currencies or other forms of payment. Cryptocurrency exchanges must register as money transmitters and report to regulatory bodies. Critics warn of potential for criminal activities due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. Concerns exist about consumer protection and compliance with anti-money laundering laws. Certain state laws and regulations are being applied to cryptocurrency-related businesses, but laws like the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 do not typically apply to digital currency transactions due to the lack of involvement of centralized financial institutions. Experts speculate that widespread cryptocurrency adoption could impact the ability of central banks to implement monetary policies. Financial innovation in capital markets has led to new fundraising methods like crowdfunding and initial coin offerings (ICO). Crowdfunding involves raising funds online from numerous individuals, while ICOs raise funds by selling digital assets. This could impact the ability of central banks to implement monetary policies if additional currencies not subject to government controls become prevalent. For more information on these issues, refer to CRS Report R45427, Cryptocurrency: The Economics of Money and Selected Policy Issues by David W. Perkins; CRS Report R45116, Blockchain: Background and Policy Issues by Chris Jaikaran; and CRS Report R45664, Virtual Currencies and Money Laundering: Legal Background, Enforcement Actions, and Legislative Proposals by Jay B. Sykes and Nicole Vanatko. Initial coin offerings (ICO) raise funds by selling digital coins or tokens using blockchain technology to investors. Crowdfunding can take different forms such as donation, reward, peer-to-peer lending, and equity crowdfunding. Securities law and regulation by the SEC apply when crowdfunding and ICOs meet the legal definition of a securities offering. Equity crowdfunding involves investors buying stakes in a company and receiving company stocks in return. It may be subject to SEC regulation if it meets the criteria of a securities offering. ICOs involve selling digital coins or tokens to investors, who can pay in traditional fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies. ICOs are similar to IPOs in that they are used by companies to raise funds, but ICO investors receive digital assets instead of equity stakes. Coin or token purchasers can use them for goods/services or hold them as investments. Policymakers are evaluating the regulatory framework for ICOs to address their risks and benefits. Equity crowdfunding debates focus on applying SEC registration exemptions broadly to reduce costs for small businesses. Title III of the JOBS Act in 2012 aimed to facilitate fundraising for companies without resources for traditional IPOs. Title III of the JOBS Act created an exemption for internet-based securities offerings up to $1 million over 12 months. Some small companies may not qualify for this exemption due to high fundraising costs. There is debate on the criteria for allowing equity crowdfunding issuers to bypass registration requirements. ICOs face uncertainty regarding securities laws and regulations. Digital assets pose challenges in determining their classification under securities laws, leading to uncertainty. ICO and digital asset investors, including retail investors, are vulnerable to fraud and manipulation due to inadequate investor protections. Studies show high levels of ICO scams and failures, making digital assets an attractive target for scammers. Transactions in digital assets lack the same protections as traditional transactions, allowing scammers to exploit vulnerabilities. The SEC has increased monitoring and enforcement actions against entities involved in digital asset transactions, including issuers and market intermediaries. Court orders have been obtained to halt fraudulent ICOs. For more information, refer to CRS Report R46208 and CRS Report R45221. High-frequency trading (HFT) involves supercomputers executing trades within microseconds or milliseconds in financial instruments like equity securities, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies. It has grown significantly over the past 15 years, representing 50% to 60% of trading volume in domestic equity markets. HFT can have both positive effects (increased liquidity, smaller spreads, decreased volatility, improved price discovery) and negative effects (decreased liquidity, higher volatility) depending on trading strategy and market conditions. High-frequency trading (HFT) involves supercomputers executing trades within microseconds or milliseconds in financial instruments like equity securities, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies. Traders using HFT strategies aim to earn small profits per trade through automated trading. Strategies can be passive (such as arbitrage trading and passive market making) or aggressive (like order anticipation or momentum ignition strategies). Regulators have been monitoring the effects of HFT, which can have both positive and negative impacts on the market. Regulators oversee HFT practices in securities and derivatives markets. HFT supporters argue it improves market quality by narrowing spreads, increasing liquidity, and reducing volatility. Critics view HFT as the latest technological advancement in trading. Some commentators argue that aggressive HFT strategies should be a public policy concern due to similarities to illegal practices like front-running and spoofing. Regulators are worried about market fragility and volatility, as seen in the Flash Crash of May 6, 2010. The Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, demonstrated market fragility and volatility, leading to the implementation of the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) by the SEC. CAT aims to consolidate trade data for regulatory analysis and provide regulators with more timely access to comprehensive trading data. The Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) aims to provide regulators with comprehensive trading data for analysis and monitoring market behavior. The system, which has raised cybersecurity concerns, is projected to be fully operational in 2022. Policymakers have taken various actions to address concerns related to High-Frequency Trading (HFT), but the balance between its benefits and risks remains an open question. The SEC regulates the asset management industry, which is increasingly using fintech for investment research and client services, including robo-advisor services. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) concerns have led to trading delay mechanisms being adopted by some markets. The asset management industry is utilizing fintech for investment research and client services, including robo-advisor services. Robo advisers offer automated digital investment advisory through online platforms, with potential benefits of serving more customers at lower costs. Large technology companies are entering the asset management sector, partnering with incumbent asset managers. Robo advisers in the investment management industry offer automated digital advisory services, potentially serving more customers at lower costs. Direct-to-consumer robo-advisory platforms had $257 billion in assets at the end of 2018, projected to reach $1.26 trillion by 2023. Big tech firms like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple are entering the financial services sector, potentially disrupting traditional asset management. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, has already seen success in overseas markets with its asset management platform. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, manages the world's largest money market mutual fund of $168 billion as of year-end 2018, with 588 million Alipay users invested. Robo advisers, like all asset managers, face policy issues regarding investor protection, risk mitigation, and innovation. Concerns include herding risks and excess volatility, as well as black box algorithm-based decision-making in AI-enabled robo advising. Some observers are concerned about black box algorithm-based decision-making in AI-enabled robo advising, where it is unclear how risks are assessed or decisions made. Questions arise about assigning blame for investment losses through AI systems. Policymakers may need to balance these risks with potential benefits like cost reduction and increased access. Fintech's application to insurance could similarly transform the industry, affecting insurance products and operations. Fintech innovations could revolutionize the insurance industry by impacting insurance products, underwriting, claims, and marketing across all lines of insurance. Insurtech advancements include peer-to-peer insurance, Big Data, artificial intelligence, blockchain, mobile technology, and on-demand insurance. Examples include insurers offering discounts for wearable device users, telematics-based auto insurance, and social media usage for underwriting and fraud detection. Fast-growing P&C insurers like Metromile Insurance and Root Insurance are leading the way with innovative telematics-based insurance offerings. Root Insurance and Lemonade Insurance are fast-growing insurers using technology like chatbots and AI. Insurers are regulated by individual states through the NAIC, which has addressed technology issues. The NAIC created an Insurance and Technology task force and a model law for insurer data security. Seven states have adopted the model law, with more considering it. State insurance regulators have designated a point of contact for \"InsurTech, Innovation & Technology\" to guide new entrants through the regulatory process. The regulatory system for insurance is state-based, with Congress having the authority to override state laws. Congress has conducted oversight on the insurance regulatory system and may question the states' approach to new technology's impact on consumers and regulatory arbitrage. The impact on consumers and potential regulatory arbitrage between federal and state regulatory approaches for financial firms. Risk-management and compliance functions rely on data analysis to assess risks, such as anti-money laundering compliance and stress testing. Regulators monitor for risks and unfolding events in securities markets. Companies are increasingly using innovative technology, referred to as regtech, for risk management and regulatory compliance activities. Algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are being utilized in the financial industry to automate risk-management and compliance functions, such as anti-money laundering processes and surveilling internal firm employees involved in trading. The development and adoption of automation in compliance are driven by the goal of cost savings in financial firms. Automation is used to reduce compliance costs, improve risk management, and enhance regulatory compliance. The use of algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in regtech is predicted to lower the cost of predictive processes and increase the accuracy of automated prediction processes in the future. The specific outcomes and deployment of these technologies in regulatory compliance are still uncertain. The use of automation in compliance raises questions about the role of human compliance officials in decision-making processes. Concerns about privacy and cybersecurity risks are also raised by the use of regtech tools. The deployment and outcomes of these technologies in regulatory compliance remain uncertain. Regtech tools pose privacy and cybersecurity risks similar to other technologies. Automated monitoring of financial transactions raises concerns about privacy infringement. Policymakers need to consider the balance between regulatory efficiency and privacy. Regulatory buy-in is a challenge for adopting compliance technologies. The federal financial regulatory framework was created before recent technologies, causing uncertainty for fintech companies on how existing laws apply. Policymakers aim to reduce regulatory uncertainty and integrate fintech while balancing innovation and consumer protection. Regulators have implemented programs like sandboxes or greenhouses to address fintech uncertainty, often involving communication between firms and regulators. Regulators establish offices, websites, and collaborations with fintech firms to understand new technologies and potential regulatory concerns. They may exempt certain regulations if they are burdensome or ill-suited to a technology. To address regulatory challenges in fintech, regulators can exempt companies meeting specific criteria from burdensome regulations or issue no-action letters. Regulators may require firms to enter a defined regulatory regime with clear permissions and responsibilities, such as obtaining a specific charter or license. Financial regulators are implementing these approaches through rulemakings and programs. Financial regulators are implementing regulatory approaches through rulemakings and establishing programs and offices within agencies. These initiatives could be supported or opposed by various stakeholders depending on their design and impact on firms and products. Fintech firms may seek national regulatory consistency but oppose additional data-reporting requirements, while incumbent financial institutions may argue against regulatory tailoring for fintech firms. State regulators and consumer advocates may oppose federal charters that preempt state regulations. State regulators and consumer advocates may oppose a federal charter preempting state consumer-protection laws. Policymakers could tailor regulation for fintechs by applying different regulatory treatment to companies or products. Institution-based regulation for start-up firms could be a better option to allow them to learn how they would be regulated. Alternatively, differentiated regulatory treatment could apply to the product rather than the firm. Regulators could also use discretion in determining which fintech companies or products qualify for tailored regulation based on objective criteria. Policymakers may tailor regulation for fintech companies or products based on legislation, deciding the duration of regulatory treatment. Different approaches like specific charters or exemptions could be considered. For more information on these issues, refer to CRS reports on fintech regulation, cybersecurity, and data protection. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various financial topics such as cybersecurity, marketplace lending, federal preemption, faster payments, cash usage decline, technology service providers for banks, cryptocurrency, and blockchain-based payment systems. The curr_chunk lists CRS reports on policy issues related to blockchain, virtual currencies, money laundering, financial innovation, digital assets, SEC regulation, capital markets, securities offerings, initial coin offerings, high-frequency trading, and derivatives trading.
