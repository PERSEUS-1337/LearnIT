High quality early childhood education is crucial for children's development, including language, math, and social skills. Demand for child care is increasing as more mothers join the workforce.

Providers of child care earn an average of $7.86 per hour, leading to high turnover rates of up to 31%. This turnover affects the quality of child care programs and children's development.

Only 20 States and the District of Columbia require prekindergarten teachers to have a bachelor's degree and certificate in early childhood education. Thirty States allow caregivers without previous training to work in child care programs. Loan forgiveness for child care providers is addressed in an amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965. The section aims to attract and retain highly trained individuals in early child care by defining terms like child care facility and services provided for children up to age 5 by individuals with a degree in early childhood education. The term 'degree' refers to an associate's or bachelor's degree awarded by an institution of higher education.

The term 'institution of higher education' refers to its definition in section 101.
