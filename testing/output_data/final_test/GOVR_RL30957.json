    "content": "This CRS Report discusses U.S. security assistance for Taiwan, focusing on policy issues for Congress and listing defense sales approved since 1990. The Taiwan Relations Act governs U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, emphasizing the need to provide defensive arms and maintain the capacity to resist any nonpeaceful means to determine Taiwan's future. The Taiwan Relations Act emphasizes the need to provide defensive arms to Taiwan to maintain its self-defense capability. It specifies a congressional role in decision-making on security assistance, with the President and Congress determining the nature and quantity of defense articles and services based on Taiwan's needs. In a crisis, the Act allows for the provision of necessary defense assistance. The Taiwan Relations Act requires the President to promptly inform Congress of any threats to Taiwan's security or U.S. interests. The Act established the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to carry out embassy functions in Taipei. AIT implements policy directed by the Departments of Defense and State, and the NSC. Congress oversees major arms sales notifications and policies implemented by the President since 1982. President Reagan agreed to reduce arms sales to Taiwan in 1982 but clarified that sales would continue as per the TRA for peaceful purposes. Reagan extended \"Six Assurances\" to Taipei, reaffirming that arms sales to Taiwan would continue as per the Taiwan Relations Act for peaceful purposes. Despite the absence of a defense treaty, Taiwan has been a significant recipient of U.S. arms sales, ranking among the top recipients globally. Deliveries of U.S. defense articles and services to Taiwan totaled $4.3 billion in the 2004-2007 period and $2.9 billion in 2008-2011. Taiwan ranked fourth in arms sales recipients in 2004-2007 and fifth in 2008-2011. In 2011, Taiwan ranked eighth worldwide in receiving $800 million worth of U.S. defense articles and services. Taiwan also ranked sixth globally in agreements in 2011 alone, with $1.6 billion worth of agreements. The Pentagon expanded the military relationship with Taiwan after the Taiwan Strait crisis in 1995-1996, focusing on strategy, training, logistics, and command and control. Taiwan's F-16 fighter pilots have trained at Luke Air Force Base. In 2004, Taiwan's Minister of Defense wanted to withdraw F-16 fighter pilots trained at Luke Air Force Base since 1997. The Defense Department emphasized the importance of the training program to develop skilled pilots. Strategic talks between the U.S. and Taiwan on national security have been ongoing since 1997, with the 11th round taking place in September 2005. The 11th round of strategic talks between the U.S. and Taiwan took place in late September 2005, following a postponement by the Bush Administration to accommodate PRC ruler Hu Jintao's visit to Washington. The talks focused on U.S. concerns about Taiwan's self-defense capability and included discussions on defense and security matters. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Rodman emphasized the need for Taiwan's military to strengthen civilian control, enhance jointness, and improve readiness and interoperability among its services. The Pentagon assessed Taiwan's defense needs from 1997 to early 2004, identifying problems in its ability to defend against aircraft, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. Congress could request reports or briefings on these assessments to improve readiness, planning, and interoperability among Taiwan's military services. In September 2000, the Pentagon conducted a classified assessment of Taiwan's naval defense needs, finding that Taiwan required the Aegis radar system, Kidd-class destroyers, submarines, anti-submarine sonar array, and P-3 anti-submarine aircraft. In December 2000, the Defense Department issued a \"Report to Congress on Implementation of the TRA,\" and in January 2001, a Pentagon team examined Taiwan's command and control, air force equipment, and air defense capabilities. In September 2001, a Defense Department team visited Taiwan to assess its army as part of arms sales talks. In August 2002, a U.S. military team studied Taiwan's Po Sheng command and control program. In November 2002, another U.S. team assessed Taiwan's Marine Corps and security at ports and harbors. In 2007-2009, Taiwan conducted a Joint Defense Capabilities Assessment with U.S. assistance. In 2010, the Defense Department began detailed studies of Taiwan's joint defense transformation. In 2009, Congress directed the Defense Secretary to assess Taiwan's air defense forces, including F-16 fighters. The Defense Department assessed Taiwan's air defense forces, including its F-16 fighters, in a report submitted to Congress in February 2010. The study found that Taiwan's combat aircraft were not all operationally capable, with the F-5 fighters reaching the end of their service life and the Indigenous Defense Fighters lacking sustained sortie capability. Taiwan recognized the need for sustainable replacements for its obsolete and problematic aircraft. The Bush and Obama Administrations did not accept Taiwan's request for new F-16s for almost four years before a comprehensive assessment was conducted. The assessment led to the Pentagon considering Taiwan's air defense needs, with Congress directing the Defense Secretary to submit a classified report on Taiwan's Air Force capabilities by December 1, 2013. The Defense Department assessed Taiwan's Air Force capabilities by December 1, 2013, submitting a classified report on January 3, 2014. The balance of forces across the Taiwan Strait has shifted in favor of the PRC, with Taiwan no longer enjoying dominance of the airspace. Assistant Secretary of Defense Gregson emphasized in 2009 that Taiwan's military will never again have quantitative advantages over the PLA. As a retired lieutenant general of the U.S. Marine Corps and former commander of Marine Corps Forces Pacific, Gregson urged Taiwan to focus on qualitative advantages like innovation and asymmetry in defense. This led to discussions with the U.S. about asymmetrical advantages and potential arms sales. In 2011, Assistant Secretary of Defense Lavoy advised Taiwan to prioritize survivable deterrence and innovative, asymmetric advantages. The Defense Intelligence Agency Director testified in 2014 that the PLA's focus remains on preparing for conflict with Taiwan and potential U.S. intervention. The PLA's primary mission remains focused on potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait despite closer cross-strait ties. The Defense Department warns of PRC leaders' goal to achieve military benchmarks by 2020, including the capability to fight regional conflicts related to Taiwan. The PLA has deployed over 1,000 short-range ballistic missiles across from Taiwan and continues to develop capabilities for action against Taiwan. The PLA lacks amphibious lift capacity for large-scale invasion of Taiwan. The George W. Bush Administration continued military ties with Taiwan, dropping annual arms talks for routine considerations. U.S. military officers observed Taiwan's Hankuang-17 exercise in 2001, and APCSS accepted fellows from Taiwan in 2002. In 2002, the U.S. and Taiwan militaries discussed setting up an undersea ASW link to monitor the PLA Navy's submarines. A hotline was established to deal with possible crises, and legislation was requested to allow the assignment of active-duty military personnel to Taiwan for the first time since 1979. An Army Colonel became the first active-duty defense attach\u00e9 in Taipei in August 2005. The Acting Under Secretary of Defense designated Taiwan as a \"major non-NATO ally\" in 2003. Taiwan's Defense Minister visited the US in 2002 for a conference, meeting with Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. However, Taiwan's defense minister declined to visit the US through 2007 after a policy change in 2002. In 2002, a deputy defense minister visited Washington, becoming the first senior Taiwan defense official to have meetings inside the US. In 2003, a Taiwanese newspaper leaked information about a U.S. military team's participation in the Hankuang-19 military exercise, leading to annoyance in Washington and a decision to limit General Chen's visit to the U.S. to a private sector conference on Taiwan's defense in San Antonio, TX. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless was involved in these events. In 2004-2007, high-ranking Taiwanese military officials visited the United States for defense industry conferences, including Deputy Minister Huoh Shoou-yeh, Chief of General Staff Lee Tien-yu, and Deputy Defense Minister Ko Chen-heng. General Chen's visit was limited to a private sector conference in 2003 due to a leak about a U.S. military team's participation in a military exercise. In September 2007, Deputy Minister Ko represented Taiwan at a conference in Annapolis, MD, as Defense Minister Lee declined. Minister Chen visited the US in 2008, Admiral Lin visited in 2009, and Taiwan's defense minister did not attend annual defense conferences from 2009 to 2014. President sent Defense Minister Yen Ming to Swaziland in April 2014. U.S. military observed Taiwan's Hankuang exercises. In April 2014, Taiwan's President sent Defense Minister Yen Ming to Swaziland. U.S. military observed Taiwan's Hankuang exercises, with participation by about 20 U.S. military personnel and retired Admiral Dennis Blair. The exercises raised questions about Taiwan's military readiness and commitment to self-defense. Deputy Defense Minister Lin Chong-pin visited Washington in June 2003 to address concerns. The Hankuang-20 exercise in August 2004 included a U.S.-provided computer simulation resulting in the PLA capturing Taipei within six days. In April 2006, Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian and officials conducted a Yushan exercise to enhance crisis-management against a PLA attack. In April 2008, AIT Director Stephen Young and U.S. officials observed the exercise for the first time, criticized by some KMT politicians. KMT's Ma Ying-jeou became president in May 2008. Defense Minister Chen Chao-min announced a reduction in Hankuang live-fire exercises frequency in December 2008. Hankuang-25 took place in June 2009 with U.S. military observers led by retired Admiral Robert Natter. President Ma renamed the capital, Taipei. In 2013, Taiwan's military resumed live ammunition drills for the first time since 2008, including firing Taiwan's new Thunderbolt MLRS. President Ma faced challenges managing relief for Typhoon Morakot in 2009, initially declining foreign aid and requesting American assistance later. The U.S. military provided assistance in Taiwan with transport aircraft and helicopters for disaster relief operations. President Ma acknowledged China for aid in his national day address in 2009. Arms sales talks between the U.S. and Taiwan took place in 2001, with President Bush approving Taiwan's request for submarines and anti-submarine aircraft. President Bush approved Taiwan's request for 8 diesel-electric submarines, 12 P-3C Orion anti-submarine warfare aircraft, 54 Mark-48 ASW torpedoes, 44 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, 144 M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers, 54 AAV7A1 amphibious assault vehicles, AN/ALE-50 ECM systems for F-16s, and 12 MH-53 mine-sweeping helicopters. He also approved the sale of four decommissioned Kidd-class destroyers. Decision on PAC-3 missile defense missiles was made, while decisions on destroyers with Aegis combat system, M1A2 Abrams tanks, and AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicopters were deferred pending assessment of Taiwan's army. In 2001, the U.S. Army briefed Taiwan on Abrams tanks and an upgraded M8 armored gun system. Taiwan estimated the cost of 150 new tanks at $2.9 billion. President Bush denied Taiwan's requests for JDAM and HARM missiles targeting radar-equipped air defense systems. The Pentagon's report to Congress in 2003 confirmed PLA's acquisition of HARPY anti-radiation systems from Israel. Press reports on PLA's acquisition of HARPY attack drones surfaced in 2002. In 2001, the U.S. denied Taiwan's requests for JDAM and HARM missiles. The Bush Administration denied Taiwan's requests in 2005, but the Obama Administration notified Congress of upgrades to Taiwan's F-16A/B fighters in 2011. The debate in Taiwan includes issues such as defense spending, U.S. weapons systems, and response to perceived pressure. The Pentagon has warned of the PLA's accelerated military capabilities. The Pentagon has warned of the PLA's accelerated buildup targeting Taiwan. Taiwan's Defense Ministry issued a new procurement plan emphasizing missile defense, command and control, and anti-submarine warfare priorities. Controversy remains in Taiwan over setting defense priorities and funding programs. Taiwan agreed to purchase AAV7A1 amphibious assault vehicles from the U.S. Marine Corps. Deliveries began in March 2005, with the possibility of requesting more vehicles. The Bush Administration approved Taiwan's request for attack helicopters in May 2002. In May 2002, the Bush Administration approved Taiwan's request for attack helicopters, leading to negotiations for AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters. Taiwan also considered AH-1Z Cobra helicopters. In April 2007, Taiwan decided to procure 30 Apaches. Additionally, in 2005, Taiwan requested price data for 60 utility helicopters, with Bell proposing UH-1Y Huey and Sikorsky proposing UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters as replacements. In December 2007, $203 million was approved for 60 UH-60M Black Hawk utility helicopters, and in 2008, $228 million was approved for 30 Apache helicopters. President Bush notified Congress of the proposed Foreign Military Sale on October 3, 2008. In October 2008, President Bush notified Congress of the proposed Foreign Military Sale program for 30 Apache helicopters to Taiwan worth $2.532 billion. Taiwan also planned to purchase 60 Black Hawk helicopters, but after Typhoon Morakot in 2009, President Ma reduced the purchase to 45 Black Hawks to allocate funds for civilian rescue helicopters. President Ma reduced the purchase of Black Hawk helicopters to 45 after Typhoon Morakot to allocate funds for civilian rescue helicopters. However, he directed the Defense Ministry to divert 15 new military helicopters to the Interior Ministry for disaster relief, which would detract from national defense. The Defense Ministry in Taiwan considered increasing assistance for disaster relief by acquiring 60 Black Hawk helicopters, with concerns about the Interior Ministry's ability to maintain and operate them. President Obama notified Congress of a $3.1 billion sale of the helicopters in 2010. Deputy Defense Minister Andrew Yang mentioned transferring 15 Black Hawks to the Interior Ministry in 2012. In 2002, Taiwan's Defense Committee debated funding for U.S. Navy destroyers. In November 2002, the Bush Administration notified Congress of the proposed sale of four Kidd-class destroyers for about $875 million. Taiwan's legislature voted to release the funding in May 2003, conditioning it on bargaining with the U.S. Navy for a price reduction. The U.S. Navy began reactivating and upgrading the destroyers in July 2003 for early delivery in 2006. Taiwan's Naval Commander-in-Chief attended the transfer ceremony in October 2005 for the first two destroyers, the largest warships in Taiwan's navy. The final two Kidd-class destroyers were transferred to Taiwan's navy in a ceremony in Charleston, SC on August 25, 2006. The destroyers are equipped with SM-2 air-defense missiles and a joint combat management system. The U.S. Department of Defense considered the Kidds as platforms to provide operational experience before any possible acquisition of more advanced Aegis-equipped ships. The Aegis combat system, used on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, has the capability to track over 100 targets and conduct air defense. An alternative system called the Evolved Advanced Combat System (EACS) has also been considered. The Aegis combat system, capable of tracking over 100 targets, supported the Patriot missile defense system during the U.S. war in Iraq in 2003. Taiwan requested Aegis-equipped destroyers in 2002, but did not receive a response. Despite initial skepticism, the U.S. Department of Defense discussed options for selling submarines to Taiwan. Taiwan pursued an FMS program in 2001 for diesel-electric submarines, raising concerns about technology transfers and leaks of secrets to China. The Secretary of the Navy reported to Congress in 1992 that U.S. resources could be used for the project, potentially tapping into advanced technology from U.S. nuclear submarines. The report highlighted that diesel submarines are not used in the U.S. Navy and building them for export in U.S. shipyards would not benefit the Navy. In 2001, Taiwan sought diesel-electric submarines through an FMS program, sparking concerns about technology leaks to China. The Secretary of the Navy warned that constructing diesel submarines in U.S. shipyards would not support the U.S. submarine shipbuilding base. Seven companies, including Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics, submitted bids for the project. The U.S. Navy limited bidding for Taiwan's submarine project to four U.S. companies - General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon. The submarines were to be of U.S. origin, with discussions starting in 2002 and plans to select a manufacturer by the end of 2003. The U.S. Navy provided an Independent Cost Estimate (ICE) for Taiwan's submarine program, estimating it at $10.5 billion. Private sector estimates were lower at $6 billion-$7 billion. Disagreements over program start-up costs between the U.S. and Taiwan put the sale at risk in April 2003. Taiwan's Navy delegation led by Vice Admiral Kao Yang visited Washington in May 2003 to discuss the issue, but differences remained unresolved. Delays in Taiwan's commitment of funds and a long acquisition process led to concerns about the program's viability. In 2003, the Bush Administration considered buying decommissioned submarines from Italy for Taiwan, but Taiwan opted for new submarines. U.S. Navy officials visited Taipei for talks on submarine procurement, including discussions with legislators like Lin Yu-fang. Legislation required Taiwan to build six of the eight submarines domestically, with the total cost estimated at $9 billion-$12 billion. The total cost of new submarines for Taiwan was estimated at $9 billion-$12 billion. Taiwan's political leaders considered a controversial Special Budget for the purchase. U.S. Navy officials discussed potential costs with prime contractors at an Industry Day meeting in Washington. The Bush Administration approved Taiwan's request for assistance in purchasing submarines but opposed Taiwan's proposal to build them domestically. U.S. opposition to Taiwan's domestic production of submarines was conveyed in official letters from the Defense Department. In May and July 2004, Minister of Defense Lee Jye estimated that the cost of submarines for Taiwan could be reduced, potentially resulting in fewer than eight boats. Delays in decision-making led to mixed opinions in Taipei and Washington regarding the sale of submarines. The Bush Administration emphasized ASW surveillance as a priority for Taiwan's military in early 2003, focusing on static arrays and patrol aircraft to track submarines. Allegations in early 2006 suggested that the U.S. Navy did not effectively implement the diesel sub program for Taiwan, possibly to protect nuclear-powered submarine capabilities. In February 2006, Representative Rob Simmons visited Taiwan and proposed a plan for Taiwan to procure a submarine design first before moving on to construction. Taiwan's military submitted a request for U.S. assessment of this plan in April 2006. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless conveyed the U.S. policy response to Taiwan's defense minister in June 2006. The U.S. policy response to Taiwan's defense minister in June 2006 stated that a two-phased approach was feasible, but warned of increased costs and risks. Representative Rob Simmons followed up in July, urging Taiwan to request a letter of agreement for the submarine design phase. Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England expressed readiness to support Taiwan's submarine acquisition efforts if funds were provided. Taiwan paid $7.5 million to retain an office for submarine acquisition. In 2007, Taiwan allocated $6 million for a feasibility study but did not commit to full procurement. Representative James Langevin raised concerns about the U.S. proposal to Taiwan. A LY delegation visited the U.S. in August 2007 for the study. The KMT's presidential stance on submarine procurement was unclear in September 2007. In September 2007, Taiwan's Defense Ministry requested $169 million for the design phase of submarine procurement. The Legislative Yuan approved $61.5 million in the 2008 defense budget, raising concerns about funding for the project. In January 2008, Navy Secretary Donald Winter assured Taiwan that full funding for the submarine design phase was required. The Navy accepted Taiwan's Letter of Request for the sub design phase in January 2008 and discussed program details during a visit in March 2008. However, after Ma Ying-jeou became president in May 2008, the Bush Administration did not submit the submarine design program for congressional review, despite notifying Congress of other proposed arms sales to Taiwan. Representative Courtney inquired about the program's status in October 2008. In 2008, President Ma reaffirmed Taiwan's commitment to the submarine design program. Despite U.S.-Taiwan commitments, the Obama Administration did not make a clear decision on the program, leading to its eventual cancellation in January 2010. President Ma reiterated Taiwan's need to buy submarines and F-16C/D fighters to replace aging equipment, emphasizing the importance of these acquisitions for political leverage in negotiations with Beijing. Key legislators and officials from Taiwan also reaffirmed the country's need for submarines during visits to the United States in early 2011. President Ma emphasized Taiwan's need for submarines to replace aging equipment for political leverage in negotiations with Beijing. Former Pentagon official Mark Stokes highlighted submarines for Taiwan's survival, deterrence, and advantages. In 2013, President Ma discussed Taiwan's aging submarines with Representatives Ed Royce and Eliot Engel. Taiwan also has Dutch Zwaardvis-class submarines. Defense Department reviewed Taiwan's 2008 submarine design request with no decision. Taiwan has not requested technical assistance for its submarine program. Taiwan's defense ministry decided to seek DCS for an Indigenous Defense Submarine (IDS) program to build four boats by 2035. President Ma stated that Taiwan sought to build submarines for ASW training and defense. Taiwan questioned the cost of $300 million per new plane for 12 P-3C planes and sought alternatives like refurbished P-3Bs or surplus P-3Cs. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense sought approval from the Legislative Yuan for a Special Budget in 2004. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense sought approval from the Legislative Yuan for a Special Budget to include funds for 12 refurbished P-3C ASW planes with possible delivery in 2008-2011. The sale became more complicated in 2006 when L-3 Communications wanted to compete. The LY committed to the procurement of the P-3C planes by budgeting about $188 million in the 2007 defense budget passed on June 15, 2007. Lockheed Martin received the contract to refurbish the P-3C planes by 2015. The initial proposal for P-3 ASW aircraft was linked to a sale of submarines, which remained pending. In 1992, Taiwan acquired Patriot missile defense units with PAC-2 Guidance Enhanced Missiles. Congress encouraged Taiwan's missile defense capability in the late 1990s. The Bush Administration briefed Taiwan on the advanced PAC-3 hit-to-kill missile in 2001. The Pentagon was disappointed with Taiwan's delay in requesting PAC-3 missiles in late 2002. Raytheon describes the Patriot system as the world's most advanced ground-based defense system. In February 2003, Bush Administration officials urged Taiwan to acquire advanced missile defense systems, including the PAC-3. In March 2003, a Defense Department delegation led by Mary Tighe visited Taiwan to push for the acquisition. After Taiwan's Deputy Defense Minister criticized the Patriot's performance in Iraq, the Pentagon corrected him. Taiwan requested price and availability data in April 2003, and in May 2004, Defense Minister Lee Jye requested six PAC-3 firing units and upgrades for three PAC-2 Plus units. Taiwan's military requested six PAC-3 firing units and upgrades for three PAC-2 Plus units for about $4.3 billion. The acquisition of missile defense systems was controversial, with some preferring domestic long-range missiles over short-range defense systems. President Chen Shui-bian's push for a referendum on buying more missile defense systems in March 2004 failed due to low voter turnout. The opposition parties objected to acquiring PAC-3 missiles for three years, claiming that the referendum \"vetoed\" the question. Taiwan's military debated upgrading PAC-2 missile defense units in 2006. KMT lawmakers had differing opinions on purchasing Patriot missile defense systems, with some preferring cost-effective and offensive missile systems for deterrence. Upgrading Taiwan's three PAC-2 units was estimated at $600 million. Taiwan's defense ministry requested U.S. price and availability data for PAC-2 upgrades and a supplemental budget for Patriot upgrades in 2006. Taiwan's LY deleted the defense ministry's request for PAC-3 missiles in the 2007 defense budget and opted to fund PAC-2 upgrades instead. The President notified Congress of the proposed Patriot ground systems upgrade program valued at $939 million in November 2007. Taiwan's LY retained a budget of about $539 million in the 2008 defense budget to begin procuring PAC-3 missiles. In 2008, Taiwan's LY decided to fund four sets of PAC-3 missiles but froze funds for two more, totaling $539 million. By the second quarter, funds were released for a total program of six PAC-3 missile batteries with 384 missiles. President Bush proposed a sale of 330 PAC-3 missiles for $3.1 billion, but excluded three firing units and about 50 missiles. This decision led to delays and higher costs for Taiwan, with an additional $2 billion needed. President Obama later notified Congress of a second purchase. President Obama notified Congress in 2010 of a sale of three firing units with 114 PAC-3 missiles for Taiwan, valued at $2.81 billion. Taiwan will have a total of ten Patriot batteries to fire PAC-2 GEM or PAC-3 missiles, but still needed early warning radars and a C4 system. In 2000, early warning radars were approved for sale to Taiwan, with the Pentagon emphasizing the importance of long-range tracking of missile attacks. Taiwan considered radar options from Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Despite divided opinions, Taiwan's legislature approved the Defense Ministry's request in November 2003. In November 2003, Taiwan's legislature approved $800 million for one radar site. In March 2004, a proposed sale of two radars worth $1.8 billion was notified to Congress. By early 2005, Taiwan had not contracted for the program, and Lockheed Martin withdrew its bid. In June 2005, Raytheon secured a $752 million contract for one radar system. However, by early 2007, Taiwan decided not to procure the second radar. In early 2007, Taiwan decided not to procure the second radar in the Surveillance Radar Program (SRP). Construction of the radar proceeded in 2009, with plans for a missile warning center. Taiwan expressed frustration over delays and price increases for the SRP. The U.S. Air Force requested additional payments totaling about $197 million for disaster response and anti-tampering measures. Despite the extra demands, Taiwan remained committed to the SRP. Taiwan's military used radar to track North Korea's missile in 2012. The US assisted Taiwan's C4 program named Po Sheng. In 2001, the Bush Administration proposed a sale of JTIDS/Link 16 terminals. Taiwan opted for a $1.4 billion program instead of a $3.9 billion recommendation. Lockheed Martin signed a contract in 2003. Taiwan signed a contract with Lockheed Martin in 2003 for a program initially valued at $27.6 million, which could reach $775 million. The Po Sheng program achieved Full Operational Capability in 2009, renamed Syun An C4 system. Taiwan requested follow-on technical support in 2009. The Taiwan Integrated Support System (TISS) would integrate more platforms, systems, and sensors into the Po Sheng network. Taiwan's Po Sheng program, now known as the Syun An C4 system, achieved Full Operational Capability in 2009. President Obama notified Congress in 2010 of a follow-on support program, but Taiwan only acquired one-third of the recommended C4 network. A 2010 study emphasized the need for Taiwan to invest more in critical C4ISR for defense. An ex-DSCA official in 2011 urged Taiwan to integrate the C4 system with Patriot missile defense units and early warning radar for a credible missile defense capability. In 2000, the Clinton Administration approved the sale of AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) to be stored in the US for later transfer to Taiwan if needed. In 2002, reports surfaced of PLA Air Force test-firing Russian AA-12 missiles, prompting concerns about PLA deployment. Raytheon planned to finalize AMRAAM production for Taiwan by 2003. In 2002, the Bush Administration authorized the delivery of AMRAAMs to Taiwan. By November 2003, Taiwan received its first delivery of AMRAAMs, with a pilot test-firing one at Tyndall Air Force Base. Taiwan's Air Force purchased 120 AMRAAMs for their F-16 fighters, but some believe they need at least 350. In April 2004, the Defense Department encouraged Taiwan to acquire the SLAMRAAM for defense against potential PLA threats. Taiwan plans to acquire the SLAMRAAM to counter the PLA's land attack cruise missiles. Since 2006, Taiwan has been seeking to procure new F-16C/D fighters to add to its existing fleet. The Defense Ministry requested initial funding from the LY in 2006 to acquire 66 F-16C/D fighters, with the budget frozen for five months pending U.S. price and availability data. The final 2007 defense budget extended the deadline for releasing funds for the F-16C/Ds until October 31. There was broad political support in the LY for the fighter procurement, but uncertainty remained if President Bush did not approve the release of funds. In 2007, Taiwan's defense committee passed a budget for F-16 procurement, but funds were frozen pending U.S. pricing data. In 2008, Defense Minister Chen Chao-min reported the military's need for new F-16 fighters, with unspent funds from previous budgets needing to be returned. President Bush was reportedly hesitant to approve the release of funds. In 2007, Taiwan's defense committee passed a budget for F-16 procurement, but funds were frozen pending U.S. pricing data. President Bush was hesitant to approve the release of funds due to concerns about Taiwan's credibility on arms purchases. Taiwan President Chen proposed a referendum on U.N. membership in 2008. The Administration stressed U.S. opposition to Taiwan's interest in new F-16s, linking strength and moderation for Taiwan's security. President Bush sought Beijing's cooperation on nuclear nonproliferation efforts. Critics argued that the 1992 sale of F-16 fighters to Taiwan violated agreements and could harm U.S. ties with China. There were concerns about the limited impact of 66 new fighters. There are concerns about the limited impact of 66 new fighters on Taiwan's military balance against PLA's missile threats. Questions arise about whether Taiwan's defense budget should be allocated to other needs like rapid runway repair, personnel recruitment, munitions, and training. Advocates argue that Taiwan's need for new F-16C/D fighters for air defense should not be tied to other programs or political issues. Taiwan's commitment to self-defense aligns with U.S. goals for cross-strait stability. In 1994, Congress affirmed that arms sales to Taiwan should be based solely on their needs, prioritizing defense capability relative to the threat posed by China. Supporters argued for considering Taiwan's defense requests, especially under President Ma Ying-jeou's goal to reduce tension through cross-strait talks. Selling more F-16s to Taiwan would enhance their air defense capabilities and maintain deterrent capability, aligning with the goal of reducing tension through cross-strait talks. This request is crucial for Taiwan to replace obsolete fighters and upgrade overall defense capabilities. Selling F-16s to Taiwan would help maintain deterrent capability and restore military balance, reducing the likelihood of U.S. intervention between Taiwan and China. Some concerns were raised about the Bush Administration prioritizing China's objections over Taiwan's defense needs. The US has long supported Taiwan's Air Force capabilities to deter PLA attacks. President Reagan sold F-5E fighters in 1982 and considered F-5G. President Bush sold F-16s in 1992. Despite Taiwan's defense needs, President Bush rebuffed requests for F-16 fighters in 2008. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush notified Congress of the sale of 150 F-16A/B fighters to Taiwan for $5.8 billion. The U.S. Air Force has been training Taiwan's F-16 pilots since 1997 at Luke Air Force Base, AZ. The PLA Air Force has acquired Russian Su-27, Su-30, and J-10 fighters, as well as S-300PMU2 surface-to-air missiles. Taiwan's Air Force faces challenges from the modernizing PLA, which has acquired Russian S-300PMU2 surface-to-air missiles. The PLA Air Force has deployed more combat aircraft within range of Taiwan compared to Taiwan's own fighter aircraft. Taiwan's Air Force has deployed F-16A/B fighters, Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDFs), and Mirage-2000 fighters. Deployment numbers are subject to change. Taiwan's Air Force faces challenges from the modernizing PLA, with a need to replace aging F-5s, IDFs, and Mirage fighters. President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Taiwan's request for F-16C/Ds in 2009, with a total cost estimated at $4.7 billion. Taiwan admitted difficulty in sustaining costly maintenance of Mirage fighters but denied reports of mothballing them in 2010. The U.S. had not made a decision on Taiwan's request for F-16C/Ds by 2009. In early January 2010, 26 legislators from Taiwan expressed bipartisan support for F-16C/Ds request to Congress. President Obama notified Congress of arms sales to Taiwan in January 2010, with officials still assessing Taiwan's need for fighters. Lockheed Martin emphasized the urgency of a new sale of F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 2010 to keep the production line open. Without new F-16s, Taiwan's fighter numbers would drop by 70% by 2020. In June 2011, a study estimated a program of F-16s for Taiwan costing $4.6 billion, creating 23,407 direct jobs. Taiwan's interest in F-16s raised concerns for policymakers due to limited alternatives. President Ma emphasized the need for F-16C/D fighters for political leverage with Beijing. President Ma's campaign manager called U.S. arms \"bargaining chips\" with the PRC during his reelection in January 2012. Taiwan sought to procure F-35 fighters, with F-16C/Ds and submarines as urgent acquisitions. The Administration did not confirm selling new F-16C/Ds but notified Congress of an upgrade for existing F-16A/B fighters. President Ma thanked President Obama for the F-16A/B upgrade but emphasized the need for new F-16C/Ds due to obsolete spare parts. In 2012, Taiwan raised concerns about defense spending and the need for new F-16C/D fighters. Legislator Lin Yu-fang led a delegation emphasizing the need for fighters with capabilities similar to F-16C/Ds. Taiwan also submitted a request to upgrade existing F-16A/B fighters to address spare parts issues. This upgrade program would not replace old fighters but extend their service life. The Ma Administration and LY prioritized new F-16C/D fighters over upgrades for existing fighters. Taiwan requested funding from the LY for both programs, totaling $3.8 billion. The US notified Congress of plans to upgrade Taiwan's 145 F-16A/Bs for $5.3 billion, including advanced upgrades like AESA radars and JDAMs. The US plans to upgrade Taiwan's 145 F-16A/Bs with AESA radars and JDAMs, providing a cost-effective solution for Taiwan's air defense needs. Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense emphasized Taiwan's need for credible deterrence at a defense industry conference. The Obama Administration shaped press reporting by highlighting the benefits of the F-16A/B upgrade program. The US plans to upgrade Taiwan's 145 F-16A/Bs with AESA radars and JDAMs, providing a cost-effective solution for Taiwan's air defense needs. The Administration's decision raised questions about the cost and timeline of the program, as well as the choice to upgrade F-16A/Bs instead of new F-16C/Ds. Lockheed Martin stated that the retrofit would take one squadron of Taiwan's fighters out of service at a time over five years, with the program not starting until 2017. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense responded that the F-16A/B retrofit program would bring capabilities to 80% of F-16C/Ds, with some upgrades surpassing US Air Force's F-16 C/Ds. The program cost would be spread over 12 years, with $3.7 billion agreement signed in 2012. The F-16A/B fighter upgrade program in Taiwan, valued at $3.7 billion, raised concerns about future funding and the fighter gap. Despite worries about cost increases due to the U.S. Air Force's decision not to fund the CAPES program, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kin Moy assured Congress that Taiwan's upgrade program was covered by the U.S.-Taiwan agreement. The program is expected to be completed in 2021, with possible future arms sales including signals intelligence aircraft. Possible future arms sales to Taiwan include signals intelligence aircraft, C-27J Spartan transport aircraft, F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, Stryker armored vehicles, upgraded engines for F-16s, CH-53X minesweeping helicopters, T-6C trainer aircraft, Phalanx Close-In Weapons System, Sensor Fuse Weapon, Armor Security Vehicle, upgrades for ships and submarines, and an air traffic control system for Taiwan's Air Force. The PLA has modernized with missile buildup and foreign arms acquisitions, including ships, submarines, Air Force control system, frigates, landing ship tank, situational awareness system, missile defense system, UAVs, helicopters, and combat management system. Foreign arms acquisitions primarily from Russia accelerated after the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1995-1996. Congress has asserted its role in determining security due to PLA's provocative exercises and missile test-firings against Taiwan. Congress has increasingly asserted its role in determining security assistance for Taiwan and overseeing the U.S. capacity to resist coercion against Taiwan. There have been concerns about the process for considering Taiwan's requests to Congress. The President is required to promptly inform Congress of any threats to Taiwan's security or U.S. interests for a joint response. During the Taiwan Strait Crisis, President Clinton deployed aircraft carriers near Taiwan, but the State Department stated it wasn't a threat to Taiwan's security. Policy issues focus on U.S. assistance to Taiwan's self-defense, Congress's role in security assistance, and whether assistance should be adjusted based on changing conditions. The main question is whether to disengage or increase engagement with Taiwan, and the concern is whether the U.S. would go to war with China over Taiwan. The issue of U.S. assistance for Taiwan's defense involves intentions. The question of U.S. assistance for Taiwan's defense involves political commitment and military capability. Suggestions include advanced arms sales, interoperability with Taiwan's military, and high-level meetings. Some argue for avoiding conflict with China and reconsidering arms sales to Taiwan. Another option is to limit assistance to arms sales without committing U.S. forces. In March 1996, President Clinton... In response to the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-1996, President Clinton deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups near Taiwan. In April 2001, President Bush stated he would help Taiwan defend itself if China attacked, leading to mixed reactions. Later, President Bush criticized Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian for advocating unilateral decisions that could change the status quo. President Bush's phrase on \"whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself\" meant the US would fulfill responsibilities under the TRA to oppose actions unilaterally altering Taiwan's status. Leaders in Taiwan misunderstood if they believed Bush supported their actions, and decisions of war and peace are made by the president with consultation with Congress. President Bush's reaffirmation of the Taiwan Relations Act left ambiguity, with warnings to Beijing that any use of force would involve the United States. Officials clarified the U.S. defense commitment, stating the requirement to deter attack but not necessarily defend Taiwan. President Bush qualified U.S. assistance for Taiwan's self-defense, emphasizing a response in the spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act. The Defense Department clarified the mutual obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act in September 2005, emphasizing Taiwan's self-defense capabilities. The Act expects Taiwan to maintain a viable self-defense, with the U.S. obligated to assist in enabling this, but ultimately Taiwan is responsible for its own defense. Taiwan is urged to fulfill its defense obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act, with the U.S. emphasizing the need for Taiwan to take responsibility for its own defense. Concerns were raised by Representative Steve Chabot about Taiwan's delay in passing the Special Budget for arms procurement, warning that lack of action could impact support from Congress. President Chen Shui-bian announced plans to \"terminate\" the National Unification. Chen Shui-bian announced the termination of the National Unification Council, sparking tensions. Senator John Warner expressed concerns about Taiwan's actions potentially leading to conflict. President Ma Ying-jeou resumed cross-strait dialogue and pursued closer engagement with China after becoming President in 2008. President Ma Ying-jeou pursued closer economic engagement with China and ruled out U.S. military deployments for Taiwan's self-defense. He emphasized Taiwan's commitment to purchasing U.S. weapons but stated that Taiwan would not ask Americans to fight for them. This stance was reiterated to Senator Dianne Feinstein to assure her. There have been calls for Washington to engage in talks with Beijing on military buildup and arms sales to Taiwan, following the U.S.-PRC summit in 2002. In October 2002, then-PRC ruler Jiang Zemin offered a freeze or reduction in China's deployment of missiles targeted at Taiwan in exchange for restraint in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. President Bush did not directly respond to Jiang's proposal. Editorials in Taiwan were divided on whether to pursue Jiang's offer, with some suggesting confidence-building measures like reducing actual deployments of PLA's missile units for cross-strait political dialogue and stability. They proposed exploring ways to reduce the threat against Taiwan, such as dismantling missile brigades verifiably. Some argued that Jiang's offer to freeze or redeploy missiles did not address the broader military threat from the PRC against Taiwan. They suggested direct talks with Taipei instead of undermining U.S.-Taiwan relations through arms sales. Congressional oversight focused on how the President would handle U.S. arms sales to Taiwan amidst increasing cross-strait dialogue. Policy considerations regarding U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have been influenced by the TRA, the 1982 Joint Communique, and the \"Six Assurances\" to Taiwan. Secretary of State Colin Powell affirmed in 2001 that the \"Six Assurances\" would remain U.S. policy and that consultations with the PRC on arms sales to Taiwan would not be favored. The Bush Administration did not accept Jiang's offer due to continued military threats against Taiwan, the need for direct talks between the PRC and Taiwan, and the importance of the TRA and \"Six Assurances.\" Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly mentioned in 2004 that if the PRC fulfills its obligations for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, there could be a shift in U.S. policy. China's military buildup near Taiwan includes short-range ballistic missiles with precision guidance capable of targeting key facilities. By 2008, the PLA had deployed 1,050-1,150 mobile SRBMs, an increase from previous years. This poses a threat to Taiwan's defense requirements. The PLA's military buildup near Taiwan includes short-range ballistic missiles with precision guidance. By 2014, the PLA had over 1,000 SRBMs, with newer missiles having longer ranges and better accuracy. The PLA also deployed cruise and ballistic missiles, with a significant number of ground-launched land attack cruise missiles. Senator Feinstein raised concerns about the PLA's posture against Taiwan, with Defense Secretary Gates confirming an \"extraordinary\" deployment of missiles opposite Taiwan. The PLA has a significant force of ground-launched land attack cruise missiles, with up to 500 CJ-10 LACMs by 2014. Potential CBMs between the PLA and Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense gained attention after Ma Ying-jeou became President in Taipei in 2008. The establishment of a mechanism of mutual trust for military security is being explored. U.S. policy concerns how cross-strait dialogue and potential CBMs might affect U.S. interests. In September 2009, Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg encouraged the exploration of Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan to enhance ties and stability across the strait. This raised expectations of a more active U.S. role in the dialogue, while injecting new pressure in Taiwan's domestic debate on the timing and benefits of such CBMs. Assistant Secretary of Defense Wallace Gregson noted the PRC's reciprocity in cultural and economic interactions but emphasized the need for further progress in CBMs. Gregson and Shear emphasized the need for progress in military affairs between the US, PRC, and Taiwan, urging dialogue and consideration of Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) at a mutually agreed pace. The US did not explicitly encourage CBMs in a Joint Statement with China, but welcomed increased dialogues and interactions across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan was advised to emphasize \"asymmetrical advantages\" in its defense strategy. Presidents Ma and Hu's proposals for Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) and a \"peace accord\" have sparked a controversial debate in Taiwan, particularly regarding whether CBMs with the PLA would benefit Taiwan's security interests or if U.S. defense support is more crucial. Concerns have been raised about the potential for stronger PLA leverage and the uncertainty of meeting Taiwan's expectations of U.S. assistance in self-defense. Lieutenant General of the Army questioned the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan's self-defense under the TRA, push for triangular talks among Taiwan, China, and the United States, and Taiwan's military leadership reform efforts. Sun Tzu conference in Beijing discussed cross-strait CBMs with PLA's Major General Luo Yuan and Taiwan's retired generals in attendance. Organizations with ties to both sides of the strait held the first meeting on November 13-14. In November 13-14, organizations with ties to officials from both sides of the strait held a conference in Taiwan to discuss economic, political, and security engagement, including CBMs and a peace accord. The PRC delegation included key figures such as Zheng Bijian, Yu Keli, Pan Zhenqiang, and Li Jijun, who emphasized the importance of the \"1992 Consensus\" and opposition to Taiwan's independence in discussions about PLA missiles. Li Jijun also noted that the withdrawal of missiles would be meaningless as they are mobile. In response to Taiwan's demand for the withdrawal of PLA missiles, the PLA stated that discussions on military deployments and CBMs would be held. The PLA could still use force as a political tool towards Taiwan. Taiwan's expectations for military CBMs have been inconsistent and politically sensitive. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense established a new Office of Defense Studies to study military contacts with the PLA. The CPC General Secretary emphasized CBMs with Taiwan at the 18th Communist Party Congress in Beijing in November 2012. The 18th Communist Party Congress emphasized confidence-building measures (CBMs) with Taiwan, but Taiwan's Quadrennial Defense Review of March 2013 expressed caution about the maturity of conditions for CBMs. The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will study the feasibility of future steps. Congress oversees the Administration's dialogue with Taiwan on self-defense and military budgets. Concerns have been raised since 2002 about Taiwan's commitment to self-defense, lack of leadership, defense transformation, and limited contributions to international security. U.S. observers and officials urge Taiwan to prioritize upgrading its self-defense capability and increase defense spending. Taiwan plans for independent defense due to its inability to rely on foreign assistance. Taiwan plans for independent defense due to its inability to rely on foreign assistance. The Pentagon's reports highlighted the need for Taiwan to reform its military and increase defense spending to keep pace with the PLA's modernizing forces. Concerns have been raised about Taiwan's budget shortfalls hindering military professionalization and force modernization efforts. Taiwan needs to increase defense spending to keep up with the PLA's modernizing forces. Senator John Cornyn emphasized the importance of Taipei finding the political will to boost its defense budget. The U.S. Government should send strong messages to encourage Taiwan to invest more in its military. Taipei must increase Taiwan's defense budget to keep up with the PLA's modernization efforts. The PRC has been increasing its military budgets, which the Defense Department believes underestimate actual defense-related expenditures. China's defense budget has been doubling every five years, with mostly double-digit percentage increases since 1997. China's defense budget has been increasing in real terms since 1997, with exceptions in 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2013. In 2013, China announced a defense budget of $116.2 billion, which exceeded $145 billion in total military-related spending. The budget grew at an average rate of 9.4% annually from 2004 to 2013. Taiwan's defense spending was debated in the legislature, with some arguing for increased budget scrutiny due to economic challenges. The US approved significant arms sales in 2001 during a year of negative GDP change in Taiwan. In 2001, Taiwan experienced negative GDP change (-2.2%) while approving significant arms sales. Special defense budgets totaling US$22.6 billion funded fighter aircraft procurement and military housing construction. Anti-American attacks in 2003 criticized perceived U.S. pressure on Taiwan. Deputy Defense Minister reassured U.S. officials of Taiwan's commitment to self-defense. Former Pentagon official stated impasse over defense spending didn't reflect lack of commitment. In 2004, Taiwan's defense budget was about US$7.8 billion, accounting for 2.4% of GDP and 16.7% of the total government budget. Despite Pentagon warnings of increased threat from the PLA, Taiwan's defense budget decreased compared to 1994. In 2005, Taiwan requested a budget of NT$260.7 billion, with a final budget of NT$258.5 billion. Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Rodman emphasized the need for Taiwan's military improvement. In 2004, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless urged Taiwan to improve military readiness, planning, and interoperability. He emphasized the importance of passing the Special Budget as a commitment to self-defense, warning of consequences for foreign support and further intimidation from Beijing. Lawless called for Taiwan to focus on national security, including countering coercion, crisis management, and protecting critical infrastructure. In February 2005, Lawless warned Taiwan's lack of seriousness about security due to failure to approve the Special Budget, raising doubts about the necessity of U.S. support. The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee blocked consideration of the Special Budget before the session's end on May 31, despite urging from U.S. House Members. Lien Chan responded with partisan attacks on the DPP and President Chen Shui-bian, criticizing the Special Budget despite KMT's past use of special budgets. In August 2005, three House Taiwan Caucus co-chairs urged Ma Ying-jeou to push for a special arms procurement package or increased defense spending. Ma, then Mayor of Taipei and soon-to-be KMT Chairman, blamed the DPP Administration for delays and promised to focus on the issue. He declined a visit to Washington, citing the Legislative Yuan's need to address tough bills like the arms procurement bill. In August 2005, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld emphasized that Taiwan had the autonomy to decide on purchasing U.S. weapons under the TRA. Deputy Under Secretary Lawless later encouraged Taiwan to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP to address the growing threat from the PLA and maintain the status quo in cross-strait relations. Lawless criticized Taiwan's military for lacking critical munitions reserves and defense hardening. He emphasized Taiwan's obligation for self-defense under the TRA and warned that the U.S. will measure its ability to contribute to Taiwan's defense based on Taiwan's own capabilities. Admiral William Fallon questioned Taiwan's defense resource allocation, suggesting a focus on defensive weapons over submarines for self-defense upgrades. Admiral Fallon questioned Taiwan's focus on submarines for self-defense upgrades, emphasizing the need for defensive weapons to enhance their self-defense capabilities. He encouraged Taiwan to acquire immediate defense capabilities while acknowledging that submarines would provide significant benefits but would require a lengthy acquisition process. On October 29, 2005, Marine Brigadier General John Allen urged Taiwan to increase defense spending and take responsibility for its own fate. The Bush Administration and Congress were frustrated with Taiwan's lack of priority on self-defense, casting doubt on the approval of a Special Budget in 2005. In 2005, the LY planned to vote on a Special Budget at full funding levels despite concerns. The US focused on Taiwan's self-defense, emphasizing the TRA's objective to assist Taiwan. Director of DSCA highlighted Taiwan's lack of attention to air-defense missiles and pending defense spending decisions. Representative Rob Simmons suggested a lower cost for submarine sale and an interim step for Taiwan to procure a sub design in February 2006. In February 2006, Representative Henry Hyde expressed concerns about Taiwan's defense readiness and legislators' resolve. President Ma blamed the DPP Administration and promised his own policy. Admiral William Fallon highlighted the dilemma for PACOM regarding Taiwan's defense. Taiwan. Fallon expressed commitment to defend the country in case of military aggression from the PRC. He urged Taiwan to invest in its own defense capabilities. KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's visit to Washington in 2006 lacked details on defense priorities. Ma issued a defense policy in 2007 supporting purchases of U.S. weaponry. In 2007, President Ma supported purchases of U.S. weapons, including submarines, to increase Taiwan's defense budget to 3% of GDP. Despite goals set by leaders, Taiwan has not reached this target. President Chen aimed to raise the defense budget to 3% of GDP by 2008, with U.S. encouragement to focus on strengthening defense capabilities. The State Department's Director of the Taiwan office warned Taiwan's political figures about the impact of their decisions on core national security issues and the future bilateral relationship with the United States. Taiwan increased its defense budgets in 2007 and 2008 under DPP President Chen, with a focus on the 2007 defense budget and a proposal to buy new F-16C/D fighters. President Ma Ying-jeou retained the goal of defense budgets at 3% of GDP after taking office in 2008. President Ma Ying-jeou initially aimed to keep defense budgets at 3% of GDP, as stated in Taiwan's Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) of March 2009. However, he later reduced defense budgets in 2009, 2010, and 2011, citing economic constraints despite Taiwan's strong economic growth. The QDR of March 2013 no longer mentioned the 3% GDP goal, highlighting the decline in defense budget allocation and its negative impact on recruitment and retention. The decline in Taiwan's defense budget has had negative implications for recruitment and retention. Despite the military's need for more resources, funding has been constrained, leading to cuts in the budget and returned unused funds. This has affected the acquisition of weapons systems and training, highlighting budgetary pressures faced by Taiwan's military. Taiwan's military has faced budgetary pressures, leading to cuts in defense budgets and returned unused funds. The Ministry of National Defense (MND) saw US$1.7 billion canceled from its appropriations from 2007 to 2009 due to delays in U.S. arms sales programs. Despite budget uncertainties, MND allocated funds for defense upgrades in 2010 and 2011, including F-16C/D fighters and a submarine design. President Ma raised the defense budget for 2012 after MND returned almost US$2 billion to the treasury from 2007-2012 budgets. MND spent US$44 million on disaster relief without repayment. Concerns arose about delaying the transition to a volunteer force, cutting operation and maintenance funds, or postponing arms acquisitions due to budget constraints and demographic challenges. President Ma increased the defense budget for 2012 to NT$317.3 billion (US$10.6 billion), with higher costs for personnel reducing funds for operations and new procurements. The budget included allocations for U.S. systems like F-16 upgrades, new fighters, and a submarine design. The increase was partly due to a $755 million boost from a lawsuit repayment by Thales, not indicating a trend of budget reversals. In 2012, the Ma Administration proposed a defense budget of NT$314.5 billion, which was later reduced to NT$312.7 billion in 2013. The budget aimed to support requests for F-16C/D fighters and a submarine design. Concerns arose about Taiwan's military readiness and recruitment issues, leading to protests in July 2013 after a corporal's death. Protests erupted at the Ministry of National Defense (MND) following the death of a corporal in July, allegedly from heatstroke and abuse while in detention. This incident led to a large protest in August against the government's handling of the situation. The government postponed the full conversion to a volunteer personnel force by two years, until 2017. Recruitment increased in 2014, but personnel cuts were also made. The defense budget for 2014 remained the same as 2013, with plans to acquire two U.S. excess Perry-class frigates. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kin Moy urged Taiwan to increase its defense budget to address security challenges. In January 2014, the Legislative Yuan (LY) passed a final defense budget of NT$311.1 billion (US$10.4 billion). In January 2014, the LY passed the final defense budget of NT$311.1 billion (US$10.4 billion), accounting for 2% of GDP and 16.2% of the total budget. Taiwan met recruitment targets in 2014 with 10,557 recruits by September. The Ma Administration proposed a 2015 defense budget of NT$319.3 billion (US$10.7 billion). The United States and Taiwan held high-level defense-related meetings, with a shift in U.S. policy welcoming Taiwan's senior military officers and defense officials to visit. The State Department's policy restricts high-level officials from military or national security agencies from visiting Taiwan, based on the determination that such visits would be inconsistent with maintaining an unofficial relationship. The guidelines also limit official travel to Taiwan for Executive Branch members. The State Department restricts high-level officials from military or national security agencies from visiting Taiwan without approval. Some in Congress and the Pentagon want to lift this restriction to enhance U.S. interests in Taiwan. Senior-level exchanges could help understand Taiwan's crisis-management and self-defense capabilities. The TRA does not specify official or unofficial relations with Taiwan. Some officials have visited Taiwan for talks, including a senior Navy official in 2003. Bruce Lemkin, Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs, traveled to Taiwan twice. Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs, Bruce Lemkin traveled twice to Taiwan by 2009 to discuss the Surveillance Radar Program (SRP) and other programs. The NSC, State Department, and some in Congress have opposed sending senior military officers and defense officials to Taiwan. Policy makers have faced an issue of how to respond to Taiwan's programs for counter-strike missiles. Some officials in Taiwan and U.S. supporters have talked about missiles as a deterrent. Some Americans have viewed Taiwan's missile defense strategy with recognition of the tactical utility of missiles and as inherently defensive against the PRC's threats. The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) guidelines are being questioned in relation to Taiwan's missile programs. Taiwan has the option to adhere to the MTCR independently. Concerns have been raised about longer-range missiles affecting stability and U.S. control in a crisis. Verification of Taiwan's compliance with the MTCR has been challenging for the United States. The Bush Administration objected to Taiwan's missile programs, raising questions about past positions. The Obama Administration's revised agreement with South Korea in October 2012 raised questions about supporting Taiwan's missile defense against the PLA. U.S. policy towards Taiwan's missile programs has been a point of contention, with concerns about technology transfers and adherence to the MTCR guidelines. In 2006, U.S. Representative Stephen Young stated that U.S. policy supports Taiwan's self-defense, not aggression towards mainland China. By April 2007, concerns arose about U.S. assistance for Taiwan's HF-2E missile program and its link to F-16C/D fighter requests. After Taiwan's Han Kuang exercise, Admiral Timothy Keating testified to Congress about the Taiwan Strait situation and Taiwan's new missile, TSMFS, for fire suppression. The U.S. supports Taiwan's self-defense, not aggression towards mainland China. Admiral Keating emphasized defensive actions over offensive ones. The U.S. believes offensive capabilities are destabilizing, but defensive capabilities are the right of the people of Taiwan. AIT Director Young also supported the development of defensive capabilities for Taiwan. In May 2007, the U.S. denied claims of approving long-range offensive missiles for Taiwan and emphasized the importance of missile defense, specifically the PAC-3 system. Taiwan's LY approved funds for the HF-2E program in 2007 but froze some in the final 2008 defense budget. Deputy Defense Minister Andrew Yang stated in 2010 that Taiwan needed missiles for deterrence and peace through strength. Taiwan planned to produce 300 HF-2E missiles with a range of 600-800 km from 2008-2010. Taiwan completed deployment of missiles with unspecified number and payload to the Missile Command in 2012. In November 2012, Deputy Defense Minister Yang mentioned concerns raised by the Obama Administration about the HF-2E program and Taiwan's development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Congressional frustrations grew in 2008 over delays in arms sales notifications and refusal to provide F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan. President Bush changed policy in 2001 to consider Taiwan's arms requests routinely. The President's refusal to accept a formal request from Taiwan for F-16C/D fighters since 2006 raised concerns about policy violations and lack of consultation with Congress. In October 2007, the House passed H.Res. 676, and Senator Lisa Murkowski wrote a letter to National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. Questions arose about changes in security strategy and defense policy under President Ma Ying-jeou, particularly regarding the KMT party's ambivalence. After President Ma's inauguration in 2008, dialogue with the PRC resumed, leading to expanded charter flights and tourism. President Ma Ying-jeou's dialogue with the PRC in June 2008 resulted in expanded charter flights and tourism across the Taiwan Strait in July. Concerns were raised about the timing of announcements on arms sales to Taiwan during the dialogue, with Ma clarifying Taiwan's urgency for the U.S. arms programs despite the talks. Ma's military viewpoint was influenced by a critical U.S. article on proposed arms sales, leading to disputes. During a visit to Washington, President Wang Jin-pyng of Taiwan was informed by U.S. officials that the Administration had not frozen arms sales but was working on notifications. Taiwan's military was concerned about potential loss of budgeted funds as the 2008 budget year neared its end. Congress suspected President Bush of suspending arms sales to Taiwan in violation of the TRA and U.S. policy, and raised concerns about lack of timely information from the Administration. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte testified to Senator Lisa Murkowski that the Administration did not plan to proceed with arms sales to Taiwan despite funding approval by Taiwan's legislature in December 2007. Assistant Secretary of Defense James Shinn denied any suspension of arms sales during a hearing in June, following protests from China over previous arms sales notifications in 2007. The PRC denied port visits at Hong Kong in November 2007 by U.S. Naval minesweepers and the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier group. PACOM Commander Admiral Timothy Keating confirmed the Administration's policy to freeze arms sales to Taiwan in July 2008, citing concerns about destabilizing the Taiwan Strait situation and a military imbalance favoring the PRC. Former PACOM Commander Dennis Blair, who visited Taiwan in June, emphasized the need for negotiation with the PRC. The Bush Administration faced pressure to maintain Taiwan's defense and negotiate with the PRC from a position of strength. Despite concerns from Congress about suspended arms sales, the Administration denied a policy change and delayed notifying Congress of approved arms sales programs worth $12-13 billion. The Bush Administration faced pressure to maintain Taiwan's defense and negotiate with the PRC from a position of strength. Despite concerns from Congress about suspended arms sales, the Administration delayed notifying Congress of approved arms sales programs worth $12-13 billion. President Bush finally notified Congress on October 3, after the originally scheduled adjournment. The PRC suspended military meetings and port visits in response. The PRC suspended bilateral talks on weapons non-proliferation and military meetings in response to delayed arms sales notifications by the Bush Administration. President Bush submitted only six of the eight pending sales, totaling $6.5 billion, excluding Black Hawk helicopters and submarine design programs. Representative Ros-Lehtinen criticized the President for not fully complying with the law and keeping Congress uninformed about U.S. arms sales policy towards Taiwan. Senator McCain noted the prolonged delay in arms sales. Senator John McCain criticized the Bush Administration for delaying arms sales and urged reconsideration of not providing submarines or F-16 fighters. The decision to submit notifications raised questions about arbitrary decision-making and piled up notifications for months. President Bush's confusion in the process for Taiwan's defense needs undermined his policy change in 2001. This situation raised the policy issue of conducting a strategic review. President Obama repeated the decision-making process since 2008. President Obama notified Congress of five programs totaling $6.4 billion, including PAC-3 missile defense systems, Black Hawk helicopters, Harpoon missiles, technical support for a joint project, and minehunters. He did not advance the submarine design program or approve Taiwan's request for F-16 fighters. The Administration stated it was still assessing Taiwan's needs. The Obama Administration did not make a decision on the submarine program or new fighters for Taiwan, stating it was still assessing Taiwan's requirements. President Obama reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the TRA at the U.S.-PRC summit in Beijing in 2009. Delays in decision-making since 2008 raised questions about the future of arms sales and defense acquisitions for Taiwan. The PRC expressed concerns about a potential shift in U.S. policy on arms sales. The Obama Administration issued arms sales notifications to Taiwan, leading to a strong reaction from the PRC. The PRC threatened to postpone military exchanges, meetings on international security, impose sanctions on U.S. defense firms, and react on international issues. This resulted in the postponement of Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg's meetings in Beijing. In February, a threat to U.S. firms from China emerged, impacting Boeing and General Electric. The PRC Embassy in Washington contacted a U.S. defense firm's executive with a warning, leading to a complaint to the State Department. In June, Defense Secretary Robert Gates' visit to Asia was not welcomed by China. In June, Defense Secretary Robert Gates countered China's concerns over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, stating they do not support Taiwan's independence but maintain peace and stability in the region. Despite this, the Administration delayed at least three arms sales programs in early to summer of 2010, including Direct Commercial Sales programs. In July 2010, the State Department notified Congress of arms sales programs for Taiwan, including upgrades to radar systems. President Obama delayed major Foreign Military Sales until September 2011 when three programs totaling $5.9 billion were formally submitted to Congress. The State Department notified Congress of arms sales programs for Taiwan in 2010, including upgrades to radar systems. President Obama delayed major Foreign Military Sales until 2011 when programs totaling $5.9 billion were submitted. In 1992, arms sales to Taiwan totaled $5.3 billion, with F-16 pilot training and aircraft spare parts pending for long-standing cooperation. The F-16A/B program was expected to be notified to Congress in early 2011. Taiwan's President Ma campaigned for reelection in 2012. President Ma of Taiwan campaigned for reelection in January 2012 and requested U.S. arms for political support. The F-16A/B program was justified to support U.S. interests in political stability. The Administration submitted notifications and studied Taiwan's air power in September 2011. Despite arms sales, officials continued to meet, with visits from various high-ranking officials. After the announcement of arms sales, the PLA postponed visits by the PACOM Commander and the U.S. Army's band. The PLA postponed visits and joint exercises with the US military, while US officials continued engagements with Taiwan. Taiwan's funding impasse for self-defense raised concerns about future US weapon requests and policy reviews towards Taiwan. The Bush and Obama administrations delayed arms sales to Taiwan, prompting a reevaluation of U.S. policy towards Taiwan in the context of China's rising influence. Options included resurrecting annual arms sales talks and considering Taiwan's defense needs in a regional approach. Taiwan's existing meetings have raised concerns about military imbalance in the Taiwan Strait. A new \"two-plus-two\" strategic dialogue between U.S. officials and Taiwan could address security concerns. Congress plays a role in oversight of policy reviews towards Taiwan. No major policy review has been acknowledged since 1994. Defense ties would likely be included in any policy reviews. Defense ties would likely be included in any policy reviews of how to enhance leverage over Taiwan and affect the cross-strait situation, including whether to limit defense ties, apply conditions, or strengthen ties. Policy promotes the U.S. objectives of assisting Taiwan's self-defense capability, preventing conflict, minimizing the chance of U.S. armed intervention, dispelling dangerous misperceptions, and promoting cross-strait dialogue. U.S. objectives have been consistent, but developments in China and Taiwan since the 1970s have required U.S. re-assessments and responses. In late 2002, the Pentagon reportedly conducted a policy review of cooperation with Taiwan. In February 2003, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless emphasized to Taiwan the importance of investing in its own defense despite America's commitment to peace in the Taiwan Strait. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall Schriver outlined three defense priorities for Taiwan: missile defense, command and control, and ASW. President Chen Shui-bian's reelection in March 2004 led to advocacy for a new constitution by 2008. In April 2004, the Bush Administration expressed a policy readjustment towards Taiwan during a hearing. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly clarified U.S. support for Taiwan, emphasizing the importance of a secure and self-confident Taiwan for engaging in dialogue with China. Some questioned the validity of this premise. Former ambassador James Lilley warned in April 2004 that U.S. military support and arms sales to Taiwan should be conditional on upholding a successful pattern of moving towards accommodation with China. Any policy review should involve a regional strategy to deal with a rising China, as expressed by Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer in August 2004. In August 2004, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer expressed doubts about U.S. military help for Taiwan against China. Australia's 2009 Defense White Paper highlighted concerns about China's rise and the Taiwan issue. In February 2005, a joint statement by U.S. and Japan aimed to resolve Taiwan Strait issues peacefully. China objected to any mention of Taiwan in alliances. Taiwan's proximity to U.S. allies like Japan and the Philippines was noted. In December 2007, the EU expressed concern about stability in the Taiwan Strait due to cross-strait integration raising worries about military technology leakage to China. There are concerns about Taiwan shifting defense responsibility to Beijing, jeopardizing U.S. defense technology integrity. Taiwan also worries about military information leaking to China. The United States has concerns about the leakage of military information and technology to China, especially after a case involving Taiwan's Army Major General Lo Hsien-che passing secrets to the PRC. Lo was recruited by PRC intelligence while assigned in Thailand and continued to pass sensitive information even after being promoted to major general with broader access to command and control information. This case raised concerns about the control of military information and technology that could leak to the PRC. In 2010, Taiwan's President Ma acknowledged a serious case of espionage that started in 2002 and led to the discovery of a spy for the PRC. The spy, Lo Hsien-che, was sentenced to life in prison for spying for the enemy. Other cases in the United States involved individuals spying for PRC against Taiwan and U.S.-Taiwan weapons programs. In January 2010, a Taiwanese citizen was sentenced to 36 months in prison for espionage. Concerns exist about vulnerabilities in Taiwan's security that could allow for unauthorized access to classified information. There have been cases of aggressive PRC espionage targeting Taiwan's military, including the C4 system. In August 2011, Taiwan failed to detain a citizen involved in arms programs, who was later arrested in the United States. In 2011, Ko-Suen Moo was deported to Taipei by the US for trying to sell military parts to China. Taiwan \"lost\" Moo despite US expectations of legal action. In 2012, Air Force Captain Chiang was detained for leaking secrets to China involving a Regional Operations Control Center. The military had been monitoring Chiang for four years, raising questions about Taiwan's handling of the arrest. Taiwan's handling of arrests related to alleged spying for Beijing has raised questions, including delays in announcing arrests and potential implications for U.S. programs. There are concerns about Taiwan's strategic reorientation towards China under President Ma Ying-jeou, highlighted by incidents like a boat collision with Japan near disputed islands. The dispute over the Diaoyutai islands escalated into a crisis between Taiwan and Japan. President Ma called for a peaceful resolution after KMT legislators planned to assert Taiwan's claims with a naval vessel trip. President Ma's meetings with Japan's Representative were limited due to a dispute over Taiwan's status. Taiwan's response to South Korea's naval ship sinking raised questions about its stance. In 2010, Taiwan faced questions about its support for South Korea and alignment with the United States. Taiwan protested Japan's expansion of its Air Defense Identification Zone. After North Korea attacked South Korea, Taiwan initially called for \"self-restraint\" but later condemned North Korea. President Ma led Taiwan to be the largest donor of aid to Japan after the 2011 disaster. In November 2013, the PRC announced an ADIZ over the East China Sea, including the Senkaku Islands, causing concerns for Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Japan's new defense policy in July 2014 was welcomed by the US, but Taiwan closely monitored the situation. In 2012, tensions rose over Taiwan's actions in the South China Sea and deployment of weapons on Itu Aba. In 2013, Taiwan budgeted for a pier and runway at Itu Aba by 2016. President Ma announced the \"East China Sea Peace Initiative\" in 2012, reiterating Taiwan's claim over the Senkaku islands as the Diaoyutai Islands and calling for talks and a code of conduct to address the issue. Taiwan deployed military assets, including frigates, fighters, and helicopters, in response to tensions over the Senkaku islands. Japan and Taiwan engaged in a water cannon confrontation in the islands' territorial waters. The United States had previously sold weapon systems to Taiwan. Taiwan deployed military assets, including frigates, fighters, and helicopters, in response to tensions with the Philippines. A Taiwan fishing boat was shot at by the Coast Guard of the Philippines, resulting in the death of a fisherman. Taiwan conducted a military-coast guard exercise involving various naval and air assets, sailing south of 20 degrees north latitude. Despite internal disagreements, Taiwan's military stated that no live ammunition was used. Taiwan's military did not use live ammunition during tensions with the Philippines. Debate in Taiwan raised questions about U.S. policy towards China and Taiwan's accommodation of China. The dynamics of cross-strait interactions have implications for U.S. interests. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee questioned Hillary Clinton's nomination as Secretary of State in 2009. The Foreign Relations Committee raised concerns about the Obama Administration's Taiwan Policy Review and potential delays in arms sales notifications. The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council suggested a weakening commitment to Taiwan's defense, while William Bader criticized the Bush and Obama Administrations for their handling of the Taiwan Relations Act. When Congress passed the TRA, concerns were raised about the lack of interest in Taiwan Relations Act by the Bush and Obama Administrations. Questions were raised about whether Taiwan's security role was considered in the U.S. defense strategy and if policy towards Taiwan, including arms sales, needed to be reviewed. Defense Secretary Robert Gates emphasized the importance of building partner capacity and addressing the evolving relationship between China and Taiwan. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the strong relationship between the United States and Taiwan, highlighting Taiwan as an important security and economic partner. President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta issued new Defense Strategic Guidance to rebalance priorities towards Asia, including a \"pivot\" to the Pacific. This shift raised questions about Taiwan's security role and the need to review policy towards Taiwan, including arms sales. Taiwan's role in the U.S. strategy of rebalancing towards Asia was discussed with U.S. officials. Senator John Cornyn advocated for the sale of F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan due to China's military modernization. Senator John Cornyn advocated for the sale of F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan in response to China's military modernization. Legislation was introduced to authorize the transfer of excess Perry-class frigates to Taiwan, Mexico, and Thailand, and inquiries were made about U.S. support for Taiwan's indigenous submarine program. The House passed a bill directing the sale of 66 F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan. The President approved the sale of 66 F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan. The Senate Armed Services Committee extended the deadline for a briefing on Taiwan's air power. The Defense Department submitted a classified report on Taiwan's air force. The House-Senate agreement did not include Section 1265 but called for steps to enhance Taiwan's air force capabilities. The Defense Department delivered a classified report on Taiwan's air force to Congress. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.R. 419 for Taiwan. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.R. 419, the Taiwan Policy Act of 2013, which includes authorizing arms sales to Taiwan and requiring a report to Congress on arms sales and TRA implementation. Representative McCaul questioned Defense Secretary Hagel about adherence to the TRA and Six Assurances. Under Secretary of Defense Miller later clarified that the U.S. does not consult on arms sales with China. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy James Miller stated that the United States does not consult with China before deciding on arms sales to Taiwan. Representative Randy Forbes urged Secretary Hagel to invite Taiwan's military to participate in RIMPAC 2014, but Miller mentioned that Taiwan has been included in other military exercises. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported a bill to authorize the President to transfer arms. On November 14, 2013, Senator Menendez reported a bill authorizing the transfer of U.S. Navy Perry-class frigates to Taiwan, Mexico, Thailand, and Pakistan. The House Foreign Affairs Committees approved a bill on November 20 to transfer frigates to Taiwan, Mexico, and Thailand. Senator Menendez attached language to authorize transfers to Mexico, Thailand, Taiwan, and Pakistan as a subsection to an amendment on embassy security. Senator Coats also submitted amendments to authorize transfers to Mexico, Thailand, and Taiwan, and to invite Taiwan to RIMPAC 2014 for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief training. The FY2014 NDAA did not include language on Taiwan. On April 7, 2014, the House passed H.R. 3470, renamed the Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014. Representatives Forbes and Colleen Hanabusa introduced H.R. 4495 to require a report on Taiwan's maritime capabilities and express the sense of Congress for Taiwan to participate in RIMPAC.

The table provides details on U.S. sales of defense articles and services to Taiwan since 1990, including the date of notification, items proposed for sale, and estimated value. These sales were primarily government-to-government Foreign Military Sales programs. Before the Defense Department can issue Letters of Offer and Acceptance for arms sales to Taiwan, the President must notify Congress as required by the Arms Export Control Act. If Congress does not pass a resolution of disapproval within 30 days, the Executive Branch can proceed with the sales. Not all approved sales were necessarily purchased by Taiwan, and there have been other transfers of U.S. defense articles and services not included in this list, including classified notifications and Direct Commercial Sales. Each year, Taiwan's military personnel receive training at U.S. military academies and institutions. Leases of naval vessels and equipment have also taken place, in addition to other transfers of defense articles and services."
