    "content": "The Act titled \"Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act of 1998\" establishes a program of payments to children's hospitals with graduate medical education programs. The Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act of 1998 establishes payments to children's hospitals for approved medical residency training programs, with a capped amount limited by appropriated funds. The Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act of 1998 establishes payments to children's hospitals for approved medical residency training programs based on a pro rata reduction if payments are insufficient. The amount payable is determined by the per resident rate for direct medical education multiplied by the weighted average number of full-time equivalent residents. The hospital's approved medical residency training programs receive payments based on the per resident rate for indirect medical education multiplied by the number of full-time equivalent residents. The per resident rate for direct medical education for a hospital is determined based on a computed national average rate and adjusted accordingly. The per resident rate for indirect medical education for a hospital is adjusted for variations in labor-related costs based on wage costs in the hospital's geographic area. The Secretary determines the updated amount for hospitals with graduate medical education programs paid under section 1886(d) of the Social Security Act by dividing the amount paid for a full twelve-month cost reporting period by the number of full-time equivalent residents participating in approved residency programs. The Secretary calculates payments for hospitals with graduate medical education programs by dividing the total amount paid in a cost reporting period by the number of hospitals, then adjusting for percentage increases. Interim payments are estimated before each cost reporting period. At the beginning of each cost reporting period, hospitals eligible for payment must receive 26 equal interim installments. Final payment is determined based on information submitted to the Secretary, with any overpayments recouped or balance paid. This final amount is subject to review under section 1878 of the Social Security Act. The final payment amount for hospitals eligible for payment is subject to review under section 1878 of the Social Security Act. Appropriations for payments under this section are limited to specific amounts for different fiscal years. If payments are less than the allocated amount, the excess can be carried over to the next fiscal year. Payments under this section to hospitals for cost reporting periods are in lieu of amounts payable under certain sections of the Social Security Act, but do not affect Medicaid payments. The term \"approved medical residency training program\" is defined in this section. The terms \"approved medical residency training program,\" \"children's hospital,\" \"direct graduate medical education costs,\" and \"Secretary\" are defined in relation to the Social Security Act."
