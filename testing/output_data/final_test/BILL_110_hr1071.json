    "content": "The Act is titled the \"September 11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act\" and it involves the adjustment of status for certain nonimmigrant victims of terrorism. The \"September 11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act\" allows for the adjustment of status to permanent residence for eligible aliens within 2 years of final regulations being implemented by the Secretary of Homeland Security, provided they are admissible except for specific grounds of inadmissibility. In applying for adjustment of status under the \"September 11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act,\" certain provisions exempt aliens from specific grounds of inadmissibility and allow for waivers. The Secretary of Homeland Security may grant waivers using established standards, regardless of previous exclusion or deportation orders. Aliens who have been excluded, deported, or ordered to depart from the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act may apply for adjustment of status without needing to file a separate motion. If the Secretary of Homeland Security approves the application, the deportation order will be canceled. If the application is denied, the deportation order remains in effect. This provision applies to aliens who were lawfully present in the United States. Aliens lawfully present in the US as nonimmigrant aliens on September 10, 2001, who were spouses, children, dependent sons, or daughters of aliens who died in a specified terrorist activity, and deemed beneficiaries of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001, are eligible for stay of removal and work authorization. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General can provide regulations for aliens with a final removal order to seek a stay based on an application. The Attorney General cannot order removal if an alien is in proceedings and has applied for adjustment of status, unless the application is denied. The Secretary can authorize work for aliens applying for adjustment of status. The Secretary of Homeland Security can authorize aliens applying for adjustment of status to work in the US during the application process. Applicants have the right to administrative review similar to those under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or aliens in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act. SEC. 3. CANCELLATION OF REMOVAL FOR CERTAIN IMMIGRANT VICTIMS OF TERRORISM. Cancellation of removal and adjustment to permanent residence status is available to certain aliens under the Immigration and Nationality Act. This relief applies to aliens who were family members of victims of specified terrorist activities on September 11, 2001, and were beneficiaries of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Aliens subject to a final order of removal can seek a stay of such order and work authorization during the application process. Any alien can file a motion to reopen removal proceedings, except those convicted of an aggravated felony. Aliens eligible for cancellation of removal can file one motion to reopen removal proceedings within a designated time period, starting 60 days after the enactment of the Act and lasting up to 240 days. SEC. 4. EXCEPTIONS. An alien may not be granted relief under this Act if they are inadmissible or deportable under specific sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, including those involved in terrorist activities, or if they are a family member of such an alien. SEC. 5. EVIDENCE OF DEATH. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General will use established standards to determine if death resulted from a specified terrorist activity. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Immigration and Nationality Act definitions apply to this Act, excluding those specific to title III. \"Specified terrorist activity\" refers to any terrorist activity against the US Government or people on September 11, 2001."
