    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission. President Trump's FY2019 budget proposal requested $36.341 billion, which is 16% lower than the FY2018 appropriation. A $375 million increase was proposed for DOE nuclear weapons activities. The House and Senate versions of the FY2019 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provided total appropriations above the FY2018 level. The conference agreement on H.R. 5895 provided total Energy and Water Development appropriations of $44.66 billion\u20143% above the FY2018 level, excluding supplemental funding. It was signed by the President on September 21, 2018. The FY2019 budget proposed significant cuts in DOE energy research and development programs, including reductions in energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil fuels, and nuclear energy. The budget also targeted programs for elimination or phaseout, such as energy efficiency grants and loan guarantee programs. Funding for the Corps and Reclamation would have been reduced as well. The House Appropriations Committee approved the FY2019 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) with total funding of $44.751 billion, $1.533 billion above FY2018 levels. The bill included more funding than the Administration's proposal for DOE weapons activities, Yucca Mountain, and energy efficiency grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill (S. 2975) on May 24, 2018, with total funding of $43.872 billion\u2014$653 million above FY2018 and $7.531 billion above the Administration request. The Senate bill increased funding for DOE's weapons activities, established a pilot interim storage facility for nuclear waste, provided nearly level funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D, and continued the Title 17 Loan Guarantee program. The bill did not eliminate ARPA-E and included an increase from the FY2018 enacted level. The final Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 increases funding for Corps, Reclamation, and DOE. The Administration's proposals to eliminate energy efficiency grants, ARPA-E, and loan guarantee programs were not adopted. Funding for DOE nuclear weapons activities was increased. Congressional consideration of the annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is affected by budget enforcement measures. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending, enforced through sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the statutory discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated the FY2019 BBA discretionary spending limits among their subcommittees. The House Committee allocated $44.7 billion for Energy and Water Development, while the Senate Committee allocated $43.766 billion. These allocations provide ceilings for appropriations bills. The Trump Administration requested $4.785 billion for FY2019 for the Corps, which is $2.042 billion below the FY2018 appropriation. The request included no funding for new studies and construction projects. The House provided a 6.6% total increase for the Corps in FY2019. The House and Senate approved different percentage increases for the Corps and Reclamation in FY2019 compared to FY2018 levels. The enacted FY2019 appropriations provided increases for both agencies. The Trump Administration proposed moving civil works activities from DOD to DOT and DOI for consolidation. The conference report on the FY2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act opposes the proposed reorganization to consolidate civil works missions with other agencies, citing potential detrimental impacts and the need for legislation. No funds shall be used to implement this proposal, which aims to support navigation, reduce flood damage, and protect aquatic ecosystems. The Corps of Engineers is responsible for managing riverine flood and coastal storm damage, protecting aquatic ecosystems, and issuing permits for private actions that may affect navigation and wetlands. They also participate in emergency response activities. The FY2019 budget request includes proposals related to Power Marketing Administrations, which sell power generated by dams operated by Reclamation. The Administration proposed to divest the assets of the three PMAs that own transmission infrastructure: BPA, SWPA, and WAPA, including thousands of miles of high voltage transmission lines and hundreds of power substations. The budget request projected $5.8 billion in savings over 10 years from the sale of these assets. Additionally, the budget proposed transitioning PMAs to a market-based approach for setting rates, estimated to yield $1.9 billion in new revenues over 10 years. The budget also called for repealing $3.25 billion in borrowing authority provided to WAPA for transmission projects. The Administration proposed divesting assets of three PMAs owning transmission infrastructure, including thousands of miles of high voltage lines and power substations, with projected savings of $5.8 billion over 10 years. The budget also suggested transitioning PMAs to a market-based rate setting approach for $1.9 billion in new revenues. A proposal to repeal $3.25 billion in borrowing authority for WAPA's transmission projects is estimated to save $640 million over 10 years. Opposition to these proposals has been voiced by various groups and Members of Congress. The FY2019 budget request aimed to terminate the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program. The State Energy Program (SEP) and Weatherization Assistance Program provide grants and technical assistance to states for energy programs. The DOE proposed cuts to these programs in FY2019, but they were not adopted by Congress. The budget request aimed to focus funding on early-stage energy research and development activities. The Trump Administration proposed splitting DOE appropriations into Electricity Delivery (OE) and Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Energy Reliability (CESER) accounts. The combined request was $157 million, a 37% reduction from FY2018. The House approved a combined appropriation of $323 million, while the Senate replaced the Electricity Delivery account with CESER. The enacted FY2019 appropriations measure includes $120 million for CESER and $156 million for OE, totaling $276 million. Proposed reductions in DOE R&D funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, and fossil energy were significant, with cuts ranging from 28.7% to 76.9%. The proposed reductions in building technologies included limiting rulemaking and enforcement for equipment and buildings standards to the minimum required by statute. The House-passed bill had smaller reductions in sustainable transportation and renewable energy compared to the Administration's proposal. The Senate provided more funding for energy R&D than requested, with small decreases in sustainable transportation and renewable energy, and a reduction in coal R&D programs. The FY2019 appropriations measure included increases for R&D on fossil energy, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and nuclear energy. The Administration's budget justification proposed terminating late-stage technology development activities to focus on early stage R&D. The FY2019 appropriations bill provided funding for the Department's energy programs, with a focus on early-stage R&D. The Administration's proposal to consolidate DOE's activities was rejected, and the Department was directed to maintain a diverse portfolio of research and development activities across all stages of energy technology development. The FY2019 appropriations bill funded DOE's energy programs, rejecting the proposal to consolidate R&D offices. The Administration's budget request included funding for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. The FY2019 funding request for DOE included $120 million for seeking an NRC license for the Yucca Mountain repository and developing interim nuclear waste storage capacity. The funding would come from two appropriations accounts, with $90 million from Nuclear Waste Disposal and $30 million from Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. DOE's license application for Yucca Mountain was submitted in 2008 but was suspended in 2011 due to lack of funding. The Obama Administration deemed the site \"unworkable\" because of opposition from Nevada. The House approved the funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2018 and proposed a $100 million increase for FY2019, but the Senate Appropriations did not agree. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2018 or FY2019. The FY2019 Senate bill included a pilot program for an interim nuclear waste storage facility, but it was not enacted. The FY2019 budget proposal aimed to halt loans under DOE's loan programs, which was not implemented in FY2018. Under the FY2019 budget proposal, the DOE would continue administering its existing loan and loan guarantee programs. The House and Senate bills did not eliminate these programs, and the enacted FY2019 appropriations measure directed DOE not to pursue the elimination of the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program. Concerns about the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France include management, schedule, and cost issues. The United States is responsible for 9.09% of ITER's funding. The United States is responsible for 9.09% of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project's construction costs, with a total estimated cost between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. The FY2019 budget allocated $122 million for the project, with the House approving $163 million and the Senate providing $122 million. The House Appropriations Committee believes ITER has the potential to revolutionize fusion energy understanding. The FY2019 appropriations include $132 million for ITER, a $10 million increase from FY2018. The Trump Administration proposed to eliminate ARPA-E, which funds research on energy technologies. Congress increased ARPA-E funding by 15.5% in FY2018. The Administration argued that the private sector is better suited for energy research. ARPA-E would still require oversight during a phaseout period. The FY2019 budget included $366 million for ARPA-E, with Congress rejecting the proposal to terminate the program. The Senate approved a $22 million increase in funding, while the House proposed a $28.3 million reduction. The enacted appropriations measure directed DOE not to terminate ARPA-E. The FY2019 budget included $366 million for ARPA-E, with Congress rejecting the proposal to terminate the program. DOE's budget documents called for a low-yield version of the W76 LEP nuclear warhead, referred to as the W76-2. The White House included $65 million for this modification in a budget amendment. The White House included $65 million in a budget amendment for a modification to authorize the production of low-yield ballistic missiles. This amendment aims to replace higher-yield weapons currently deployed while maintaining the overall number of deployed U.S. ballistic missile warheads. Both the House and Senate passed bills included funding for the low-yield warhead, as did the enacted FY2019 appropriations measure. The Obama and Trump administrations proposed terminating the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) due to rising costs and schedule delays. Despite this, Congress continued to allocate funds for MFFF in South Carolina. The Trump Administration suggested ending the MFFF project in FY2018 and starting a new Surplus Plutonium Disposition Project. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 authorized the Department of Energy to pursue alternative plutonium disposal options. The Department of Energy was authorized to pursue an alternative plutonium disposal option if costs were less than half of the mixed-oxide fuel program's lifecycle cost. Energy Secretary Rick Perry certified cost savings for terminating the MFFF project, but South Carolina filed a lawsuit to prevent it. Congress allowed DOE to terminate MFFF with a cost certification in FY2019. The FY2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provided $220 million to begin shutting down the MFFF project, in line with the Defense Authorization language. It did not include the $59 million for an alternative disposition project but allocated $25 million for design of the dilute and dispose option. Supporters argue the project is necessary to fulfill an agreement with Russia on surplus weapons disposal. The FY2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provided $220 million to begin shutting down the Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Plant (MFFF) project, as part of an agreement with Russia on surplus weapons disposal. The Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management (EM) is responsible for environmental cleanup and waste management at nuclear facilities, with a total FY2019 appropriations request of $6.601 billion, a decrease of $525 million from FY2018. The Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) Fund saw a decrease of $87 million (-10.4%). The House allocated $6.869 billion for EM, a decrease of $257 million (-3.6%), while the Senate approved $7.182 billion, an increase of $56 million (0.8%). The enacted FY2019 appropriations included $7.175 billion for EM, a 0.7% increase over FY2018. DOE may negotiate with regulators to modify project milestones, as noted in the Administration's FY2019 request. The FY2019 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes four titles: Title I\u2014Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil; Title II\u2014Department of the Interior (Central Utah Project and Bureau of Reclamation); Title III\u2014Department of Energy; and Title IV\u2014Independent Agencies. The bill outlines major programs and budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted from FY2010 through FY2019. Previous Administrations have adjusted milestones due to resource constraints or technical challenges. The FY2019 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes four titles: Title I\u2014Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil; Title II\u2014Department of the Interior (Central Utah Project and Bureau of Reclamation); Title III\u2014Department of Energy; and Title IV\u2014Independent Agencies. Details and budget justifications for these programs can be found on respective agency websites. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, an agency in the Department of Defense, is responsible for civil works projects funded by the Energy and Water appropriations bill. Congress typically authorizes Corps activities in Water Resources Development Acts before funding them through appropriations legislation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for civil works projects funded by the Energy and Water appropriations bill. Congress authorizes Corps activities in Water Resources Development Acts before funding them through appropriations legislation. Acts like the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 and the Water Resources Development Act of 2016 authorized new Corps projects and altered policies. Federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive grants, but are cost-shared with nonfederal project sponsors. Congress identifies additional Corps projects for funding beyond the President's annual budget request. In the 112th Congress, Congress added funding for Corps projects beyond the President's budget request, but since FY2010, project-based increases have been limited due to earmark moratorium policies. Instead, Congress has provided \"additional funding\" for select categories of projects with specific directions and limitations. Previous appropriations and recommendations for FY2019 can be found in Table 4. The Bureau of Reclamation in the West builds water diversion structures for irrigation and water supplies. They manage hundreds of dams and reservoirs in 17 states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. Reclamation is the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and also generates hydroelectric power. The Bureau of Reclamation is the largest wholesale supplier of water in the 17 western states and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation facilities provide flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but their operations are controversial due to their impact on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users during droughts. The Reclamation budget consists mainly of individual project funding lines subject to earmark disclosure rules, with the current moratorium on earmarks limiting congressional steering of money towards specific projects. The Bureau of Reclamation manages water resources and projects, including construction, dam safety, and ecosystem restoration. They also oversee the Central Utah Project funded by Title II. The Energy and Water Development bill funds DOE programs for renewable energy, nuclear power, and environmental cleanup.

Major activities include Carbon Capture, Carbon Storage, Advanced Energy Systems, and Cross-Cutting Research and Analysis. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to provide strategic and economic security against oil supply disruptions. It consists of caverns in salt domes in Louisiana and Texas. The program fulfills U.S. obligations under the International Energy Program and serves as a deterrent against energy supply disruptions. DOE is conducting maintenance to address aging infrastructure. The DOE has been conducting a maintenance program to address aging infrastructure at SPR facilities. The SPR's capacity reached 727 million barrels by early 2010. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994. In 2011, President Obama ordered an SPR sale in coordination with an International Energy Administration sale due to Libya's supply curtailment, reducing the inventory to 695.9 million barrels. In 2014, a test sale delivered 5.0 million barrels of crude oil, netting $468.6 million. In 2015, the DOE purchased 4.2 million barrels of crude oil for the SPR using proceeds from a test sale. The SPR's drawdown capacity in FY2019 will be 4.13 million barrels per day, down from 4.4 mbd in FY2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 authorizes the sale of 58 million barrels of oil from the SPR, with authorized sales totaling 5 million barrels per fiscal year for 2018-2021.
