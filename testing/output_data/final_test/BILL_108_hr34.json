    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Energy and Science Research Investment Act of 2003\". The Office of Science is a major sponsor of civilian research in physical sciences, supporting interdisciplinary research in various scientific fields. The Department of Energy's laboratories have unmatched scientific capabilities and facilities that are invaluable to scientists across disciplines. The Department of Energy's laboratories are essential for scientists in academia, industry, and government. Science research has significantly impacted the economy, national security, medicine, energy, and the environment. However, the Office of Science programs have been underfunded for over a decade, jeopardizing scientific leadership and hindering future economic growth. Higher funding for the Office of Science is crucial to support research, training, and facilities, as flat funding has led to a decline in grants awarded and underutilization of resources. Increased funding will provide more opportunities for young Americans in mathematics, engineering, and physical sciences, reducing reliance on foreign talent in these fields. SEC. 101. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Secretary of Energy, through the Office of Science, conducts fundamental research in various scientific fields, maintains and expands scientific user facilities, focuses on energy-related nanoscience, scientific computing, and genome research. The Office of Science ensures that its fundamental science programs inform the Department's applied research and development. For fiscal year 2004, $3,624,454,000 is authorized for the Office of Science, with specific allocations for general research activities and initiatives consistent with interagency guidance. For fiscal year 2005, the Office of Science is authorized $4,015,000,000, with allocations for general research activities, new construction, and specific initiatives like nanoscience centers and complex-simulation computing. For fiscal year 2006, the Office of Science is authorized $4,618,000,000, with allocations for general research activities, new construction, and specific initiatives like nanoscience centers and Genomes-to-Life centers. For fiscal year 2007, the Office of Science is authorized $5,310,000,000, with allocations for general research activities, specific initiatives, and new construction totaling $375,000,000. For fiscal year 2007, the Office of Science is authorized $5,310,000,000, with allocations for general research activities, specific initiatives, and new construction totaling $495,000,000. SEC. 102. REPORTING. The Director of the Office of Science must submit a plan for fund allocation to congressional committees within 60 days of the annual appropriation legislation. The plan should detail how funding will impact research support, facility utilization, and workforce needs in science, mathematics, and engineering fields. The Director of the Office of Science must submit a plan for fund allocation to congressional committees within 60 days of the annual appropriation legislation. The plan should ensure adequate research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering to address important opportunities in these fields. Improved coordination and management of civilian science and technology programs under Title II - Science Management. The Department of Energy Organization Act is amended to establish an Under Secretary for Energy Research and Science, who must have a scientific or engineering background and be qualified to manage research programs. The Under Secretary for Energy Research and Science serves as the Science and Technology Advisor to the Secretary, monitors research programs, advises on laboratory management, education and training activities, and financial assistance for research activities. The Department of Energy oversees long-term research activities and has authority over Assistant Secretaries involved in energy research and development. The position of Director of the Office of Science is reconfigured under Section 209 of the Department of Energy Organization Act. The Department of Energy oversees long-term research activities and has authority over Assistant Secretaries involved in energy research and development. The position of Director of the Office of Science is reconfigured under Section 209 of the Department of Energy Organization Act. The office of science. The Department of Energy reconfigures the position of Director of the Office of Science under Section 209 of the Department of Energy Organization Act. The Assistant Secretary of Science is appointed by the President and is responsible for fundamental science and engineering research functions within the Department. Management of Nuclear Energy Issues is being restructured under the Department of Energy Organization Act, with the addition of an Under Secretary and a total of seven Assistant Secretaries. The House of Representatives emphasizes the importance of nuclear energy leadership at the Assistant Secretary level. The Department of Energy Organization Act is restructuring management of nuclear energy issues by adding an Under Secretary and increasing the number of Assistant Secretaries. The Under Secretary and General Counsel will be compensated according to specific levels in the Executive Schedule. Amendments are made to the number of Under Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries in the Department. The Department of Energy Organization Act is amending the table of contents by changing section numbers to \"Sec.\" and inserting new section numbers. The Department of Energy Organization Act establishes a Science Advisory Board in the Office of Science to advise on various aspects including science, laboratory management, education, and university research programs."
