This process is guided by constitutional provisions to ensure proportional representation. Apportionment and redistricting are key elements of this process, with apportionment dividing House seats. For more details on the census process, refer to CRS Report R44788 and CRS In Focus IF11015. Apportionment in the U.S. House of Representatives divides seats among states based on population size. The 2010 census reported a 9.9% increase in the U.S. apportionment population to 309,183,463 individuals. District population sizes increased across all states after the 2010 census. Following the 2010 census, there were shifts in House seats among states, with 10 states losing seats and 8 states gaining seats. Regional population patterns continued, with the Northeast and Midwest losing House seats while the South and West gained seats. California had the largest House delegation. California had the largest House delegation with 53 seats following the 2010 census. The constitutional requirements for House representation based on state population size are outlined in Article I, Section 2. This includes provisions for the apportionment of seats and the national population count every 10 years. Federal statute sets the parameters for the number of House Members. The federal statute establishes the apportionment process for House seats based on state population size, ensuring each state receives at least one Representative. Congress standardized the process in the early 20th century, including legislation for the decennial census and the current number of 435 House seats. The current number of 435 House seats was established following the 1910 census and fixed under the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929. Congress created a reapportionment formula and process in the Apportionment Act of 1941, which applies to every cycle starting from the 1950 census. The House size, reapportionment method, and timeline are codified in 2 U.S.C. \u00a72a and detailed in Title 13 of the U.S. Code. The official decennial census date is April 1 in years ending in \"0\". The U.S. Census Bureau calculates the apportionment population for the United States from the decennial census data, including residents in all 50 states, minors, noncitizens, and certain groups living overseas. The Secretary of Commerce reports this population to the President within nine months of the census date. Each state must have at least one House Representative, and the current House size is set at 435 seats since 1910. The House size is set at 435 seats, and the method of equal proportions is used to distribute seats from the 51st to the 435th across the 50 states based on priority values calculated from each state's apportionment population. The President transmits a statement to Congress showing the number of persons in each state and the resulting number of Representatives each state would be entitled to under an apportionment using the method of equal proportions. The Clerk of the House then sends each state governor a certificate indicating the number of Representatives the state is entitled to within 15 days. Each state receives the number of Representatives noted in the President's statement for its House delegation at the start of the next session of Congress. States then engage in their own redistricting processes based on state laws. Federal law outlines how apportionment changes will apply to states during congressional elections between reapportionment and redistricting. Congressional redistricting involves adjusting district boundaries. Congressional redistricting involves creating or redrawing geographic boundaries for U.S. House districts within a state, largely determined by state law and federal parameters. States vary in their redistricting procedures, with some common standards and criteria aimed at enabling fair representation for all residents. Redistricting aims to ensure fair representation for all residents by avoiding gerrymandering tactics like packing and cracking districts to advantage certain voter groups. Redistricting aims to prevent gerrymandering tactics like cracking, which disperses similar voting preferences to dilute voting strength. States may need to redistrict after an apportionment to maintain equal population sizes in each district. Additional changes to district boundaries may be made in the years following initial redistricting. In the years following initial redistricting, changes may be required by legal decisions. Congress considers legislation affecting apportionment and redistricting processes. The Constitution mandates House seat apportionment based on population size, with redistricting practices determined by state laws. Single-member districts are provided by 2 U.S.C. \u00a72c, with Congress passing legislation on House district characteristics. The federal government has passed legislation addressing House district characteristics, including population equality and geographic compactness in the past. Judicial decisions have also influenced federal parameters for congressional redistricting. States often face legal challenges regarding their redistricting plans, with lawsuits filed in many states during the 2010 redistricting cycle. This report does not provide legal analysis on redistricting. For more information on redistricting law, refer to CRS Report R44199 and CRS Report R44798. One area of redistricting addressed by federal standards is population equality across districts. The U.S. Supreme Court has established the \"equality standard\" or \"one person, one vote\" principle, requiring congressional districts within a state to have approximately equal population sizes. Mathematically, there are various ways to express the population difference across districts. These standards apply only to congressional districts within a state. The U.S. Supreme Court has established the \"equality standard\" or \"one person, one vote\" principle, requiring congressional districts within a state to have approximately equal population sizes. Wide variations in state populations and the U.S. Constitution's requirement of at least one House seat per state make it difficult to ensure equal district sizes across states. States redraw district boundaries following each U.S. Census to account for population shifts. The Census Bureau provides population tabulations for drawing districts with equal population sizes under the Census Redistricting Data Program. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 affects how congressional districts are drawn, with a key requirement from Section 2 prohibiting voting discrimination based on race, color, or language minority membership. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits the abridgement of voting rights based on race, color, or language minority membership. States must adhere to redistricting criteria such as population equality, compliance with the VRA, compactness, contiguity, and observing political boundaries. These criteria, known as traditional districting principles, are often related to geography and aim to preserve existing subdivisions or communities. Compactness is a key criterion in redistricting laws, aiming for geographically consolidated congressional districts with smoother boundaries and a defined center. While 30 states require compact districts, precise measures are often not specified in state laws. Previous federal apportionment statutes also emphasized contiguous territory for districts. Most states require redistricting to be based on contiguous territory, ensuring districts can be traveled without crossing into another district. Political boundaries like towns and cities must be considered, but districts may not always encompass entire subdivisions due to population equality standards. Preserving existing congressional district cores is mandated in some states to simplify election administration. Some states consider communities of interest in redistricting laws, which are shared backgrounds or interests relevant to legislative representation. These similarities can be social, cultural, historical, racial, ethnic, partisan, or economic. Measures are in place to prevent districts from unduly favoring a candidate or political party, with the term gerrymander used to describe districts drawn for political advantage. Redistricting is a political process where district boundaries are drawn to favor a specific party or candidate. Some states allow the use of party identification information in this process, while others prohibit it. Redistricting is primarily the responsibility of state governments, with various approaches taken among states with multiple House districts. In 43 states with multiple House districts, redistricting methods vary. State legislatures or redistricting commissions determine congressional district boundaries. Historically, most states rely on state legislatures for this task, with 37 states authorizing them to establish boundaries. Some states have adopted redistricting commissions to reduce legislative influence. Eight states use commissions for redistricting. In some states, redistricting commissions are responsible for redrawing congressional districts, while in others, commissions serve in an advisory capacity or as a backup if the legislature's plan is not enacted. The composition of these commissions varies, with some including nonpartisan or bipartisan members and others including political appointees or elected officials. Some redistricting commissions include political appointees or elected officials, affecting their perceived objectivity. Proponents believe independent commissions can prevent partisan gerrymandering and create fairer districts. However, others argue that political influence can still impact decision-making. The timeline for redistricting varies by state and can be influenced by state or federal requirements. The redistricting process varies by state and can be influenced by state or federal requirements. It usually begins in a year ending in \"1\" after the decennial census. Many states complete the process within the next year, with Iowa being the first to finish in 2011. The redistricting process typically starts in a year ending in \"1\" after the census, with Iowa being the first state to finish in 2011. By mid-2012, all states, including Kansas, complete their initial plans. While redistricting is mainly governed by state law, there have been discussions in Congress about a potential federal role to standardize the process. Various legislative proposals have been introduced in recent Congresses regarding redistricting. Some legislative proposals in recent Congresses aim to establish criteria for districts, such as population equality, compactness, contiguity, or preservation of existing political subdivisions. Bills have been introduced to require states to use independent redistricting commissions and maintain standards of public input and transparency. Certain bills include provisions to prevent mid-decade redistricting and expand oversight by the Department of Justice under certain circumstances related to the Voting Rights Act. These bills have been referred to committee but not passed by either chamber. In the 116th Congress, H.R. 1 addressed election administration and redistricting by requiring states to use independent redistricting commissions, adopt specific criteria, and prohibit mid-decade redistricting. Apportionment and redistricting are crucial for representational democracy, determining the number of House representatives and congressional districts based on population growth. The House of Representatives has 435 seats set throughout the last century, leading to larger constituencies over time. The apportionment process is established by the U.S. Constitution, requiring representation based on state population size and reallocation of seats every 10 years. Congressional legislation addresses other elements of the process. Congress legislates on various aspects of the apportionment process, such as the number of House seats and distribution methods. Prior to the mid-20th century, decennial acts were passed to address upcoming censuses and apportionments. While apportionment is governed by federal statute, redistricting is largely governed by state law, with certain federal standards in place to ensure equal representation access. States with multiple congressional districts have flexibility in drawing boundaries based on specific criteria. The criteria used for redistricting reflect a combination of state and federal statutes, judicial interpretations, and past practices. Ensuring equal population size across all districts may be a goal, but geographic and demographic factors, along with state boundaries, can complicate this process. The redistricting process is complex due to the need to balance equal representation, state boundaries, and population characteristics. Despite advancements in mapmaking technology, challenges remain in achieving fairness and representational access. Legal disputes over congressional district maps drawn after the 2010 census reflect differing views on redistricting criteria. Congress is structured with equal representation in the Senate and House seats based on population. The House apportionment method considers the number of seats, states, and population. Various options have been used historically due to the lack of a specified method in the Constitution. Parameters can be set for House size and district size, with each state guaranteed at least one seat and a limit of one Representative per 30,000 persons. The Constitution sets parameters for House size and district size, with each state guaranteed at least one seat and a limit of one Representative per 30,000 persons. The House could range from 50 to over 10,000 seats, with House size and district size inversely related. Various perspectives on apportionment reveal considerations for creating a representative legislature. An apportionment method focusing on equal district population size would establish a representation ratio, adjusting the total number of House seats based on population changes. The ratio could be modified to create larger or smaller districts to control House size. States receiving fractional House seat allocations could use a rounding rule for whole numbers. The process involves determining an ideal district population size and dividing each state accordingly. The process of determining district size involves establishing an ideal population size, dividing each state's population to determine House seat quotas, and applying a rounding rule for states with fractional seat allocations. The number of House seats is currently set at 435 by federal statute, with arguments for and against expanding the House size to represent a broader range of interests and local issues. The apportionment process for determining House seat quotas involves dividing each state's population by an ideal district size to calculate the number of seats, with a rounding rule applied for fractional seat allocations. The total number of House seats is currently set at 435 by federal statute, with discussions on potentially increasing the House size to better represent diverse interests and local issues. The Hamilton/Vinton Method for congressional apportionment in the United States was considered after the first census in 1790, but was vetoed by President George Washington. Various methods have been used to adjust state quotas to ensure the sum of q values equals H. President George Washington vetoed the Hamilton/Vinton Method for congressional apportionment due to violations of district population requirements. The Jefferson Method was adopted by Congress after the veto, ensuring state quotas were adjusted to meet the total House size. The Jefferson method of apportionment, used from 1792 to 1832, is based on a fixed House size and rounding down each state's quota of seats. The Webster method, used from 1842 to 1930, is similar to the Hamilton/Vinton method but rounds up remainders of seats. The Webster method of apportionment involves rounding up remainders of seats greater than or equal to 0.5 to the next whole number, resulting in additional seats for states. If the initial calculations do not match the desired number of House seats, an adjusted divisor can be used. The Huntington-Hill Method aims to minimize percentage differences in district population sizes across states. The Huntington-Hill method, also known as the method of equal proportions, aims to minimize percentage differences in district population sizes across states. It differs from the Webster method by rounding up remainders for a state's quota at the geometric mean, rather than at the arithmetic mean. Each state receives its \"lower\" quota of seats and may receive an additional seat if its quota is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. The method of equal proportions, also known as the Huntington-Hill method, calculates a state's quota using the \"ideal\" district size as the divisor. If the sum of rounded geometric means for each state does not result in the desired number of House seats, a priority list is used to apportion seats based on each state's claim. This involves multiplying each state's apportionment population by multiplier values created from the reciprocal of the geometric mean associated with each potential successive seat number for the state. The method of equal proportions, also known as the Huntington-Hill method, calculates a state's quota using multiplier values created from the reciprocal of the geometric mean associated with each potential successive seat number for the state. The products are ranked to create a priority list for seat distribution until the total number of seats needed (currently 385 out of 435) have been apportioned."
