It directs NOAA on research and development activities to improve weather forecasting and warnings. Congress has introduced legislation to improve weather programs, policies, and activities. The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-25) focuses on improving forecasts, coordination, and communication in the weather enterprise, incorporating commercially available weather data, and enhancing the research-to-operations pathway. It also emphasizes transferring R&D advances to operations at the National Weather Service and allocating funding for weather R&D to the nonfederal weather research community. Title II of P.L. 115-25 aims to enhance NWS forecasts, focusing on subseasonal and seasonal forecasts. Title III addresses weather satellites, including microsatellite constellations and the acquisition of commercial weather data. Title IV directs NOAA to coordinate weather data, improve expertise exchange, enhance communication of hazardous weather events, and study NEXRAD coverage gaps. Title I of P.L. 115-25 authorizes R&D efforts at NOAA to improve forecasts and warnings of damaging weather events. The legislation covers a broad range of activities, including basic R&D on weather, enhancing observing systems, and improving data for forecasts and warnings. NOAA is required to report to Congress on its progress in fulfilling the legislation's requirements. Congress can evaluate NOAA's success in meeting congressional direction provided in the legislation. Title I of P.L. 115-25 authorizes NOAA to improve forecasts and warnings for damaging weather events through R&D efforts. The legislation prioritizes protecting life, property, and the national economy. It addresses challenges in research-to-operations, focusing on understanding weather, public response to dangerous weather, and transferring knowledge to NWS. Sections 103 and 104 specifically target tornadoes and hurricanes to reduce loss of life and economic damage. The legislation prioritizes improving tornado and hurricane forecasts to reduce loss of life and economic damage. NOAA is required to create plans for tornado and hurricane forecasting within specific timelines to achieve these goals. Additionally, there is a focus on restoring U.S. leadership in numerical weather forecasting and prediction through an R&D plan. Title I of the legislation authorizes funding for R&D in weather forecasting and prediction, including consultation with various partners to enhance social science integration. Sections 106-109 focus on observation systems, computer resources, and operationalizing R&D for NWS forecasts. Title II amends existing laws to improve temperature and precipitation forecasts for subseasonal and seasonal forecasts. Title II of the legislation focuses on improving subseasonal and seasonal forecasts by amending existing laws to enhance weather and climate information for agriculture and silviculture. It requires the Director of NWS to collect and use information, utilize existing models, assess forecasted conditions' impact on severe weather, and establish an Internet clearinghouse for sharing forecasts. Title II of the legislation aims to enhance subseasonal and seasonal forecasts by requiring the NWS director to provide forecasts to the public, prioritize research and monitoring for forecasts, contribute to Earth System Prediction Capability, consult with Defense and Homeland Security Secretaries on forecast priorities, and foster communication and use of forecasts by designated individuals. NOAA may provide assistance to states for forecast communication coordinators. Title III of P.L. 115-25 focuses on weather satellites and commercial weather data, authorizing appropriations of $26.5 million per year for activities related to subseasonal and seasonal forecasts. Designated individuals would serve as liaisons for forecast communication coordination, with NOAA providing limited support and requiring a 50% match from other entities. Other federal agencies are required to cooperate with NOAA, and a report to Congress on implementation is due within 18 months of enactment. Title III of P.L. 115-25 focuses on weather satellites and commercial weather data, authorizing NOAA to consider how commercially provided weather satellite data could enhance observations for better forecasts and warnings. Section 301 addresses microsatellites, integration of data from the ocean observing system, and a study on future satellite data needs. NOAA is required to complete the microsatellite project COSMIC-1 and COSMIC-2, deploy microsatellites in polar and equatorial orbits, integrate satellite data into weather forecast models, and make the data freely available. The COSMIC satellite system utilizes radio occultation to make high-precision measurements of the global atmosphere. Data from the COSMIC mission, along with other atmospheric data, could enhance weather forecasts. NOAA is required to integrate data from the Integrated Ocean Observing System into regional weather forecasts, support real-time data-sharing products, and follow report recommendations for weather satellite systems. The legislation requires NOAA to conduct a study on future weather satellite needs with the National Academy of Sciences or another qualified entity. It authorizes $1 million for the study and report in FY2018 and FY2019. NOAA is also authorized to purchase weather data from commercial sources and submit a strategic plan for procuring commercial weather data to Congress within 180 days. NOAA is required to publish standards and specifications for commercially available weather data, conduct pilot programs with private-sector data providers, and submit a strategic plan for procuring commercial weather data to Congress within 180 days. The pilot project contract agreement requires NOAA to report to Congress on the progress of the program and the use of commercial weather data. If successful, NOAA will determine if a government weather satellite system is needed. Title IV of P.L. 115-25 requires NOAA to report to Congress on international agreements, avoid data duplication, and improve coordination between private and public sources. It addresses NWS outreach, radar coverage gaps, and environmental services working. Title IV of P.L. 115-25 mandates NOAA to maintain an Environmental Services Working Group with experts in weather-related fields. It also requires the establishment of an Interagency Committee for Advancing Weather Services to coordinate weather research and innovation activities across the federal government. Section 403 allows personnel exchange between OAR and NWS, Section 404 hosts postdoctoral fellows and researchers at NOAA Centers, and Section 405 mandates warning coordination meteorologists at weather forecast offices to enhance decision support services. The NWS director is responsible for collaborating with agencies to improve products and services, maintaining severe weather policies, and working with emergency managers to ensure preparedness. NOAA is required to assess its system for issuing weather warnings and submit a report to Congress by April 2019. The legislation requires NOAA to consult with various entities in the weather enterprise, utilize NAS if possible, and make recommendations to Congress for system improvements. It also authorizes the NWS director to establish the NOAA Weather Ready All Hazards Award Program, recognizing individuals or organizations using NOAA Weather Radio receivers or other tools for early warnings. NOAA must submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment analyzing the impact of the U.S. Air Force. Section 409 requires NOAA to conduct a baseline analysis of NWS operations and workforce. Section 410 mandates a report on the use of contractors at NWS for FY2017. Section 411 directs the NWS director to review modeling and forecasting in urban areas. Section 412 allows NOAA to establish outreach mechanisms to the weather enterprise. NOAA is tasked with assessing forecast needs of the weather-enterprise community and acquiring backup capabilities for its hurricane hunter aircraft. The Secretary of Commerce must complete a study on NEXRAD coverage gaps and submit recommendations for improving hazardous weather detection and forecasting. The Secretary's recommendations aim to improve hazardous weather detection and forecasting in areas with limited NEXRAD coverage. Congress has provided detailed directives in P.L. 115-25 to enhance weather-related activities at NOAA and NWS. The law requires regular reports to track NOAA's progress in meeting these requirements, with the ultimate goal of enhancing weather forecasts to reduce property damage and injuries from severe weather events. The new law, P.L. 115-25, addresses issues related to severe weather events and aims to improve weather forecasts and warnings. Congress is considering the adequacy of funding for authorized activities and evaluating the effectiveness of research-to-operations focus. There is also interest in using commercially provided weather data to enhance forecasts, with a focus on assessing the potential and limitations of such data sources. Title IV of P.L. 115-25 focuses on improving coordination and communication between NOAA and the weather enterprise. Congress may conduct hearings to assess NOAA's implementation of activities authorized in Title IV, with the effectiveness measured by improvements in forecasts and warnings to reduce damage and casualties from severe weather."
