The purpose of this section is to provide loans and credit for the construction, improvement, and acquisition of broadband facilities in eligible rural communities. The Rural Utilities Service of the Department of Agriculture will make loans to eligible entities for this purpose. Eligible entities include non-Federal public or private entities, cooperatives, non-profit organizations, and limited liability entities. The Rural Utilities Service provides loans for broadband projects in rural communities. Broadband service includes technologies for high-quality data transmission. NTIA reviews and updates technology criteria as needed. The Rural Utilities Service provides loans for broadband projects in rural communities to deliver broadband service throughout eligible rural areas. Considerations for loan approval include the area's need for broadband service, the size of the area to be served, and the potential number of subscribers. The loan or credit extension for broadband projects under the Rural Utilities Service must adhere to specific terms and conditions, including compliance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, a maximum annual interest rate of 2 percent, and a repayment term aligned with the useful life of the project assets. Technology neutrality is required when evaluating project proposals for loan approval. The Rural Utilities Service sets a limit of $3 billion for loans and credit extensions. Eligible rural communities must have under 20,000 inhabitants and not be in a Metropolitan Area. No loans can be made after September 30, 2006.
