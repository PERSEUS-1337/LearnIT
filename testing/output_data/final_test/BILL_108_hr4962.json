The 50 State Capitols Commemorative Currency Program amends Section 5114 of title 31, United States Code to redesign the $1 Federal reserve notes to incorporate designs emblematic of the capitols or statehouses of the 50 States starting in 2005. The Secretary may continue printing $1 Federal reserve notes in 2005 with the previous design to ensure a smooth transition. During a 10-year period, each note will feature a design emblematic of a state capitol or statehouse. Five states will be commemorated each year. During a 10-year period, $1 Federal reserve notes will feature designs emblematic of 5 States selected based on their ratification of the Constitution or admission into the Union. The Board will determine the number of notes issued for each design annually. The Secretary will select 50 designs for $1 Federal reserve notes after consulting with State officials and the Commission of Fine Arts. Designs will also be reviewed by the Board and the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. The Secretary will select designs for $1 Federal reserve notes through a process involving State officials, artists, engravers, and the general public.
