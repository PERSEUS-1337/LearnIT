    "content": "The Act titled \"National Parks Overflights Act of 1997\" defines key terms like Administrator, Plan, and Secretary. It addresses overflights in national parks. Congress finds that noise from aircraft overflights in national parks can significantly impact the natural quiet and visitor experience, as well as raise concerns for public safety. The Secretary is required to submit recommendations within 120 days to protect public health, safety, and park resources from the adverse effects of aircraft overflights. The recommendations aim to protect public health, safety, and park resources from the adverse effects of aircraft overflights, including preserving natural quiet and preventing resource impairment. Flight-free zones, restrictions, and bans may be implemented to achieve these goals. The recommendations include proposals for flight-free zones, restrictions, or bans within national parks to protect public health, safety, and park resources from aircraft overflights. Flight-free areas will be established over national parks, with exceptions for administration, emergency operations, and transportation to Indian reservations. Military and public operations may be exempted from these recommendations. The recommendations may exempt noncommercial general aviation, military, and other public operations from proposed flight restrictions or bans within national parks to preserve the natural quiet and experience of the park. Commercial air tours may be banned if necessary. Recommendations also include prioritizing parks for implementation of these measures. The recommendations for regulating overflights in national parks may prioritize implementation based on resource impairment or threats from overflights. The Administrator can set minimum flight altitudes and prohibit overflights below those altitudes as needed. Additionally, the recommendations will include a proposal for quiet aircraft technology. The joint proposal by the Secretary and the Administrator includes incentives for quiet aircraft technology in national parks, a schedule for commercial air tour operators to convert to quiet aircraft, and other steps to encourage quiet aircraft use. The Administrator must prepare a plan within 90 days of receiving recommendations on regulating overflights in national parks. The Administrator must issue a final plan for managing air traffic over national parks experiencing noise impacts or needing regulation for air tours to prevent resource impairment. The plan must implement Secretary's recommendations unless it affects aviation safety. The Administrator must enforce the final plan for managing air traffic over national parks, following Secretary's recommendations unless it impacts aviation safety. Regulations must be issued in accordance with subtitle VII of title 49, United States Code. The Secretary may enforce requirements of the plan for managing air traffic over national parks, following regulations applicable to the National Parks System. A report must be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the plan's effective date, detailing the success of restoring natural quiet in parks and other relevant matters. The report will also include comments from the Administrator on any impact on aircraft safety due to the plan's implementation."
