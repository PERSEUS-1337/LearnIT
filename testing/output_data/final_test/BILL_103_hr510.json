    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Indigenous Peoples Protection Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that the situation of indigenous and tribal peoples in developing countries is deteriorating worldwide, leading to discrimination, denial of human rights, and loss of cultural diversity. If current trends continue, the diversity of humankind will be significantly diminished, resulting in the loss of ecological, biological, and pharmacological knowledge, as well as cultural and artistic expressions. The pressures on indigenous and tribal peoples, about 10 percent of the world's population, include denial of political and civil rights, destruction of natural resources, and marginalization. Unsustainable development policies jeopardize their survival and cultural autonomy, leading to loss of cultural diversity. In light of the United States' concern for human rights, including cultural and religious freedoms, and the need for sustainable economic development, the US must take a leadership role in addressing indigenous and tribal peoples' rights to survival. Indigenous and tribal peoples in developing countries are distinct from the dominant society and often lack political representation or influence. Many are marginally integrated into market economies. Indigenous or tribal peoples engage in traditional economic activities and are marginally integrated into market economies. Examples include lowland South American Indians, Basarwa of Botswana and Namibia, Mayan Indians in Central America, and registered tribes in India. The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development must ensure that US foreign policy and assistance support the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples worldwide. This includes protecting their cultural, religious, and traditional practices. Foreign assistance should not fund projects that harm indigenous or tribal rights. A baseline report on indigenous and tribal peoples is also required. The purpose of this section is to guide future US foreign assistance for indigenous and tribal peoples. The Administrator of the Agency for International Development will prepare a report on their economic, political, and social situation, as well as the effects of US assistance on them. The Agency for International Development is currently funding projects impacting indigenous and tribal peoples, with a focus on monitoring and improving their situation. The Administrator will consult with NGOs to guide future US foreign assistance for these communities. The Administrator will consult with NGOs experienced in monitoring indigenous and tribal peoples to prepare a report for Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. MONITORING REGARDING INDIGENOUS AND TRIBAL PEOPLES. The Agency for International Development, in consultation with the Department of State, regularly collects and analyzes information on indigenous and tribal peoples in developing countries. They utilize NGOs with experience in monitoring these groups. The Administrator of the Agency submits annual reports to Congress presenting findings and updates on the situation of indigenous and tribal peoples. The Agency for International Development, in consultation with the Department of State, collects information on indigenous and tribal peoples in developing countries. The annual report to Congress describes proposed activities to address their problems, specifying Agency and NGO roles. The Secretary of State includes a description of each country's practices regarding the human rights of indigenous and tribal peoples in the annual reports to Congress."
