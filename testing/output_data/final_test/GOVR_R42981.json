    "content": "The Small Business Act of 1958 governs set-asides and contracting preferences for small businesses. It reserves \"small purchases\" for small businesses and allows agencies to conduct competitive set-asides and grant contracting preferences. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) implements the Act but applies only to goods and services acquired by executive branch agencies with appropriated funds, excluding certain contracts like those performed overseas. The Small Business Act allows for set-asides and contracting preferences for small businesses. Agency regulations are generally deferred to unless Congress has directly addressed the issue. Congress has also passed additional legislation requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs to set aside contracts for SDVOBs and other VOSBs in certain situations. The Small Business Act allows for set-asides and contracting preferences for small businesses. Contracts valued between $3,500 and $150,000 must be reserved exclusively for small businesses, unless the contracting officer cannot obtain competitive offers from at least two small businesses. This provision mandates agencies to award contracts within this value range to small businesses. Certain regulations implementing the Small Business Act narrow the scope of contracts reserved for small businesses. Part 19 of the FAR applies only in the United States, excluding small contracts awarded overseas. Subpart 8.4 of the FAR states that Part 19 does not apply to BPAs or orders placed against Federal Supply Schedule contracts. The FAR authorizes agencies to solicit small purchases on an unrestricted basis if they receive no acceptable offers from responsible small business concerns. Agencies may use various methods for small purchases, promoting competition to the maximum extent practicable and utilizing simplified acquisition procedures like governmentwide commercial purchase cards. The FAR allows agencies to use various simplified procedures for small purchases, including governmentwide commercial purchase cards, purchase orders, blanket purchase agreements, imprest funds, third-party drafts, and Standard Form 44. These procedures can be used for contracts exclusively reserved for small businesses. When awarding a contract exclusively reserved for small businesses, agencies can use sealed bidding or contracting by negotiation. Sealed bidding involves publicly opening bids, evaluating them without discussions, and awarding to the lowest-priced responsible bidder. Contracting by negotiation involves discussions with vendors in the competitive range and awarding to the best value offeror. Different rules apply when the contract value exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. Larger contracts, awarded and/or performed outside the US, do not have to follow small business requirements of the FAR. Agencies must use sealed bidding or contracting by negotiation for competitive set-asides. The type of small business (e.g., WOSB, SDVOSB) matters more with larger purchases for set-asides or preferences. Section 15(a) of the Small Business Act of 1958 paved the way for small business set-asides. The Business Act of 1958 paved the way for small business set-asides by ensuring that small-business concerns receive awards or contracts in the interest of national defense programs and maintaining the nation's productive capacity. Regulations by 1962 implemented Section 15(a) to support small businesses. By 1962, regulations implementing Section 15(a) supported small businesses by setting aside procurements for them when there was a reasonable expectation of offers from a sufficient number of small business concerns at fair prices. This led to the development of the \"Rule of Two,\" where contracts were set aside for small businesses if the contracting officer expected offers from at least two small businesses at fair market prices. The \"Rule of Two\" requires contracting officers to set aside acquisitions over $150,000 for small business participation if there is a reasonable expectation of offers from at least two responsible small businesses offering products at fair market prices. This rule is incorporated in both the FAR and SBA regulations. The \"Rule of Two\" mandates agencies to set aside acquisitions for small businesses when certain criteria are met. However, Section 15(a) does not prioritize set-asides for small businesses over specific types of small businesses. Additionally, agencies are not authorized to make sole-source awards to small businesses under Section 15(a) in certain circumstances. Congress has granted agencies the authority to set aside contracts or provide contracting preferences to specific types of small businesses. The Small Business Act allows agencies to set aside contracts or provide contracting preferences to specific types of small businesses, such as small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). The 8(a) Program, established for SDBs, allows agencies to subcontract to firms participating in the program. However, SBA has delegated its subcontracting authority to other agencies, who enter contracts with 8(a) participants in the same way as other small businesses. The Small Business Act allows agencies to set aside contracts or provide contracting preferences to specific types of small businesses, such as small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). The 8(a) Program, established for SDBs, allows agencies to subcontract to firms participating in the program. Procedures for subcontracting/contracting with 8(a) participants depend on the contract value and ownership of the 8(a) firm. Contracts below the competitive threshold are typically awarded without competition, while those above must be competed if the Rule of Two is satisfied. The Small Business Act allows agencies to set aside contracts or provide contracting preferences to specific types of small businesses, such as small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). The 8(a) Program allows agencies to subcontract to firms participating in the program. If the Rule of Two is not satisfied, agencies may make a sole-source award to firms owned by an Indian tribe, Alaska Native Corporation, or Native Hawaiian Organization. Price evaluation preferences for SDBs in unrestricted competitions are not authorized under Section 8(a). The HUBZone Act provides a set-aside program for HUBZone small businesses. Title VI of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 allows contract opportunities to be set aside for HUBZone small businesses when the Rule of Two is met. Sole-source awards can also be granted to HUBZone small businesses under certain conditions. Additionally, agencies can provide price evaluation preferences of up to 10% to HUBZone small businesses in unrestricted competitions. The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 amended Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act to allow agencies to set aside contracts for economically disadvantaged and other women-owned small businesses. This includes providing price evaluation preferences of up to 10% to HUBZone small businesses in unrestricted competitions. The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 amended Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act to allow agencies to set aside contracts for economically disadvantaged and other women-owned small businesses. This includes providing price evaluation preferences of up to 10% to HUBZone small businesses in unrestricted competitions. The legislation permits set-asides for women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) when the Rule of Two is satisfied and the proposed procurement involves an industry where WOSBs are underrepresented or substantially underrepresented. Agencies can now set aside contracts of any value for WOSBs and award sole-source contracts to WOSBs if the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price, with the anticipated value of the contract below $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts). The Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 established a set-aside program for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs). Agencies can set aside procurements for SDVOSBs when the Rule of Two is met, and sole-source awards are allowed under certain conditions, including a fair market price and a contract value below $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts). The Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 established a set-aside program for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs). The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 created a separate set-aside program for veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) limited to procurements of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VOSBs must have their eligibility verified by VA and may receive sole-source awards. The VA can make sole-source awards to VOSBs for contracts valued at less than $150,000 at the contracting officer's discretion. Contracts over $150,000 must be set-aside if at least two VOSBs can submit offers. Sole-source awards for contracts over $150,000 are possible if the business is responsible, the price is under $5 million, and offers best value to the US. The 2006 act prioritizes awards to SDVOSBs over VOSBs and other small businesses. Legal questions on small business set-asides have increased, with GAO recommending precedence for HUBZone small businesses over SDVOSBs. Agencies were advised to consider set-asides before the International Program Group decision. Prior to GAO's 2008 decision, agencies believed they could choose which set-aside program to use, despite previous rulings indicating HUBZone set-asides were mandatory when the Rule of Two was met. GAO's decision in International Program Group rejected agency discretion in using HUBZone set-asides, clarifying that they must be considered when the Rule of Two is satisfied. The GAO's decision in International Program Group in 2008 prompted increased scrutiny of small business set-asides and the Rule of Two. Contracting officers are only authorized to set aside acquisitions for small businesses if they expect offers from at least two responsible small businesses at fair market price. Contracting officers engage in market research to determine if offers will be received from at least two responsible small businesses at fair market price. The FAR's guidance on market research is limited, allowing agencies to use any reasonable method. Measures include prior procurement history, market surveys, advice from small business specialists, and technical personnel. Inadequate market research can lead to set-aside determinations based on outdated or incomplete information. In determining small business set-asides, contracting officers must consider the availability and capability of potential offerors. Market research should assess if at least two responsible businesses are capable of performing, taking into account their current obligations. The receipt of multiple responses from small businesses does not automatically require a set-aside. Contracting officers have discretion to determine if responsible businesses are capable based on market research. To determine small business set-asides, contracting officers must assess if there are at least two responsible businesses capable of performing. Factors include financial resources, compliance with schedules, performance record, integrity, organization, experience, and technical skills. Agencies do not need to make a responsibility determination for small business offerors to satisfy the Rule of Two, but must use informed business judgment. Contracting officers have discretion in determining if at least two small businesses can perform and expect an award at fair market price. The FAR defines fair market price as reasonable costs under normal competitive conditions. Different methods are used for set-asides for 8(a) firms and non-8(a) firms. Fair market price is estimated using cost or price analysis, commercial prices, in-house cost estimates, SBA data, and data from other agencies for set-asides under the 8(a) program. For set-asides for WOSBs, SDVOSBs, HUBZone small businesses, and others, fair market price is determined differently. Per FAR Section 15.404-1(b), contracting officers use price analysis techniques to determine fair market prices for SDVOSBs, HUBZone small businesses, and other small businesses. Techniques include comparing proposed prices and historical prices for similar items. The focus is on the expectation of receiving an award at a fair market price, not on a guaranteed price. Contracting officers can rely on various information sources for this determination. Contracting officers use price analysis techniques to determine fair market prices for small businesses. They can rely on information from prior procurements and market research to expect adequate price competition. The use of \"shall\" in statutes or regulations may require agencies to set aside procurements for small businesses if certain conditions are met. The use of \"shall\" in statutes or regulations may require agencies to set aside procurements for small businesses if certain conditions are met, including provisions in the Small Business Act and the FAR. However, the extent of the preference for small businesses under these authorities may not be as broad as expected. The FAR exempts certain procurements for small businesses like WOSBs and SDVOSBs from set-aside requirements. The Veterans Benefits Act gives the VA some discretion on set-asides. The Small Business Act allows set-asides for 8(a) firms, WOSBs, and SDVOSBs using \"may,\" not indicating mandatory action. HUBZone set-asides previously used \"shall,\" but the 111th Congress amended the HUBZone Act, removing the requirement for agencies to use a set-aside when the Rule of Two is satisfied. The HUBZone Act was amended by the 111th Congress, removing the requirement for agencies to use a set-aside when the Rule of Two is satisfied. This change impacted the language used in the Small Business Act and FAR regulations, which previously indicated mandatory set-asides for small businesses. The HUBZone Act was amended by the 111th Congress, removing the requirement for agencies to use a set-aside when the Rule of Two is satisfied. This change impacted the language used in the Small Business Act and FAR regulations, which previously indicated mandatory set-asides for small businesses. The determination for set-asides is based on the contracting officer's discretion and the Rule of Two being satisfied. Exceptions to this requirement are outlined in FAR Subsection 19.203(c). Subsection 19.203(c) of the FAR states that for acquisitions exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers should consider small business socioeconomic programs before small business set-asides. Agencies must prioritize sole-source awards to specific small business programs before general set-asides. These exceptions are not explicitly stated in the Small Business Act but fall under the FAR Council's authority. The FAR Council has authority to establish requirements for contracts set aside for small businesses when the Rule of Two is satisfied. This is consistent with Congress's intent for set-asides for specific types of small businesses, highlighting differences between Section 15(a) and its implementing regulations. The Veterans Benefits Act of 2006 amended regulations to require set-asides for SDVOSBs or VOSBs when the Rule of Two is met, ensuring competition among eligible businesses. The VA interpreted the 2006 amendments as allowing purchases through Federal Supply Schedules instead of set-asides for SDVOSBs and VOSBs, even when the Rule of Two is met. Protesters argued that the VA's discretion was limited by the amendments and VA regulations. The protesters challenged the VA's interpretation of the 2006 amendments, arguing that the amendments required set-asides for SDVOSBs and VOSBs whenever the Rule of Two was satisfied. GAO sided with the protesters in multiple bid protest decisions, stating that the VA's interpretation was not entitled to deference. The FAR provisions on small business set-asides do not apply to purchases made through the Schedules. The Court of Federal Claims disagreed with GAO's interpretation of the 2006 amendments, stating that the amendments did not unambiguously require the VA to use set-asides for VOSBs when the Rule of Two is met. The court viewed the amendments as \"goal-setting\" provisions, giving the VA some discretion in using set-asides. The Court of Federal Claims disagreed with GAO's interpretation of the 2006 amendments, stating that the amendments did not unambiguously require the VA to use set-asides for VOSBs when the Rule of Two is met. The court viewed the amendments as \"goal-setting\" provisions, giving the VA some discretion in using set-asides. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision in Kingdomware, stating that the VA may purchase goods or services from VOSBs through the Federal Supply Schedules, which are exempt from small business set-aside requirements. The VA is required to set aside contracts for VOSBs to meet annual goals, as mandated by the Veterans Benefits Act. The Supreme Court is set to review a case regarding this issue. Set-asides can be total or partial, reserving contracts for small businesses. Partial set-asides are used when a total set-aside is not possible, with specific conditions to be met. These set-asides are not applicable to construction contracts and can only be used when the requirement can be divided into multiple economic production runs or lots. The partial set-asides are used when a total set-aside is not possible, with specific conditions to be met. The acquisition must be divided into two or more economic production runs or lots, and at least one small business should have the capacity to meet the set-aside portion at a fair market price. The goods and/or services being procured must be \"severable,\" and it should not be expected that only two concerns, one large and one small, can fulfill the requirements. Decisions not to partially set aside acquisitions have been made when multiple vendors could increase performance risks. The risks of performance in standardizing computer systems can complicate efforts and increase costs for users. Multiple awards of a contract do not prove requirements are severable. Partial set-asides may be improper if the set-aside portion is not economically feasible. The Small Business Act was amended in 2010 to authorize set-asides of orders under ID/IQ contracts. Multiple-award ID/IQ contracts allow for the issuance of orders for supplies over the contract period. Agencies can set aside parts of these contracts for small businesses and their subcategories. Orders can also be set aside for small businesses, bypassing fair opportunity requirements. The authority to set aside orders for small businesses under multiple-award ID/IQ contracts is important, as it allows agencies to bypass fair opportunity requirements. Agencies are not required to set aside orders for small businesses, as the provisions use \"may\" instead of \"shall.\" The 2010 amendments clarified that agencies are not required to set aside orders for small businesses under multiple-award ID/IQ contracts. This overturned a previous GAO decision that orders were subject to \"mandatory\" set-asides. Some question if this was Congress's intent. The question of precedence among set-aside programs has been raised periodically, including in discussions of small business set-asides' priority compared to other procurement preferences. The FAR addresses this, stating agencies must satisfy requirements from listed sources in descending order of priority. The FAR requires agencies to prioritize listed sources in descending order, with Federal Prison Industries having priority over small businesses in certain cases. Agencies must use competitive procedures when FPI has a significant market share, allowing FPI to participate in set-asides for small businesses. The FAR allows agencies to prioritize set-asides for specific types of small businesses, such as 8(a) firms, WOSBs, SDVOSBs, or HUBZone small businesses, over set-asides for small businesses generally. Agencies must consider set-asides for these specific types of small businesses before using a set-aside for small businesses generally. Additionally, agencies must consider sole-source awards to 8(a) firms, SDVOSBs, and HUBZone small businesses before setting them. The FAR allows agencies to prioritize set-asides for specific types of small businesses like 8(a) firms, WOSBs, SDVOSBs, or HUBZone small businesses before considering set-asides for small businesses generally. Agencies should also consider sole-source awards to these specific types of small businesses before setting them. The relationship between set-asides for SDVOSBs and VOSBs under the Veterans Benefits Act and certain \"priority sources\" like AbilityOne is within VA's discretion. For example, GAO upheld a VA procurement through AbilityOne instead of a set-aside for SDVOSBs or VOSBs, as the Veterans Benefits Act does not expressly address the preference for AbilityOne. The VA's interpretation of the 2006 act regarding set-asides for VOSBs and the AbilityOne program was found to be entitled to deference by GAO and the Court of Federal Claims. VA guidelines require contracting officers to research if VOSBs can supply items not on the AbilityOne list before adding them, filling a gap between the 2006 act and the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act. The 2006 act prioritizes contracts for SDVOSBs over VOSBs, which have precedence over 8(a) or HUBZone programs. Set-asides may be required, permitted, or prohibited based on statutory conditions or court orders. The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988 required the Department of Defense to solicit contracts valued over $25,000 on an unrestricted basis, which prevented the use of small business set-asides. Challenges have also prevented agencies from setting aside procurements for 8(a) small businesses due to allegations of discrimination. Eligibility for the 8(a) Program is based on race, and the government must show that the program is narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government interest. The government must have a \"strong basis in evidence\" to conclude that race-conscious remedies are necessary. Lack of evidence of discrimination has led to restrictions on using 8(a) set-asides in certain industries or areas. For example, in DynaLantic Corporation v. U.S. Department of Defense in 2012, the court found inadequate evidence of discrimination. In a case against the U.S. Department of Defense, the court found the 8(a) Program unconstitutional in the military simulation and training industry due to lack of evidence of discrimination. The court enjoined SBA and DOD from awarding procurements for military simulators under the program without strong evidence. The VA also faced a similar situation recently. The VA is required to use set-asides for SDVOSBs or other VOSBs when the Rule of Two is met, but also must procure certain services through AbilityOne. VA issued guidance directing procurement from AbilityOne instead of VOSB set-asides, which was challenged. GAO found VA's guidance was within its authority as the 2006 amendments did not specify how VA's obligations under the Veterans Benefits Act should be fulfilled. The 2006 amendments did not specify how VA's obligations under the Veterans Benefits Act should be reconciled with its obligations to AbilityOne. GAO believed VA had the discretion to prevent set-asides for items on the AbilityOne list. Courts have rejected challenges to small business set-asides, indicating that set-asides do not violate the requirement for selection on a \"competitive basis.\" The court rejected arguments that set-asides are exceptions to selection on a \"competitive basis\" under the Workforce Investment Act. They found that \"competitive procedures\" constitute selection on a competitive basis. The court also stated that small business set-asides are not noncompetitive, which could have broader implications. In 2014, Congress required DOL to allow operators of \"high-performing centers\" to participate in competitive selection processes for Center operators under the Workforce Investment Act. Determining small business set-aside requirements can be complex due to multiple statutes governing different actions for various types of small businesses, enacted between 1958 and 2006. These statutes have not always been consistent in their treatment of sole-source awards to 8(a) firms compared to other small businesses, implemented by SBA regulations and the FAR over the years. The statutes and regulations governing small business set-aside requirements have been implemented over the years, with interpretations varying among different tribunals. The high stakes involved in federal contract dollars can lead to differing views on specific provisions, such as the use of set-asides for VOSBs. Some may focus on specific words in procurement regulations to influence competition. Questions may arise about the intent behind existing provisions and whether they align with industry practices. Congress could address conflicting interpretations by amending statutes, updating regulations, or enforcing specific interpretations."
