Comparison metrics include piece-wise Pearson correlation and information geometry-based similarity measurement. The technique is applied to datasets from air traffic control, eye-tracking, and GPS. The paper introduces a novel brushing technique that considers location and shape to select similar items in large datasets, using comparison metrics like Pearson correlation and information geometry-based similarity measurement. It is applied to datasets from air traffic control, eye-tracking, and GPS trajectories. Our shaped-based brushing technique allows users to select trajectories based on shape similarity, avoiding clutter in dense visualizations. This method helps users visually identify relevant patterns and select them interactively, improving the selection process compared to standard brushing techniques. The paper proposes a novel brushing technique that filters trajectories based on shape similarity, improving the selection process in dense visualizations. This technique utilizes a shape comparison algorithm to provide a numerical similarity measurement for filtering trajectories. The paper introduces a novel shape-based brushing tool that combines brushing and shape comparison techniques for trajectory analysis. It fulfills design requirements for incremental selection refinement and interactivity. The paper discusses previous works, details the brushing pipeline, demonstrates use-cases, and evaluates the technique's usefulness, applications, and limitations. The paper discusses domain-specific techniques for trail-set exploration and analysis, focusing on brushing, query-by-content, and similarity measurement. Brushing is highlighted as a powerful selection technique for information visualization, allowing users to interactively highlight data subsets. The approach is based on dynamic queries and interactive filtering techniques for refining selections. The paper suggests a shape-based brushing technique for trail sets in spatio-temporal visualization. Existing systems use selection techniques like brushing but do not consider the shape of trails, making it challenging to select specific shapes. Researchers have explored shape-based selection techniques in various contexts, including using arbitrary shapes and sketch-based queries. Sketch-based querying offers advantages over traditional selection methods, such as the ability to search and localize time series patterns of interest. Previous work in this area has focused on domain-specific applications and used the Euclidean distance metric, which may not be robust for similarity detection. Additionally, user-sketched pattern matching plays a crucial role in selecting relevant data. The relaxed selection technique allows users to draw a query to select the relevant part of a time-series. Other approaches use boxes and spheres to specify regions of interest, requiring analysts to adjust parameters multiple times for a single selection. The relaxed selection technique allows users to draw a query to select the relevant part of a time-series. Many selection box modifications are required to refine the selection efficiency. Common approaches for retrieving similar trajectories include K-nearest neighbors based on Euclidean distance or elastic matching metrics. Euclidean distance is simple to calculate but unbounded and task-specific. Some works suggest transforming raw data into a lower-dimensional representation. In contrast to K-nearest neighbors based on Euclidean distance or elastic matching metrics, Dynamic Time Warping is considered the best measurement for selecting shapes by matching their representation in various applications such as gestures recognition, eye movements, and shapes. It offers a more flexible and generalized approach compared to other methods like SAX and PAA, which require adjusting dataset-dependent parameters. The k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) approach has been studied for trail similarity detection, but it may not capture differences in shapes accurately. Other measurements like Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBR) and Fr\u00e9chet Distance calculate trajectory segment similarity using perpendicular, parallel, and angular distances. To address these issues, two approaches are proposed: one based on calculating correlations on x-axis and y-axis independently, and the other based on geometrical information of the trails. The paper's approach leverages geometrical information of trails to enable efficient shape-based brushing for large datasets. The interactive pipeline allows for detailed motif discovery through user input, brush extraction, similarity measurement, binning, and filtering processes. The interactive pipeline enables shape-based brushing for large datasets by allowing users to refine the brush area and choose comparison metrics like Pearson and FPCA for shape and curvature comparison. Different metrics produce varying results, and users can select the appropriate one based on the filtering needed. Initial consideration of Euclidean distance and DTW was quickly replaced by the current algorithms. The interactive pipeline allows users to refine brush areas and choose comparison metrics like Pearson's Correlation (PC) and Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) for shape and curvature comparison. PC values > 0.8 indicate shape similarity, surpassing the limitations of Euclidean distance (ED). PC offers a consistent threshold across datasets, unlike ED's context-dependent threshold. The direction of trajectories, crucial for brushing techniques, is not supported by ED and DTW. Functional Data Analysis is a statistical tool that measures dataset similarity using Pearson's Correlation (PC) for trajectory points. PC produces a measurement between -1 and 1, with 1 indicating high similarity and -1 indicating anti-correlation. It is invariant in point translation and trajectory scale but does not consider point order. The pipeline also considers FPCA for trajectory shape, which does not account for negative correlation. Functional Data Analysis is an information geometry approach that captures statistical properties of multivariate data functions, such as curves in an infinite-dimensional space. The Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) computes data variability around the mean curve of a cluster and estimates Karhunen-Loeve expansion scores using eigen functions and principal component scores. The principal component functions, \u03c6 j, are eigenfunctions of the covariance operator with eigenvalues \u03bb j. Hurter et al. [28] provide a discrete implementation. Using the mean curve \u03b3 and principal component functions \u03c6 j, a group of curves can be described and reconstructed with the principal component score matrix b j. The interaction pipeline filters items based on user brush input, storing brushed items in bins for further refinement and selection adjustments. The user can adjust the selection with brushing interactions using both PC and FPCA separately. Each small multiple represents one metric exclusively. An example in Figure 3 shows how brushing around curve 3 selects curves 1 and 2. Pearson computation reveals correlation with curve 2 and anti-correlation with curve 3. FPCA considers curvature similarity, identifying shape 3 as highly similar to the brush input. The explained variance is optimized by selecting b j scores with a defined percentile. The metric computation uses the first two Principal Component functions to compute a meaningful metric (DR2). The metric computation in the pipeline uses the first two Principal Components (PC) to define a representative point for each trajectory. The Euclidean distance between the brush shape and each trajectory is computed in a Cartesian scatterplot PC1/PC2. The distances are normalized between [0, 1], with 1 indicating the largest shape difference. The resulting values are stored in bins for sorting from least to most similar trajectories. The binning process operates similarly to Pearson measurements and FPCA. Each bin visually represents trajectories through small multiples. The user can interactively filter selected items with a range slider on top of small multiple visualizations to remove uncorrelated items or refine correlated ones. This technique enables flexible and rapid brushing of trajectories by location and shape, illustrated in a scenario where an air traffic management expert studies flight data. Aircraft trajectories can be visually represented as connected line segments on a map, with the option to present them in 3D and vary their appearances. Edge bundling techniques have been used to reduce clutter and occlusion in visualizations of trajectories, but they can distort trajectory shapes. Analysts need to explore datasets to compare expected and actual aircraft trajectories, detect unexpected patterns, and analyze traffic in dense areas. Most systems only support selection techniques based on starting and end points or predefined regions. Interactive shape brush technique is proposed as a helpful tool for tasks requiring visual inspection, detection, and selection of specific patterns in data. This technique enables easier manipulation of data by selecting patterns based on their shape characteristics. An example scenario involves analyzing 4320 aircraft trajectories in French airspace, defining a trail as a set of consecutive points. The interactive shape brush technique is used for analyzing 4320 aircraft trajectories in French airspace. Trails are defined as sets of consecutive points, with the shape smoothed and resampled for comparison using similarity metrics. The user can explore the data using pan and zoom operations. The user explores 4320 aircraft trajectories in French airspace using pan and zoom operations. They can choose between subsequence match or exact match for trajectory selection based on length and shape. The analyst activates subsequence match and starts brushing near the target. The user explores aircraft trajectories in French airspace using subsequence match for trajectory selection. They brush near the target trajectories to define the brush region and shape, highlighting selected trajectories in green. Similarity calculation between the shape and brushed region produces values for each trail, allowing for fine control over the final selection. The range slider allows for fine control over trajectory selection by adjusting similarity levels and the number of trajectories chosen. A colored heatmap displays the distribution of similarity values to aid in navigation. The expert uses shape brushes to select specific flight trajectories based on their correlation with the original brush. They switch to FPCA metric for more precise selection, arranging trajectories from less to more similar. This allows them to identify planes landing on the north strip but not coming from the east.

They switch to FPCA metric for more precise selection, arranging trajectories from less to more similar. This allows them to identify planes landing on the north strip but not coming from the east. The brushing technique enables the selection of trajectories that do not match the specified shape but are contained in the brushing region, with a focus on selecting motifs in datasets. The system was built using C# and OpenTK on a 64bit 1 XPS 15 Dell Laptop, with a strong demand for targeted brushing to select motifs in datasets. The running performance was 10 times faster with PC compared to FPCA. The technique was informally tested with experts from the aerospace domain, showing positive feedback but some limitations in understanding filtering parameters. Users needed a small training period to better understand the interaction technique. The interaction technique requires a small training period for users to understand the semantic of small multiples. It provides good selection results without parameter adjustment and complements standard brushing. The goal is to facilitate trajectory selection in dense areas, reducing the need for multiple user actions. Eye-tracking technologies are gaining popularity for analyzing human behavior in various fields. Eye-tracking technology involves tracking the user's eye movements to determine points of interest. The data collected includes fixations (where the user focuses for a period) and saccades (rapid eye movements between fixations), which together form a scanpath. The scanpath may face challenges like overplotting. The scanpath, subject to overplotting, can be addressed with precise brushing techniques to select specific trails. Fixation events are studied to create an attention map showing salient elements in high density fixation areas. Saccades maintain links between fixations, providing temporal information. Discovering patterns in raw scanpath data is challenging due to sparse and irregular eye movements. Various visualizations, like edge bundling techniques, have been proposed to minimize visual clutter in scanpaths. The study describes a new approach for efficient motif discovery in eye tracking datasets, using a dataset from a cockpit eye movement recording. The approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing techniques that alter trail properties or are computationally expensive. The study presents a new approach for motif discovery in eye tracking datasets, focusing on cockpit eye movements. It aims to reduce noise from microsaccades and tracking devices, allowing exploration of pilot attention patterns in the cockpit. The order of pilot attention is crucial for interpreting information displayed on different instruments. For example, the priority of the Primary Flight Display (PFD) over the Flight Control Unit (FCU) varies during different flight phases. The study introduces a new method for analyzing eye movements in cockpit settings. It focuses on exploring the transition of eye movements from the Primary Flight Display (PFD) to the Navigation Display (ND) using a unique brushing technique. The results show different patterns of saccades between these displays, with only one saccade observed between the ND and the Flight Control Unit (FCU). The tool allows experts to analyze eye movements in cockpit settings, focusing on transitions between displays. It reveals unique patterns of saccades, with only one observed between the Navigation Display (ND) and the Flight Control Unit (FCU). The tool also enables visualization of saccadic movements in a temporal view, providing insight into when these movements occur. GPS trajectories track spatial locations of subjects like people and vehicles. Analysts track modes and devices by analyzing spatial positions. Advances in position-acquisition have provided large location data for different moving targets. Novel approaches are needed to mine this data, traditionally done by analyzing GPS logs and trajectories using distance functions and processing algorithms. The data from Zheng et al. is used to analyze GPS trajectories of users in Beijing collected over five years. Bounding boxes are used to select trajectories passing through specific locations, but do not simplify analysis of overlapping and directional trajectories. The study analyzes GPS trajectories of users in Beijing over five years, focusing on path differentiation and direction. The authors use shape-based brushing to explore event sequences and refine results using FPCA metric and small multiples. This allows them to select trajectories with specific event sequences passing through certain locations. The proposed brushing technique leverages existing methods with the novel usage of the shape of the brush as an additional filtering parameter. It allows users to gain insight about the visitation order of selected locations by switching between correlated and anti-correlated trajectories. The interaction pipeline involves different data processing steps, including comparison algorithms between brushed items and the shape of the brush. The contribution of this paper is a novel shape-based brushing technique that utilizes FPCA distance and Pearson metric for curve similarity measurement. The binning process aids in visualizing trajectory shapes and facilitates filtering and adjustment of selected items in a continuous manner. The presented scenario demonstrates how small multiple interaction can enhance flexibility in filtering trajectories. The proposed shape-based brushing technique allows for accurate filtering parameters and various visual mapping solutions. It can be applied to different moving object datasets beyond the three mentioned application domains. The shape-based brush technique complements traditional brushing methods, enabling selection of difficult trails and novel comparison perspectives. While not claiming superiority in all cases, the technique shows potential with examples provided. Limitations include selection flexibility, but extensions can be applied to address this issue. This technique mainly addresses DR4 for refined selections. The curr_chunk discusses refining selections through user inputs, using Boolean operations like And, Or, Not. Hurter et al. proposed a drag and drop technique for implicit item composition. The pipeline can store filtered items for final composition, allowing users to refine selections by adding, removing, or merging. Additionally, a sketch-based brushing technique for trail selection in occluded and cluttered data visualization is introduced. The curr_chunk discusses a shape-based brushing tool for selecting trajectories in occluded and cluttered data visualization. Users brush the trajectory of interest, and the system pre-selects trajectories that touch the brush area. A distance is computed between brushed shapes and the brush area, and comparison scores are sorted to display trajectories from least to most correlated. Users can adjust a filtering parameter to refine selected trajectories with suitable correlation. The technique relies on shape comparison for selection refinement. The shape-based technique for selecting trajectories in occluded and cluttered data visualization relies on two algorithms for flexibility in trajectory selection. Validation is shown with examples of trail datasets, and potential extensions include applying the method to different types of datasets like car or animal movements, exploring virtual reality data, and enhancing mouse pointer usage. In the near future, there will be an investigation into adding machine learning to assist users in selecting relevant trajectories, especially in dense areas where occlusion may hinder visibility. Visual processing could be used to guide users during the brushing process."
