    "content": "When legislation is enacted under Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution, it is classified as either a public law or a private law. Each statute is assigned a number based on its order of enactment within a Congress. Private laws benefit specific individuals or entities, while public laws are general and permanent, forming the basis of the Code. The first official publication of a law is called the slip law, and the Government Printing Office's Federal Digital System provides free online access to federal laws. The Government Printing Office's Federal Digital System (FDsys) offers free online access to official federal government publications, including individual slip laws. Federal Depository Libraries across the United States also provide public access to federal publications. Some libraries compile laws in looseleaf binders or microfiche collections. The U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News (U.S.C.C.A.N.) publishes public laws chronologically in slip law version, with annual bound volumes and monthly supplements containing new enactments and reports. The U.S.C.S. and the U.S.C.A. publish new public laws chronologically as supplements in the Statutes at Large. Researchers refer to this publication for original language of statutes not codified in the Code. Most statutes revise existing laws rather than initiate new programs. For example, in 1952, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was amended by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. These amendments made it illegal to hire illegal aliens in the United States and required employers to verify the legal status of new employees. The 1996 act amended the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, specifically Section 274A and Section 1324a in Title 8 of the U.S.C. Congress often works on an updated version of earlier public laws, not the U.S. Code. The Code provides the authoritative version of public laws with an asterisk, while discrepancies are resolved using the Statutes at Large. The Statutes at Large is the authoritative source for federal legislation, not the U.S. Code. Updated versions of public laws can be found in committee prints, commercial publishers, and online. The United States Code (U.S.C.) is the official codification of federal laws, published every six years with annual supplements. The U.S. Code (U.S.C.) is the official codification of federal laws, organized into 51 titles, each further divided into chapters and sections. It is cited by title and section number, with notes at the end of each section providing additional information. Unofficial editions like the United States Code Annotated (U.S.C.A.) and United States Code Service (U.S.C.S.) are also available. The U.S.C.A. and U.S.C.S. by LexisNexis are unofficial editions of the U.S. Code, providing annotations, cross-references, historical notes, and references to secondary sources. They are updated with annual inserts or supplements containing newly codified laws and annotations. The editions also issue pamphlets with copies of recently enacted public laws. Each edition includes a comprehensive index organized by subject, updated in annual supplements. The Code includes a comprehensive index organized by subject and updated annually. It also has a table to find acts and their codification. The Statutes at Large table helps researchers locate laws and their status. When searching in a law with many subsections, a table can help locate where individual sections and subsections have been codified. Legal resources, including federal statutes, are accessible online, but caution is needed as materials may not be current or easily found, especially for frequently amended statutes. Federal agencies may not always provide the most up-to-date versions of the statutes they administer on their websites. Public resources for selected statutory materials include the Public Laws Library of Congress - American Memory and Library of Congress: THOMAS, providing access to statutes from various Congresses. Websites may not always have current versions of statutes and their information may change. The GPO's Federal Digital System and the United States Code Office of the Law Revision Counsel provide access to public laws and statutes from various Congresses, including the 101st Congress to present and the 2006 edition and its supplements. The websites offer advanced search capabilities for multiple collections. The Office of the Law Revision Counsel and the U.S. Code Classification Tables provide access to public laws and statutes from various Congresses, with advanced search capabilities for multiple collections. The Popular Name Index lists popular and statutory names of Acts in alphabetical order."
