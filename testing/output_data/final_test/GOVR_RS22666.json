    "content": "The GI Bill of 1944 provided cash allowance for unemployed veterans, as they were not eligible for unemployment compensation at the time. However, few veterans utilized this program due to economic growth post-World War II and the GI Bill's education benefits. Currently, veterans are eligible for unemployment compensation instead of a cash allowance. The federal government offers programs and preferences for veterans seeking civilian employment. The Department of Labor, in partnership with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, runs the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) and Disabled Transition Assistance Program (DTAP) to help servicemembers find civilian jobs within 180 days of separation from the military. TAP is a three-day workshop covering job search, market conditions, resume preparation, and interview techniques, while DTAP provides additional support for disabled servicemembers. Additionally, information on veterans benefits is provided. P.L. 112-56 amends the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) for veterans, requiring all eligible Armed Forces members to participate, with exceptions for certain cases. A study will be conducted to identify equivalences between military training and civilian employment, with results to be shared with Congress and the public. Each servicemember in TAP will receive an individualized assessment for civilian transition. The VA Secretary is required to provide individualized assessment and services to servicemembers in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) for civilian employment transition. This includes counseling, job application assistance, academic readiness assessment, and other relevant services. Private entities may also be contracted to provide TAP instruction on private sector culture and job search training. The DOD Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security may allow eligible Armed Forces members in the TAP program to join an apprenticeship program. The comptroller general will review TAP before November 21, 2013, and report to Congress with recommendations. The DOL VETS offers assistance to veterans through the JVSG Program, funding DVOP specialists and LVERs for outreach and job assistance. The DOL VETS office provides outreach and job assistance to disabled veterans with barriers to employment. LVER staff help veterans find jobs and encourage businesses to hire veterans. P.L. 112-56 authorizes grants for training and mentoring veterans seeking employment, with a $4.5 million budget for FY2012-FY2013. Grant recipients must collaborate with disabled veterans' outreach specialists and local veterans' employment representatives. The DOL Secretary must report to Congress on grant processes within six months and assess grant results within 18 months. The VETS office operates the Veterans' Workforce Investment Program (VWIP) to help reintegrate veterans into the civilian labor force. Grants are provided to fund programs that address veterans' needs in the workforce. Additionally, the office offers grants under the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program and provides information on re-employment rights to veterans and employers. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) requires priority in services for veterans and eligible spouses in workforce development programs funded by the Department of Labor. Veterans receive federal hiring preference through point preference, special appointment authority, and affirmative action requirements. This preference aims to prevent penalization for military service. Veterans with an honorable or general discharge who served on active duty during specific periods or campaigns are eligible for a five-point preference in federal hiring. This preference applies to those who served during wars, certain timeframes, or in designated campaigns such as the Gulf War. Veterans who enlisted after specific dates must have served continuously for 24 months to qualify for preference in federal hiring. Military retirees above the rank of major are not entitled to preference unless they are disabled veterans. A 10-point preference is given to honorably separated veterans who are disabled, Purple Heart recipients, spouses of disabled veterans, and unmarried widows of certain deceased veterans. P.L. 112-56 allows servicemembers to be certified as preference eligible for federal employment within 120 days of separation. Three special appointment authorities for veterans include Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA), Veterans Employment Opportunity Acts (VEOA), and 30% or More Disabled Veteran. VRA allows agencies to appoint eligible veterans without competition, leading to a career-conditional appointment after two years of service. Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) allows federal agencies to appoint eligible veterans without competition, leading to a career-conditional appointment after two years of service. VRA appointees must meet specific criteria, including being disabled veterans, veterans who served during a war, or in a campaign with a campaign badge, or veterans who participated in a U.S. military operation with an Armed Forces service medal. Additionally, veterans must have been separated under honorable conditions. The Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA) allows federal agencies to recruit outside their workforce for competitive service openings. Veterans, including those with a 30% or more service-connected disability, can be appointed non-competitively to permanent, temporary, or term positions. Agencies must have an affirmative action program for disabled veterans as part of their hiring efforts. Federal agencies must have an affirmative action program for disabled veterans to hire, place, and advance them under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Contractors with federal contracts over $100,000 must report efforts to hire veterans in specific categories. President Obama issued Executive Order 13518 in 2009, establishing a Veterans Hiring Initiative and a Council on Veterans Employment. The Office of Personnel Management created a website, fedshirevets.gov, to help veterans find federal government employment. Agencies are required to establish programs to assist separating servicemembers in finding employment, coordinated with the Transition Assistance Program (TAP). The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2003 authorized funds transfer to support veterans' employment through programs like \"Helmets to Hardhats\" in the construction industry. The Department of Education also transfers funds for the \"Troops 2 Teachers\" Program. The \"Troops 2 Teachers\" Program offers funding of up to $5,000 for military personnel to become certified teachers. Participants teaching in high-poverty schools may receive a bonus of up to $10,000. The program had a funding of $14 million for FY2010."
