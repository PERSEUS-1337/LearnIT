    "content": "The \"Medical Device Cybersecurity Act of 2017\" is introduced as an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to address cybersecurity for medical devices. It includes a new section, 520A, specifically focusing on cybersecurity measures for these devices. The \"Medical Device Cybersecurity Act of 2017\" introduces definitions for \"cyber device\" and \"cybersecurity fix or update\" to address cybersecurity for medical devices. It also includes provisions for transparency of risk prior to marketing. The entities listed in subparagraph (B) will develop a cybersecurity report card for cyber devices, including key contents and disclosure requirements. These entities include the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the National Coordination Office supporting the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, the Federal Trade Commission, and any other relevant agency. The cybersecurity report card for medical devices will include information on essential elements from the Manufacturer Disclosure Statement and a traceability matrix approved by the Secretary. The cybersecurity report for medical devices must include design components and compensating controls, manufacturer compensating controls addressing vulnerabilities, industry standard controls, details of cybersecurity evaluation, testing, validation, and results. The cybersecurity report for medical devices should include a risk assessment, indication of remote access capability, security measures in place, and disclosure in notifications to the FDA. The Secretary must provide a copy of the cybersecurity report card to specified entities upon request, including health care industry entities and other approved organizations. The manufacturer of a cyber device must submit an annual update to the Secretary for the report card as long as the device receives technical support. Consent is required from the provider to remotely access the device after ownership transfer. The manufacturer of a cyber device must obtain consent from the provider and potentially the patient for remote access. Consent can be in the form of an agreement between the provider and manufacturer at the time of sale or through subsequent agreements. The manufacturer must notify the provider when accessing the device remotely, maintain an audit log of each access, and make it accessible to the provider. The manufacturer must implement multi-factor authentication, data encryption, automated access tracking, whitelisting, and changeable passwords for cyber devices accessed remotely. The manufacturer must comply with remote access provisions recommended by NIST for cyber devices. Manufacturers can request exemptions from certain requirements if minimal risks are proven. The manufacturer of a cyber device must provide free cybersecurity fixes or updates until the expiration of any agreement with a provider. Cybersecurity fixes or updates do not require new notifications or premarket approval, except in unique circumstances requested by the Secretary. The manufacturer must provide cybersecurity fixes or updates for a cyber device until the expiration of any agreement with a provider or for 10 years after discontinuing marketing the device. When declaring the end-of-life for a device, the manufacturer must provide a report card to providers, inform them of the discontinuation, and give notice of the last cybersecurity fix or update date. The manufacturer must provide cybersecurity fixes or updates for a cyber device until the expiration of any agreement with a provider or for 10 years after discontinuing marketing the device. When declaring the end-of-life for a device, the manufacturer must notify the Secretary, provide information to providers on compensating controls, secure preparation for recycling, infrastructure architecture guidance, and instructions for deleting personal information. The section provides instructions on deleting sensitive data from cyber devices and outlines enforcement measures for non-compliance. It also expands the responsibilities of ICS-CERT regarding cyber device definitions. The term \"cyber device\" is defined in section 520A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. ICS-CERT refers to the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team. The Under Secretary is appointed under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Under Secretary is required to expand responsibilities within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Under Secretary must expand ICS-CERT's duties to investigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities in cyber devices that may harm human life or misuse health information. They must also coordinate responses with relevant agencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security will issue rules for coordinated disclosure of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in cyber devices, outlining roles, responsibilities, timelines, and enforcement measures involving ICS-CERT, manufacturers, and providers. The Under Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 1 year detailing the expanded duties and mission of ICS-CERT in collaboration with manufacturers and providers of cyber devices."
