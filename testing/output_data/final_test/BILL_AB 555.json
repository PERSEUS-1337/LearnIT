    "title": "AB 555",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Chapter 4.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure in California is amended to allow for Voluntary Expedited Jury Trials. Parties agreeing to participate must sign a consent order, which is binding unless all parties agree to end it or the court finds good cause to not proceed. Any agreement for an expedited jury trial in California must be made after a dispute has arisen and an action has been filed. The court must approve the use of expedited jury trials for self-represented litigants or individuals who are minors, incompetent, or under conservatorship. The proposed consent order submitted to the court must include specific details. The proposed consent order for an expedited jury trial in California must include a preliminary statement informing all parties and insurance carriers of the process, agreement to waive appeal rights, and a five-hour limit for voir dire and case presentation. The proposed consent order for an expedited jury trial in California includes provisions for a jury of eight or fewer jurors, limited peremptory challenges, and adherence to specific trial procedures unless parties agree otherwise. The court must approve the consent order unless there is good cause to deny it. The Judicial Council will update rules and forms by July 1, 2016, to implement uniform procedures for expedited jury trials in limited civil cases, including content of consent orders, pretrial exchanges, conferences, evidence presentation, and other necessary procedures. Section 630.12 of the Code of Civil Procedure is repealed, and Chapter 4.6 is added to establish mandatory expedited jury trials. Chapter 4.6 introduces mandatory expedited jury trials for limited civil cases, with certain criteria allowing parties to opt out of these procedures. This includes cases involving punitive damages, damages exceeding insurance policy limits, legal defense with a reservation of rights by a party's insurer, claims reportable to a governmental entity, claims affecting professional licensing due to moral turpitude, and claims of intentional conduct. The case involves claims of intentional conduct and has been reclassified as unlimited. The complaint includes a demand for attorney's fees, with exceptions. Good cause must be shown for the action not to proceed under this chapter, such as needing more than five hours for the case. This chapter does not apply to forcible entry or unlawful detainer proceedings. A judgment in a limited civil case with a mandatory expedited jury trial can be appealed to the appellate division of the superior court. 630.21. \"Mandatory expedited jury trial\" is a trial before a reduced jury panel and a judge. \"High/low agreement\" is a written agreement specifying minimum and maximum damages. 630.22. Procedures in this chapter apply to mandatory expedited jury trials in limited civil cases, unless parties agree otherwise. The procedures for mandatory expedited jury trials include each side having up to five hours for voir dire and presenting their case. The jury consists of eight jurors and one alternate, with each side limited to four peremptory challenges. Additional challenges may be granted in cases with more than two sides. Any matters not addressed in this chapter are governed by applicable statutes and rules. The parties can modify rules with court approval. Jury can deliberate as long as needed. Rules of evidence apply unless parties agree otherwise. Subpoenas and notices for witnesses are allowed. Verdict requires six out of eight jurors, unless stipulated otherwise. The Judicial Council will establish rules for limited civil cases with mandatory expedited jury trials, including pretrial procedures, evidence presentation, and other necessary procedures by July 1, 2016. Sections 630.20 to 630.27 will be in effect starting July 1, 2016, with any necessary procedures to implement this chapter. The chapter will be repealed on July 1, 2019, unless a later statute extends this date."
