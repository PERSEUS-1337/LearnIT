    "content": "In 2013, the U.S. poverty rate was 14.5%, a decrease from 15.0% in 2012. 45.3 million people were estimated to be below the poverty line, similar to 46.5 million in 2012. Poverty levels closely follow the economic cycle, rising during economic downturns and falling during periods of growth. The poverty rate increased over the past decade due to economic recessions, with a historic low of 11.3% in 2000. The poverty rate in the U.S. was 11.3% in 2000, tied with the lowest rate in 1973. It increased from 2001 to 2004 due to economic recessions, peaking at 10.0% in 2009. Despite the economy recovering, poverty remained high until a significant decline in recent years. The official poverty rate in the U.S. has seen a marked decline, with the unemployment rate also falling in 2014. Poverty statistics for 2014 will be released in late summer 2015. The recession particularly impacted non-aged adults and children, with the poverty rate for non-aged adults reaching 13.8% in 2010. In 2013, the poverty rate for non-aged adults remained unchanged at 13.6%. The number of poor children and their poverty rate decreased from 2012 to 2013, with an estimated 1.3 million fewer poor children in 2013. In 2013, the number of poor children decreased by 1.3 million, with a poverty rate of 19.5%. Child poverty is sensitive to economic cycles, often requiring two working parents to support a family. The aged poverty rate in 2013 was 9.5%, with 4.2 million aged individuals living in poverty. Despite the recession, the aged poverty rate remains near historic lows. The secular trend in poverty has been influenced by changes in household composition and government income security programs. Social Security and pension systems have significantly reduced poverty among the elderly. The Census Bureau's poverty thresholds are used to estimate poverty in the US based on the amount needed to purchase essential goods and services. These thresholds are updated annually for inflation. The current official U.S. poverty measure, developed in the early 1960s, is based on a minimal standard of food consumption. The poverty thresholds are updated annually for changes in consumer prices. In 2013, the average poverty threshold was $11,888 for an individual, $15,142 for a two-person family, and $23,834 for a family of four. The official U.S. poverty measure, established in the early 1960s, is based on a minimal standard of food consumption. The poverty line reflects economic need based on living standards from the mid-1950s and is not adjusted for changes in living standards over time. If the methodology from the 1960s was applied today, poverty thresholds would be over three times higher. Persons are considered poor if their family's income is below the poverty threshold, based on a Census Bureau survey. The official definition of poverty includes various sources of income but excludes noncash and \"near cash\" benefits. The Census Bureau, in partnership with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has released a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) to address flaws in the official poverty measure. Poverty is concentrated among minorities, women, children, the elderly, the unemployed, and those with low education or skills. African Americans and Hispanics have higher poverty rates than whites. In 2013, poverty rates among African Americans and Hispanics were significantly higher than that of whites. Blacks and Hispanics had incomes below poverty at 27.2% and 23.5% respectively, compared to 9.6% for non-Hispanic whites and 10.5% for Asians. Blacks and Hispanics also made up a larger percentage of the poor population compared to their total population. Poverty rates for Hispanics decreased from 25.6% in 2012 to 23.5% in 2013, while poverty rates for whites, blacks, and Asians remained unchanged. Among the native-born population, 13.9% were poor in 2013, while 18.0% of the foreign-born population were poor. In 2013, the poverty rate among the foreign-born population was 18.0%, with 7.4 million individuals living in poverty. The poverty rate for foreign-born naturalized citizens was 12.7%, lower than that of native-born U.S. citizens. The poverty rate for non-citizens dropped to 22.8% in 2013, with about 4.0 million individuals living in poverty. Child poverty also decreased significantly in 2013, with an estimated 1.3 million fewer children living in poverty compared to 2012. In 2013, child poverty rates were influenced by the high percentage of children living in single female-headed families, with 45.8% of them being poor compared to 9.5% in married-couple families. The share of children in single female-headed families has doubled since 1969, contributing to the overall child poverty rate. In 2013, 58.7% of poor children were from single female-headed families. In 2013, child poverty rates were significantly influenced by the high percentage of children living in single female-headed families. Among these families, over half of black and Hispanic children were poor, compared to one-third of non-Hispanic white children. The poverty rate among Hispanic children in married-couple families was higher than that of black children, and four times higher than non-Hispanic white children in similar families. Adults with low education or unemployment also contributed to high child poverty rates. Adults with low education, unemployment, or work-related disabilities are more likely to be in poverty. In 2013, 36.8% of 25- to 34-year-olds without a high school diploma were poor, compared to 6.5% of those with a bachelor's degree. Among unemployed individuals aged 16-64, 29.8% were poor, while only 6.9% of employed individuals were in poverty. Additionally, 11.3% of the 16- to 64-year-old population had a work disability, with 26.0% of the poor falling into this category. In 2013, the poverty rate among persons age 65 and older was 9.5%, with 4.2 million aged individuals living in poverty. Among those aged 75 and over, 11.2% were poor. Nearly three-quarters of poor persons lived in poverty. In 2013, a significant percentage of poor persons lived in households that received means-tested assistance, including cash aid, SNAP benefits, Medicaid, and subsidized housing. Poor single-parent families with children were among the most likely to receive cash aid. In 2013, about 21.9% of families received government cash aid, down from 24.0% in 2012. Poverty is more concentrated in center cities compared to suburban areas and varies by race and ethnicity. Among the poor, living in areas of concentrated poverty differs by location within metropolitan areas. In 2013, poverty rates varied by location, with central city areas having a higher rate (19.1%) compared to suburban areas (11.1%). Nonmetropolitan areas had a poverty rate of 16.1%. Only nonmetropolitan areas saw a significant decline in poverty from 2012 to 2013, with the rate dropping from 17.7% to 16.1%. Poverty rates were lowest in the Northeast (12.7%) and Midwest (12.9%), and highest in the South (16.1%). Poverty rates varied by location in 2013, with the South having the highest rate. Poverty rates remained stable in each region from 2012 to 2013. States bordering Mexico, along the Ohio River, and in the eastern and western halves of the nation had higher poverty rates. Some states had rates well below the national average. In 2013, poverty rates varied by location in the United States, with the South having the highest rate. States bordering Mexico, along the Ohio River, and in the eastern and western halves of the nation had higher poverty rates. Figure 6 displays estimated poverty rates for each state based on the 2013 American Community Survey data, showing a 90% confidence interval around each state's estimate. States with non-overlapping confidence intervals have significantly different poverty rates. In 2013, poverty rates varied by location in the United States, with the South having the highest rate. States bordering Mexico, along the Ohio River, and in the eastern and western halves of the nation had higher poverty rates. Confidence intervals may also have significantly different poverty rates from one another, measured at the 90% confidence interval. New Hampshire and Alaska are statistically tied for the lowest poverty rate, while Mississippi has the highest poverty rate. Louisiana, Arkansas, and the District of Columbia have high poverty rates as well. Table 1 provides estimates of state and national poverty rates from 2002 through 2013. Table 1 shows that three states (New Jersey, New Mexico, and Washington) had significant increases in poverty rates from 2012 to 2013, while four states (Colorado, New Hampshire, Texas, and Wyoming) saw significant decreases in poverty rates. From 2002 to 2005, poverty rates generally increased among states, following the 2001 economic recession. In 2005, poverty was higher in 22 states compared to 2002, with only one state showing a decrease. By 2007, 13 states were starting to see improvements in poverty rates. Since 2007, state poverty rates have generally increased due to the recession. From 2007 to 2010, many states experienced significant increases in poverty rates, with only a few states seeing decreases. Since 2007, state poverty rates have generally increased due to the recession. Comparing 2013 to 2007, poverty rates were statistically higher in 48 states, with no state having a poverty rate statistically below its prerecession rate. Tables provide poverty estimates for large and small metropolitan areas, showing areas with the lowest and highest poverty rates. The poverty rates for metropolitan areas in 2013 are shown in Table 5 and Appendix B. Poverty estimates for congressional districts in 2012 are in Appendix C. Census tracts are delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau and poverty areas are defined as tracts with a poverty rate of 20% or more. Figure 7 groups census tracts based on their level of poverty. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2009-2013, poverty areas are categorized based on poverty rates in census tracts. These areas include \"concentrated\" poverty (30% to 39.9%) and \"extreme\" poverty (40% or more). The data is collected over five years to ensure statistical reliability and respondent confidentiality. Over the five-year period 2009-2013, more than half of all poor individuals (55.0%) lived in poverty areas with rates of 20% or higher. Among the poor, 30.7% lived in areas with poverty rates of 30% or more, and 14.5% lived in extreme poverty areas with rates of 40% or more. African Americans, American Indian and Alaska Natives, and Hispanics were more likely to live in poverty areas compared to Asians or white non-Hispanics. Among poor blacks, 48.0% lived in neighborhoods with poverty rates of 30% or more, and 25.2% lived in extreme poverty areas with rates of 40% or more. Among poor Hispanics, 39.6% lived in areas with poverty rates of 30% or more, and 17.5% lived in extreme poverty areas. Among poor white non-Hispanics, 53.2% lived outside poverty areas. The Census Bureau released its fourth annual report on poverty using a new Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) on October 16, 2014. The SPM is meant to supplement the official poverty measure, which many experts consider to be flawed and outmoded. In 1990, Congress commissioned a study on how poverty is measured in the United States, leading to the National Academy of Sciences convening an expert panel to study the issue. The National Academy of Sciences convened an expert panel to study poverty measurement in 1990. In 2009, the Office of Management and Budget formed a group to develop a new Supplemental Poverty Measure based on the panel's recommendations. The Census Bureau announced in 2010 the development of a dynamic Supplemental Poverty Measure to better understand poverty and anti-poverty policies. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) aims to address weaknesses of the official poverty measure by considering additional factors like government programs and policies that impact disposable income. This includes payroll taxes, tax benefits like EITC and Child Tax Credit, in-kind benefits such as SNAP, free school lunches, and housing subsidies. The SPM is designed to improve over time with new data and methodologies. The \"official\" poverty measure, established in the 1960s, has remained largely unchanged, failing to account for modern expenses like child care, transportation, and medical costs. This outdated measure does not reflect the current living standards and challenges faced by individuals and families today. The \"official\" poverty measure, established in the 1960s, does not consider modern expenses like child care, transportation, and medical costs. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) addresses these shortcomings by incorporating a more comprehensive income/resource definition. It takes into account changing family situations, differences in prices across geographic areas, and provides a more accurate reflection of families' abilities to meet basic needs. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) expands the income/resource definition beyond the \"official\" poverty measure to include in-kind benefits and refundable tax credits. It also broadens the traditional family definition to include cohabiting partners and their family relatives. The SPM subtracts necessary expenses from resources to determine disposable income that can be applied to a standard of need, with thresholds set based on what reference families spend on basic necessities. The poverty thresholds for families with two children are adjusted for housing costs by geographic area. The U.S. poverty measure compares pre-tax income to these thresholds, which were originally based on food expenditure research. The poverty thresholds, established in 1963, are adjusted annually for price inflation based on the NAS panel recommendation. They are derived from the cost of food plans multiplied by a factor of three, with one-third addressing food needs and two-thirds addressing other expenses. The thresholds are based on what \"reference\" families spend on food, clothing, shelter, and utilities, and are adjusted for housing costs by geographic area for families with two children. The SPM thresholds for price changes are based on reference consumer units' actual spending on FCSU over time. Three sets of thresholds are established for homeowners with a mortgage, homeowners without a mortgage, and renters. Poverty thresholds are adjusted by a factor of 1.2 to account for other needs, and adjusted based on reference unit size and geographic price differences. The poverty thresholds under the Research SPM are adjusted based on geographic housing cost differences and reference consumer units' spending. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold for a family of two adults and two children varied for homeowners with a mortgage, homeowners without a mortgage, and renters, showing differences compared to the official poverty measure. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) calculates families' and individuals' income against varying poverty thresholds. It includes federal benefits like SNAP, school lunches, housing assistance, and tax credits to provide a more comprehensive measure of disposable income. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) factors in necessary expenses like child support, taxes, work-related costs, child care, and medical expenses to determine disposable income available for meeting basic needs. This comprehensive approach includes federal benefits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) to assess resources and expenses. In 2013, the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) showed a higher poverty rate of 15.5% compared to the adjusted official measure of 14.6%. Approximately 48.671 million people were considered poor under the SPM, 2.9 million more than the official measure. The report focuses on differences in poverty rates among various groups, particularly in age groups. The poverty rate varies among different age groups under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) compared to the \"official\" measure in 2013. Adults aged 18 to 64 have a higher poverty rate under the SPM (15.4% vs. 13.6%), while children have a lower rate (16.4% vs. 20.4%). However, the poverty rate for persons aged 65 and over is much higher under the SPM (14.6% vs. 9.5%). Despite the lower child poverty rate under the SPM, it still exceeds the aged poverty rate. The SPM provides a different perspective on poverty among the aged compared to the \"official\" measure. The difference in aged poverty rates between the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) and the \"official\" measure is due to the impact of medical expenses on disposable income. The SPM considers a broader economic unit for poverty measurement, including unrelated individuals as separate units. The \"official\" measure groups co-residing household members together for poverty determination. The \"adjusted official\" poverty measure includes these factors. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) expands the economic unit used for poverty determination beyond the \"official\" measure by including unrelated co-residing household members as part of the economic unit. This includes combining cohabiting partners, unmarried co-residing parents, and their co-resident family members into an economic unit under the SPM. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) includes unrelated children under age 15 and foster children under 22 in the economic unit, along with children over 18 living with a parent. In 2013, 8.9% of the population were classified under the SPM measure. In 2013, the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) included additional household members in the economic unit, reducing poverty rates compared to the \"official\" measure. Poverty rates were higher for married-couple and male-householder units under the SPM. Poverty rates under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) are higher than the \"official\" measure for married-couple units (9.5% versus 6.7%) and male-householder units (23.1% versus 18.7%). However, poverty rates for persons in female-householder units did not differ significantly between the two measures. Poverty among members of \"new SPM units\" decreased by about two-fifths, from 31.4% to 17.9%. Poverty rates in the West and Northeast were higher under the SPM compared to the \"official\" measure, while rates in the Midwest were lower. Poverty rates vary by region under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). The Midwest has lower rates compared to the \"official\" measure, while the South's rates are similar. Geographic price adjustments for housing costs impact poverty thresholds, with higher housing costs in the West and Northeast leading to higher poverty rates under the SPM. Metropolitan areas have higher poverty rates under the SPM compared to the \"official\" measure. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) shows that poverty rates vary by region, with higher rates in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) compared to non-MSAs. Within MSAs, poverty rates are higher in principal cities than in suburban areas. Geographic price adjustments for housing costs impact poverty thresholds, with higher housing costs in the West and Northeast leading to higher poverty rates under the SPM. Thirteen states have SPM poverty rates that statistically differ from their \"official\" poverty rates. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) reveals that poverty rates vary by region, with higher rates in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) compared to non-MSAs. Thirteen states, including Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia, along with the District of Columbia, had higher poverty rates under the SPM than the \"official\" measure. Among these states, only Illinois and Nevada were inland. The SPM poverty rate was not statistically different than the \"official\" poverty rate in 11 states. Among the remaining states, nearly all had lower SPM poverty rates than their \"official\" rates, with most being in the South or inland. The poverty rates vary by state under the official poverty measure and the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) based on three years of data. The two figures differ in how states are sorted, with no precise rankings possible due to the margin of error. Solid-filled markers and lines indicate statistically significant differences between a state's official poverty rate and its SPM poverty rate. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) shows differences in poverty rates among states compared to the official measure. Geographic adjustments for housing costs can result in higher poverty rates in areas with higher-priced housing. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) reveals variations in poverty rates among states compared to the official measure. Factors such as housing tenure, taxes, and population composition contribute to differences in poverty rates within and between geographic areas. California experienced the largest increase in poverty rate under the SPM, rising from 16.0% to 23.4%, highlighting the impact of demographic factors on poverty estimation. California's poverty rate is the highest in the nation under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), with other states like Florida, Hawaii, and New Jersey also showing significant increases in poverty rates. Some states, like New Mexico and Mississippi, have SPM poverty rates statistically tied with the U.S. rate. Kentucky and West Virginia have \"official\" poverty rates well above the national average. California, Florida, Hawaii, and New Jersey have high poverty rates under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), with Kentucky and West Virginia also above the national average. The SPM shows the marginal effects of income/resources on poverty rates, with the EITC having the greatest poverty reducing effect. The EITC has the greatest poverty reducing effect among various resource elements, lowering the SPM poverty rate by 2.9 percentage points. Other elements like SNAP benefits, housing subsidies, school lunch, WIC, and LIHEAP also contribute to poverty reduction. On the expenditure side, child support has a minimal impact, while federal income taxes and FICA payroll taxes increase poverty rates. Medical out of pocket expenses (MOOP) contribute the most to increasing poverty, especially among children and working-age adults. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has the greatest impact on reducing poverty, particularly for children. Housing subsidies have a similar effect on reducing poverty for both children and the aged. FICA payroll taxes and work expenses have a greater impact on increasing poverty for children and non-aged adults. Under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), medical out of pocket expenses (MOOP) significantly increase poverty rates among the aged, leading to a 6.3 percentage point rise in their poverty rate. The distribution of resources and expenses under the SPM by age group explains why child poverty is lower and aged poverty is higher compared to the \"official\" measure. Figure 17 illustrates the population distribution by age group based on income falling below or above poverty lines under both measures. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) shows that child poverty rates are lower compared to the \"official\" measure, with a higher percentage of children living in families with income between one and two times the poverty line. Over half of children live in families with income below twice the poverty line under the SPM. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) indicates that child poverty rates are lower than the \"official\" measure, with a higher percentage of children living in families just above the poverty line. Among individuals aged 65 and over, a greater share are poor under the SPM compared to the \"official\" measure, with more in \"deep poverty\" as well. The SPM offers potential for better understanding of the economically and socially vulnerable population. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) highlights the economic vulnerability of the elderly, especially due to rising medical expenses. It shows that more elderly individuals are considered poor under the SPM compared to the \"official\" measure, emphasizing the impact of medical costs on their poverty status. The SPM emphasizes the economic risk posed to the elderly by rising medical costs, impacting their ability to meet basic needs. It highlights the importance of affordable insurance in reducing poverty among the aged. The SPM does not consider financial assets or non-liquid assets in determining poverty status, potentially overlooking resources that could help meet medical needs. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) shows that child poverty rates are higher than those of the elderly, but work-based supports like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) help reduce child poverty by offsetting work-related expenses. Lack of affordable child care can limit parents' ability to work, contributing to poverty. The SPM recognizes child care as a necessary expense for working families. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers child care as a crucial expense for working families, impacting their decisions related to work. It is sensitive to measuring the effects of child care programs and policies on affordability and poverty, capturing the policy effects of in-kind benefits like SNAP. The SPM also expands the economic unit to include cohabiting partners, contributing to lower child poverty rates compared to the \"official\" measure based on traditional family ties. The \"official\" poverty measure is based on family ties defined by blood, marriage, and adoption."
