    "content": "Requiring parental involvement in education has been a goal of Title I, Part A, Education for the Disadvantaged under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Changes in parental involvement activities have occurred over time, from advisory council meetings to volunteering and school-parent compacts. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 continued to emphasize parents as partners in education, with added notification requirements and options for parents of children in underperforming schools. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 has provisions for parental involvement in education, with Title I-A emphasizing parental roles in schools. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 added requirements for parental notification and options for underperforming schools. Additional parental involvement requirements are found in various sections of the Act, including Title I-B, Title III, Title IV, Title V, and Title IX. Recent state monitoring reports and evaluations by the U.S. Department of Education have highlighted these requirements. Recent monitoring reports and evaluations by the U.S. Department of Education have identified the need for improvement in parental involvement requirements at state educational agencies, local educational agencies, and schools. Alternative approaches to increasing parental involvement, such as expanding public charter schools and community schools, are suggested. The report explores various modes of parental involvement in education, activities promoted through the ESEA, progress in implementation, research on the importance of parental involvement, and potential strategies for enhancing parental involvement. The report discusses approaches for enhancing parental involvement in education, highlighting the lack of in-depth information on implementation and effectiveness of parental activities. While these activities are generally beneficial, there may be variations in how they are implemented. The report discusses the importance of parental involvement in education, focusing on the historical goals of Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This includes encouraging parents to be more involved in their child's education, with recent emphasis on parental accountability and school choice under NCLB. The report emphasizes parental involvement in education, highlighting the accountability requirements and options for parents under NCLB. Parental involvement is defined as two-way communication and active participation in their child's education, including decision-making and advisory roles. The statutory definition of parental involvement varies, with different interpretations. Joyce Epstein's framework outlines six types of parental involvement, including parenting, communicating, volunteering, learning at home, and decision making. These aspects are addressed in Section 1118 of ESEA. The framework outlined by Joyce Epstein includes six types of parental involvement: parenting, communicating, volunteering, learning at home, decision making, and collaborating with the community. Researchers have focused on various parental involvement activities, but there is no single definition, making it challenging to study the effects on student outcomes. In a 2006-2007 ED survey, 92% of parents of children in grades K\u201312 reported school communication about their child's performance, 83% about homework help, and 86% about parents' role in school. Additionally, 89% attended a school meeting, 78% a parent-teacher conference, 74% a school event, and 46% served on a school committee. The survey found that 70% of parents of students in grades 6-12 expected their child to attain a four- or five-year college degree. Communication between school and parents was consistent across demographics, but parental participation in school activities varied based on education level and income. Parents with higher education levels were more likely to attend parent-teacher conferences and volunteer at school. Parents' participation in school activities varied based on education level and income. Higher-educated parents were more likely to volunteer or serve on a school committee, attend parent-teacher conferences, and have higher educational expectations for their children. Older students' parents were less involved in school activities compared to parents of younger students. The 2006-2007 ED survey found that parents with higher education levels had higher expectations for their children to attain a four- or five-year college degree. Asian parents had the highest expectations at 90%, followed by white parents at 73%, Hispanic parents at 67%, and black parents at 63%. Parental involvement activities varied across settings, with the survey data showing a wide range of activities but not providing detailed information on their nature and intensity. The survey findings supported existing research showing a positive correlation between parents' education level, income, and English proficiency. Parents' education level, income, and ability to speak English are positively correlated with parental involvement. Low-income parents may face barriers like inflexible work schedules, while those with little formal education may feel intimidated by the school environment. Timely and clear information in a language they understand is crucial for parents to be involved in their child's education. Research shows parents are more likely to be involved when their child is younger. Parents' education level, income, and ability to speak English are positively correlated with parental involvement. Low-income parents may face barriers like inflexible work schedules, while those with little formal education may feel intimidated by the school environment. Schools and LEAs are aware of the challenges to increasing parental involvement, with a need for technical assistance reported by principals and teachers. During the 2006-2007 school year, insufficient parent involvement was a challenge for improving student performance. Researchers struggle to study the effects of parental involvement on achievement due to various factors like parents' education and income levels. Parents with higher education and income tend to be more involved in their children's schooling, leading to better academic outcomes. Parental involvement in a child's education is positively correlated with student achievement, leading to better grades, high school graduation, and college attendance. Various forms of parental involvement have been shown to increase academic achievement, especially for racial minority students, boys, and girls. However, different activities under parental involvement have varying effects on student achievement, and the most effective methods for parents are not clear. Some research suggests that parental aspirations and involvement in home-based learning are strongly linked to student achievement, regardless of parents' socioeconomic status. The impact of school-sponsored parental involvement programs on student achievement is less certain compared to self-initiated parental activities. Parental involvement in school-sponsored programs may indirectly improve student achievement by encouraging self-initiated activities. Effective programs must be comprehensive, reaching out to all families and involving them in various roles. Home supervision like monitoring homework shows weak or negative correlation with achievement. Research on parental involvement in decision-making is inconclusive. Title I-A of the ESEA has aimed to involve parents in education decisions since 1965. Title I-A of the ESEA, enacted in 1965, has been reauthorized multiple times with changes to parental involvement provisions. In 1968, Parent Advisory Councils (PACs) were recommended for involvement in Title I-A programs. By 1974, Title I-A schools were required to have their own PACs with a majority of members being parents of participating children. The 1978 National Institute of Education study found confusion about the role of Parent Advisory Councils (PACs) in Title I-A programs, with varying levels of involvement and training. The 1981 reauthorization of the ESEA no longer required LEAs and schools to have PACs, reducing parental involvement in the program. An ED study post-1981 reauthorization showed varying levels of parental involvement in 20 LEAs across 11 states. After the 1981 reauthorization of the ESEA, Parent Advisory Councils (PACs) were present in 20 LEAs across 11 states, serving as a communication tool for LEAs rather than for parental advice on Chapter 1 implementation. The Hawkins-Stafford Amendments of 1988 reintroduced mandatory parental involvement in Chapter 1 programs, but PACs were not required. Despite this, a study found no significant change in the presence of PACs in LEAs before and after the amendments. The Hawkins-Stafford Amendments of 1988 emphasized parental involvement in the Chapter 1 program, including training parents to support their children at home and involving them in advising schools. An ED study showed that most LEAs incorporated these objectives into their goals, with a focus on communicating children's progress and training parents. Only a small percentage of LEAs prioritized having parents serve in an advisory role. The study compared parental involvement before and after the amendments, showing changes in strategies implemented by LEAs. During the 1987-1988 and 1990-1991 school years, there was an increase in the percentage of LEAs offering parental involvement activities. Activities included disseminating home-based education, using parents as volunteers, parent liaisons, and offering activities for parents with literacy or language barriers. Larger LEAs offered more activities than smaller ones. Site visits to 54 schools in 27 LEAs showed various factors influencing parental involvement. The Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 reauthorized the ESEA and emphasized the importance of parental involvement in education. It mandated that Title I-A LEAs and schools have parental involvement policies and develop school-parent compacts. Section 1116(a) required all LEAs receiving grants under Title I-A to have a written policy on parental involvement, prepared jointly with parents. Key factors for effective parental involvement programs included leadership at the SEA and LEA level, dedication of staff, positive attitudes towards parents, and recognition of parents' needs. The Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 emphasized parental involvement in education by requiring LEAs and schools to have parental involvement policies and develop school-parent compacts. LEAs had to involve parents in developing the overall LEA plan for Title I-A and in school identification and improvement procedures. Additionally, LEAs had to coordinate parental involvement activities and allocate at least 1% of Title I-A funds for parental involvement if they received over $500,000 in funds. Title I-A schools were required to have a parental involvement policy developed with parents, covering information about programs, school performance, curriculum, and assessments. The school-parent compacts under the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 described the school's responsibility to provide quality curriculum and instruction, parents' role in supporting their children's learning, and the importance of ongoing communication between teachers and parents. Parents were expected to sign the compact, which included parent-teacher conferences, progress reports, and access to staff. In 1998, 75% of principals in Title I-A schools reported using school-parent compacts, with positive outcomes noted, especially in high-poverty schools. Principals found compacts helpful for homework completion, school climate, student attendance, discipline, teacher-parent relations, and reading at home. However, a study in 1997 found that only about one-third of parents in Title I-A schools had signed parent compacts. In Title I-A schools, children reported signing parent compacts to enhance parental involvement. Schools and LEAs were required to build capacity for parental involvement through various activities, including helping parents understand academic standards, providing materials and training, educating teachers on the value of parental involvement, and offering literacy training. NCLB emphasized parental involvement policies, school-parent compacts, parental notification requirements, and options for parents of children in schools that did not meet state standards. These options included Title I-A public school choice for transferring children from underperforming schools. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) includes various parental involvement requirements, such as transferring a child from a school that has not met Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) to one that has, and offering Supplemental Educational Services like free tutoring. These requirements are mainly outlined in Title I-A, Section 1118, with additional provisions in other sections and titles of the Act. The NCLB requires LEAs to have parental involvement policies similar to those under the IASA, including school-level policies and compacts. Schools must provide information in a language parents can understand and involve parents in teacher training and school meetings. LEAs may amend existing policies to include Title I-A requirements. The NCLB requires LEAs receiving over $500,000 in Title I-A funds to reserve 1% for parental involvement, with 95% of that going to schools for activities like workshops, training, conferences, and parent liaisons. The NCLB requires LEAs to reserve 1% of Title I-A funds for parental involvement activities such as administering surveys, informing parents about their children's performance, providing training on parenting skills, and supplying information about meeting basic needs. These activities should be accessible to parents with disabilities, limited English proficiency, or who are migratory. LEAs and schools must inform parents about Parental Information and Resource Centers (PIRCs) and review parental involvement policies to ensure compliance with Section 1118 requirements. Schools participating in Title I-A must hold annual meetings to explain Title I-A requirements to parents. Participating schools must involve parents in planning, improvement, and review of Title I-A programs, provide information on curricula and assessments, and inform parents of school status if identified for improvement. The school must inform parents about its performance compared to other schools, actions taken in response to identification, parents' right to transfer their child, and students' right to SES if in year two of improvement. SEAs must also inform parents when the LEA serving their child has been identified for improvement, reasons for the identification, and how parents can be involved in improving instructional programs. Additionally, parents of pupils attending schools in an LEA identified for corrective action must be notified after two years of failing to meet AYP. The notification must occur after two additional years of an LEA failing to meet AYP after being identified for improvement. A school identified for improvement must develop a two-year school improvement plan in consultation with parents, including strategies for effective parental involvement. States monitor and evaluate Title I-A programs, providing leadership and guidance to LEAs and schools. ED ensures states fulfill this duty through ongoing reviews. The ED ensures states fulfill their duty of monitoring and evaluating Title I-A programs through document reviews and site visits. The National Assessment of Title I includes longitudinal studies and surveys conducted with SEA, LEA, principals, teachers, parents, and stakeholders. The state monitoring protocol and national evaluation survey instruments assess parental involvement and notification provisions. Findings show a need for improvement in implementation, with a decrease in SEAs meeting requirements over the years. During the second full cycle of monitoring, there was a decrease in the percentage of SEAs meeting parental involvement requirements. Only two SEAs met the requirements in 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, with problems identified in parent notification materials and parental involvement policies. In 2007-2008, several SEAs failed to ensure parental involvement in various aspects such as informing parents of their rights, including all elements in school-parent compacts, holding annual Title I-A meetings, and consulting parents on spending Title I-A funds. Additionally, a survey showed that 28% of principals focused on increasing parental involvement in school improvement strategies during the 2006-2007 school year. During the 2005-2006 school year, Title I-A principals focused on promoting parental involvement by arranging convenient school meetings, sending information in a parent-friendly language, providing materials and training for parents, and educating staff on the value of parental involvement. They did not prioritize providing childcare or transportation to meetings or employing parent liaisons. Around 80% of parents participated in parent-teacher conferences or open house events. During the 2005-2006 school year, Title I-A principals focused on promoting parental involvement through convenient school meetings and parent-friendly communication. Around 80% of parents participated in parent-teacher conferences or open house events. In addition, a majority of parents felt schools did well in keeping them informed about their child's progress. During the 2005-2006 school year, Title I-A principals emphasized parental involvement through convenient meetings and communication. Around 80% of parents participated in conferences or open house events. Schools were perceived to do well in keeping parents informed about their child's progress. In the 2006-2007 school year, 70% of parents reported that their child's school provided workshops, materials, or advice on helping children learn at home, information on homework help, and opportunities to volunteer. However, fewer parents received information on community services. Despite efforts to notify parents of school improvement status, a sample of parents in urban LEAs showed low awareness of their child's school identification. During the 2006-2007 school year, LEAs used various communication strategies to inform parents about Title I-A public school choice and Supplemental Educational Services (SES). 99% and 91% of LEAs notified parents about their options through written communication. Some LEAs used different languages, individual meetings, and community partners to reach parents. Despite these efforts, many parents were unaware of the public school choice option. 95% of Title I-A LEAs offering public school choice notified parents, but awareness remained low. During the 2006-2007 school year, communication efforts were made to inform parents about Title I-A public school choice and Supplemental Educational Services (SES). While 95% of Title I-A LEAs notified parents, only 20% were informed about the transfer option, and 59% about free tutoring. Low participation rates in these programs were attributed to poor communication, lack of options for secondary students, and late notification to parents. Many parents did not participate in public school choice or SES services, citing satisfaction with teaching quality and school location. Some parents felt their child did not need help, indicating a lack of involvement in their child's education as consumers. Additionally, a study on school improvement plans in the Northwest Region found issues with the majority of plans. The study on school improvement plans in the Northwest Region revealed that many plans failed to meet parental involvement requirements. Despite focusing on communication activities, plans often neglected to include strategies for engaging parents of English language learner students. Important parental involvement provisions are outlined in various sections of the ESEA Title I-A, such as collecting and disseminating information on effective practices and reporting assessment results to parents and the public. States and LEAs are required to publish report cards for schools, including information on academic performance by race, ethnicity, gender, disability, English proficiency, and economic status. The report cards must also cover pupil progress, graduation rates, schools failing to meet standards, teacher qualifications, and may include additional details like parental involvement and class size. The report cards for schools must include information on academic performance by various demographics, pupil progress, graduation rates, schools not meeting standards, and teacher qualifications. Parents have the right to request information on the professional qualifications of their child's teachers and paraprofessionals. Parents have the right to request information on the professional qualifications of their child's teachers and paraprofessionals. Participating schools must provide parents with information on their child's performance on state assessments and notify them if their child is taught by a teacher who is not \"highly qualified.\" Schools using Title I-A funds for language instruction programs for limited English proficient pupils must notify parents within 30 days of the school year, including the basis for identifying their child as LEP and the instructional methods used. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for language instruction programs for LEP pupils, including exit requirements, meeting individualized education program objectives, parental rights, and notification obligations for schools using Title I-A funds. It also outlines parental participation requirements and notification obligations for schools failing to meet achievement objectives. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for language instruction programs for LEP pupils funded under Title I-A, with a specific emphasis on helping pupils attain proficiency in English. Other ESEA programs also require parental involvement or permit funds to be spent on parental involvement activities, such as the Reading First program. The curr_chunk discusses the use of funds for family literacy programs and parental involvement efforts in Title I-A schools, including coordination with other programs like Head Start or Reading First. Results from a national implementation study of Reading First show that teachers were not more likely to involve parents in reading instruction compared to non-Reading First teachers. Almost two-thirds of first grade RF and non-RF Title I-A teachers provided special materials for parents of struggling readers, with RF teachers more likely to have received professional development on working with parents. Reading coaches reported that teachers made efforts to involve parents in reading instruction. The William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs support integrating early childhood education, adult literacy, and parenting education into a unified family literacy program. The William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs aim to assist parents in becoming full partners in their children's education and help children reach their full potential as learners. The program targets economically disadvantaged parents, with a high percentage having not completed high school or a GED. The main reasons for participation include furthering education, becoming better parents, and improving teaching skills. However, an evaluation in 2003 showed that participants did not perform better on literacy assessments. The evaluation of Even Start programs in 2003 showed that participants did not perform better on literacy assessments compared to a control group. However, parents who engaged more in parenting education had children with higher literacy scores, while those who focused more on adult education had children with lower scores. This suggests that parents prioritizing their own education may impact their child's literacy outcomes. A recent study on a literacy-focused curriculum in Even Start programs found positive effects on parent interactive reading skills and responsiveness to their child. The combined curriculum in Even Start programs did not significantly impact child language development and early literacy outcomes. Parental notification requirements under Language Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students (Section 3302) include informing parents of LEP pupils about reasons for needing language instruction and their rights to decline enrollment or withdraw from the program. Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities (Title IV, Part A) requires consultation with schools and LEAs receiving grants under this program. Title IV, Part A requires schools and LEAs to consult with parents in developing, operating, and evaluating programs. Title IV, Part B funds can be used for before- and after-school activities to promote student achievement, including parental involvement. Parents of children in 21st Century Community Learning Centers were more likely to help with homework and attend after-school events. The Parental Information and Resource Center (PIRC) grant program provides training and support to parents, teachers, and principals. Parental consent is required for armed forces recruiter access to student information under the ESEA. The ESEA allows schools to provide student contact information to military recruiters, with the option for parents to opt out. Schools have varied interpretations on how to notify parents about this option, leading to different outcomes based on parental response. In the NLS-NCLB, 78% of teachers in schools identified for improvement reported insufficient parent involvement as a challenge in improving student performance. Teachers believe parents should be more involved with homework and school activities, suggesting improved communication methods and professional development for parents. The NLS-NCLB suggests increasing parental involvement by providing information in appropriate languages, offering professional development for teachers and principals, and conducting workshops tailored to parents' specific needs. Technical assistance could be provided to refine strategies and guide school leaders on effective implementation techniques. Some principals have worked with community partners and parent liaisons to promote parental involvement, especially among low-income or non-English speaking parents. Parent liaisons, who are often members of the community, reach out to low-income or non-English speaking parents to increase parental involvement. While not required by the ESEA, evaluating the effectiveness of these practices and promoting full-service models like public charter schools can also enhance parental engagement. Public charter schools offer operators increased autonomy and flexibility in regulations in exchange for accountability. An evaluation found that charter schools have higher levels of parental involvement compared to traditional public schools, with more parents volunteering and participating in school activities. Public charter schools have higher levels of parental involvement compared to traditional public schools, with more parents participating in workshops, instructional issues, governance, and budget decisions. Charter schools may attract highly involved parents, but there are no statistical differences in parent participation in conferences and open houses between charter and traditional public schools. As charter schools become more popular, evaluating their effectiveness in increasing parental involvement is important. At the time of this report, there was no action in the 111th Congress regarding community schools. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to amend Title IV of the ESEA to include grant programs for full-service community schools. These bills proposed two grant programs: one for consortiums of LEAs and nonprofit organizations to provide services to multiple schools, and another for state collaboratives to develop full-service community schools. Funding of $200,000,000 for FY2008 and subsequent years was proposed, with 75% allocated to local grants and 20% to state grants. The FY2008 appropriation for the grant program was $4,912,650, with 10 five-year grants awarded for full-service community school programs. The Coalition for Community Schools envisions community schools as places that form partnerships with other community resources, focusing on academics, services, and opportunities to improve student learning and strengthen families and communities. Schools are open to everyone, serving as centers of the community all day, every day. Community schools serve as hubs that foster relationships among educators, families, volunteers, and community partners. These schools collaborate with various agencies and organizations to transform traditional schools into lasting partnerships for excellence. By providing services to parents and family members, community schools aim to increase parental involvement in their child's education. Studies have shown that parents are more engaged and feel more welcome in community schools compared to other schools. The Obama Administration proposed creating the Promise Neighborhoods program modeled after the Harlem Children's Zone (HCZ) to improve college-going rates by combining a rigorous K-12 education in charter schools with supportive services in an entire neighborhood. HCZ combines community schools' supportive services with charter schools' educational benefits, aiming to serve children from grades K-12. The Promise Neighborhoods program offers various programs and services for children, parents, and community members during evenings, weekends, and summer."
