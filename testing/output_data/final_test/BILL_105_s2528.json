    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Since 1988, three cost-sharing payment programs have been established to assist low-income elderly and disabled individuals with Medicare costs. Despite efforts to expand eligibility and improve program administration, gaps in beneficiary knowledge and deficiencies in program administration persist, hindering enrollment of eligible beneficiaries. The financial challenges faced by Social Security and Medicare further compound these issues. The financial challenges faced by Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries, especially widowed spouses, are a significant concern. Statistics show that a large percentage of nonmarried women rely heavily on Social Security benefits for their income. Current reform proposals focus on initial enrollment, but the financial vulnerability of widowed spouses can occur at any time after retirement benefits begin. The text chunk \"SEC. 2. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\" is a condensed version of the previous information about the financial challenges faced by Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries, particularly widowed spouses. The Commissioner will establish a demonstration project for outreach to identify Medicare beneficiaries eligible for Medicaid assistance with cost-sharing. Individuals will be notified of this assistance and must provide accurate information to qualify. The Commissioner will establish a demonstration project to identify individuals eligible for Medicaid assistance with cost-sharing. Information will be provided to States regarding eligible individuals for medical assistance under the Medicaid program. The Commissioner will conduct a demonstration project to identify individuals eligible for Medicaid assistance with cost-sharing. Information on income and assets of potential beneficiaries will be shared with states. The project will run for one year starting on October 1, 1998, and a report will be issued within 6 months after its completion. The Commissioner will conduct a demonstration project to identify individuals eligible for Medicaid assistance with cost-sharing. A report on outreach efforts and results will be submitted to Congress, including any recommendations for further actions. Definitions for key terms such as \"Commissioner,\" \"Medicaid program,\" and \"Medicare program\" are provided in the Act. The Social Security Act authorizes up to $5,000,000 for a demonstration project in fiscal year 1999."
