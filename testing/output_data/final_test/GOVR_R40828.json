    "content": "The shift in retirement plans for American workers over the past 25 years has been from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) pension plans. In DB plans, employees receive guaranteed monthly retirement incomes based on a formula, while in DC plans, employees have individual accounts that accumulate contributions and investment returns for retirement income. DC plans, like the 401(k) plan, give participants more autonomy and responsibility for decisions such as participation, contribution amounts, and investment allocations. This CRS report provides background on borrowing from DC plans, examining the incidence of loans, analyzing household characteristics with outstanding loans in 2001, 2004, and 2007, and discussing public policy implications. Households with loans were less wealthy but had more retirement wealth than those without loans. Loans were not taken due to attractiveness or low-cost credit. Workers may borrow from their DC plans for credit or financial hardship. DC plans allow access to assets through withdrawals or loans, subject to Treasury regulations. Withdrawing or borrowing from DC plans can lead to lower retirement savings due to lost investment returns. Conventional advice discourages this practice. DC plans allow participants to make withdrawals for hardship reasons, defined as immediate and heavy financial needs. Withdrawn amounts are included in gross income and subject to a 10% tax penalty for those under 59\u00bd. This penalty aims to deter the misuse of retirement funds for non-retirement purposes. Hardship withdrawals from DC plans result in a six-month suspension of contributions, including employer matches. Borrowers can continue contributing while repaying loans, which have lower interest rates than other options. Interest payments go back into the borrowers' accounts, reducing the overall cost of the loan. Upon default or separation from employment, outstanding loans from qualified retirement plans are treated as distributions subject to income tax and a 10% penalty unless certain conditions are met. The loan amount cannot exceed $50,000. The loans from qualified retirement plans must meet specific conditions, including a maximum amount of $50,000 or one-half of the account balance, a repayment period of five years (except for home acquisitions), equal payments, and reasonable interest rates. Failure to comply results in the loan being treated as a distribution. Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances compares households with and without DC plan loans. The 2007 SCF provides detailed information on U.S. household finances, focusing on assets, debt, and demographic data. The report considers households where the head is under 60 years old. Data is adjusted using survey weights to represent the U.S. population. Table 1 shows DC plan coverage, withdrawal ability, borrowing, and households with outstanding loans. Over half of American households had someone covered by a pension plan at work. Among households with pension plans, 82.6% participated in DC plans, with 85.0% having access to their accounts for withdrawals or borrowing. More households could make withdrawals (80.1%) than borrow (69.8%), with 14.6% having outstanding loans. Of those with loans, 90.3% continued making contributions while repaying. Vanguard's study found less than 2% took hardship withdrawals in 2008. Median DC loan balance was $4,800, with an average of $6,734, representing 11.1% of individual account balances. The median DC loan balance increased from $3,509 in 2001 to $4,800 in 2007. Most loan balances were modest, with a few households having large balances outstanding. The loans were taken for liquidity purposes rather than as a source of low-cost credit. In 2007, the largest category of loans from DC plans was for unanticipated personal expenses, accounting for 45.9% of outstanding loans. Other reasons for borrowing included home repairs or improvements (14.4%), medical or education expenses (11.0%), and automobile purchases (4.3%). Expenses could be planned or unplanned within each category. Households with outstanding DC plan loans were in worse financial shape compared to those without loans. They had lower net worth, financial assets, and higher debt relative to their assets. Median net worth was 52% lower for households with loans ($115,100) compared to those without loans. Households with outstanding loans had lower median financial assets and income compared to those without loans. Their debt-to-financial assets ratio was higher, indicating a worse financial condition. Households with outstanding loans had similar median DC account balances ($41,000 versus $40,100) compared to those without loans, but the median total retirement assets were 33% higher for households without outstanding DC plan loans ($60,000 versus $45,000). The median ratio of DC-to-financial assets was higher for households with outstanding loans (0.89 compared to 0.51). Loan use varied among different age groups, with lower rates for younger households and higher rates for those aged 40 to 49 years old. Households headed by individuals aged 40 to 49 had higher loan rates at 17.5%. Younger households with smaller DC and retirement account balances were more likely to have loans. Education level also played a role, with fewer loans among households with graduate degrees. Single households had a higher percentage of outstanding loans compared to married households. Among households, single households had a higher percentage of outstanding loans (21.8%) compared to married households (12.2%). Married households with a non-working spouse had a higher percentage of outstanding loans (14.2%) compared to households where both the head and spouse worked (11.5%). Non-white households had a higher percentage of outstanding loans (16.2%) compared to white households (13.6%). Home ownership did not significantly impact loan rates, with 14.5% of homeowners and 14.8% of non-homeowners having outstanding loans. Participation in defined benefit pensions was associated with higher loan rates (16.7% versus 13.4%). Among households with the ability to borrow from their DC plans, those with IRAs had a lower percentage of outstanding loans (7.2%) compared to those without IRAs (19.5%). This difference could be due to the wealthier status of households with IRAs, as they had a higher median net worth of $400,400 compared to $113,450 for households without IRAs. Additionally, households may have preferred to withdraw from their IRAs rather than borrow from their DC plans. Among households with the ability to borrow from their DC plans, those with IRAs had a lower percentage of outstanding loans (7.2%) compared to those without IRAs (19.5%). The percentage of households with outstanding loans decreased with longer savings horizons, indicating a reluctance to jeopardize long-term retirement savings goals. The study found that households with IRAs had a lower percentage of outstanding loans compared to those without IRAs. The percentage of households with outstanding loans decreased with longer savings horizons, indicating a reluctance to jeopardize long-term retirement savings goals. A logit analysis was used to study the relationship between borrowing decisions and various factors such as demographic factors, retirement plan use, credit use, and attitudes toward savings and credit. The logit regression results in Table 6 show that various factors impact the likelihood of having a loan. 18 out of 27 variables in the regression are significantly different from zero, indicating that households may borrow from their DC plans due to financial difficulty. Poor credit, denial of credit in the past five years, and lack of discipline in saving are factors that make households more likely to have outstanding DC plan loans. Households with longer savings horizons and those who did more credit shopping were less likely to have outstanding loans. Higher retirement savings were associated with higher probabilities of having loans, with wealthier households having larger retirement account balances. The probability of having a loan increased with higher DC account balances, indicating a correlation between wealth and loan status. The probability of having an outstanding loan increases as the DC-to-financial assets ratio rises. Younger households have a lower probability of having a loan compared to older households. The probability of having an outstanding loan increases with age, peaking for households in their forties. Debt-to-financial assets ratio also impacts the likelihood of having a loan, with more indebted households being more likely to have outstanding DC plan loans. However, very indebted households show a decrease in probability. Additionally, heads of households with higher education levels have a lower probability of having an outstanding DC plan loan. Households with college or graduate degrees have lower probabilities of having outstanding loans compared to those without higher education. This could be due to increased household wealth or higher financial education. Longer savings horizons also correlate with lower loan probabilities. Households with longer savings horizons have lower probabilities of outstanding loans. Race does not significantly impact loan characteristics, with education and retirement assets playing a stronger role. Having an IRA is associated with a 3.9% lower probability of having an outstanding loan, possibly due to preferences for IRA withdrawals over borrowing from a DC plan, disciplined saving habits, or higher wealth levels. Congress faces competing factors in assessing policy on access to assets in DC plans. Tax-advantaged retirement accounts encourage saving to supplement retirement income. Decline in DB plan coverage means households rely more on savings. Allowing access to DC plan funds can both further and hinder retirement savings goals, especially for younger households. The median plan loan amount is $4,328, well below the statutory maximum. Households with high DC account balances are less likely to take out loans. Accessing retirement funds through loans is preferred over withdrawals according to finance experts. Some DC plans allow borrowing instead of withdrawals, while others allow both or neither. 18.6% of households with DC plans that allow withdrawals could not borrow. Giving households the option to borrow could be beneficial, but it may be administratively costly for plans to implement. Plan sponsors should design features based on the needs of their workers, including the option to make withdrawals or borrow from the plan. Changing the interest rate on DC plan loans may not significantly impact borrowing behavior. Households with outstanding loans often borrow due to limited credit options, regardless of interest rates. The current law requires loans to be repaid within five years, with exceptions for principal residences. It is uncertain if altering the maximum loan term would affect borrowing behavior. Lengthening the maximum term of DC plan loans may have varying effects on households' borrowing habits. The analysis suggests that lengthening the maximum term of DC plan loans could increase the loan amount for borrowers. IRA ownership decreases the likelihood of households having outstanding DC plan loans, possibly due to withdrawals from IRAs instead of taking loans. Allowing loans from IRAs raises public policy concerns. Under current law, lending money from an IRA to the account owner or beneficiary is prohibited unless an exemption is available. IRA owners are considered fiduciaries and must act in the interest of participants. Allowing IRA owners to borrow from their accounts could impact fiduciary obligations and default rates may be higher compared to DC plan loans. In case of default on a DC plan loan, the outstanding amount is treated as income. Plans with high default rates risk losing their tax-advantaged status. Most employers offer automatic payroll deduction for loan repayments, keeping default rates low. Limited data exists on IRA withdrawals and their impact on ownership and contributions. More data is needed to understand the effects of tightening or loosening access to IRAs before retirement."
