    "content": "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs is the largest healthcare delivery system in the US, serving 5.6 million patients in FY2008 with a budget of $43.5 billion. Veterans' service organizations are urging Congress to provide VHA with a sufficient and predictable budget, citing past budget underestimations. In June 2005, the George W. Bush Administration requested $975 million and $1.977 billion in supplemental VHA appropriations from Congress. Delays in enacting the VA budget have caused operational challenges for VHA network directors, including delays in capital expenditures and recruitment. Former VHA officials have testified about difficulties faced due to funding uncertainty. The report discusses VSO's proposal for an advance appropriation for VHA to address operational difficulties due to funding uncertainty. It provides background on federal funding categories, reasons for the proposal, affected accounts, and VHA's budget estimation approach. The report discusses the definition of an advance appropriation, federal programs funded under it, and issues Congress faces in implementing it. It also presents options for Congress to consider. Understanding federal funding categories is crucial for funding VA health care programs. Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is controlled by substantive legislation under the jurisdiction of various House and Senate committees. This type of spending often has a permanent appropriation that automatically provides funds each year without the need for further legislative action. Some direct spending programs may require financing through annual appropriations acts if they do not have their own financing mechanism. Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is controlled by substantive legislation under the jurisdiction of House and Senate committees. Some programs may require financing through annual appropriations acts, but the level of direct spending is controlled in substantive legislation. The annual budget resolution sets a framework for legislation with budgetary impact, including appropriations acts and direct spending measures. Enforcement procedures differ for appropriations acts and direct spending measures, with \"Section 302(b)\" spending allocations being a key tool for appropriations acts. The Appropriations Committee allocates discretionary spending among subcommittees based on the budget resolution. Enforcement tools like Section 302(b) allocations ensure spending levels are met. Direct spending is controlled by legislation, with different enforcement procedures. The Department of Veterans Affairs has both discretionary and direct spending. In FY2008, its total spending was around $88 billion. In FY2008, the Department of Veterans Affairs had total spending of approximately $88 billion, with $43 billion in discretionary spending and $44 billion in direct spending. VSOs have been advocating for moving funding for VA health care from discretionary to mandatory appropriation for over a decade to ensure sufficient and predictable funding. The dysfunctional budget process for veterans' health care has hindered VA officials from efficiently managing and planning for the future. Uncertainty in funding levels and approval of policy proposals severely impairs VA's operations. Previous attempts to secure mandatory funding for VA health care did not gain widespread support. Some budget analysts argue against switching to mandatory appropriations for the VHA, citing concerns about potential negative impacts on the healthcare system and federal spending. Congress could still exert budgetary pressures even with mandatory funding. Hearings in the 110th Congress discussed both support and opposition to mandatory funding proposals for VA health. In response to the lack of momentum for mandatory funding proposals for VA health care, VSOs proposed advance appropriations in 2008. The Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 (H.R. 1016 and S. 423) introduced in the 111th Congress aims to fund VHA accounts as advance appropriations starting in FY2011. The legislation includes a study by the Comptroller General on budget projections based on VHA's Enrollee Health Care Projection Model. The VHA is funded through multiple appropriations accounts, including medical care, research, and administration. Congress also appropriates funds for construction of medical facilities. The Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 proposes advance appropriations for VHA starting in FY2011. In FY2004, Congress changed the VHA's appropriations structure to provide better oversight. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004 funded VHA through four accounts. In FY2009, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 renamed the medical administration account. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care of veterans and dependents, including care in non-VA facilities, outpatient care on a fee basis, medical supplies, employee salaries, and aid to state veterans homes. Funds from the medical care collection fund can be transferred to this account. The medical support and compliance account funds administration expenses for hospitals, nursing homes, and domiciliaries. The medical facilities account covers expenses for maintenance, operation, and construction of VHA facilities, including non-recurring maintenance projects, leases, and laundry services. This account also funds VA researchers investigating veteran-centric health topics. The VA researchers receive funding from various sources for research on limb loss, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury, as well as organ transplantation. The VHA's budget size historically depended on the number of operating beds controlled by Congress. Workload estimates and unit costs were used to develop the budget, with additional costs for new programs, staffing improvements, pay increases, and inflation. The VHA's budget formulation process included costs for staffing improvements, pay increases, and inflation. In 1996, Congress enacted an Act requiring VHA to develop a plan for fair allocation of health care resources for veterans. The VHA established the Enrollee Health Care Demand Model in 1998 to develop estimates of future veteran enrollment, utilization of health care services, and associated costs. This model informs VHA's budget formulation process, with projections by fiscal year, enrollment priority, age, VISN, market, and facility. Congress appropriates funds based on these projections each year. The Enrollee Health Care Demand Model (EHCPM) is used by the VHA to estimate future veteran enrollment, health care utilization, and costs. This information is crucial for developing budget requests to Congress. The EHCPM combines three subcomponents to project total health care expenditures: enrollment, utilization, and unit cost projection models. The EHCPM's three sub-models project total health care expenditures by multiplying outputs for 58 medical services for various enrollee types. Trend factors account for changes in medical costs, provider efficiency, veteran morbidity, and reliance on VA care. The model also considers enrollment levels and mix, with modeled expenditures currently around. The EPM projects veteran enrollment rates based on historic data and U.S. Census projections. Enrollment rates are determined by age, priority level, geographic sector, and participation in specific military operations. The model accounts for demographic trends but does not consider private-sector health insurance influences on veteran enrollment in VA healthcare. The UPM is based on Milliman Health Cost Guidelines (HCGs) and adjusts utilization rates for VA enrollees' health status and reliance on VA. Utilization rates are annually adjusted for national and VA-specific trends, tied to community practices. Adjusted HCG benchmarks are calibrated to actual VA workload. Adjusted HCG benchmarks are calibrated to actual VA workload to account for differences between the VA and the private sector. Services without commercial counterparts are projected from historical VA workload data. Average unit costs are derived through the UCPM by allocating VA's budget obligation to workload in each service category. The model relies on relationships between VA cost levels and Medicare-allowable charges to estimate VA unit costs. Inflation and intensity trends are then factored in. The VA unit costs are estimated by service category, with inflation and intensity trends factored in to project unit costs in any given year. There are three types of appropriations that do not follow the usual pattern, including advance appropriations, advance funding, and forward funding. Advance appropriations provide new budget authority that becomes available one or more fiscal years beyond the budget year. $30,854,000,000 will be available on October 1, 2010 for FY2011. Advance funding is budget authority provided in an appropriation act to obligate and disburse funds from a succeeding year's appropriation. Forward funding is budget authority available for obligation in the last quarter of the FY for ongoing activities in the next FY, mainly used for education programs. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) currently receives funding under an Advance Appropriation (AA) to insulate public broadcasting from financial and political pressures. AA allows CPB and grant recipients to plan budgets two years in advance, providing lead time for programming. Another program previously funded under AA was the Low Income. In 1990, Congress authorized forward funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to allow states to plan for heating/cooling seasons. Funds were appropriated for FY1993 and an additional $1.4 billion for the 9-month period from October 1993 through June 1994. LIHEAP was funded for the period July 1994 through June 1995 in FY1994. In 1998, Congress authorized an advance appropriation for LIHEAP, funding it only in FY1999 and FY2000. The program LIHEAP was initially forward funded for states' flexibility, then changed to advance appropriation in FY1999 and FY2000. Congress has not funded LIHEAP under an advance appropriation since FY2000, with no public rationale available. Congress can change funding mechanisms for programs, but an advance appropriation does not guarantee stability. Some federal programs are funded under advance appropriations, but most are formula grant programs. The majority of programs funded under an AA are formula grant programs established by Congress. It is uncertain how funding certain VHA accounts under an AA would impact the largest integrated health care delivery system in the nation. There are budget enforcement issues and potential implications if advance funding for some VHA accounts is implemented. The current congressional budget process has enforcement rules to maintain fiscal discipline, which may affect programs funded under an advanced appropriation. The congressional budget process enforces fiscal discipline by including programs funded under advanced appropriations in the yearly budget resolution. Points of order can be used to enforce budget provisions, prohibiting legislation that exceeds funding levels. For example, the House FY2010 Concurrent Resolution placed limits on advance appropriations for FY2011 and FY2012. Certain accounts funded under an AA in the Senate FY2010 Concurrent Budget Resolution could face a point of order if not listed. H.Con.Res. 85 does not exempt medical services accounts, but an amendment by Senator James Inhofe allows for advance appropriations for certain medical accounts without a point of order. The FY2010 Concurrent Resolution on the budget (H.Rept. 111-60) exempts certain medical accounts from point of order against advance appropriations. Congress may need to address the impact of funding these accounts based on estimates from the EHCPM, which is challenging due to assumptions and imperfect information. The EHCPM is used to estimate VHA's budget request to Congress, but it lacks specificity to inform scenarios about VA benefit generosity, health coverage, enrollment decisions, and health status. This could lead to budget shortfalls if there are unexpected shocks to the VA health care system or policy environment, such as veterans losing employer-provided health insurance and seeking care from the VA. The EHCPM used to estimate VHA's budget request lacks specificity for forecasting scenarios beyond VA's capacity. Concerns raised by the recent RAND study question the validity and accuracy of projecting future expenditures. GAO has expressed concerns about VHA's long-term care spending estimates, citing unrealistically low cost assumptions and high workload projections. The VA's long-term care spending estimates are questionable benchmarks for budget deliberations. Funding VHA under AA could lead to potential budget shortfalls, requiring Congress to address them through regular appropriations. Reorganization of VA's IT functions centralized control under the VA Chief Information Officer to improve management. The reorganization of VA's IT functions centralized control under the VA Chief Information Officer, bringing VHA's health IT budget under central control. VA's IT infrastructure supports health care by providing voice services, data processing, and image transmission for patient care. The migration of VistA into Health e Vet is underway. Funding IT accounts under a regular appropriation act could hinder VHA's ability to purchase necessary software or transmit patient data through VA's IT infrastructure. When VHA expands new services, there is often an IT component that requires funding from the VA's IT budget. Congress funding accounts under an AA and the IT budget under a regular appropriation can lead to issues with implementing policy changes and supporting new clinics. Advance appropriations may not account for legislative mandates, causing challenges in increasing access to veterans in rural areas. The current legislative proposal (H.R. 1016; S. 423) suggests funding certain VHA accounts under an Advance Appropriation (AA), while excluding the medical and prosthetic research account. This could create accounting complexities for VA's medical research programs, potentially affecting the timing of funding for research projects and support. The current appropriations account set-up for VA research support may create a mismatch between funding research projects and funding research support. Congress could provide oversight to modify VA's EHCPM for better predictability in VA health care financing. The EHCPM for VHA could be modified to improve predictability in funding by developing analytic tools for measuring demand and costs. Routine data collection on veterans' health and utilization could provide better estimates of funding needs. Creating an independent entity similar to MedPAC could bring transparency and credibility to VHA's funding process. MedPAC, established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, advises Congress on Medicare issues, including payments to health plans and providers. They analyze access to care and quality of care. A similar program for VHA could provide transparency and accountability in funding for veterans' healthcare."
