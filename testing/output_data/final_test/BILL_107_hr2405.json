    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Microbicide Development Act of 2001\". The Congress acknowledges the serious and costly epidemics of STDs and HIV globally. In the United States, 15,400,000 people will acquire a new STD this year. Globally, 36,100,000 people are infected with HIV, with over 15,000 new infections daily. Racial and ethnic minorities, especially African American and Latina women, are disproportionately affected by STDs, including HIV. STDs can lead to severe and costly conditions for women and their children. Women and their children face various health risks such as infertility, pregnancy complications, cervical cancer, infant mortality, and a higher risk of contracting HIV. The estimated annual costs of STDs and their complications in the United States range from $8.4 billion to nearly $20 billion. Microbicides are a promising new technology for STD and HIV prevention, offering user-controlled products that could kill or inactivate bacteria and viruses. They could fill a critical gap in STD prevention by providing an important backup or alternative to condoms and offering protection against various STDs, not just HIV. Several potential microbicides are in development, with over 20 products in clinical trials and 35 promising compounds for further investigation. Studies show broad market appeal for microbicides, with at least 21 million sexually active women in the US interested in such products. Federal support for research is crucial as there is currently a lack of economic incentives for pharmaceutical companies to engage in microbicide development. Microbicide research and development heavily rely on public-sector grants due to limited funding. Existing grants are insufficient to advance product leads, and clinical trial sites are constrained by funding. This hinders progress in addressing the STD and HIV epidemics. The current Federal investment in microbicide research and development needs to increase to $75,000,000 in fiscal year 2002, to $100,000,000 in fiscal year 2003, and sustain at $100,000,000 yearly in the following years to address the growing infection rates and backlog in innovative product concepts. The National Institutes of Health are amending the Public Health Service Act to focus on microbicides for preventing HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. The Director of the Institute will expand and coordinate research activities on microbicides to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Coordination with other institutes within the National Institutes of Health will be ensured, and a comprehensive research plan will be developed in consultation with the Office of AIDS Research. The Director of the Institute will develop a comprehensive research plan for microbicides, including current research activities and opportunities for the next five years. The Director of the Institute will develop a research plan for microbicides, including funding projections, objectives, institutes involved, capacity enhancement plans, and consultation with appropriate institutes and components. The Microbicide Development Act of 2001 requires the Director of the Institute to develop a Research Plan within six months of enactment. This plan will be submitted to the President and Congress independently of the biennial NIH report. The Microbicide Development Act of 2001 mandates the Director of the Institute to establish a program supporting research on microbicides to reduce HIV and STD transmission. This includes basic research, animal model development, formulation approaches, and targeted microbicide designs. The Microbicide Development Act of 2001 mandates the Director of the Institute to establish a program supporting research on microbicides to reduce HIV and STD transmission. This program includes research on targeted designs of microbicides, manufacture of candidate products for testing in animals and humans, conduct of HIV incidence and microbicide feasibility studies, evaluation of microbicides in clinical trials, and behavioral research on use, acceptability, and adherence to microbicides. The Director of the Institute shall establish a Microbicide Research Branch within the Vaccine and Prevention Research Program of the Division of AIDS to carry out this program. The Director of the Institute can award grants and contracts for constructing facilities for microbicide research and establish multidisciplinary research centers for this purpose. Each center must use the facilities of a single institution or a consortium of cooperating entities. The Director of the Institute can award grants and contracts for constructing facilities for microbicide research and establish multidisciplinary research centers. These centers must meet specific requirements and conduct basic research on muscosal transmission to design novel microbicide strategies for HIV and STD prevention. The Director is required to report to Congress annually on the Research Plan progress. The Director of the Institute must report annually to Congress on the progress of the Research Plan for microbicide research. The report should include an updated Research Plan, assessment of plan implementation, progress in research, expenditures, and recommendations. The Director of the Institute must consult with other federal agencies in developing the Research Plan for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. The term 'HIV' includes AIDS. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2004. TITLE II--MICROBICIDE RESEARCH AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION\n\nSEC. 201. MICROBICIDES FOR PREVENTING TRANSMISSION OF HIV AND OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a section on microbicides for preventing transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Sec. 317Q of the Public Health Service Act directs the Secretary to expand and coordinate CDC activities for researching microbicides to prevent HIV and other STDs. The Secretary may provide grants for laboratory and behavioral research to support clinical trials for safe and effective microbicides. The Secretary is directed to expand CDC activities for researching microbicides to prevent HIV and other STDs. This includes developing populations for clinical trials, conducting safety and efficacy trials, providing technical assistance, and evaluating implementation strategies for topical microbicides. The Secretary, in collaboration with other agencies, selects agents and trial designs for clinical trials on microbicides. Annual reports on activities are to be submitted to relevant committees. Annual reports on microbicide research and development progress, expenditures, and activities supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are required by the Secretary. The term 'HIV' is defined as the human immunodeficiency virus, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2002 through. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for necessary sums."
