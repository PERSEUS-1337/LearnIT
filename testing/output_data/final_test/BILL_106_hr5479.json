    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Wholesale Motor Fuel Fairness and Competition Restoration Act.\" The Congress finds that various unfair and anticompetitive practices by oil companies contribute to unjustified retail motor fuel prices charged to American consumers, including price zoning, redlining, discriminatory pricing, and hidden cost allocation. Unfair practices by oil companies include price zoning, redlining, discriminatory pricing, and hidden cost allocation, all contributing to unjustified retail motor fuel prices. Price zoning artificially increases or depresses prices based on location, redlining restricts sales to certain distributors or markets, and discriminatory pricing is based on purchaser relationship and competition level. The oil companies engage in discriminatory pricing practices, using complex cost allocations to hide factors influencing wholesale prices. This allows them to charge different prices to various types of retailers in the same community, distorting the true wholesale price. It is necessary for the Federal Government to address these unfair practices. The Federal Government should prohibit unfair oil company practices in cost, pricing, and marketing to restore fair competition in the wholesale fuel market and empower consumers to understand price changes at the pump.
