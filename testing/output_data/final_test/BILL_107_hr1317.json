The Act \"Qualified Personal Service Corporations Clarification Act of 2001\" expands the definition of qualified personal service corporation in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include former employees holding stock by reason of their past employment with any controlled entity. The common parent of an affiliated group can treat all members as one taxpayer if 80 percent or more of the group's activities involve services in specific fields. The definition of a qualified personal service corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes ownership of at least 50 percent of a partnership's capital or profits interest by the corporation. A corporation can be considered a qualified personal service corporation before its first taxable year with gross receipts. Certain stock ownership is not taken into account for this determination. The determination of whether an employee-owned corporation is a qualified personal service corporation is made without considering stock held by employees of unaffiliated controlled entities. This exclusion does not apply to specific employee categories. Employee-owned corporation refers to a corporation where at least 50% of the outstanding stock is owned by certain employees. The term 'unaffiliated controlled entity' in an employee-owned corporation refers to a corporation where at least 50% of the outstanding stock is owned by members of an affiliated group. The term 'engineering' for an employee-owned corporation includes professional services or activities of an engineering nature as defined by State. It excludes any corporation permitted to file a consolidated return with the affiliated group. The curr_chunk describes professional services of an engineering nature that must be performed or approved by a licensed individual, including research, planning, design, construction, and other related activities. The curr_chunk outlines a wide range of professional services that licensed individuals may perform, including studies, investigations, planning, design, construction, and other related activities. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
