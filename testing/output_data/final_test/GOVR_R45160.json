It administers federal campaign finance law, discloses campaign finance data, conducts compliance training, and administers public financing for presidential campaigns. Commissioners serve six-year terms, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. At least four commissioners must vote on substantive actions, including enforcement, advisory opinions, and rulemaking. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is a six-member independent regulatory agency established in 1974 after fundraising controversies and the Watergate scandal. It administers federal campaign finance law, discloses campaign finance data, conducts compliance training, and administers public financing for presidential campaigns. The FEC requires bipartisan commission membership and at least four agreeing votes for substantive actions. Vacancies make achieving quorum difficult, with only four commissioners currently in office and one nomination pending. The agency may face challenges in maintaining its policymaking powers without at least four commissioners in office. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is currently operating with four commissioners instead of six, with two vacancies. Democratic Commissioner Ann M. Ravel resigned in 2017, and Republican Commissioner Lee Goodman resigned in 2018. No nominees have been announced for their seats. Maintaining quorum for policymaking and nominations may be challenging for the FEC in the future. Recent developments suggest that Republican Commissioner Matthew S. Petersen could leave the Federal Election Commission after being nominated for a federal judgeship by President Trump. Petersen remains on the commission in holdover status since his term expired in 2011. The status of a nomination to replace him is unclear, as President Trump previously nominated James E. \"Trey\" Trainor III for the Petersen seat. The White House resubmitted the nomination for a commissioner at the FEC at the start of the second session of the 115th Congress. Uncertainty surrounds the potential departure of other commissioners, which could leave the agency without a policymaking quorum. The original design of the FEC included six commissioners appointed by different officials, but court decisions have altered this structure. In 1976, the Supreme Court invalidated the original appointments method at the FEC, citing a violation of the Constitution's Appointments Clause. A federal court later found fault with the appointment structure again in 1993. The current appointment method involves all commissioners being presidentially appointed subject to Senate advice and consent. The appointment process for FEC commissioners is influenced by the House Committee on House Administration and Senate Rules and Administration Committee. Commissioners are chosen based on experience, integrity, impartiality, and good judgment, with a mix of lawyers, congressional staffers, political professionals, and election lawyers serving. No more than three commissioners can be from the same political party, with terms staggered so that two expire every other April 30 during odd-numbered years. Currently, FEC commissioners may serve a single six-year term, with the possibility of being nominated for an unexpired term or an upcoming term. Some commissioners have assumed office mid-term. The FEC commissioners can serve in \"holdover\" status after their terms expire until a successor is appointed. Currently, all commissioners are serving in holdover status, requiring at least four affirmative votes for most policymaking activities. The FEC commissioners can serve in \"holdover\" status after their terms expire until a successor is appointed, requiring at least four affirmative votes for most policymaking activities. Matters without at least four votes can leave questions unresolved, with existing campaign law and regulation remaining in effect. Agency staff and remaining commissioners can provide general information and prepare for a repopulated commission. In 2008, the FEC faced challenges with only two commissioners, leading to amendments allowing the agency to function with a reduced quorum. Despite the lack of policymaking quorum, the remaining commissioners could only discuss, not vote on, advisory opinions. The FEC faced challenges in 2008 with only two commissioners, leading to amendments allowing the agency to function with a reduced quorum. Despite the lack of policymaking quorum, the remaining commissioners could discuss but not vote on advisory opinions. After the Senate confirmed nominees in June 2008, the new commissioners faced a backlog of enforcement matters, litigation, advisory opinions, and rulemakings to implement portions of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. The agency returned to normal operations during the rest of 2008 and throughout 2009, maintaining a full policymaking quorum since then. Media reports suggest that the FEC currently retains its policymaking quorum. The FEC currently retains its policymaking quorum, but there are concerns about potential departures. If commissioners leave before additional confirmations, the FEC may not be able to reach a policymaking quorum, hindering its ability to carry out important duties. This includes addressing issues related to online political advertising, responding to events from past election cycles, and preparing for upcoming elections. Advisory opinion requests are common, especially during election years."
