    "content": "AMENDMENTS TO UNITED STATES INSULAR POSSESSION PROGRAM. Production Certificates under the U.S. Insular Possession Program require verification of wages and watch production for each calendar quarter. Certificates are issued to producers based on these criteria. The U.S. Insular Possession Program issues Production Certificates to producers based on verification of wages and watch production for each calendar quarter. The \"applicable amount\" for these certificates is calculated as 90% of the producer's creditable wages on watch assembly, with a graduated declining percentage for units exceeding 300,000 per calendar year. The Production Certificates issued under the U.S. Insular Possession Program entitle certificate holders to refunds of duties based on watch imports. The certificates calculate the refund amount by comparing duties on watches imported from eligible countries to duties under previous tariffs. The certificate holder can secure refunds of duties equal to the face value of the certificate on watches, watch movements, and parts imported into the US. Refunds are subject to Treasury Department regulations and a maximum of 5% can be retained for administrative costs. The Secretary of the Treasury may authorize refunds on jewelry or other duties if there is an insufficient level of duties from watch-related tariffs. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay the certificate holder the face value of the certificate, minus any duty refund claimed and a discount of up to 2%. The funds must be reinvested or used to support employment in the Virgin Islands. Payments will be made from duties collected on watches and watch movements. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay the certificate holder the face value of the certificate, minus any duty refund claimed and a discount of up to 2%. Payments will be made from duties collected on jewelry under chapter 71 or other appropriate duties. Additional U.S. Note to chapter 71 is amended to remove the 750,000 unit limitation for articles of jewelry. Prior to February 9, 2004, jewelry assembled in the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa will be treated as a product of those territories for customs purposes. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on April 1, 2002 for goods imported into the US customs territory on or after January 1, 2002."
