    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 15601 of the Elections Code is amended to specify procedures for recounting ballots for voting systems approved for use in California. The Secretary of State must adopt regulations by January 1, 2018, including guidelines for charges during a manual recount. Section 15620 is also amended. Section 15620 of the Elections Code is amended to allow voters to request a recount within five days after the official canvass or postcanvass risk-limiting audit. The request must be filed with the elections official in the county where the recount is sought and specify the candidate, slate of electors, or position on a measure for which the recount is requested. The amended Elections Code allows voters to request a recount within five days after the official canvass. The request can be filed by any voter in any affected county, and the recount may be conducted in one or more counties. The completion of the canvass is defined as when the elections official signs the certified statement of the election results. Section 15621 of the Elections Code is amended to allow any voter to request a recount within five days after the official canvass of a statewide election. The request must be filed with the Secretary of State and specify the county or counties for the recount and the candidate or measure in question. The Secretary of State sends a copy of the recount request to each county's elections official. If multiple voters request a recount for the same office or measure, the county elections official will conduct only one manual recount. The recount process must begin within seven days of the request and continue daily until completed, excluding weekends and holidays. The voter can choose between a manual recount or using the original voting system for ballots cast. The recount process must start within seven days of the request and occur daily until finished, excluding weekends and holidays. Voters can opt for a manual recount where the voter-verified paper audit trail is counted manually. Upon completion of a recount showing different election results, the new outcome will become the official returns for the precincts involved. If a recount is not completed in every precinct where votes were cast, the results will be declared null and void. If a recount is not completed in every precinct where votes were cast statewide for the office, slates, or measure, the results will be declared null and void. State-Funded Recounts can be ordered by the Governor within five days after the Secretary of State files a statement of the vote if the difference in votes for the second and third place candidates is within a certain margin. The official canvass of returns in a statewide election shows that the difference in votes for candidates or ballot measures must be within a certain margin for the Governor to order a state-funded manual recount. In a statewide election, if no candidate for Superintendent of Public Instruction receives a majority of votes and the difference between the second and third place candidates is within 1,000 votes or 0.00015 of all votes cast, a state-funded manual recount may be ordered by the Secretary of State. If a statewide election results in no majority for Superintendent of Public Instruction and a close margin between second and third place, a state-funded manual recount may be ordered by the Secretary of State for key statewide offices. If a recount is conducted, no other recount shall take place, and counties will be reimbursed for costs promptly. Upon ordering a recount, the Secretary of State directs county elections officials to recount all votes for the office or state ballot measure. During a recount, county elections officials must review rejected ballots to ensure none were improperly discarded. The process must be open to the public, including campaign members. The recount must be completed by specific deadlines for primary and general elections. Certain provisions of Article 3 apply to this process unless stated otherwise. The Secretary of State has the authority to establish rules for this article. County elections officials are only required to conduct a recount if funds are allocated for it. A new section in the Elections Code prohibits certification of voting systems that cannot facilitate a risk-limiting audit. The Secretary of State can approve changes to noncompliant voting systems until January 1, 2021. Reimbursement for mandated costs in this act will be provided to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
