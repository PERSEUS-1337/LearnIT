It introduces relative entropy regularization to maintain optimization stability while utilizing off-policy data. Trust-PCL significantly enhances solution quality and sample efficiency compared to traditional trust region methods like TRPO in continuous control tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes an agent's behavior policy through trial and error in a black box environment. Value-based algorithms like Q-learning and policy-based algorithms like actor-critic have been successful in environments with enumerable action spaces, such as Atari games. However, in more complex environments like continuous control and robotics, success has been limited. DDPG is an off-policy algorithm that aims to improve Q-learning's applicability to continuous control, but it can be unstable due to hyperparameter selection and initialization. The DDPG algorithm's performance is heavily influenced by hyperparameter selection and initialization. Trust region policy optimization (TRPO) has shown better results on continuous control tasks compared to DDPG but lacks the ability to utilize off-policy data efficiently. Efforts are being made to combine the stability of TRPO with the sample efficiency of value-based methods. In this paper, an alternative approach to improving the sample efficiency of trust region policy-based RL methods is investigated. By incorporating both on and off-policy data in an actor-critic algorithm, PCL, strong results on challenging continuous control benchmarks are achieved. The main observation is that augmenting the maximum reward objective with a relative entropy regularizer enhances performance. The Trust-PCL algorithm enhances policy-based RL methods by incorporating a relative entropy regularizer, improving performance and stability. It utilizes off-policy data to train policy and value estimates, with a coefficient for the regularizer to remain agnostic to reward scale. Trust-PCL outperforms TRPO in solving continuous control tasks. The Trust-PCL algorithm improves TRPO performance in solving continuous control tasks by incorporating a Riemannian metric for more effective descent directions in parameter space. The natural gradient method uses a Bregman divergence to define trust regions for parameter updates, improving optimization for conditional probabilistic models. The natural gradient method uses Bregman divergence for trust regions in parameter updates, improving optimization for probabilistic models. TRPO has achieved state-of-the-art results in continuous control by adding approximations to the natural gradient. Proximal gradient methods offer an alternative approach to trust region optimization, with techniques popular in RL for continuous control benchmarks. The optimal d\u03b8 under the reverse KL constraint D KL (\u03b8 + d\u03b8, \u03b8) can be characterized, providing a more natural and effective approach compared to TRPO. Previous work has used KL divergence to regularize policy optimization, resulting in a softmax relationship between the optimal policy and state values. Our work introduces multi-step consistency relations for a hybrid relative entropy plus entropy regularized expected reward objective, treating relative entropy regularization as a trust region constraint. Unlike previous studies, we can automatically determine the coefficient of relative entropy, crucial for cases with significant reward distribution changes during training. Most prior research on softmax consistency has been limited to simple tasks. This paper introduces the softmax consistency concept to challenging continuous-control benchmarks, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. The agent's behavior is modeled by a policy distribution \u03c0(a | s) over actions, and the environment provides rewards based on actions taken. The environment provides rewards based on actions taken, and the objective in RL is to maximize expected future discounted reward. Policy-based algorithms aim to optimize this objective, with Path Consistency Learning augmenting it with a discounted entropy regularizer. The PCL algorithm introduces a temperature parameter for entropy regularization and defines the discounted entropy recursively. It also enforces a softmax temporal consistency constraint for optimizing the policy and value function. PCL minimizes squared error to optimize parameterized policies and is applicable to both on-policy and off-policy trajectories. Trust Region Policy Optimization addresses instability in standard policy-based algorithms for maximizing expected reward. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) proposed an iterative trust region optimization to maximize expected reward (ER) while maintaining a constraint on KL-divergence with a prior policy. The algorithm aims to stabilize training by augmenting the entropy regularized expected reward objective with a discounted relative entropy trust region around the prior policy. This approach enhances training stability and leverages the natural information geometry of the parameter space. Relative entropy is defined as DISPLAYFORM1 and aims to maximize entropy regularized expected reward while maintaining proximity to the previous policy. Entropy regularization improves exploration, while relative entropy enhances stability and allows for faster learning. The method uses Lagrange multipliers to optimize the objective in (13) and the expected per-state objective in DISPLAYFORM3. O RELENT has a similar structure to O ENT and can be cast as an entropy. The objective, similar to O ENT, can be seen as an entropy regularized expected reward objective with transformed rewards. The optimal policy \u03c0 * is derived from this objective, expressed as a softmax state values equation. This leads to a single-step temporal consistency constraint that can be extended to multiple steps. We propose training a policy and value estimate to satisfy multi-step consistencies by minimizing the squared consistency error on sub-trajectories. Gradient descent is performed on the parameters to minimize this loss, with a focus on learning the value estimate parameter at least as fast as the policy parameter. In our implementation, we use a replay buffer prioritized by recency for gradient updates on parameters. B episodes are sampled from the replay buffer based on priority, and we update the prior policy using a lagged geometric mean of parameters to maximize entropy regularized expected reward. The use of a relative entropy regularizer introduces difficulties as the hyperparameter \u03bb needs to adapt to reward distribution. A method is proposed to redirect hyperparameter tuning from \u03bb to a desired hard constraint on relative entropy, approximating the penalty coefficient \u03bb( ). This is a key novelty of the work and differs from previous attempts at automatically tuning a regularizing coefficient. The study focuses on adapting the regularizing coefficient \u03bb during training by using a relative entropy regularizer. The analysis is done in an undiscounted setting with deterministic, finite-horizon environment dynamics. Despite some restrictive assumptions not being met in experiments, the method performs well. The optimal policy is proportional to exponentiated scaled reward, and the trajectory-wide KL-divergence between optimal and current policies is approximated analytically. The study focuses on adapting the regularizing coefficient \u03bb during training using a relative entropy regularizer in an undiscounted setting with deterministic, finite-horizon environment dynamics. The analysis approximates the trajectory-wide KL-divergence between optimal and current policies analytically, providing a method to determine \u03bb given a desired maximum divergence. The method involves performing a simple line search to find a suitable \u03bb that yields a KL-divergence as close as possible to the desired maximum divergence. Additionally, the method approximates the best \u03bb which yields a maximum divergence of N N k=1 T k given a set of sampled episodes. The study focuses on adapting the regularizing coefficient \u03bb during training using a relative entropy regularizer in an undiscounted setting with deterministic, finite-horizon environment dynamics. To avoid a large number of interactions with the environment, the last 100 episodes are used as the set of sampled episodes. Trust-PCL is evaluated against TRPO on benchmark tasks, with TRPO chosen as a baseline for its state-of-the-art performance on continuous control tasks. Trust-PCL is compared to TRPO on various control tasks from OpenAI Gym. Trust-PCL matches or surpasses TRPO's performance in terms of reward and efficiency. TRPO uses batches of 25,000 steps for training, while Trust-PCL is off-policy and alternates between collecting experience and training on batches from a replay buffer. Trust-PCL utilizes experience sampling from a replay buffer, collecting 10 steps from the environment and performing a gradient step on a batch of 64 sub-episodes. The policy is parameterized by a unimodal Gaussian, leading to stability challenges addressed by using Huber loss. Hyperparameter search was conducted for each variant and environment to optimize performance. Reward plots display results based on the best hyperparameters averaged over multiple training runs. Trust-PCL, using experience sampling from a replay buffer, shows competitive performance compared to TRPO across various environments. The implementation details and hyperparameter search are provided in the Appendix. Results indicate Trust-PCL matching or outperforming TRPO in terms of final reward and sample efficiency, especially on challenging tasks like Walker2d and Ant. Trust-PCL demonstrates competitive performance compared to TRPO across different environments, with the size of the trust region being a critical hyperparameter affecting algorithm stability. Increasing this parameter can lead to instability and hinder the agent's ability to achieve optimal rewards. Trust-PCL consistently matches or outperforms TRPO, as shown in the reward plots across millions of environment steps. Trust-PCL outperforms TRPO in terms of reward and sample efficiency across various trust region sizes. The use of trust region is crucial for stability, with Trust-PCL's off-policy learning ability being a key advantage. The hyperparameters \u03b1, \u03b2, and P determine the degree of off-policy learning in Trust-PCL. Trust-PCL achieves superior reward and sample efficiency compared to TRPO, especially with off-policy learning. The hyperparameters \u03b1, \u03b2, and P control the level of off-policy learning in Trust-PCL. Off-policy training shows a significant advantage in sample efficiency, requiring less experience compared to on-policy training. Trust-PCL shows improved sample efficiency with off-policy learning, achieving competitive rewards. Results are comparable to state-of-the-art implementations, with \u03c4 not significantly impacting performance. Trust-PCL, an off-policy algorithm with a relative-entropy penalty, improves sample efficiency and average reward on standard control tasks compared to TRPO. It maintains stability while approaching the sample efficiency of value-based methods. Trust-PCL is praised for its ability to train both policy and value estimate using off-policy data, making it stand out from previous methods. It also offers easy exploration incorporation through an entropy regularizer. Compared to TRPO, Trust-PCL is simpler to implement as it uses gradient descent instead of second-order gradient calculations on the KL-divergence. Trust-PCL simplifies implementation by using gradient descent instead of second-order calculations on KL-divergence. It allows for a wider range of policy parameterizations, making it more expressive. The log-density must be analytically computable, but the KL-divergence does not need to have a closed form. In Trust-PCL, the policy can be more expressive with mixtures of Gaussians or autoregressive policies. The experimental setup details implementation and hyperparameter search. Episodes in Acrobot were cut-off at step 500, while other environments had a cut-off at step 1,000. Some environments are non-terminating, ensuring equal-length episodes in each batch, while others can terminate the agent, maintaining a constant batch size in terms of steps. The batch size remained constant in steps but not episodes. TRPO and Trust-PCL struggled with the Humanoid task and did not pursue GAE implementation for fair comparison. Fully-connected neural networks were used for policy and value representation. The policy network uses a Gaussian distribution to sample actions, while the value network is trained using an LBFGS optimizer to fit a mixture of empirical and expected values. The policy is updated using a trust region step, and both policy and value parameters are updated at each training iteration. The policy network uses a Gaussian distribution to sample actions, while the value network is trained using an LBFGS optimizer to fit a mixture of empirical and expected values. Training \u03c6 involves minimizing a specific loss function with \u03ba = 0.9. Trust-PCL (on-policy) updates the policy with Adam optimizer and value network with TRPO-inspired updates. Trust-PCL (off-policy) updates both policy and value parameters simultaneously with Adam optimizer. Target value network is also utilized in this variant. Trust-PCL utilizes a target value network and key hyperparameters for effective learning. Grid searches were conducted for TRPO and Trust-PCL, experimenting with different values for constraints and rollouts. The discount factor was fixed at \u03b3 = 0.995. Trust-PCL also experimented with the value of \u03c4, either constant or decaying exponentially. Trust-PCL utilizes a target value network and key hyperparameters for effective learning. A simplified pseudocode for Trust-PCL is presented in Algorithm 1 with input parameters and update functions."
