    "title": "SB 591",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature in California acknowledges the devastating impact of tobacco use, with over 40,000 deaths annually. The state has 3.64 million adult smokers and 224,000 youth smokers, leading to significant healthcare costs and economic consequences. Tobacco-related diseases strain the healthcare system, costing billions in medical expenses and lost productivity. In 2015\u201316, publicly funded health care programs in California will cost over $18 billion, providing coverage to 12 million residents. Despite this, many families and children lack medical coverage due to budget constraints and cutbacks. Following CDC guidelines for tobacco control programs could save up to 14 to 20 times the implementation cost through reduced medical and Medicaid expenses. The California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 aims to fund the California Tobacco Control Program to change social norms and discourage tobacco use, saving money for the state. Tobacco tax increases can help mitigate tobacco-related diseases and improve healthcare access. Increasing the tobacco tax is an effective way to reduce smoking rates and fund services for prevention and cessation. California has a low cigarette tax of $0.87 per pack, ranking 33rd in the US. This is much lower than other west coast states like Washington ($3.025), Oregon ($1.31), and Arizona ($2). Certain populations in California have higher tobacco use rates, including African Americans, white men, Korean men, enlisted military personnel, LGBTQ individuals, young adults, rural, and low-income populations. A reinvigorated tobacco control program in California aims to combat predatory marketing by the tobacco industry to ethnic groups, reducing smoking rates and health risks such as heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and cancer. This program targets communities representing more than half of the state's residents. The taxes imposed on cigarettes and tobacco products do not apply to sales made by distributors to common carriers engaged in interstate or foreign passenger service or authorized persons selling on carrier facilities. Instead, a tax is levied on the carriers or authorized persons for sales in California at the same rate as set forth in the law. Common carriers and authorized persons must pay the tax imposed by this section and file reports with the board as required. Section 30108 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require distributors in California to collect taxes on cigarettes and tobacco products from purchasers who are not licensed distributors. Receipts must be provided in the prescribed manner. Every person engaged in business in California must collect taxes on untaxed cigarettes or tobacco products given as samples, and provide a receipt. This requirement does not apply to distributions exempt from tax under Section 30105.5. The California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 defines \"engaged in business in the state\" as maintaining a place of business or having representatives selling tobacco products. Taxes collected are considered debts owed to the state. The California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 imposes an additional tax on distributors of cigarettes at a rate of $0.10 per cigarette distributed after January 1, 2016. The act defines \"tobacco products\" to include cigars, smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, and products containing at least 50% tobacco, excluding cigarettes. Every dealer and wholesaler in California must pay a floor stock tax of $0.10 for each cigarette in their possession as of January 1, 2016. They need to file a return with the board by July 1, 2016, showing the number of cigarettes they have. Every licensed cigarette distributor in California must pay a cigarette indicia adjustment tax based on the type of tax stamp affixed to or in their possession. The rates are $2.50 for \"25\" stamps, $2 for \"20\" stamps, and $1 for \"10\" stamps. They need to file a return by July 1, 2016, showing the number of stamps held. The California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 establishes taxes due by July 1, 2016, with interest for late payments. Revenues from these taxes go to the California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund. The California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund distributes moneys as follows: 14% to Tobacco Prevention and Education Account, 84% to Tobacco Disease Related Health Care Account, and 2% to Tobacco Law Enforcement Account. Funds can be invested with interest credited back to the fund for specific purposes outlined in the article. The taxes imposed by this article and the revenue derived therefrom are not part of the General Fund or General Fund revenue for purposes of the California Constitution. Revenues from the California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund are designated for specific purposes and cannot be used for any other reason. The funds must supplement existing services, not replace them, and cannot be transferred to other government funds. Section 30181 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to specify that the tax on cigarettes must be paid monthly by the 25th day following distribution or sale on carrier facilities. Each distributor of tobacco products must file a monthly return with the board by the 25th day of the following month, including distribution details and wholesale costs. The board may require longer filing periods for administration purposes, and returns must be authenticated as prescribed. No reimbursement required by this act under California Constitution. Act only incurs costs for local agencies/school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing crimes/infractions. Act effective only if Assembly Bill 1396 of 2015-16 is enacted by January 1, 2016."
