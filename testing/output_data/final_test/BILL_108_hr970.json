    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Training for Realtime Writers Act of 2003\". Congress finds that the Federal Communications Commission has adopted rules for closed captioning of television programming, with a gradual requirement for full captioning starting in 2006. Over 28 million Americans are deaf or hard of hearing, with many needing captioning services for mainstream activities. Additionally, around 24,000 children are born in the US each year with some form of hearing loss. According to a study by the National Council on Aging, a significant percentage of Americans over 65 years old are hearing impaired, with the numbers increasing with age. The study also suggests a link between hearing loss and depression in older adults. Research shows that captions can improve English reading skills for various groups, including remedial readers and young children. Over the past 5 years, student enrollment in programs training court reporters as realtime writers has significantly decreased, leading to program closures on many campuses. This affects 12 million young children learning to read, 27 million illiterate adults, and 30 million people for whom English is a second language. Authorization of grant program to promote training and job placement of realtime writers. The Secretary of Education will provide competitive grants to eligible court reporting or realtime writing training programs to train individuals as realtime writers for closed captioning of video programming. Eligible entities must meet educational and financial standards and be accredited by a recognized agency. The Department of Education prioritizes grants for eligible entities that show the ability to increase training capacity for realtime writers, collaborate effectively with local institutions, and propose innovative approaches for training and job placement. Grants awarded under this section are for a specified duration. A grant under this section is for a 2-year period and may not exceed $1,500,000 for the duration. SEC. 4. APPLICATION. To apply for a grant under section 3, an eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary of Education. The application should include a description of the training and assistance to be funded, performance measures for evaluating progress, ensuring employment and retention of scholarship recipients as realtime writers. The eligible entity applying for a grant must describe how they will continue providing training after the grant period, work with local workforce boards to meet workforce goals, and provide any additional information requested by the Secretary. SEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS. An eligible entity receiving a grant under section 3 must use the funds for recruitment, training, assistance, and job placement of individuals as realtime writers. This includes activities like recruitment, scholarships for training, distance learning, curriculum development, job placement assistance, promoting careers in realtime writing for individuals with disabilities. The scholarship amount for realtime writing services is based on financial need and recipients must agree to provide services for a specified period. The Secretary will establish requirements for coursework and employment. The Secretary will establish requirements for coursework, employment, and repayment of scholarship amounts for recipients of scholarships. Administrative costs for grants under section 3 are limited to 5 percent. Grant amounts should supplement, not supplant, other funds for training and placing individuals as realtime writers. Each eligible entity receiving a grant under section 3 must submit an annual report to the Secretary of Education. The report should include a description of grant usage, an assessment of activities' effectiveness in increasing the number of realtime writers, and identification of best practices for training and retaining realtime writers. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $20,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2006, and necessary sums for fiscal year 2007."
