The Congress finds that fair international trade is crucial for economic well-being, but it must be upheld through national and international trade agreements. Developing countries have gained a competitive advantage by violating worker rights, which is unacceptable in international trade. Exports to the United States from countries that do not respect worker rights can lower living and working standards in both countries. International agreements and US policy have emphasized the importance of fair labor standards in international trade. The US and other member nations of the International Labor Organization are obligated to maintain fair working conditions. The United States has been striving to ensure fair and humane labor conditions for workers globally, engaging in discussions with GATT and the International Labor Organization. Fundamental worker rights and fair labor standards are crucial in multilateral trade negotiations, as affirmed in various international agreements. The United Nations Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights emphasize promoting higher living standards, fair employment conditions, and just remuneration for workers globally. The curr_chunk discusses various international agreements related to labor rights, including the prohibition of forced labor in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the commitment to fair wages and working conditions in the Revised Charter of the Organization of American States, and the goal of raising living standards and ensuring full employment in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of fair labor standards, productivity, wages, and working conditions, as outlined in international agreements such as the Havana Charter. It recognizes the need to consider the rights of workers and aims for the achievement and maintenance of these standards globally. The curr_chunk highlights the need for fair labor standards and the improvement of wages and working conditions to align with productivity. It emphasizes the importance of eliminating unfair labor conditions in international trade. The United States' commitment to these principles is reflected in specific laws prohibiting goods produced by forced labor. The curr_chunk discusses the 1974 law defining internationally recognized worker rights, including the right to association, organize and bargain collectively, prohibition of forced labor, minimum age for child employment, and acceptable work conditions. It also prohibits trade preferences for countries not upholding these rights. The curr_chunk highlights the lack of progress in adopting worker rights as a principle of the GATT to prevent countries from using denial of worker rights for competitive advantage in international trade. The curr_chunk refers to section 1101(b)(14) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Establishment of Working Party on Worker Rights. The President shall seek the establishment of a working party in the GATT to examine the relationship of internationally recognized worker rights to international trade. The objectives include exploring ways to link trade to worker rights, examining the economic impact of trade distortions due to denial of worker rights, and developing information on trade-distorting worker rights practices. The curr_chunk discusses the unjustifiability of countries or industries gaining a competitive advantage in international trade through the denial of worker rights. The President will establish a standing committee on worker rights within the World Trade Organization. Definitions include \"fundamental internationally recognized worker rights\" and \"GATT\" referring to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade."
