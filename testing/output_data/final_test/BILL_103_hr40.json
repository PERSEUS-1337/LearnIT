The Congress finds that approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants were enslaved in the United States from 1619 to 1865, and that slavery was constitutionally sanctioned from 1789 to 1865. The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to study the effects of slavery on African Americans and society in the United States. The Act aims to establish a commission to examine slavery from 1619 to 1865, discrimination against freed slaves and their descendants, the lingering effects on African Americans and society, and recommend ways to educate the public on the findings. The Commission will recommend remedies based on its findings and submit the results to Congress. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT AND DUTIES.

The Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans will examine discrimination against freed African slaves and their descendants post-Civil War, the lingering effects of slavery on African Americans and society, and recommend ways to educate the public and provide appropriate remedies.
