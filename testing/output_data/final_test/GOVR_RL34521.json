    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Carcieri v. Salazar on February 24, 2009, stated that the Secretary of the Interior did not have the authority to take land into trust for the Narragansett Indian Tribe under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. This decision may have broader implications as it limits the SOI's ability to acquire land in trust for newly recognized tribes. The impact of this ruling on future litigation is still uncertain. The Supreme Court ruling in Indians v. Patchak allows challenges to DOI decisions on land trust acquisitions within a six-year period under the Administrative Procedure Act, overturning the assumption of sovereign immunity under the Quiet Title Act. This decision may lead to more suits contesting SOI decisions to take land into trust for Indian tribes. In Big Lagoon Rancheria v. California, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that challenges to trust acquisitions for tribes not recognized in 1934 must adhere to the APA's six-year statute of limitations. The Bureau of Indian Affairs revised its Land Acquisition regulations in response to the Patchak decision, specifying when final agency action occurs for land-into-trust decisions. Decisions by the SOI or AS-IA for land-into-trust applications are final agency actions, requiring prompt publication in the Federal Register. BIA-level decisions are not final agency actions and require notice in a newspaper and to state/local officials and interested parties. Land cannot be taken into trust based on BIA-level decisions. The decision regarding land-into-trust applications by the SOI or AS-IA is final and requires prompt publication. BIA-level decisions are not final and do not allow land to be taken into trust. The report discusses trial and appellate court decisions leading to the Supreme Court's ruling in Carcieri, analyzing its potential impact and legislative proposals. The Narragansett Indian Tribe's longstanding history in Rhode Island is also highlighted. The Narragansett Indian Tribe's history in Rhode Island predates colonial settlement and includes a continuing relationship with the state. Their formal federal recognition was established in 1983 under the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act. The Tribe's petition for inclusion on the DOI's list of recognized Indian entities was approved, leading to the placement of tribal lands in trust under state jurisdiction. The Narragansett Indian Tribe's dispute with the State of Rhode Island began in 1991 when the Tribe's housing authority purchased 31 acres adjacent to settlement lands, asserting it was free of state jurisdiction. After losing the claim, the Tribe applied to have the land taken into trust, which was approved by the SOI and upheld by various courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in favor of the trust acquisition, with dissenting opinions criticizing the method of resolution. The State of Rhode Island's jurisdiction over tribal lands conflicts with the settlement agreement, leading to a legal dispute with the Narragansett Indian Tribe. The Tribe's reservation lands are subject to state jurisdiction under RIICSA, preventing gaming activities. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether the trust acquisition violated federal regulations. The legal dispute between the Narragansett Indian Tribe and the State of Rhode Island involves the interaction of federal statutes, including RIICSA and 25 U.S.C. \u00a7465. RIICSA settled land claims of the Tribe and required tribal relinquishment of land claims, while 25 U.S.C. \u00a7465 is a provision of the IRA of 1934. The case centers on whether the trust acquisition violated federal regulations and the terms of RIICSA, which ratified the settlement ending a land claim lawsuit by the Tribe. The Settlement Act involved federal ratification of earlier land transactions, the establishment of an Indian-owned corporation for the Narragansett Tribe, a settlement fund for purchasing private lands, transfer of state land to the corporation, designation of transferred lands as \"settlement lands,\" and a jurisdictional provision for state jurisdiction on the settlement lands. Rhode Island was required to set up a corporation to hold the land initially for the Tribe's benefit, with the potential for federal recognition as an Indian tribe through the DOI process. The Settlement Act extinguished all Indian claims to land in Rhode Island once the State created the Indian corporation. After the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act (RIICSA) was enacted, it did not provide federal recognition for the Narragansett Tribe but allowed for the possibility of administrative recognition by the Secretary of the Interior. The Act did not explicitly mention the Tribe's ability to acquire more trust land in Rhode Island. However, after the Tribe received federal recognition in 1983, they successfully transferred settlement lands from the corporation to the Tribe and had them taken into trust, establishing an Indian reservation. The central issue in the litigation was the interpretation of the Indian Reorganization Act's definitions of \"Indians.\" The central issue in the litigation was the IRA definitions of \"Indians\" and \"tribe\" under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7467. The SOI is authorized to take land into trust for Indians, defined as persons of Indian descent who are members of recognized tribes under Federal jurisdiction. The district court upheld the SOI's decision to take a 31-acre tract into trust for the Tribe, ruling that the SOI had authority under the IRA. The court interpreted the IRA to allow the land to be taken into trust for the Narragansett Indian Tribe, even though it was not formally recognized until 1983. Despite not being recognized in 1934, the court found that the Tribe was under federal jurisdiction since its existence in 1614, making it eligible for trust acquisition. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had two withdrawn decisions supporting trust acquisition based on Section 465 authority, rejecting Rhode Island's arguments against it. The court upheld the trust acquisition for the Narragansett Indian Tribe under the Indian Reorganization Act, despite not being federally recognized in 1934. It focused on the interpretation of \"now\" in the statute, supporting the DOI's view that it refers to the present day. The court also addressed the jurisdictional issue, reaffirming its decision based on statutory principles. The court addressed the jurisdictional issue, with a majority of the panel interpreting the Settlement Act in favor of the Narragansett Indian Tribe's sovereignty over land in Rhode Island. Circuit Judge Howard dissented, arguing for the application of Rhode Island laws. The First Circuit ruled that the definition of Indian in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7479 is ambiguous, invoking the Chevron test. This involves deferring to Congress's interpretation if clear, or to the agency's if ambiguous. The court found the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) to be ambiguous on jurisdictional issues. The court found the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) ambiguous on trust acquisitions for tribes not recognized in 1934. It ruled against the State's arguments on jurisdiction, citing a high standard for repeals by implication and finding no intent to repeal the Secretary's trust acquisition powers. Other statutes settling Indian land claims supported this position. The court rejected the State's request to limit the Tribe's jurisdiction over newly acquired land, stating that only Congress has the power to do so, not the courts or the Secretary of the Interior. This decision was based on the existence of other statutes settling Indian land claims that did not limit trust acquisition authority. The court ruled that only Congress, not the courts or the Secretary of the Interior, has the authority over newly acquired land. The dissenting opinions argued that the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act (RIICSA) intended to resolve all Indian claims in Rhode Island and partially repealed the Secretary of the Interior's authority to take land into trust for the Tribe. The Supreme Court found that the Secretary of the Interior had no authority under the Indian Reorganization Act to take land into trust for the Tribe. The Court's opinion, written by Justice Thomas, stated that the 1934 legislation restricted beneficiaries to \"Indians\" and \"Indian tribe[s]\" as defined in the statute. The dissenting opinion criticized the majority's narrow interpretation of the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act as \"absurd.\" The Supreme Court ruled that the Secretary of the Interior lacked authority to take land into trust for the Tribe under the Indian Reorganization Act. The decision focused on the interpretation of the word \"now\" in the statute, with Rhode Island arguing it meant \"at the time of enactment\" and the SOI claiming it was ambiguous. The case centered on Section 5 of the IRA and the definitions of \"Indian\" and \"Indian tribe\" in Section 19. Section 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act allows for the acquisition of lands for Indians, with title held in trust by the United States. Section 19 provides definitions for \"Indian\" and \"tribe\" under the IRA. The Indian Reorganization Act allows for the acquisition of lands for Indians, with title held in trust by the United States. It defines \"Indian\" and \"tribe\" and includes Eskimos and other aboriginal peoples of Alaska as Indians. The Court's opinion on the membership of the Narragansetts in a recognized Indian Tribe under Federal jurisdiction was based on statutory construction, examining the meaning of \"now under Federal jurisdiction\" in 1934. The Court ruled that trust acquisitions can only be done for tribes under Federal jurisdiction in 1934, based on the plain meaning of the statute. It stated that there is no way to circumvent the definition of 'Indian' in delineating the Secretary's authority. The Court also rejected the argument that trust acquisitions are authorized for tribes not under Federal jurisdiction in 1934. The Court's analysis of \u00a72202 clarified that tribes can benefit from \u00a7465 even if they opted out of the IRA under \u00a7478. It resolved the issue of whether the Narragansetts were under Federal jurisdiction at the time of the IRA's enactment, citing evidence from the record. The Court found that the Narragansett Indian Tribe was not under Federal jurisdiction in 1934, ruling the trust acquisition contrary to the statute. Justice Stevens dissented, interpreting \"tribe\" separately from the IRA's definition of \"Indian.\" He argued that the Secretary of the Interior had authority to confine the meaning of \"tribe\" to those recognized by the Department of the Interior. The Supreme Court found that the Narragansett Indian Tribe was not under Federal jurisdiction in 1934, making the trust acquisition invalid. Justice Stevens argued that the Secretary of the Interior could limit the definition of \"tribe\" to those recognized by the DOI, questioning the SOI's ability to take land into trust for any tribe added to the DOI's list. The Supreme Court's Carcieri decision questions the ability of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for tribes not under federal jurisdiction in 1934, unless authorized by other legislation. A memorandum released by the DOI in 2014 interprets the meaning of \"under Federal jurisdiction\" for the Indian Reorganization Act, allowing post-1934 recognized tribes to establish eligibility for trust acquisitions. The 2014 DOI memorandum analyzed the Carcieri decision's impact on tribes' eligibility for land trust acquisitions under the IRA. It highlighted the ambiguity of the phrase \"under Federal jurisdiction\" and the potential for tribes to prove pre-1934 federal dealings. The Memorandum explored various interpretations of the phrase before concluding its ambiguity. The 2014 DOI memorandum analyzed the ambiguity of the phrase \"under Federal jurisdiction\" in determining tribes' eligibility for land trust acquisitions under the IRA. It concludes that the phrase is ambiguous and requires a reasonable construction by the agency charged with interpreting it, following the two-pronged test used in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. The 2014 DOI memorandum analyzed the ambiguity of the phrase \"under Federal jurisdiction\" for tribes' eligibility for land trust acquisitions under the IRA. It explores the historical context of the IRA, federal Indian policy evolution, and the powers Congress and the executive branch hold over Indian affairs. The memorandum also discusses the unique statutory construction tools courts use when interpreting federal Indian statutes. The 2014 DOI memorandum analyzed the ambiguity of the phrase \"under Federal jurisdiction\" for tribes' eligibility for land trust acquisitions under the IRA. It determined that \"under Federal jurisdiction\" in 1934 meant that the recognized Indian tribe was subject to the Indian Affairs' authority of the United States. The basic requirement is to show that the federal government exercised jurisdiction before 1934 and that the jurisdictional status remained in 1934. The 2014 DOI memorandum analyzed the criteria for tribes' eligibility for land trust acquisitions under the IRA, requiring proof of federal jurisdiction before and in 1934. The memorandum also discussed the 2010 DOI decision regarding land trust acceptance for the Cowlitz Tribe of Indians, indicating a thorough review process for newly recognized tribes seeking land trust status. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in Big Lagoon Rancheria v. California that a tribe not recognized in 1934 cannot challenge the validity of a trust acquisition for gaming purposes under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The case involved land taken into trust in 1994 for the Big Lagoon Rancheria of California. Big Lagoon, a tribe in California, faced a dispute with the state over a gaming compact. California objected to the tribe's chosen gaming site, claiming it was not validly taken into trust in 1934. The Ninth Circuit initially sided with California, stating there was no group on the Big Lagoon Rancheria in 1934. The Ninth Circuit found that Big Lagoon was not a tribe under federal jurisdiction in 1934, leading to the conclusion that the DOI had no authority to take land into trust for Big Lagoon. The en banc court rejected the argument that the APA was the only avenue to challenge a land-into-trust decision, stating that such challenges were considered \"garden-variety APA claims.\" The en banc court stated that allowing California to challenge the BIA's decision to take land into trust outside the APA would create doubt over land taken into trust for tribes recognized by the Federal government. Recent court decisions suggest challenges to land-into-trust determinations based on Carcieri. Some courts have upheld the SOI's process for determining tribal jurisdiction in 1934 for land trust under the IRA. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the Department of the Interior's decision to take land into trust for gaming for the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, which was officially acknowledged as an Indian tribe in 2002. This decision affirms a ruling by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Cowlitz Indian Tribe, officially acknowledged in 2002, had land taken into trust for gaming. Plaintiffs, including a neighboring tribe, local entities, homeowners, and businesses, challenged the decision as arbitrary and capricious. They argued the tribe was not eligible for land acquisition under the IRA and the land was not eligible for gaming under IGRA. Courts upheld the decision, citing ambiguity in the statutory language and the agency's reasonable interpretation. The district court found the language of Section 19 of the IRA ambiguous regarding the acquisition of trust land for tribes under federal jurisdiction. It concluded that recognition need not have been operative in 1934 for a tribe to qualify. The district court found the IRA ambiguous on acquiring trust land for tribes under federal jurisdiction, determining recognition in 1934 not necessary. The court upheld the SOI's reasonable test for tribal status, referencing Justice Breyer's factors from Carcieri concurrence. The SOI's two-part test examines guardian-like actions by Federal officials for tribes and the absence of formal recognition in 1934. The Cowlitz Indian Tribe met the IRA's \"under Federal jurisdiction\" test based on failed treaty negotiations, dealings with federal officials, provision of resources, representation of fishing rights, allotments, and attorney contract approval. The appellate court reviewed the trust acquisition under the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard. The court analyzed whether the Cowlitz Indian Tribe met the \"under Federal jurisdiction\" test based on various criteria, including failed treaty negotiations and dealings with federal officials. The court applied the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard and the Supreme Court's Chevron analysis in its decision. The court found the statute ambiguous regarding the eligibility of a tribe for trust acquisition under the IRA. It concluded that a tribe must be recognized at the time of trust acquisition, not necessarily in 1934. The court also deemed the SOI's interpretation reasonable in determining the Cowlitz Indian Tribe's federal jurisdiction status in 1934. The court found the statute ambiguous regarding a tribe's eligibility for trust acquisition under the IRA. It concluded that a tribe must be recognized at the time of trust acquisition, not necessarily in 1934. The court also deemed the SOI's interpretation reasonable in determining the Cowlitz Indian Tribe's federal jurisdiction status in 1934, stating that a formal government-to-government relationship was not required. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York applied the Chevron framework in Central New York Fair Business Association v. Jewell, finding judicial deference to the SOI's interpretation of \"under Federal jurisdiction\" in a trust acquisition case involving 17,370 acres in New York. The court considered the diversity of evidence tribes can produce and evolving agency practices in Indian affairs. The U.S. District Court upheld the Secretary of the Interior's decision regarding a trust acquisition case for the Oneida Indian Nation of New York, involving 17,370 acres. The court rejected claims that the Oneidas were not under federal jurisdiction in 1934, citing historical treaties and the ambiguity of the IRA language. The U.S. District Court upheld the Secretary of the Interior's decision on a trust acquisition case for the Oneida Indian Nation of New York, stating that recognition is not limited to a specific administrative process and that the tribe was under federal jurisdiction in 1934, making them a federally recognized tribe. The court dismissed suits contesting a decision to take land into trust for the Ione Band of Miwok Indians, citing the ambiguity of the term \"under Federal jurisdiction\" and deferring to the agency's interpretation. The plaintiffs argued the Ione Band was not under Federal jurisdiction in 1934, but the court viewed its role as limited in this matter. The court deferred to the agency's interpretation regarding the Ione Band's federal jurisdiction in 1934, stating it was not arbitrary or capricious. The U.S. District Court invalidated the decision to take land into trust for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, based on the IRA's definition of \"Indian\" as descendants residing within Indian reservations in 1934. The Mashpee Tribe was acknowledged as an Indian tribe in 2007 and applied for trust acquisition, which was approved in 2015 by the Secretary of the Interior. The DOI found that the Mashpee Tribe met the definition of \"Indian\" under the IRA, allowing land to be taken into trust for them. The agency's decision clarified ambiguities in the statutory language using Chevron principles. The DOI's interpretative elucidation identified the Town of Mashpee as the Mashpee Tribe's \"reservation\" under the IRA. The decision clarified that \"such members\" refer to members of any recognized Indian tribe, regardless of federal jurisdiction in 1934. This interpretation aligns with Congress's intent to provide new homelands for Indians. The Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of not rendering any part of a statute meaningless or insignificant. Interpreting the second definition of \"reservation\" under federal jurisdiction in 1934 as encompassing all individuals would negate the requirement of reservation residency. The term \"reservation\" holds a distinct meaning from \"under federal jurisdiction,\" and the conjunctive term \"and all\" indicates Congress intended the second definition to stand independently from the first. The Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of not rendering any part of a statute meaningless or insignificant. The interpretation of the second definition of \"reservation\" under federal jurisdiction in 1934 as encompassing all individuals would negate the requirement of reservation residency. The term \"reservation\" holds a distinct meaning from \"under federal jurisdiction,\" and the conjunctive term \"and all\" indicates Congress intended the second definition to stand independently from the first. The overall structure of the three definitions can be seen as three partially overlapping sets defined by different limitations, with the 1934 statute applying to and limiting the second definition. The district court interpreted the IRA's second definition of \"Indian\" to mean that a descendant of a recognized Indian tribe must have been under federal jurisdiction in June 1934 to be eligible for the IRA's land-into-trust provision. The court found the statutory language unambiguous and reinforced its conclusion by citing analogous cases. The 111th Congress explored the ramifications of the Carcieri decision regarding the IRA. The House Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing to discuss the interpretation of \"now under federal jurisdiction\" and concerns about potential litigation. Representative Nick Rahall emphasized the importance of placing land into trust for Indian tribes. Placing land into trust for Indian tribes is crucial to address past injustices. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs discussed executive branch authority to acquire trust lands, with Edward P. Lazarus suggesting legislative changes to avoid costly litigation. Two possible approaches were proposed: amending the IRA and ratifying pre-Carcieri land-into-trust determinations for tribes not recognized in 1934. Mr. Lazarus suggested that the Department of the Interior must now determine if tribes recognized after 1934 were under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 when considering land trust requests under the Indian Reorganization Act. He highlighted factors like treaty obligations, appropriations, and enrollment duties. Tribes recognized since 1978 have shown continuous existence since 1900, indicating they have been under Federal jurisdiction since 1934. Mr. Lazarus suggested that DOI should determine if tribes recognized after 1934 were under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 for land trust requests under the Indian Reorganization Act. He mentioned possible ways to provide trust status for these tribes, such as transferring excess federal real property or exploring presidential authority. W. Ron Allen provided draft language for an IRA amendment to remove certain wording. In the 111th Congress, there were bills introduced to extend authority to the Secretary to take land into trust for all federally recognized tribes, but none were enacted. Witnesses recommended a review of trust acquisition policy and criteria used by the DOI. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to extend the Secretary's authority to take land into trust for all federally recognized tribes. Of the three bills introduced, only S. 1703 was reported out of committee. The reported version of S. 1703 included an amendment by Senator Tom Coburn requiring a study on the impact of a Supreme Court decision and clarifications on the legislation's scope. The legislation proposed in the 111th Congress aimed to amend the Indian Reorganization Act by changing the definition of \"Indian\" to include members of any federally recognized tribe. This change would have expanded the Secretary's authority to take land into trust for all tribes acknowledged by the Secretary of the Interior. The legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to amend the Indian Reorganization Act by redefining \"tribe\" to include any Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or Indians residing on one reservation for IRA purposes. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs viewed the legislation as necessary to correct a judicial decision that contradicted the Department of the Interior's trust land acquisition practices, potentially leading to disparate treatment of federally recognized tribes and creating uncertainty about the Secretary's authority. Senator Dorgan introduced the legislation in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri v. Salazar. The legislation introduced in response to the Carcieri v. Salazar decision aimed to reaffirm the Secretary's authority to take lands into trust for Indian tribes, regardless of when they were recognized by the federal government. This was necessary to avoid creating two classes of Indian tribes based on recognition dates. Additionally, there was another legislative vehicle that included language amending the Indian Reorganization Act to cover \"any federally recognized Indian tribe.\" In response to the Carcieri v. Salazar decision, legislation was introduced to reaffirm the Secretary's authority to take lands into trust for Indian tribes, regardless of recognition dates. This included language amending the Indian Reorganization Act to cover \"any federally recognized Indian tribe.\" In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to extend this authority, but none were enacted. One bill, S. 676, was amended and reported out of committee with provisions similar to Section 2727 of H.R. 3082 from the previous Congress. S. 676, introduced in response to the Carcieri v. Salazar decision, aims to reaffirm the Secretary's authority to take lands into trust for any federally recognized Indian tribe. The bill includes provisions for ratifying past land-into-trust acquisitions and requires a study on the decision's impact. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs criticized the handling of Carcieri before the Supreme Court and highlighted the decision's negative effects on tribes. H.R. 1234 aims to address issues related to public safety, tribal law enforcement, and economic development by freezing access to capital and potentially increasing Federal litigation. It contains language similar to H.R. 3082 from the 111th Congress. Additionally, H.R. 1291 applies the Indian Reorganization Act retroactively to federally recognized Indian tribes, excluding Alaska. Legislation in the 112th Congress, such as S. 988, H.R. 1851, and H.R. 1882, aimed to compensate local governments for revenue loss due to land being taken into trust for tribes or individuals under the Land-In-Trust Schools and Local Governments Equitable Compensation Act. In the 113th Congress, a bill was enacted into law reaffirming the trust acquisition of land for an Indian tribe. Compensation from the U.S. Treasury's general fund for lost tax revenue is provided unless waiver agreements are negotiated. Eligible entities suffering revenue loss include local education agencies, local governments, and states. In the 113th Congress, a bill was enacted into law reaffirming trust land acquisitions for Indian tribes. The Obama Administration proposed amending the Indian Reorganization Act to include all persons of Indian descent who are members of federally recognized tribes. H.R. 279 sought to retroactively define \"Indian\" as any federally recognized tribe and remove the term \"tribe\" from the Act's definition. The bill H.R. 666 / S. 2188 aimed to amend the Indian Reorganization Act retroactively to define \"Indian\" as any federally recognized tribe. It also included provisions to protect past land-into-trust acquisitions for tribes recognized at the time of acquisition. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs reported an amended version of S. 1879, the Interior Improvement Act, on June 6, 2016. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs reported an amended version of S. 1879, the Interior Improvement Act, introduced by Senator John Barrasso. It aims to amend the Indian Reorganization Act to include all persons of Indian descent who are members of federally recognized tribes. It also outlines procedures for off-reservation land trust applications and cooperative agreements with local governments. Effective June 18, 1934, the term \"Indian\" in this Act includes all persons of Indian descent who are members of federally recognized tribes, descendants residing on reservations, and those with one-half or more Indian blood. Eskimos and Alaskan aboriginal peoples are also considered Indians. The term \"tribe\" refers to any Indian tribe, band, pueblo, or Indians on a reservation. \"Adult Indians\" are those over twenty-one years old. The bill ratifies trust acquisitions challenged for lack of federal jurisdiction in 1934. The legislation proposed in S. 1879 in 1934 would establish a land-into-trust acquisition application process for tribes or individual Indians seeking off-reservation land to be taken into trust by the Secretary of the Interior. It would not impact other federal Indian land determinations and would define terms like \"contiguous\" for the acquisition process. The proposed legislation in S. 1879 in 1934 would establish a land-into-trust acquisition process for tribes or individual Indians seeking off-reservation land. It defines terms like \"contiguous jurisdiction\" and \"impacts\" for the application process. The bill would establish requirements for land acquisition applications, including descriptions of need, ownership verification, business plans, and location details. It also mandates notice to contiguous jurisdictions, public notice of applications, and timetables for comments and decisions. The SOI is encouraged to facilitate cooperative agreements with neighboring jurisdictions. An expedited process is available for applications with such agreements. The legislation establishes an expedited process for applications with cooperative agreements, allowing for terms related to mitigation, land use changes, dispute resolution, and fees. If a completed application includes a cooperative agreement, the SOI must make a decision within 120 days. Failure to meet the timeline results in automatic approval. If no agreement is included, the SOI must issue a written determination of mitigation. The legislation requires consideration of the economic impact on contiguous jurisdictions and specifies that failure to submit a cooperative agreement will not prejudice an application if it is due to a lack of good faith. The SOI must encourage local cooperation and verify clear title before issuing a final decision on an application. The bill requires verification of clear title to the land, satisfaction of legal requirements, consideration of materials and comments, determination of mitigation, and cooperative agreements with jurisdictions. It also mandates consultation with Indian tribes, publication of consultation summary, and allows for judicial review of final decisions in federal court. H.R. 407 and H.R. 249 propose amendments to the Indian Reorganization Act to include all persons of Indian descent who are members of federally recognized tribes. The bills also address previous acquisitions and limitations on the Secretary of the Interior's authority regarding land trust acquisitions. The Indian Reorganization Act amendments proposed in H.R. 407 and H.R. 249 aim to expand the definition of 'Indian tribe' to include all federally recognized tribes acknowledged by the Secretary of the Interior."
