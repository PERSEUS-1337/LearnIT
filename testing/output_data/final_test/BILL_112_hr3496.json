Congress acknowledges the importance of fish and wildlife conservation as a core American value, providing various benefits such as economic contributions and diverse habitats that are essential to the American landscape. Federal, State, and local governments, tribes, private landowners, and conservation organizations, along with American sportsmen and outdoor recreationists, value and protect fish and wildlife. States have trustee and police powers over fish and wildlife within their borders. Cooperation between States and the Federal Government is essential for managing fish and wildlife. The changing American landscape, especially in the Western United States where most Federal public lands are located, highlights the importance of conserving fish and wildlife habitats on public lands. Federal public lands play a critical role in preserving fish, plant, and wildlife species in America. Federal public lands in America protect endangered and threatened species, prevent species from becoming endangered, and provide habitats for species impacted by global climate change. They serve as refuges from human development and help maintain common species, including those valued for hunting and fishing. These lands play a crucial role in preserving fish, plant, and wildlife species in the face of mounting impacts of global warming. The stewardship of America's public lands should aim to sustain diverse fish, wildlife, and plant communities, guided by long-standing principles of multiple use and sustained yield management. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"desired non-native species\" are valued for their contribution to species diversity or their social, cultural, or economic value. \"Focal species\" are selected for monitoring to provide insights into the effects of management activities on other species. \"Native species\" are indigenous to a planning area. A \"planning area\" refers to any designated area. The term \"planning area\" refers to a geographic unit of National Forest System lands or Bureau of Land Management lands covered by an individual management plan. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, depending on the jurisdiction of the land. The term \"species-of-concern\" includes species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. A sustainable population refers to a species with a high likelihood of persisting well distributed throughout its range within a planning area for at least 50 years, based on scientific evidence. This includes species designated with specific status rankings, identified as species of greatest conservation need, or those raising concerns for sustainability by the Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management. Based on scientific evidence, the future of a species is determined by its abundance, distribution, habitat quality, and reproduction and survival rates. SEC. 4. SUSTAINABLE POPULATIONS. Each Secretary must plan and manage planning areas to maintain sustainable populations of native and desired non-native species. Coordination is required for species populations that extend across multiple planning areas. If necessary, a Secretary can make decisions based on the best available science after public notice and comment. The Secretary must manage lands within planning areas to ensure the survival and health of native and non-native species populations. Activities within the planning area should not increase the risk of population extirpation. Compliance with land management plans and actions must be ensured by each Secretary. Activities within the planning area must comply with land management plans to ensure the maintenance of sustainable populations under the Secretary's jurisdiction. SEC. 5. MONITORING AND EVALUATION. Establishment of Monitoring Programs for native and non-native species populations is required for determining sustainability. Each Secretary must adopt a targeted monitoring program as part of land management planning to assess species status and trends. The program must include focal species representing ecological diversity, identify species-of-concern, and monitor habitats and population surveys. The monitoring program established by each Secretary must include population surveys of focal species, species-of-concern, and species not adequately assessed to evaluate population status and trends. Cooperation with state entities and other agencies is required for implementation. The monitoring program established by each Secretary must include population surveys of focal species, species-of-concern, and species not adequately assessed to evaluate population status and trends, in cooperation with State fish and wildlife agencies and other relevant entities. Each Secretary shall consider and utilize relevant population data maintained by Federal agencies, State agencies, tribes, or other entities. COORDINATION. Management Coordination involves coordinating the management of planning areas with the National Wildlife Refuge System, National Park System, other federal agencies, State fish and wildlife agencies, tribes, and non-governmental organizations to maintain sustainable populations of native and non-native species, address climate change impacts, establish habitat linkages, and reintroduce extirpated species when necessary. The management coordination involves consulting and coordinating with various stakeholders to maintain sustainable populations of native and non-native species in planning areas. This includes collaborating with federal, state, tribal, and local agencies, as well as developing conservation plans for fish, plants, and wildlife. Conservation plans for fish, plants, and wildlife and their habitats, including State comprehensive wildlife strategies and other State conservation strategies for species, National Fish Habitat partnerships, North American Wetland Conservation Joint Ventures, and the Federal-State-private partnership known as Partners in Flight. No Effect on National Wildlife Refuge or National Park Systems - does not impact laws or management standards for lands or species populations within the National Wildlife Refuge System or National Park System. SEC. 7. IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.\n\nEach Secretary must issue regulations implementing all provisions of America's Wildlife Heritage Act within one year of its enactment.\n\nSEC. 8. CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThis Act does not affect the authority of States to manage fish, plants, and wildlife, nor does it authorize a Secretary to control hunting or fishing within a State unless granted authority under other laws."
