The Congress finds that the productivity of the \"green revolution\" heavily relies on abundant, low-cost fossil fuels for fertilizer, herbicides, and mechanization, but this method is unsustainable as fossil fuels become scarce and costly. Energy efficiency is crucial for sustainable food production. Efficiency is essential for sustainable reliance on renewable resources at an affordable scale. Agriculture extension has demonstrated that showcasing viable techniques and technologies is effective for their adoption and promotion. The text chunk discusses definitions related to the topic. In this Act, an \"eligible entity\" includes regional, State, local, or tribal agencies, nonprofit organizations providing farm services, farms with at least 50% revenue from food or fiber sales on less than 160 acres, and institutions of higher education. An \"eligible entity\" includes regional, State, local, or tribal agencies, nonprofit organizations providing farm services, farms with at least 50% revenue from food or fiber sales on less than 160 acres, and institutions of higher education. Renewable energy refers to energy obtained sustainably. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. A \"self-powered farm\" is capable of independence from external sources for energy, fuel, and raw materials, serving as a community resource for food and energy. A self-powered farm minimizes operating expenditures for fossil fuel-derived energy, uses sustainable farming practices, and produces at least 2 times more energy than it consumes on-site and during product transportation. The Secretary will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to develop evaluation measures and criteria for programs promoting self-powered farms. Additionally, a report with recommendations and evaluations must be submitted to Congress within 12 months. The Secretary will establish a research and technology development program based on recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences for energy and other technologies to enhance energy efficiency and enable self-powered farms. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis to eligible entities or consortia, with encouragement for participation through the Agricultural Cooperative Extension System. Additionally, there will be State Agricultural Demonstration Program awards. The Secretary will establish a program for State agricultural research programs to demonstrate technologies for self-powered farms. Additionally, there will be loan programs available. The Secretary will provide low-cost revolving loans and loan guarantees on a competitive basis to eligible entities for energy technologies supporting self-powered farms. Preference will be given to applicants using biobased feedstocks or renewable energy sources. Oversight procedures will be established to monitor supported projects. The Secretary will provide low-cost revolving loans and loan guarantees to eligible entities for energy technologies supporting self-powered farms. The loan amount shall not exceed 80 percent of the project cost, and the guarantee amount shall not exceed 80 percent of the loan principal. SEC. 7. CONSULTATION. The Secretary will consult with the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 8. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REVIEW. The Secretary will arrange for a review by the National Academy of Sciences on the programs under this Act and provide recommendations for improvements. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Appropriations are authorized for the Secretary to carry out sections 4, 5, and 6 for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. SEC. 10. COST SHARING. SEC. 10. COST SHARING.
