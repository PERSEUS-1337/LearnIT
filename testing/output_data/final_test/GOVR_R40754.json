    "content": "The 111th Congress focused on the continued detention of alleged enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Enacted measures restricted the transfer or release of detainees, especially to the United States. The FY2011 NDAA imposed blanket restrictions on using military funds for transferring or releasing detainees into the US. The 111th Congress enacted measures restricting the transfer or release of Guantanamo Bay detainees, including limitations on transferring detainees to certain foreign countries to prevent them from returning to hostilities. The President was authorized to use force against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks, leading to the capture and detention of suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban members. The United States has detained suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban members at Guantanamo, with most detainees transferred to foreign governments. As of January 11, 2010, 173 detainees remain at the facility, with unresolved issues regarding repatriation, resettlement, and trials for criminal offenses in military or civilian courts. The Guantanamo detention facility has been controversial since its inception. President Obama aimed to close it by January 22, 2010, but the deadline was not met. The Obama Administration still intends to close the facility promptly. Military commission proceedings were temporarily halted by Executive Order 13492. The Guantanamo detention facility closure is a priority. Military commission proceedings have resumed for some detainees. Executive orders limit interrogation methods to those in the Army Field Manual and establish a Special Task Force on Detainee Disposition. The potential closure of the Guantanamo detention facility raises key issues such as detainee transfer, prosecution procedures, and funding complications in Congress. Legislation would be needed to make the President's policies permanent, as executive orders can be revoked or modified. Congress has the authority to reverse or adjust executive orders in relevant areas. Senator Dianne Feinstein highlighted the challenges in deciding what to do with remaining detainees when proposing a timeline for closure. The focus on closing Guantanamo involves deciding what to do with remaining detainees, with legislative activity centered on transfer, release, and treatment. Proposed transfers to the US, including for prosecution related to 9/11, have drawn attention. Plans to transfer detainees to a facility in Illinois were also discussed. The implementation of proposals to transfer Guantanamo detainees for continued detention was put on hold, with alternative approaches being developed. Several laws in the 111th Congress restrict the use of funds to transfer or release detainees into the United States. The 2011 NDAA includes a strict prohibition on using funds to transfer or release Guantanamo detainees into the United States. Other measures in the 111th Congress require the Executive to provide information on detainees. Continuing resolutions were passed to extend funding for federal agencies until the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 was signed into law on December 22, 2010. President Obama signed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-322) into law, extending funding for federal agencies at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011. Restrictions on Guantanamo detainees' transfer and release remain in place due to security concerns. Reporting requirements must be met before detainees can be transferred or released to foreign countries. The 2011 NDAA (P.L. 111-383) imposes significant restrictions on detainee transfers, prohibiting the use of funds for transfers to the US or its territories. The 2011 NDAA prohibits the transfer or release of detainees, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who are not US citizens or members of the US Armed Forces, held at Guantanamo Bay after January 20, 2009, to the US or its territories. It also bars the use of Department of Defense funds to assist in such transfers. The 2011 NDAA prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the US, despite previous measures allowing for transfers for criminal prosecution. Some argue that other federal agencies could still transfer detainees using their own funds, but Congress intended to prevent any transfers. The 2011 NDAA includes the most comprehensive restrictions on detainee transfer and release, with President Obama expressing opposition to limits on executive discretion in transferring detainees into the US or to certain foreign entities. President Obama criticized provisions in the 2011 NDAA that limit executive discretion in transferring detainees, stating they pose a challenge to critical executive authority in prosecuting Guantanamo detainees and interfere with foreign policy decisions. He did not claim these provisions were unconstitutional but expressed concern about their impact on executive power. President Obama expressed opposition to restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, stating his administration would work with Congress to seek repeal and mitigate their effects. Several measures prohibit the use of funds to release detainees into the US or specified territories, including the 2009 Supplemental Act and the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act. The 2011 NDAA prohibits the release of Guantanamo detainees into the US or its territories from October 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010. Seven measures in the 111th Congress restrict detainee transfers to the US. The 2011 NDAA also bars DOD appropriations for transferring detainees into the US for prosecution. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act required the President to submit a classified report to Congress 45 days prior to transferring Guantanamo detainees into the United States, detailing risks to national security, costs, legal rationale, and mitigation plans. The 2010 National Defense Authorization Act requires a detailed plan for detainee transfers, including notification to the Governor of the State, certification by the Attorney General, and justification of little to no security risk. This differs slightly from the reporting requirements in the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act, which focused on risks to national security, costs, legal rationale, and mitigation plans prior to transferring Guantanamo detainees into the United States. The 2010 National Defense Authorization Act mandates a classified report for detainee transfers to the United States, including risk assessment, detainee disposition proposal, security risk mitigation plan, transfer location, cost information, consultation with local jurisdiction's chief executive, and certification by the Attorney General. This report also involves consultation with the proposed location's chief executive as required by the 2010 NDAA. The 2010 National Defense Authorization Act requires a classified report for detainee transfers to the United States, including risk assessment, detainee disposition proposal, security risk mitigation plan, transfer location, cost information, and consultation with the chief executive of the proposed location. This involves a greater degree of involvement by state governors in detainee transfer decisions compared to previous legislation. The 2010 National Defense Authorization Act mandates a classified report for detainee transfers to the United States, including risk assessment, detainee disposition proposal, security risk mitigation plan, transfer location, cost information, legal rationale, notification to the Governor of the State, and assessment of national security risks. The 2009 Supplemental Act and subsequent NDAAs impose restrictions on transfers of Guantanamo detainees to the United States and its territories. The measures enacted during the 111th Congress require specific reporting requirements for funds used in detainee transfers to foreign states. The FY2010 appropriations acts restrict transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign states unless specific reporting requirements are met. The President must submit detainee information, security risk assessment, and transfer agreement terms in classified form 15 days before the proposed transfer. The 2009 Supplemental Act has a similar provision but does not specify its application. The 2011 NDAA imposes significant restrictions on transferring detainees to foreign countries, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense to Congress 30 days prior to transfer. The foreign government or entity must not sponsor terrorism, have effective control over detention facilities, be able to control the detainee, and agree to ensure their security. The 2011 NDAA imposes restrictions on transferring detainees to foreign countries, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense. The foreign government must not sponsor terrorism, have control over detention facilities, ensure detainee security, and share relevant information with the United States. There is a one-year prohibition on transfers if a former detainee engages in terrorism, but the Secretary of Defense can waive this with certification. The 2011 NDAA imposes restrictions on transferring detainees to foreign countries, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense. The prohibition does not apply if the transfer is ordered by a U.S. court. Several measures in the 111th Congress establish reporting requirements for Guantanamo detainees and the detention facility. Section 319 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 mandates the President to report on the Guantanamo \"prisoner population\" to Congress every 90 days. The 2011 NDAA imposes restrictions on transferring detainees to foreign countries, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense. Reports on Guantanamo detainees must include detainee information, justification for detention, measures taken for transfer, number of individuals released or transferred who returned to terrorist activities, and efforts by al Qaeda to recruit released detainees. Initial report due within 60 days of enactment, subsequent reports every 90 days. The 2011 NDAA imposes restrictions on transferring detainees to foreign countries, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense. Reports on Guantanamo detainees must include detainee information, justification for detention, measures taken for transfer, number of individuals released or transferred who returned to terrorist activities, and efforts by al Qaeda to recruit released detainees. Initial report due within 60 days of enactment, subsequent reports every 90 days. The curr_chunk focuses on screening detainees released and confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorist activities, assessing the adequacy of the screening process, and lessons learned from previous releases to reduce the risk of detainees returning to terrorist activities after release or transfer. Additionally, there are reporting requirements before the Executive can cease operations at the Guantanamo detention center. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 requires the Director of National Intelligence to inform congressional intelligence committees about disposition decisions and threat assessments for Guantanamo detainees within 45 days. The report must include information on detainees' legal status and decisions made by the Guantanamo Review Task Force. The 2011 NDAA mandates the Secretary of Defense to report to congressional defense committees by April 1, 2011, on the feasibility of using proposed facilities in the US to house Guantanamo detainees. The report must include rationale for facility selection, potential risks to the community, personnel and modifications needed, and legal issues. The 2011 NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to report on the feasibility of using proposed US facilities to house Guantanamo detainees, including rationale for facility selection, potential risks, personnel needs, modifications required, and legal issues. Restrictions on transferring and releasing detainees vary in scope and time frames, with different acts applying to funds appropriated by specific departments during certain fiscal years. The Appropriations Acts for FY2010 extended funding for federal agencies until March 4, 2011. Funding restrictions on Guantanamo detainees remain in effect until then. Different reporting requirements may apply concurrently for funds appropriated in FY2010. Later-enacted provisions are likely to be interpreted to avoid repealing earlier provisions. The Executive will submit reports fulfilling all applicable requirements to committees of jurisdiction. Restrictions on detainee transfer/release apply for the 2011 fiscal year and one year after the 2011 NDAA enactment. Other provisions in enacted measures may also impact Guantanamo detainees. Title XVIII of the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act establishes new procedures for military commissions, including prohibitions on evidence obtained through cruel treatment, changes in burden of proof for hearsay evidence, disclosure of exculpatory information, and procedures for classified evidence. Congress chose to preserve the military commission system despite proposals to abolish it. Section 1040 of the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act restricts foreign enemy belligerents captured outside the US from being read Miranda warnings. This legislation applies to members of the Armed Forces and officials of the Department of Defense or intelligence community, excluding the Department of Justice. The 2010 National Defense Authorization Act restricts foreign enemy belligerents captured outside the US from being read Miranda warnings. This provision applies to all foreign nationals detained abroad as enemy belligerents, not just those at Guantanamo, and excludes the Department of Justice. This means that agents of the DOJ could potentially read Miranda warnings to persons in military custody, especially if criminal charges are intended to be brought against a detainee in federal civilian court. The 2010 National Defense Authorization Act requires strategic intelligence interrogations of detainees in Department of Defense custody to be recorded. The FY2010 Homeland Security Appropriations Act includes provisions for including former detainees on the \"No Fly List\" unless certified as not a threat, and prohibits the use of funds for immigration purposes. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act prohibits using funds to provide immigration benefits to former Guantanamo detainees, including visas, admission, parole, refugee status, or asylum. This restriction is similar to other proposals in the 111th Congress but applies only to funds appropriated by that act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 also restricts using funds to provide immigration benefits to Guantanamo detainees. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to release intelligence on recidivism rates within 60 days of enactment. The 2011 NDAA prohibits funds for renovating or constructing facilities in the US for Guantanamo detainees. Various legislative proposals in the 111th Congress addressed detainee disposition. Some proposed closing the Guantanamo facility, while more recent legislation includes restrictions on funds for detainee immigration benefits. Intelligence on recidivism rates of detainees was required to be released within 60 days of enactment. The 2011 NDAA prohibits funds for renovating or constructing facilities in the US for Guantanamo detainees. Recent legislative proposals aimed to restrict detainee transfer or release into the US, impacting efforts to close the facility. Some proposals in the 111th Congress sought to extend restrictions on detainee transfers. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (H.R. 3082) would have barred funds for transferring Guantanamo detainees in FY2011. The 2011 NDAA and H.R. 5136 imposed restrictions on transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees, extending limitations from FY2010 appropriations. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 initially aimed to prevent transfers in FY2011 but was not included in the final resolution. The 2011 NDAA and H.R. 5136 imposed restrictions on transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees, extending limitations from FY2010 appropriations. S. 3454 introduced in the Senate aimed to extend restrictions on detainee transfers until December 31, 2011 and placed a one-year restriction on transferring detainees to specific countries with active al Qaeda presence. The 2011 NDAA and H.R. 5136 imposed restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees. S. 3454 aimed to extend restrictions on detainee transfers until December 31, 2011 and placed a one-year restriction on transferring detainees to specific countries with active al Qaeda presence. However, the version of the 2011 NDAA enacted into law did not contain these limitations. The House-passed H.R. 5822 would have barred funds from being used to renovate or construct a facility within the US to house Guantanamo detainees. The FY2011 defense authorization bill (H.R. 5136) included a reporting requirement on detainees' legal representation, but this provision was not enacted into law. The FY2011 defense authorization bill included provisions on detainee interrogation and treatment, with bills introduced in Congress addressing these issues. The House-passed version of H.R. 5136 aimed to prohibit the use of funds for violating certain interrogation rules, while other bills proposed conducting interrogations in accordance with U.S. Army standards. Legislation aimed to ensure that detainees in U.S. custody are interrogated according to the U.S. Army Field Manual. Some bills sought to restrict detainees' access to benefits and medical treatment, including making Guantanamo detainees ineligible for certain benefits and prohibiting medical care in facilities where military members are treated. H.R. 1042 and other bills raised legal concerns about withholding medical care for detainees and U.S. compliance with treaty obligations. Some bills aimed to restrict the Department of Justice's use of funds to prosecute Guantanamo detainees in criminal courts. The funding restriction in Article III courts and military commissions in the United States did not preclude the Department of Defense from prosecuting detainees. Bills like S. 2977 and H.R. 4556 aimed to prohibit the Department of Justice from using federal funds to prosecute non-citizen individuals suspected of involvement in the 9/11 attacks in Article III courts. H.R. 4588 proposed that Guantanamo detainees be tried only in military commissions, while other proposals sought to reaffirm executive authority to detain individuals. Several proposals aimed to reaffirm or extend executive authority to detain individuals associated with U.S. operations against Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other entities. S. 3707, the Terrorist Detention Review Reform Act, would have reaffirmed the President's authority to detain enemy belligerents until the end of hostilities. The bill also addressed jurisdiction and procedures for habeas corpus challenges. Another bill, the Protecting America's Communities Act (S. 1071), contained similar provisions. The Protecting America's Communities Act (S. 1071) and other related bills aimed to broaden the President's authority to detain enemy belligerents in post-9/11 military operations. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld addressed the President's authority to detain enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan but not in other locations. The bills expressly authorized detention of individuals captured outside the Afghan combat zone and granted exclusive jurisdiction over habeas challenges to the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia. The House resolutions, H.Res. 920, H.Res. 922, and H.Res. 923, aimed to provide greater congressional oversight by requesting relevant documents from the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President regarding Guantanamo detainees. These resolutions were part of efforts to stay habeas proceedings pending status review hearings by military judges, with a limited timeframe of 120 days for decisions unless extended for good cause. President Obama issued an executive order to close the Guantanamo detention facility within a year, but the deadline was not met due to congressional limitations on detainee transfers. Congress has shown strong opposition to releasing detainees into the US, even if they are not enemy belligerents. Congress was more open to transferring detainees for prosecution with a risk assessment until recently. The 111th Congress enacted legislation to prohibit the transfer of detainees to the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. This law ensures that the Guantanamo detention facility remains open and military tribunals are the only viable forum for trying detainees for criminal offenses. Legislation enacted in the 111th Congress, such as new military commission procedures, may significantly impact the treatment and disposition of Guantanamo detainees, informing future legislative debates on detainee rights."
