    "content": "On August 5, 2004, the United States signed the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with several countries. After a year of debate, Congress narrowly passed the implementing bill. The House approved it by a two-vote margin on July 28, 2005, followed by the Senate passing it (55-45). The agreement was implemented on a rolling basis as each country made changes to comply with its obligations. CAFTA-DR came into force with different countries at different times, with the last country, Costa Rica, joining on January 1, 2009. The Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) was signed on August 5, 2004, with Costa Rica joining on January 1, 2009. This report analyzes trade and investment trends since CAFTA-DR's implementation six years ago. Changes in rules like intellectual property rights and labor are difficult to measure. The focus is on trends in all countries, with minimal impact expected on the U.S. economy due to the size of CAFTA-DR countries and existing duty-free access to the U.S. market. The Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1983 to support stability in the Caribbean. CAFTA-DR, signed in 2004, builds on this by providing comprehensive, reciprocal, and permanent preferential access to stimulate economic growth and cooperation. CAFTA-DR promotes specialized co-production in assembly manufacturing between the United States and CAFTA-DR countries, increasing productivity and firm competitiveness. Tariff preferences help firms remain competitive with global producers, and U.S. exporters benefit from reduced trade barriers. U.S. exporters benefit from reduced trade barriers, including for intermediate goods in the supply chain model. FTA negotiations focus on market access and enhanced rules in various disciplines. Central American and Dominican perspectives aim to permanently reduce barriers to the U.S. market for duty-free access and lower-cost imports. Increased trade can boost long-term growth through market size and production specialization. The CAFTA-DR agreement aims to increase trade by reducing barriers and promoting market access. It benefits U.S. exporters by allowing duty-free access and lower-cost imports. However, challenges include concerns over negative effects on import-competing firms and competition with local agricultural production in CAFTA-DR countries. Transition periods and safeguards are in place to address these concerns. CAFTA-DR countries aim to diversify agricultural sectors and integrate rural economies with other sectors. Market access, rules of origin, and non-discrimination are key provisions of the agreement. Results of this transition have varied among the six countries involved. CAFTA-DR replaces and consolidates trade preferences previously granted under GSP, CBERA, and CBTPA. It involves the progressive elimination of customs duties, with sensitive products having delayed duty-free treatment. Duties on most U.S. exports were immediately eliminated, with some phased out over 10-20 years. Duty-free treatment for some products may not begin for seven years or more after the agreement takes effect. CAFTA-DR allows duty-free entry of non-textile and non-agricultural goods from CAFTA-DR countries to the United States. Safeguards are in place for certain agriculture and textile goods during the duty phaseout period. Antidumping and countervailing duties are not addressed in CAFTA-DR, allowing all trade remedy laws to be enforceable under the WTO. Apparel must adhere to a \"yarn forward rule,\" requiring yarn production and subsequent operations to be done in the United States or a CAFTA-DR country for duty-free treatment. In 2011, 82% of textile and apparel imports from CAFTA-DR countries entered the US duty-free. Exceptions include the \"cut and assemble\" rule allowing third country inputs, a de minimis rule for up to 10% third country content, and tariff preference levels for Nicaragua and Costa Rica. A \"short supply\" list permits third country materials when not available locally, and cumulation of inputs from the region is allowed with limitations. The CAFTA-DR agreement allows for the use of inputs from various countries in the region, with restrictions on Mexican yarns and fabrics for certain textile and apparel goods. Exceptions exist for hand-loomed fabric, folklore handicrafts, and other products. Average applied tariffs on agricultural goods in CAFTA-DR countries range from 7% to 23%, with most agricultural imports facing no tariffs in the United States. Tariff rate quotas were a pressing challenge for select products in all countries. The CAFTA-DR agreement addresses tariff rate quotas for agricultural products, with some products having up to 20 years for phase-out schedules. Most agricultural trade becomes duty-free except for specific items like sugar in the US, fresh potatoes and onions in Costa Rica, and white corn in other Central American countries. These goods will continue to have quotas increasing by 2% annually with no decrease in above-quota tariffs. The CAFTA-DR agreement eliminated tariffs on various U.S. farm exports to Central America, such as cotton, wheat, soybeans, fruits, vegetables, processed food, wine, and beef. Trade trends from 2000 to 2011 show a decrease in U.S. trade relative to other countries, an increase in trade with China and Mexico, and deeper integration within Central America. The integration of America trade has deepened, with the United States accounting for a smaller percentage of CAFTA-DR exports and imports by 2010. China's trade share increased, as did intra-Central America trade, reflecting efforts to enhance subregional integration. Costa Rican semiconductor exports drove the rise in exports to China. The CAFTA-DR agreement plays a supporting role in these evolving trade patterns. The Mexico-Central America Free Trade Agreement signed in 2011 deepened subregional integration, leading to a significant increase in trade over the past decade. CAFTA-DR reinforces regional integration with rules of origin that promote cumulation of production between Central American and Mexican producers using U.S. inputs, enhancing global competitiveness and production efficiency. The Mexico-Central America Free Trade Agreement signed in 2011 deepened subregional integration, leading to increased trade. New cumulation rules allow for U.S. duty-free treatment of imports assembled from inputs produced in Central America or Mexico, enhancing global competitiveness. Goods like integrated circuits, automobile parts, and apparel are produced using U.S. inputs and exported to the United States and Latin America. Fabric from the U.S., the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Guatemala is used in apparel production in CAFTA-DR countries, receiving duty-free treatment upon entering the U.S. The CAFTA-DR trade agreement has led to a shift in the region's trade towards global supply chain manufacturing for U.S. production and consumption. Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic have the highest technology content in their exports, while Guatemala and Nicaragua have the lowest. However, the potential benefits from technology-enhanced exports are uncertain, as CAFTA-DR countries need to increase productivity and adopt policies to become more globally competitive. The U.S.-CAFTA-DR trade agreement has resulted in a trade surplus for the U.S. with exports outpacing imports. U.S. demand plays a significant role in trade growth, with intra-industry trade being a key factor. The agreement has led to an increase in U.S. exports, especially for countries like Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic with high technology content in their exports. U.S. exports to CAFTA-DR countries have shown an upward trend, driven by the increase in refined petroleum products. Import trends from these countries have varied, with Costa Rica and Nicaragua showing the most growth, while the Dominican Republic experienced a decline. Most CAFTA-DR countries saw a similar trend in U.S. imports and exports between 2000 and 2011. Costa Rica and Nicaragua increased their share of U.S. imports, while the Dominican Republic saw a decline. Examining trade data at the product level reveals changes in trade composition among these countries, highlighting the potential benefits of trade liberalization. The value added of a country's exports increases by transitioning to nontraditional and high-tech products. U.S.-CAFTA-DR trade composition in 2000 and 2011 shows categories like apparel, machinery, agriculture, and medical equipment. U.S. exports structure remained stable with a notable rise in certain sectors. The structure of U.S. exports has not shifted dramatically, with a rise in petroleum products. U.S. imports have shifted from apparel to higher value-added manufactures. Costa Rica is a non-apparel, high tech exporter. Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua export low tech apparel. Guatemala exports agriculture and apparel. The Dominican Republic has diversified exports including medical manufactures, mining, apparel, and processed agricultural goods. From 2000 to 2011, U.S. exports of apparel, yarns, and fabrics declined from 33.4% to 12.4% of total exports to CAFTA-DR countries. The shift away from apparel towards yarn and fabric exports is notable. The decline in apparel exports from CAFTA-DR countries to the US is attributed to a shift towards more yarn and fabric production. Despite apparel still being a significant import sector, its share has decreased from 56.1% in 2000 to 30.4% in 2011. This decline is due to increased competition from low-cost producers in Asia, impacting major apparel producers like Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The apparel rules under CAFTA-DR aim to promote trade, but the region faces challenges from lower-wage countries. Despite preferential access under CAFTA-DR, Costa Rica has shifted from apparel to higher value-added goods, while Nicaragua is expanding apparel exports to the US due to tariff preferences and low wages. The Dominican Republic is transitioning away from apparel to focus on footwear, with a diversified export structure. U.S. exports of machinery and electrical goods have declined as a percentage of total exports but continue to grow in dollar terms. U.S. imports in this category have significantly increased, with Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic supplying more technology-intensive products. Costa Rica's economy has shifted towards more sophisticated manufacturing processes, including integrated circuits and medical equipment, for the U.S. market. The country has also developed related industries like specialized packaging for electronics. Nicaragua is transitioning to assembly-type manufacturing, focusing on wire harnesses for automobiles. Nicaragua is undergoing economic transformation with a focus on low-skilled assembly manufacturing, while Costa Rica has shifted towards more sophisticated manufacturing processes. U.S. import data for the Dominican Republic shows a decline in apparel imports but an increase in medical equipment and other manufactures, indicating a possible transition in economic production. The United States has seen strong growth in agricultural exports since CAFTA-DR, with cereals like corn, wheat, and rice leading the way. Agricultural exports from the CAFTA-DR region have increased significantly since the implementation of the FTA in 2011. Corn, wheat, and rice are the top cereals exported, while meat exports have tripled to $290 million. U.S. imports of agriculture from the region have also grown modestly. Costa Rica has shifted to value-added agriculture exports like pineapple, while the Dominican Republic has seen growth in sugar and tobacco exports. Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras have experienced slight increases in fruit, fish, and specialized coffee exports. The CAFTA-DR region has seen increases in fruit, fish, and specialized coffee exports, indicating a shift towards nontraditional exports. However, there are challenges in fully transitioning to nontraditional exports, requiring further structural reforms and support for the agriculture sector. There is a debate on the impact of CAFTA-DR on small agricultural producers, with potential benefits for rural development. Most households benefit from lower agricultural prices, leading to an increase in family income. Subsistence farmers who produce little for sale are less likely to be affected by market price changes. The tariff transition period aims to increase productivity for small agricultural producers affected by market price changes. Delaying necessary competitive adjustments, as seen in Mexico under NAFTA, can be detrimental. Costa Rica's support for domestic rice production may delay needed adjustments as U.S. rice tariff rate quotas phase out over 20 years. FTAs focus on both trade and investment. Foreign Trade Agreements (FTAs) are crucial for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) by providing stable access to markets and protecting investors. FDI plays a vital role in economic growth, especially in countries with low domestic savings rates. Despite varying trends among CAFTA-DR countries, the benefits of FDI generally outweigh the costs for developing nations. Trends in FDI among CAFTA-DR countries show the United States as the largest investor. FDI increased post-FTA, but varied in magnitude. Macroeconomic conditions also impact investment, with Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic leading in attracting new FDI due to stability, education, and productivity levels. Trade liberalization in small developing countries can lead to increased growth through higher productivity and other channels such as market size expansion, technology transfer, and more efficient resource use. Economists argue that trade can boost long-term growth rates by facilitating the growth of high-productivity plants and increasing investment. Trade liberalization in small developing countries can lead to increased growth through higher productivity, market size expansion, technology transfer, and more efficient resource use. Case studies show contradictory evidence on the impact of trade opening, raising questions on why trade benefits are more robust in some cases than others. CAFTA-DR countries exhibit varied responses to trade liberalization, with noticeable differences in trade and FDI trends. Productivity improvements are essential for the export model of development to succeed, requiring a mix of private sector initiatives and a supportive public sector role in creating a conducive business environment. Trade liberalization in small developing countries can lead to increased growth through higher productivity, market size expansion, technology transfer, and more efficient resource use. CAFTA-DR countries need a solid business environment to avoid being stuck in low-level manufacturing and agricultural production, competing with the poorest nations. Improving economic well-being requires macroeconomic stability, investment, and supportive policies for economic growth. Developing countries may benefit less from trade liberalization without policies that directly promote growth, such as private sector support, infrastructure development, education, and good governance. The fiscal commitment to infrastructure, education, and good governance has been lacking in CAFTA-DR countries, except for Costa Rica. Differences in export growth and FDI closely correlate with these variables. Maintaining macroeconomic stability is crucial for long-term growth and benefits from trade liberalization. CAFTA-DR countries have implemented reform agendas to support competitiveness and economic growth. The CAFTA-DR countries have implemented reform agendas to support economic growth and stability, with Costa Rica, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic showing above-average expansion. However, El Salvador and Nicaragua lag behind. These economies are heavily dependent on the U.S. economy and vulnerable to global shocks, such as fluctuations in commodity prices and the 2008-2009 recession. Since CAFTA-DR was proposed, new microeconomic indicators have been developed to analyze the regulatory environment for business, essential for assessing competitiveness in a U.S. free trade agreement. The World Bank's Doing Business Indicators measure a country's regulatory efficiency, accessibility, and implementation, crucial for evaluating economic competitiveness. The World Bank emphasizes the importance of good regulations in supporting small and medium-sized businesses for income growth and social inclusion. Despite some progress in regulatory reform, CAFTA-DR countries lag behind in improving the business environment compared to other developing nations. This could hinder the countries' ability to fully benefit from the FTA, potentially understating its impact. The World Bank has introduced a Logistics Performance Index (LPI) to evaluate a country's ability to trade efficiently. The LPI summarizes performance in customs efficiency, trade infrastructure, shipping competitiveness, logistics services, shipment tracking, and on-time delivery. This index helps identify supply-chain bottlenecks and assesses the time and cost burdens of import and export transactions. Costa Rica's performance in the composite LPI index for CAFTA-DR countries is summarized in Table 4. The rankings of composite LPI index for CAFTA-DR countries show Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras in the top half, while El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua are in the bottom half. Costa Rica outperforms the group in logistics capabilities, reflecting differences in economic development and political decisions. Many CAFTA-DR countries face governance issues, with regressive tax systems hindering development. Costa Rica's tax burden is twice that of Guatemala and higher than other countries except Nicaragua. Inadequate tax systems and bureaucratic inefficiencies in CAFTA-DR countries, except Nicaragua, contribute to high inequality levels. This leads to growing violence and crime, particularly related to drug trafficking, threatening societal stability. Weak government bureaucracies and corruption allow organized crime to operate with impunity, hindering development and business opportunities. The region's inability to address extreme violence and security violations incurs a significant cost, estimated at 7.5% to 8.0% of GDP, and perpetuates poverty and inequality. The national insecurity in CAFTA-DR countries, especially in the \"Northern Triangle,\" is linked to low levels of foreign direct investment (FDI). Business executives cite security concerns as a reason for shifting production from violence-prone countries to safer ones like Costa Rica. The Index of Economic Freedom, which reflects various indicators, shows that CAFTA-DR countries perform reasonably well in macroeconomic aspects. The CAFTA-DR countries perform well on macroeconomic and trade reform, but struggle with upholding property rights and addressing corruption. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index highlights the challenges of corruption in the region, hindering business conduct, investment attraction, development, and poverty reduction. Concerns over corruption are particularly noted for Honduras and Nicaragua by the United States Trade Representative. The CAFTA-DR agreement has enhanced trade partnerships in the region by providing incentives for liberalization and investment. Key features include transitioning to a reciprocal agreement, making tariff preferences permanent, and promoting institutional capacities to support trade and investment arrangements. The data suggests a long-term trend towards liberalization in trade and investment. The CAFTA-DR agreement has supported a long-term trend in the region towards trade and investment liberalization, leading to growth in U.S. exports, particularly in agriculture and manufactured goods. Challenges to the agreement include the need for deeper structural transformation in the region to fully realize its potential. The CAFTA-DR agreement aims to support productivity enhancements for global competitiveness, despite challenges in security and governance. Policy changes are crucial for the success of the trade arrangement, with a focus on enhancing trade facilitation to overcome obstacles in implementation. The effective implementation of the trade agreement, particularly regarding rules of origin for textile trade, has led to complaints. Issues include U.S. producers no longer supplying required materials, mismatched rules causing delays at borders, and confusion over customs procedures. This has resulted in delays at borders and importers sometimes opting to pay tariffs to meet production deadlines. Challenges in implementing the CAFTA-DR trade agreement include issues with U.S. customs procedures, customs modernization in CAFTA-DR countries, and the \"first come\" rule for tariff rate quotas. Assistance has been provided to prevent delays in U.S. exports, but further resources are needed for a smooth flow of goods. The agreement faces obstacles in areas such as intellectual property rights, sanitary regulations, and telecommunications, leading to operational challenges. The CAFTA-DR trade agreement presents operational challenges, with new issues arising over time. The trade data will show how well the countries utilize the agreement, potentially improving conditions for economic benefits. It is too early to judge the FTA, but early indicators suggest that policy decisions could enhance its effectiveness."
