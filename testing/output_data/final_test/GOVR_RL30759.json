    "content": "In the mid-1980s, the number of children in foster care increased, while adoptions remained static. Concern grew in the 1990s about children staying in foster care for long periods. The 105th Congress enacted the Adoption and Safe Families Act to prioritize child safety in welfare decisions and expedite legal procedures for adoption or permanent arrangements. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) was enacted in 1997 to prioritize child safety in welfare decisions and expedite legal procedures for adoption or permanent arrangements. All states have implemented laws to comply with ASFA, and the Department of Health and Human Services monitors state compliance with federal child welfare laws. Incentive payments are awarded to states for increasing foster child and special needs child adoptions. The report provides background information on the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) and references related actions after its enactment. President Clinton directed HHS to double foster child adoptions by 2002, resulting in the release of the Adoption 2002 report in February 1997. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) was enacted in November 1997 after being introduced as the Adoption Promotion Act and later renamed. President Clinton signed the bill into law after it was approved by the House and Senate. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) was signed into law by President Clinton on November 19, 1997. The law amended Title IV-B or IV-E of the Social Security Act, providing grants to states for child welfare activities totaling $7.6 billion for FY2004. States are required to make \"reasonable efforts\" to protect abused and neglected children, provide services to families, conduct hearings, and establish placement plans for each child. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) clarified federal policy to ensure safety for children in the child welfare system and expedite permanency for foster children. It aimed to promote adoption for children who cannot safely return home and established new procedural requirements to achieve these goals. The law was intended to save federal money by reducing the time children spend in foster care. The Adoption and Safe Families Act aimed to promote adoption for children who cannot safely return home and expedite permanency for foster children. It included financial incentives for states to increase adoptions, health insurance coverage for special needs adopted children, and continued eligibility for federal subsidies for special needs children. The law also reduced spending for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant to offset costs, with a net cost estimated at $40 million over five years. The Adoption and Safe Families Act prioritizes the health and safety of children in efforts to preserve or reunify families. States must make reasonable efforts to avoid foster care placement and return children home, with exceptions for serious offenses by parents. Most states have incorporated these exceptions into their laws. The federal law allows exceptions for efforts to preserve or reunify families if aggravated circumstances are present, defined by each state. Individual judges can use discretion to protect a child's health and safety, even if not specified in federal law. States can still make efforts to preserve or reunify families. States typically include federal law's aggravated circumstances in their definitions, with some adding additional factors like physical abuse or assault. In addition to federal law's aggravated circumstances, states also consider factors such as physical abuse, neglect, court discretion, abuse of another child, failure to comply with treatment plan, parent's location, previous removal for abuse, criminal convictions, violent crimes, substance abuse, and mental illness as reasons for child removal. Judicial findings of \"reasonable efforts\" must be documented on a case-by-case basis according to HHS regulations. The 1997 law requires states to conduct criminal background checks for all prospective foster or adoptive parents, denying approval to those with certain felony convictions. States can opt out of these provisions with approval from the Secretary of HHS or through state legislation. As of August 2004, three states had opted out. According to HHS, as of August 2004, three states (Idaho, Oklahoma, and Oregon) had opted out of criminal background checks for foster or adoptive parents. Six states opted out through a letter from their governors. Final regulations require states to document safety considerations for foster and adoptive families. ASFA also mandated states to develop standards for quality services in foster care. ASFA requires states to meet deadlines for child welfare cases, including permanency hearings and termination of parental rights. If family reunification is not required, a permanency hearing must be held within 30 days. States must make efforts to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan, which may include adoption or guardianship. ASFA requires states to make efforts to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan, which may include adoption, guardianship, or another permanent arrangement. States must obtain a judicial determination within specific timeframes to ensure reasonable efforts are made for adoption. Concurrent planning allows for efforts to preserve or reunify a family while also planning for adoption or guardianship. The Adoption and Safe Families Act promotes concurrent planning to save time if family restoration efforts fail. It also addresses interjurisdictional issues in adoption by requiring states to use cross-jurisdictional resources efficiently. Financial penalties were established for states that deny or delay adoptive placements outside the child's jurisdiction. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) amended to establish financial penalties for interjurisdictional adoption violations. HHS clarified regulations in 2002, and GAO conducted a study on adoption issues. Legislation in the 108th Congress aimed to improve interstate placements. ASFA also shortened the time for foster children to have a dispositional hearing to determine their future status. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) requires permanency hearings within 12 months of a child entering care, with goals including returning home, adoption, termination of parental rights, guardianship, placement with relatives, or another permanent living arrangement. States must justify selecting the last option with compelling reasons. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) requires permanency hearings within 12 months of a child entering care, with goals including returning home, adoption, termination of parental rights, guardianship, placement with relatives, or another permanent living arrangement. HHS regulations specify that the case plan for a child must be developed within 60 days of removal from home, with a focus on achieving a safe placement in a family-like setting close to the child's parents. States must ensure that the placement is consistent with the child's best interests and special needs. The 1997 law requires states to initiate termination of parental rights (TPR) proceedings for certain foster children, including those with siblings who have lost parental rights, been subjected to felony assault, or abandoned infants. Additionally, TPR proceedings must be initiated for children in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months. The 1997 law mandates states to start termination of parental rights (TPR) proceedings for specific foster children, such as those with siblings who have lost parental rights, been subjected to felony assault, or abandoned infants. States can opt out of initiating TPR if the child is with a relative, there is a compelling reason in the case plan, or necessary services have not been provided. HHS regulations require states to file the TPR petition by the child's 15th month in care, excluding trial home visits or runaway episodes from the count. If an exception applies, the 15-month TPR requirement does not need to be applied. The law allows exceptions to the 15-month TPR requirement for specific cases like abandoned children or parents convicted of certain felonies. States must initiate TPR proceedings within 60 days in these cases. Compelling reasons for not pursuing TPR include adoption not being the best option or lack of grounds for TPR. The law allows exceptions to the 15-month TPR requirement for specific cases like abandoned children or parents convicted of certain felonies. States must initiate TPR proceedings within 60 days in these cases. Compelling reasons for not pursuing TPR include adoption not being the best option or lack of grounds for TPR. Adoption may not be suitable as a permanency goal for the child in cases where there are international legal obligations, compelling foreign policy reasons, or if the child is an unaccompanied refugee minor. States must also seek and approve a qualified adoptive family concurrently with TPR proceedings. Compliance with TPR requirements varies based on when the child entered foster care. The General Accounting Office (GAO) published a report in 2002 on the effects of the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) on the child welfare system. The report highlighted that ASFA timeframe provisions helped child welfare agencies focus on finding permanent homes for children more quickly. Some states and agencies expressed concerns about the timeframes. The GAO study found that few states were using the fast track provision due to court-related issues like judges being reluctant to approve requests and scheduling difficulties. Some states reported using the fast track option in cases of infant abandonment or serious abuse. States are not required to collect data on fast track use. The GAO recommended that HHS review the feasibility of collecting data on state usage of the fast track and 15 of 22 provisions, including the number of children exempted and reasons for exemptions. Most states do not collect data on these provisions, and in cases where data was provided, more children were exempted than actually utilized the 15 of 22 provision. For example, in Oklahoma, over 1,000 TPRs were filed for children in care for 15 of 22 months, but nearly 3,000 children were exempted from the requirement. States provided various reasons for not requesting a TPR for children in care for 15 of 22 months. The GAO recommended that HHS review the feasibility of collecting data on state usage of the fast track and 15 of 22 provisions for TPR. States provided various reasons for not requesting a TPR for children in care for 15 of 22 months, including adoption not being a realistic option, TPR not being in the best interest of the child, parents needing more time to address problems, and court delays for hearings and appeals. Some states are not filing for TPR in a timely manner, and the appeals process for TPR decisions is seen as extremely lengthy, posing challenges to achieving permanency. Under Title IV-E, states receive federal funds for adoption assistance programs for special needs children. Adoptive parents may receive monthly subsidies for children meeting specific criteria. Medicaid coverage is provided for children eligible for federal adoption assistance. States have the option to provide Medicaid for special needs adopted children who do not meet federal income eligibility criteria. ASFA requires states to provide health insurance coverage to special needs adopted children for medical, mental health, or rehabilitative care, through Medicaid or a comparable program. All states are in compliance with this provision, with 46 states and the District of Columbia providing coverage through Medicaid, and the remaining four states through a fully state-funded program. States were also required to provide health coverage to special needs children for adoption incentive payments in FY2001 or FY2002. The Adoption and Safe Families Act requires states to provide health insurance coverage to special needs adopted children. States must comply with this provision to be approved for child welfare projects. The Act also ensures continued eligibility for federally subsidized adoption assistance in case of disruptions or parental death. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, originally set to expire in FY1998, was renamed and reauthorized through FY2006. The annual entitlement ceiling is $305 million with an additional $200 million in discretionary funds. The FY2004 appropriation was $404 million. The program requires states to provide family preservation, community-based family support, and time-limited services. The Adoption and Safe Families Act expanded the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to include time-limited family reunification services and adoption promotion and support services. States must justify spending less than 20% of funds on each category. Funds were commonly used for recruiting adoptive parents and post-adoption services. Allocation for adoption promotion and support increased from 15% to 20% from FY1999 to FY2002, while time-limited family reunification increased from 16% to 21%. Family support allocation decreased from 40% to 29% during the same period. The Adoption and Safe Families Act aimed to increase state accountability in child welfare programs by developing outcome measures and rating state performance. HHS published outcome measures in 1999 and issued annual reports from 1998 to 2001. The law also directed HHS to study and develop recommendations for a performance-based financial incentive system under Titles IV-B and IV-E. The Adoption and Safe Families Act aimed to increase state accountability in child welfare programs by developing outcome measures and rating state performance. HHS was required to submit progress reports to Congress within specific timeframes. Legislation in 1994 and 1997 authorized HHS to approve states for waivers and demonstration projects, with no specific goals mandated by federal law. The Adoption and Safe Families Act aimed to address barriers to adoption for foster children, parental substance abuse issues leading to foster care placement, and kinship care. Between 1996 and 2001, 25 demonstration project components were implemented in 17 states. The authorization for new waiver projects was extended through temporary reauthorizations of welfare reform programs. In November 2003, new proposals were solicited from states, and in September 2004, two new waiver projects were approved. The House-passed version of H.R. 4 in the 108th Congress aimed to amend and reauthorize waiver authority through FY2008, removing limits on project approvals and prohibiting HHS from imposing restrictions on waivers or demonstration projects. It also directed HHS to develop a streamlined process for project extensions and amendments, and required the agency to make evaluation reports available to interested parties. Additionally, the Adoption and Safe Families Act mandated a report to Congress on kinship care, with recommendations for policy in this area. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) established an adoption incentive program to increase foster child adoptions, with additional incentives for special needs children. The program, reauthorized in 2003, provides payments for adoptions of children under nine and separate incentives for older children. This program complements the adoption assistance program under Title IV-E, which offers subsidies to adoptive parents of special needs children. The Adoption and Safe Families Act established an adoption incentive program for foster child adoptions, with additional incentives for special needs children. The definition of \"special needs\" varies by state and may include age, ethnicity, or disability. Incentive payments were set at $4,000 for each foster child adoption above a base level and $6,000 for each special needs adoption. $20 million annually was allocated for these payments from FY1999 to FY2003, with adjustments to budget caps to ensure funding. The Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 reauthorized the adoption incentive program for foster child adoptions, providing additional incentives for special needs children. States receive credit for increased adoptions and extra payments for special needs adoptions. The Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 reauthorized the adoption incentive program for foster child adoptions, providing additional incentives for special needs children under age nine. A third incentive payment of $4,000 was created for adoptions of children age nine or older. States must exceed their baseline number of older child adoptions to earn these payments. The Act also reauthorized provisions for technical assistance to help increase adoptions or permanent placements for children. The Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 reauthorized the adoption incentive program for foster child adoptions, providing additional incentives for special needs children under age nine and creating a $4,000 payment for adoptions of children age nine or older. States exceeded expectations in early years, leading to additional appropriations above the $20 million authorized annually for adoption incentive payments. The Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 reauthorized the adoption incentive program for foster child adoptions, providing additional incentives for special needs children under age nine and creating a $4,000 payment for adoptions of children age nine or older. States exceeded expectations in early years, leading to additional appropriations above the $20 million authorized annually for adoption incentive payments. States use their incentive awards for various purposes, such as recruiting adoptive families, providing post-adoptive services, and funding one-time expenses like studies and legal services. The awards, although relatively small compared to overall child welfare budgets, allow states to be innovative and flexible in their use. The Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 reauthorized the adoption incentive program for foster child adoptions, providing additional incentives for special needs children under age nine and creating a $4,000 payment for adoptions of children age nine or older. States used their funds in innovative ways, but the incentives were not the primary motivator for improving adoption systems. Concerns included the perception that adoption is always the best plan, challenges for states with increased adoptions before ASFA, and the need for further changes in federal funding for child welfare. Additional provisions in the law included access to the Federal Parent Locator Service, eligibility for the independent living program, standby guardianship laws, and a statement of intent about \"reasonable\" parenting. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 required HHS to prepare a report on substance abuse and child welfare, submitted to Congress in April 1999. The law took effect in November 1997, with states given three months after their first legislative session to comply. ASFA led to changes in state and federal laws, but assessing its impact on the child welfare system has been challenging due to pre-existing adjustments and similar laws in some states. The enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) in 1997 has made it challenging to determine its specific impact on child welfare outcomes. The lack of comparable pre- and post-ASFA data limits the analysis of its effects. However, current data can still provide valuable information on the characteristics and experiences of the child welfare population post-ASFA. The number of public child welfare agency adoptions increased before ASFA but rose more sharply after its passage. The number of children in the public child welfare system rose significantly after the enactment of ASFA, with an increase from 31,000 in 1997 to over 52,500 in 2002. Data analysis also shows changes in adoption trends, with more children being adopted by relatives and shifts in the racial demographics of adoptions. The average age of children waiting for adoption also increased during the FY1998-FY2001 period. The average age of waiting children increased from 7.7 years to 8.4 years between FY1998 and FY2001. ASFA aimed to expedite legal proceedings for children in foster care, reducing the time from removal to termination of parental rights from 37 months to 30 months. However, the average time spent in foster care after TPR increased slightly from 22 months to 24 months during the same period. The average time spent in foster care after termination of parental rights increased slightly from 22 months in FY1998 to 24 months in FY2001. HHS reported on state performance in finalizing adoptions within 24 months, with 31 states meeting the national standard in FY1999 and 27 in FY2001. Child welfare agencies view ASFA requirements as good practice and continue to train staff on implementation. States have adjusted service delivery systems and practices to meet ASFA requirements, including improving data systems, working closely with courts, passing legislation, and hiring additional staff. Interviews with agency directors in 2000 found a focus on developing new casework strategies to promote child safety. ASFA had an impact on permanency by reducing time frames and implementing concurrent planning at the front end of child welfare. State administrators faced challenges such as providing substance abuse treatment within ASFA time frames, lack of adoptive placements for certain groups, backlogs in juvenile courts, and accountability for time frames dependent on other agencies. Local agencies saw a greater emphasis on child safety due to ASFA requirements. ASFA led to a greater emphasis on child safety for 60% of local agencies, shortened decision-making time frames to less than 12 months for 93% of agencies. Adoption emphasis increased for children in kinship care and older children. Most agencies reported no change in caseload numbers but spent more hours on each case. 33% of agencies expedited access to drug treatment for clients."
