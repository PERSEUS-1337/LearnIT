If the property is disposed of or no longer used as required, the taxpayer's tax for that year will be increased by a recapture percentage of the decrease in credits allowed in prior years. The recapture percentage for the taxpayer's leased property is determined according to a specific table.

Certain rules from section 50(a) also apply to this determination. Special rules apply for aggregation of taxpayers treated as a single entity under section 52. Reduction in basis rules apply to property eligible for the credit. No other deductions or credits are allowed under this chapter.
