The \"File Once FAFSA Act of 2016\" allows dependent students to submit a certification form instead of a FAFSA for subsequent academic years, confirming their dependent status and maintaining their expected family contribution. Adjustments to the expected family contribution may be made under certain circumstances. The applicant must submit a FAFSA for each academic year they seek financial assistance under this title, unless determined to be an independent student or submitting a certification form.

The Secretary will create a consumer-tested dependent student certification form that uses skip logic to bypass irrelevant fields. The form will only require necessary data elements to confirm the applicant's dependent student status and update contact information or school code. The form will also inquire about the applicant's enrollment in higher education for the upcoming academic year and whether their financial need has significantly changed since their last FAFSA submission or adjustment to expected family contribution. The term 'succeeding academic year' refers to any academic year following the one for which the applicant submits the FAFSA, based on the completion period of their first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study. The effective date for determining the expected family contribution of applicants for award year 2017-2018 and beyond is based on the completion period of their first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study."
