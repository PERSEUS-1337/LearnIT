The Act titled \"Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Sanctions Implementation and Review Act\" outlines findings by Congress regarding the IRGC's support for terrorist activities, including training proxy groups, insurgents, and terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran, identified as a state sponsor of terrorism, uses the IRGC to fund and carry out acts of terror. The Government of Iran engages in serious human rights violations, with the IRGC playing a significant role in these abuses. The IRGC dominates many sectors of the Iranian economy, controlling billions of dollars in various industries through affiliated firms and front companies. The IRGC controls Iran's economy through affiliated businesses and foundations, enriching its personnel through corruption. It supports Assad's regime in Syria with training, weapons, and funding. The US designated IRGC and Qods Force for proliferation and terrorism concerns. Title III of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012 imposed secondary sanctions on firms dealing with the IRGC and related entities. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran's nuclear program did not require the US to lift sanctions on the IRGC. On September 15, 2015, Adam Szubin stated that no sanctions relief would be provided to the IRGC or its affiliates. Strengthening sanctions against the IRGC and its affiliated entities, along with imposing secondary sanctions on firms assisting the IRGC, will help cut off resources for its activities. Modification of sanctions on persons supporting or conducting transactions with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps or other sanctioned individuals. The Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012 is amended to block transactions with foreign persons in the US or under US control.

The Comptroller General of the United States must annually report foreign persons linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps to the President and congressional committees.

The Comptroller General of the United States will report foreign persons associated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps to the President and congressional committees. Sources for the report include credible publications, databases, and information from government agencies, NGOs, and foreign entities. SEC. 5. REVIEW, SANCTIONS, AND REPORT BY PRESIDENT. The President must review foreign persons identified in a report to determine if there is enough evidence to impose sanctions. If there is sufficient evidence, the foreign person will be included on a list of specially designated nationals and sanctions will be imposed. The President will review foreign persons for potential sanctions under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012.
