If a State or territory becomes independent before the coins are minted, this subsection no longer applies to that State or territory.

The design for each coin is also chosen by the Secretary. The Secretary selects designs for $1 coins after consulting with the Governor, Commission of Fine Arts, and Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. The Secretary has the sole discretion to develop the process for selecting dignified designs for $1 coins, prohibiting frivolous or inappropriate designs, and excluding head and shoulders portraits or busts of any person. All $1 coins minted under this subsection are considered numismatic items. The Secretary may mint and issue $1 coins of selected designs in uncirculated and proof qualities. The issuance of coins under this subsection will end after honoring an innovator or pioneer from each State, the District of Columbia, and territory, and can only be resumed by an Act of Congress."
