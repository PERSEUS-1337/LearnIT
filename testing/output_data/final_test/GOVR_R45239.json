This review follows legislative proposals and executive orders addressing the federal role in pipeline permitting. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is reviewing its policies for certifying interstate natural gas pipelines in response to the rapid expansion of the U.S. pipeline network. This review provides an opportunity for stakeholders to express their views on gas pipeline development and could impact U.S. natural gas resource development, prices, and environmental impacts. The review follows legislative proposals and executive orders addressing the federal role in gas pipeline permitting. The report discusses recent executive orders and proposed legislation aimed at expediting federal approval of natural gas pipeline projects. It also highlights FERC's review of its policy statement for natural gas pipeline certification. The United States' supply of natural gas is increasing due to technological advancements, with shale gas projected to dominate by 2030, driving the expansion of pipeline infrastructure at the local level. The expansion of natural gas pipeline infrastructure is driven by the growth in U.S. shale gas, with over 300,000 miles of transmission pipelines already in place. A recent analysis projected the need for approximately 26,000 miles of new pipelines between 2018 and 2035, with potential capital expenditure ranging from $154 billion to $190 billion. Annual additions to pipeline mileage have been significant since 2004, as federal and state agencies approve new projects. Since 2004, there has been a significant increase in gas transmission pipeline construction, especially after the shale gas expansion in 2006-2008. Over 24,000 miles of pipeline have been built or planned for construction. Additional capacity has been created through pipeline conversions and flow reversals. FERC has the authority to issue certificates for interstate gas transportation projects under the Natural Gas Act of 1938. Companies building interstate natural gas pipelines must obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity from FERC. The regulatory process includes pre-filing procedures to improve project proposals and avoid issues during FERC certificate application review. The pre-filing process for pipeline projects involves specific activities by the developer to notify stakeholders and incorporate environmental mitigation measures. FERC staff also participate in public forums to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The pre-filing process for pipeline projects involves consulting stakeholders, government agencies, and holding public meetings. The developer then submits a final application to FERC, including details of the proposed pipeline, construction plans, and environmental reports to analyze potential impacts. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reviews applications for pipeline projects, considering environmental impacts, cultural resources, socioeconomics, and land use. Intervenors in FERC's proceedings have the right to file briefs, attend hearings, and appeal the commission's decisions. FERC exercises its pipeline certification authority in accordance with regulations and guidance. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reviews pipeline project applications based on its 1999 Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities. FERC considers market support, economic benefits, environmental impact, and safety issues in its decision-making process. FERC's certificate application review focuses mainly on environmental review, as required by NEPA. Federal agencies must assess and disclose potential environmental impacts before approving projects. CEQ regulations guide agencies in implementing NEPA procedures. FERC adopted CEQ regulations to include procedures relevant to its authority and integrate NEPA procedures into its decision-making process. CEQ regulations focus on EIS preparation but also allow for environmental assessments to determine the need for an EIS or FONSI. Agencies must identify actions with no significant environmental impact, which are exempt from EIS or EA preparation. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 designates FERC as the \"lead agency\" for coordinating NEPA compliance and all applicable Federal authorizations in reviewing pipeline projects. Agencies must determine if a proposal has significant impacts by analyzing direct, indirect, and cumulative effects. FERC is designated as the lead agency for coordinating NEPA compliance and Federal authorizations for pipeline projects. It involves obtaining input from cooperating agencies with expertise in environmental impacts. After completing environmental analysis and consultations, FERC issues a draft EIS with recommendations for approval or denial, starting a public comment period. After completing environmental analysis and consultations, FERC issues a draft EIS with recommendations for approval or denial, starting a public comment period of at least 45 days. FERC reviews comments, revises the draft EIS, and issues a final EIS with recommendations. A record of decision cannot be issued until at least 30 days after the final EIS is published, with no additional public comment opportunity. The commission may then approve or deny the pipeline certificate, stating terms and conditions of approval. A FERC certificate grants a developer authority to exercise eminent domain if conditions are met. It preempts state or local laws that duplicate federal regulations. The certificate allows developers to secure necessary rights-of-way for pipeline construction. The FERC certificate grants developers authority to exercise eminent domain and preempts state or local laws duplicating federal regulations. Developers must also secure federal authorizations for water crossings, permission to cross federal lands, and state approvals before proceeding with construction. If parties object to FERC's order, they can request a rehearing for reconsideration. The FERC certificate allows developers to exercise eminent domain and preempts state or local laws. A party can request a rehearing within 30 days of the final order, but FERC has no time limit to consider it. If approved, the pipeline project can proceed, and construction can start after meeting certificate conditions. Weekly status reports must be filed until construction is completed. Over the last decade, new interstate natural gas pipeline proposals have faced controversy, public scrutiny, delays, and litigation. Despite a 2018 report finding FERC generally followed regulations, some practices are still under scrutiny by policymakers. FERC must consider environmental impacts under NEPA for certificate proposals. Direct effects are easier to identify in pipeline projects. Indirect effects of a proposed gas pipeline, including upstream and downstream impacts, have presented challenges and controversies. Stakeholders argue that these impacts should include production-related emissions and environmental effects of natural gas usage. FERC has limited its review of certain impacts, claiming they are not reasonably foreseeable. In February 2017, a FERC commissioner argued for analyzing upstream environmental effects and downstream impacts of increased natural gas production. A recent legal challenge to the Sabal Trail pipeline in Florida required FERC to consider downstream carbon emissions. FERC's response stated that while downstream greenhouse gas emissions were quantified, their significance could not be determined. The majority's conclusion emphasized the need to quantify the significance of downstream greenhouse gas emissions. In a separate FERC order, it was stated that a broad analysis based on generalized assumptions does not provide meaningful information for project-specific reviews. Two commissioners dissented, arguing that the Commission should consider the effects of increased production and consumption from natural gas pipelines. FERC's review of a certificate application requires evaluating public benefits, including meeting demand, eliminating bottlenecks, accessing new supplies, lowering costs, and increasing competition. Market need is shown through contracts for at least 25% of capacity. Showing 10-year firm commitments for all capacity makes an applicant eligible for a traditional certificate. Some stakeholders question FERC's reliance on precedent agreements to prove market need for pipeline projects, especially when involving developer affiliates. FERC gives equal weight to contracts with affiliates and unrelated third parties, without investigating if customer commitments reflect genuine market demand. In 2018, a FERC commissioner dissented from approving a certificate due to a majority of the pipeline's capacity being associated with affiliates, which was deemed insufficient to demonstrate market need. In February 2018, FERC chairman raised concerns about the validity of affiliate agreements in demonstrating pipeline capacity demand. Some stakeholders criticize FERC's project-by-project evaluation approach for multiple pipelines in one region. Congress has urged FERC to consider multiple projects collectively, but FERC maintains it does not engage in regional planning exercises. In October 2017, one FERC commissioner dissented from approving two pipelines in Virginia, questioning the need for both projects due to their proximity. FERC has no statutory time limits for its certificate review process but can establish schedules for federal authorizations. Natural gas pipelines require permits from various agencies, and FERC operates under an interagency agreement for early coordination on pipeline certificate applications. FERC and cooperating agencies have an agreement for early coordination on gas pipeline certificate applications. The EPAct requires timely final decisions on certificates within 90 days of FERC's environmental document issuance. This was implemented to address delays in pipeline approvals due to lack of coordination. Pipeline developers have raised concerns about ineffective coordination between agencies and FERC during the review process. Cooperating federal agencies have not always coordinated effectively with FERC in reviewing certificate applications, leading to delays. Despite efforts to expedite the process, regulatory approvals for gas pipeline projects are taking longer. Congressional hearings have highlighted criticism and support for FERC's review process, with a goal of completing applications within 18 to 24 months. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has generally met a 24-month review deadline for larger pipeline projects, but there have been delays in some cases. Out of 43 pipeline projects, 4 were approved more than 24 months after filing. Additionally, there are two pending applications from late 2016 and two from 2015. Pre-filing time is not included in the figure, which can vary for different projects. FERC's review of certificate applications for major pipeline projects is complex and varied, with no clear trend in review periods. The lack of a quorum of FERC commissioners in 2017 further complicates the evaluation of review timing. Developer response times and challenges with state agencies add to the complexity of the process. FERC challenged New York's denial of water quality permits for a pipeline project due to excessive delay. However, FERC did not contest the state's denial for another project that met the one-year deadline. Changes in the U.S. natural gas sector over the past 20 years have impacted pipeline permit reviews, including concerns about greenhouse gas emissions. New considerations in pipeline permit review include concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater and seismic risks, pipeline safety, energy infrastructure security, and changing contractual relationships with customers. Regulators and operators are worried about the reliability of electricity supply in markets with constrained infrastructure due to the shift from coal to natural gas for power generation. Stakeholders suggest that FERC should update its certificate reviews to address these new considerations. The growth in U.S. natural gas production has led to increased exports of pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas. Some communities affected by pipeline development question FERC's application of the \"public convenience and necessity\" standard. Some analysts question if FERC evaluates pipelines for natural gas exports differently from those for domestic markets. The development of pipelines has been a focus of the last three presidents, with executive orders aimed at expediting infrastructure projects, including energy infrastructure. President George W. Bush issued E.O. 13212 in 2001 to expedite the review of energy-related projects, including natural gas pipelines. This led to an interagency agreement in 2002 for early coordination of pipeline certificate review, which is still in effect. FERC also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Corps in 2005 to streamline regulatory processes further. The Obama administration issued E.O. 13604 in 2012 to streamline regulatory processes for infrastructure projects. A Presidential Memorandum in 2013 expanded upon the order, directing the Steering Committee on Federal Infrastructure Permitting and Review Process Improvement. The Executive Order 13604 aimed to modernize Federal infrastructure review and permitting regulations to reduce decision-making time for projects, including pipelines. However, it is unclear if this led to changes in FERC certification for pipelines. None of the pipelines identified as \"of national or regional significance\" were natural gas pipelines. President Trump's order on January 24, 2017, aimed to expedite environmental reviews and approvals for infrastructure projects. The Executive Order 13604 aimed to modernize Federal infrastructure review and permitting regulations to reduce decision-making time for projects, including pipelines. President Trump's order on August 15, 2017, permits expedited procedures and deadlines for completion of environmental reviews and approvals for high priority infrastructure projects. The goal is to complete federal environmental reviews and permitting decisions for major projects within two years of application. The \"One Federal Decision\" framework streamlines the permit process for major infrastructure projects by assigning one lead federal agency to issue a Record of Decision. The FERC chairman signed a memorandum of understanding with other agencies to reduce the time for environmental reviews and authorization decisions to two years. FERC is already the lead agency for pipeline certificate environmental reviews. The FERC chairman signed a memorandum of understanding with other agencies to reduce the time for environmental reviews and authorization decisions to two years, aiming to improve the efficiency of the certification process for pipeline projects. Congress has frequently overseen FERC's certification of interstate natural gas pipelines and proposed legislation to change the review process. Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41) revised the process for federal approval of major infrastructure projects, requiring coordination of federal agency reviews and shortening the period for challenges to final decisions. Bills in the 111th-114th Congresses aimed to increase FERC public hearings, limit eminent domain authority, require regional project reviews, and impose deadlines on FERC and cooperating agencies. Infrastructure projects covered by FAST-41 require environmental review under NEPA and investment exceeding $200 million. As of June 2018, four natural gas pipeline projects were listed under FAST-41 with FERC as the lead agency. Some legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aim to change FERC's certification authority or review process for natural gas pipelines. These proposals include requirements for collective review of multiple pipelines in the same region, preparation of supplemental EISs, increased public meetings, and consideration of greenhouse gas emissions. Some proposals also suggest deadlines for permit review, enhanced cooperation and transparency among federal agencies, and the promotion of interagency coordination for pipeline review. The Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act (H.R. 2910) passed in the House on July 19, 2017, would require agencies to defer to FERC's approved scope for NEPA review. It also mandates FERC to decide on pipeline certificate applications within 90 days of completing NEPA review and requires concurrent review by cooperating federal agencies. FERC announced a review of its permitting policies for interstate natural gas pipelines on December 21, 2017, issuing a Notice of Inquiry on April 19, 2018. In 2018, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry to review its policies regarding natural gas pipeline proposals. The inquiry focuses on four aspects of certificate application review, seeking feedback on potential changes to the existing Policy Statement and the environmental analysis process. FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry in 2018 to review its policies on natural gas pipeline proposals, focusing on project alternatives, environmental effects, and the efficiency of certificate processes. The commission will not make decisions on further action until reviewing public comments. Any certification activities will follow the 1999 policy statement until changes are implemented. Congress has long been interested in natural gas pipeline development, particularly in siting and environmental impacts. Views on pipeline development vary, with some seeing economic and environmental benefits, while others are concerned about greenhouse gas emissions and risks to groundwater. Proponents advocate for more pipeline development, while opponents prefer less. Opponents of natural gas pipeline development prefer a greater policy emphasis on energy alternatives like renewable electricity generation. Congressional scrutiny of FERC's pipeline certification process has led to repeated attempts at intervention, with only the FAST Act becoming law. Congress must rely on FERC to address policy concerns regarding gas pipelines. Congress must rely on FERC to address policy concerns on its own volition in response to congressional oversight, federal court decisions, and public input. FERC's recent Notice of Inquiry covers key congressional concerns raised in the 115th Congress, such as greenhouse gas impacts, application review efficiency, and market need determination. While FERC's policy review may not guarantee changes to the gas pipeline certification process, it can provide valuable information for congressional oversight and potential legislative proposals based on informed findings. The recent executive and agency actions, including FERC's agreement with other agencies and its Notice of Inquiry (NOI), may lead to changes in FERC policies or processes related to gas pipeline regulation. However, these changes are limited to aspects falling within FERC's statutory authority under the Natural Gas Act or its discretion under other federal statutes. While potential legislative proposals and FERC's policy review could impact how FERC interprets or fulfills its obligations under NEPA, they would not amend NEPA itself or other federal statutes like the Clean Water Act or Clean Air Act that also affect gas pipeline siting approval."
