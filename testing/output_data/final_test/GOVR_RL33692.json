    "content": "The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) was established in 1951 by President Truman to address the nation's airlift needs during crises. The program is now managed by the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Transportation (DOT), with DOD's strategic airlift aircraft handling oversized cargo while CRAF carriers transport passengers and cargo pallets. Participants must be FAA-certified U.S. carriers meeting strict aviation regulations. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) requires carriers to commit a percentage of their passenger and cargo fleet, maintain crews for each aircraft, and undergo regular safety and performance evaluations by Air Mobility Command (AMC) analysts. The program has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. AMC and the FAA exchange information on contract carriers through liaison officers. The international segment of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) includes long-range and short-range sections, while the national segment consists of domestic and Alaskan sections. Aircraft are assigned based on requirements and performance characteristics. The long-range section uses commercial airliners for transoceanic operations, the short-range section uses medium-sized passenger and cargo aircraft for near offshore airlift, and the Alaskan section provides airlift within U.S. Pacific Command's area of responsibility. The domestic section supports increased DOD airlift requirements in the United States during emergencies, and the aeromedical evacuation segment assists in evacuating casualties from operational theaters to hospitals in the continental United States. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program utilizes kits to convert Boeing 767 passenger aircraft into air ambulances. Civil carriers commit aircraft to CRAF through International Airlift Services, with the government providing incentives and peacetime airlift business. In FY2007, DOD's guaranteed CRAF contract was $379 million, with additional business expected to total $2.1 billion. The Air Force awarded $2.2 billion in CRAF contracts in FY2005, and DOD awarded contracts worth $3.8 billion between FY1998 and FY2002. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program had contracts worth $3.8 billion between FY1998 and FY2002, with three stages of activation for tailoring an airlift force: Stage I for minor regional crises, Stage II for major theater war, and Stage III for national mobilization. The U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) commander, with approval of the Secretary of Defense, is the activation authority for all three stages of CRAF. When needed, the Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) can request activation of the appropriate CRAF stage. Each stage is used as necessary to provide civil augmentation airlift needed by DOD. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program has a response time of 24 to 48 hours for aircraft readiness after being assigned a mission by AMC. CRAF has been activated twice in its 57-year history, during Operations Desert Shield/Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. During these activations, CRAF airlines completed missions transporting passengers and cargo at a cost of $1.4 billion. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program has 35 carriers with 1,262 aircraft enrolled as of March 2008. It includes aircraft in international, national, and aeromedical evacuation segments. CRAF benefits both the DOD and the U.S. airline industry with its low cost compared to maintaining a larger fleet. As circumstances change, pressures and diverging interests may bring changes to CRAF. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program provides half of the nation's strategic airlift capability without the government needing to buy additional aircraft or pay personnel costs. While relatively inexpensive, commercial aircraft used in CRAF have operational limitations compared to DOD's organic airlift fleet, such as the inability to carry outsized cargo or support special operations forces. Commercial aircraft also face challenges in combat zones due to potential hostile fire. However, they offer longer range and efficiency in transporting passengers and cargo pallets. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program provides cost-effective strategic airlift capability by utilizing commercial aircraft, saving billions in acquisition and maintenance costs compared to military aircraft. During Operation Desert Storm, CRAF's minimal costs were highlighted, with DOD paying carriers about $1.5 billion, a fraction of the $15 to $50 billion cost of acquiring military aircraft. A RAND study also emphasized the cost-effectiveness of CRAF in providing substantial airlift capacity at a very small cost. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program has a significant airlift capacity at a low cost compared to military transports. Replacing CRAF's Stage II capability would have cost $1 billion annually, while Stage III would have cost $3 billion. DOD maintains excess airlift capacity for major crises, leading to routine costs even if not fully utilized. Increasing CRAF size may be more attractive than expanding the Air Force fleet. Commercial aircraft are increasingly used for everyday DOD needs. The growing use of commercial aircraft for everyday DOD needs is evident, with commercial airlines moving twice as many U.S. troops overseas in January 2005 compared to January 2004. Contracting with air carriers for wartime needs is cost-effective compared to purchasing additional Air Force cargo aircraft. However, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is not free and costs more once activated. RAND points out that the government has a financial incentive to use its own resources in a crisis rather than give additional business to CRAF carriers. The U.S. government contracts commercial airlines to transport federal employees, including DOD personnel, on official business. DOD also charters commercial aircraft for peacetime mobility needs and initiated a pilot program to use commercial air cargo carriers for delivering military supplies to Afghanistan and Iraq, aiming to save $9 million per month. The program aims to reduce flight costs by creating competition among carriers. The Air Force's mobility needs have increased post-9/11, leading to a trial program using commercial air carriers for military operations. Potential changes in DOD's strategic airlift requirements may impact the CRAF program. DOD periodically assesses its air mobility fleet and future airlift needs. General Arthur L. Lichte discussed these issues during congressional testimony. General Arthur L. Lichte highlighted changes post-MCS-2005, including increased ground forces and Army's Future Combat System growth. DOD reduced C-5 Galaxies upgrades, impacting strategic airlift capability shortfall. Current Air Force program falls short of 33.95 million ton miles/day requirement. The DOD's projected use of CRAF has increased from 12 MTM/D in the late 1980s to 20 MTM/D in 2005. Commercial aircraft committed to CRAF exceed DOD requirements, making shortfalls unlikely. Some suggest acquiring additional C-17s to meet potential airlift requirement shortfalls. General Norton A. Schwartz believes DOD needs a fleet of 111 C-5 aircraft. General Norton A. Schwartz believes DOD needs a fleet of 111 C-5s and 205 C-17s. The Air Force's FY2009 Unfunded Priority List included a request for 15 additional C-17s, but the Administration's budget did not allocate funds for new C-17s. Gen. Schwartz cautioned against overbuilding the organic airlift fleet, as it could impact the CRAF program and commercial partners. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a balance between the organic fleet and commercial capability. The Air Force's budget limitations make large-scale procurement of C-17s difficult. Some suggest a commercial version (BC-17) for the CRAF fleet, but the market's viability is uncertain. Boeing has received requests for proposals, with potential market interest in heavy industry. However, there are currently no orders for a commercial C-17 variant. Acquisition decisions for the KC-X tanker program may impact future DOD CRAF operations. The Air Force's budget constraints make large-scale C-17 procurement challenging. Suggestions for a commercial BC-17 for the CRAF fleet face market uncertainty. Boeing has proposals for a commercial C-17 variant, but no orders yet. The KC-X tanker program's acquisition decisions could affect future DOD CRAF operations, potentially reducing the need for commercial airlift. The Air Force relies on the CRAF program for airlift demand surges. Northrop Grumman won the $12.1 billion KC-X contract for 68 KC-45s. Boeing protested the decision to the GAO. Major passenger and cargo carriers participate in CRAF, showing broad support. U.S. air carriers value and want to participate in CRAF, as seen in the growth of participation over the last 10 years. Rising fuel prices pose a threat to the commercial airline industry, leading to discussions about the benefit of CRAF for the sector. Economic conditions may pressure the DOD to use more commercial airlift to support the private sector. Proposed changes to FAA regulations could increase foreign investment in U.S. airlines participating in CRAF, sparking debate over foreign influence in the U.S. economy. The FY2008 NDAA included provisions affecting the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, such as a comprehensive assessment and extension of the Aviation Insurance Program (AIP) authorization. This legislation raised concerns about foreign corporations gaining influence in the U.S. defense sector. The FY2008 NDAA included provisions for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, extending the Aviation Insurance Program (AIP) until December 30, 2013. A DOD study was called for to assess the impact of CRAF on airlift fleet requirements, expected to be completed by January 2009. This study is crucial for informing force structure decisions regarding the optimal mix of DOD's air mobility fleets and the CRAF. The FY2008 NDAA included provisions for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, extending the Aviation Insurance Program (AIP) until December 30, 2013. Section 356 of the FY2008 NDAA required an independent assessment of the viability of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to be conducted by a federally-funded research and development center selected by the Secretary of Defense. The assessment required by subsection (a) shall include an evaluation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, focusing on increased use of commercial assets for Department of Defense transportation post-9/11, charter air carrier participation, and any limitations on carrier income under contracts with the Secretary of Defense. The assessment required by subsection (a) includes evaluating the viability of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet in response to increased demand by the Department of Defense during contingency operations. It also involves comparing the fleet's current viability with projections for 5, 10, and 15 years after the enactment of the Act. The assessment includes evaluating the viability of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet during contingency operations, examining barriers such as operational planning, reward system, affordability of Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, impact on US air carriers, foreign ownership, and increased operational costs. The assessment evaluates the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, including operational costs, policy initiatives, and limitations imposed by the Secretary of Defense. Recommendations for program improvement will be submitted to Congress by April 1, 2008. The Secretary of Defense is required to conduct a study on the size and mix of airlift forces to meet the National Military Strategy for specific timeframes. The Comptroller General will review the assessment report within 90 days of submission. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to conduct a study on the lifecycle costs of various aircraft models and the feasibility of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet during activation stages. A federally funded research and development center will be selected to carry out the study, and a study plan will be developed and submitted to relevant committees within 60 days. The Comptroller General will review the study plan for completeness, objectivity, flaws, and weaknesses in scope or methodology. Recommendations for improvements will be submitted to the Secretary and the center within 30 days. The center will modify the study plan based on recommendations and submit a report on modifications to the Secretary and congressional defense committees within 45 days. The report will detail each modification and provide reasons for not incorporating recommendations. Elements of Study Plan- The study plan required shall address lift requirements for airlift aircraft to meet the National Military Strategy, including assumptions on combat missions, force structure growth, Future Combat Systems deployment, KC(X) aircraft capabilities, Civil Reserve Air Fleet assets, and Global Rebasing Initiative. The study plan will evaluate air mobility requirements for the Global Rebasing Initiative, peacekeeping missions, homeland defense, and Civil Reserve Air Fleet capabilities. It will also assess the current airlift fleet of the Air Force, including the impact of increased aircraft usage on service life. The study will assess the impact of ongoing operations on the service life of the aircraft fleet, evaluate the adequacy of the current airlift force, and determine the optimal mix of C-5 and C-17 aircraft for the Air Force's strategic airlift fleet. This includes analyzing the cost-effectiveness of modernizing C-5 aircraft versus procuring additional C-17 aircraft, as well as assessing military capability, operational availability, usefulness, and service life of both aircraft types. The study will assess availability rates, departure rates, and mission capable rates after completion of Avionics Modernization Program and Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program. It will also analyze fleet inventory levels that could impact Civil Reserve Air Fleet participants and provide lessons learned from restarting C-5 aircraft production. The Department of Defense should analyze the costs and methods of closing and reopening production lines for aircraft, including the C-17. This assessment should consider workforce, facilities, suppliers, and maintenance options. Additionally, they should evaluate the military capability and cost-effectiveness of intra-theater airlift aircraft. The Department of Defense should analyze the costs and methods of closing and reopening production lines for aircraft, including the C-17, considering workforce, facilities, suppliers, and maintenance options. They should also evaluate the military capability and cost-effectiveness of intra-theater airlift aircraft, comparing the Joint Cargo Aircraft, C-130J, C-130E/H refurbishment, and C-17 procurement for meeting airlift requirements. The analysis should include assumptions, sensitivity analysis, data, and cost comparisons for an optimally mixed fleet of airlift aircraft. The study required shall utilize previous mobility capabilities studies, intra-theater airlift fleet analysis, lift capabilities study, and joint future theater airlift analysis. Collaboration with US Transportation Command and Cost Analysis Improvement Group is essential for the study. The Transportation Command will collaborate with the Cost Analysis Improvement Group of the Department of Defense for the study required by subsection (a). A report on the study must be submitted by January 10, 2009, in unclassified form with a classified annex."
