    "content": "The \"Hydrogen Future Act of 1993\" is the short title of this Act, which includes findings, purpose, and definitions. The Congress finds that fossil fuels, the main energy source, are limited and polluting, while hydrogen holds promise as a cleaner energy source despite current production efficiency challenges. An aggressive, multiyear research initiative on efficient hydrogen fuel production is needed due to the inadequate current federal effort. A $100,000,000 annual authorization is justified to accelerate research and enable the commercial introduction of hydrogen into the energy system to support economic growth and reduce emissions. The Act aims to support economic growth, reduce emissions, improve fuel efficiency, and promote the development of hydrogen technologies for new markets and jobs. It seeks to establish a scientific basis for commercial hydrogen production by 1998 on a national scale. The term \"United States\" includes several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, and other U.S. territories. The term \"United States company\" refers to a business entity incorporated and operating in the U.S. The Secretary will consult with the Department of Energy's Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel in implementing the Act. Research and development activities will also be conducted. The Secretary will support research and development in industrial hydrogen energy production and use, including areas like photoconversion, coal gasification, bioconversion, water-cracking, fuel cell power plants, and stationary applications. The Secretary will support research and development in various areas related to hydrogen energy production and use, including economically feasible motor vehicles, zero-emission engines, electricity generation, heating and cooling, and stationary power generation using hydrogen as a fuel source. Within 90 days of enactment, proposals for carrying out these projects will be solicited. The Secretary will solicit proposals for research, development, and demonstration activities related to hydrogen energy production and use. Financial assistance will be awarded to U.S. companies or consortia for these activities within 1 year of enactment. Awards may be made separately for different areas described in the subsections. The Secretary may conduct research, development, and demonstration activities using various procedures and agreements authorized by applicable laws. This includes contracts, cooperative agreements, grants, joint ventures, and other forms of agreements. The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 applies to consortia supported under this Act. The Secretary requires at least 50% of research project costs to be provided from non-Federal sources, with 50% of the non-Federal share to be provided by U.S. companies. SEC. 5 allows up to 5% of funds from section 4 to be used for research on highly innovative energy technologies. SEC. 6 promotes technology transfer among industry, academia, and the government for hydrogen production and use. SEC. 7 focuses on protecting information and patents. SEC. 7 of the Act focuses on protecting information and patents for United States companies by applying the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act. Within 18 months of enactment, the Secretary must report to Congress on the progress of hydrogen research programs, suggest improvements, and propose any necessary legislation. The report will also analyze Department of Defense programs related to hydrogen power for coordination with the programs established by this Act. The Secretary must report to Congress within 18 months on hydrogen research programs, including Department of Defense programs, for coordination with programs under this Act. NASA programs involving hydrogen-based power will also be analyzed for cooperation. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 under this Act is set at $100,000,000 annually, with 60 percent allocated for section 4(a) activities and 40 percent for section 4(b) activities. Additionally, for fiscal years 1994 and 1995, funding for subtitle A of title XIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is set at 175 percent of the previous year's amount authorized under this Act. For fiscal years 1996 to 1998, the amount authorized for appropriations for subtitle A of title XIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 increases annually, starting at 150 percent of the previous year's amount in 1996, then 125 percent in 1997, and finally 100 percent in 1998."
