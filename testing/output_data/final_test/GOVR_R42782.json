    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund discretionary spending for federal government agencies. If regular appropriations are not enacted by the start of the fiscal year, continuing resolutions (CRs) may be used to provide funding. In FY2013, H.J.Res. 117 was enacted as a CR, providing funds from October 1, 2012, through March 27, 2013. This CR was later superseded by P.L. 113-6 on March 26, 2013. In FY2013, a continuing resolution (CR) was enacted on September 28, 2012, covering the remaining regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills, with seven passed by the House and none by the Senate before the fiscal year began. In FY2013, a continuing resolution (CR) was enacted on September 28, 2012, providing funding through March 27, 2013. P.L. 113-6 included five regular appropriations acts, while the remaining seven were funded through continuing appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee reported 11 out of 12 regular appropriations bills before the fiscal year began. The House Appropriations Committee reported 11 out of 12 regular appropriations bills before the fiscal year began, with seven bills passed by the House prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported 11 regular appropriations bills, with Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (S. 2322) and Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (S. 2323) being the first bills reported. The Department of Defense (H.R. 5856) and Legislative Branch (H.R. 5882) Appropriations bills were the last bills reported. The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill was not reported. The full Senate had not considered any of the reported regular appropriations bills. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933) was introduced on March 4, 2013. It passed the House on March 6, 2013, and the Senate on March 20, 2013, after additional regular appropriations acts were added. The House agreed to the Senate amendments on March 21, 2013, and H.R. 933 was enacted on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). H.R. 933 was enacted on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), containing texts of five regular appropriations acts. Remaining appropriations bills for FY2013 were funded through continuing appropriations in Division F. H.J.Res. 117, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2013, was introduced on September 10, 2012. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2013, H.J.Res. 117, was introduced on September 10, 2012. It passed the House on September 13 and the Senate on September 22, before being signed into law by President Obama. The House passed the full-year CR for FY2013 on March 6, 2013, by a vote of 267-151. In the Senate, cloture on the motion to proceed was filed on March 12, but the Senate agreed to the motion by unanimous consent on March 13. Senator Reid offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute on March 13. On March 14, cloture was invoked on S.Amdt. 26 and the underlying bill. A unanimous consent agreement on March 20 led to the passage of H.R. 933 by the Senate and House. President Obama signed the full-year CR into law on March 26, 2013, detailing the components of the FY2013 continuing resolutions. The part-year CR for FY2013 covered all 12 regular appropriations bills by providing budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2012 by previous appropriations acts. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended by subsequent acts, also played a role in the funding process. The part-year CR for FY2013 provided budget authority for projects exempt from annual limits on discretionary spending established by the BCA and the America Taxpayer Relief Act. This included budget authority for \"Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism,\" \"continuing disability reviews and redeterminations,\" \"health care fraud abuse control,\" and \"disaster relief.\" The CR extended provisions from FY2012 acts, maintaining limits on agency authorities. The FY2012 full-year CR provided budget authority for projects funded in FY2012, aiming to protect Congress's authority in annual funding decisions. It covered seven regular appropriations bills and referenced specific acts for funding allocations. The FY2012 full-year CR provided budget authority for projects funded in FY2012, covering seven regular appropriations bills and referencing specific acts for funding allocations, including the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2012. The FY2012 full-year CR provided budget authority for projects funded in FY2012, covering seven regular appropriations bills and referencing specific acts for funding allocations. The FY2013 part-year CR funded activities from October 1, 2012, through March 27, 2013, with the possibility of being superseded by a regular appropriations act or CR before March 27. The funding provided by the second CR (Division F) is effective for a full fiscal year\u2014October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013\u2014replacing the funding rate and directions provided in the part-year CR with amounts for the entire fiscal year both by reference and through anomalies. Annual budget authority provided by this CR expires at the end of the fiscal year, but projects and activities funded in the referenced FY2012 appropriations acts with multi-year or no year budget authority maintain a comparable period of availability for the new FY2013 funds. The full-year CR also provides funds for discretionary accounts that received advance appropriations for FY2013 or FY2014 in the referenced FY2012 appropriations acts. Continuing resolutions fund projects and activities using a formula to provide budget authority at a restricted level. They may provide specific amounts for projects and activities in the text of the act or by reference, typically associated with full-year CRs. The part-year CR for FY2013 provides budget authority for projects and activities funded in the previous year's appropriations acts at the same rate. The FY2012 appropriations acts referenced in the CR provided budget authority for projects and activities for a maximum of 178 days. Some projects received an across-the-board increase of less than 1%, excluding certain appropriations like OCO/GWT and those designated under P.L. 112-77. The CR also modified the formula for extending funds for Section 251(b) of the BBEDCA. The CR extends funding for FY2012 budget authority designated for OCO/GWOT at the rate in the President's FY2013 budget request, resulting in lower annualized funding levels. It does not extend funding for some appropriations designated for disaster relief. The full-year CR funds projects and activities for FY2013 at the same amount as FY2012, including transfers and obligation limitations. No rescissions or cancellations of funds are included. The part-year CR extends funding for covered projects and activities at the levels provided by P.L. 113-6, without any rescissions or cancellations. Anomalies in the CR may affect funding levels for specific activities, such as the 'Department of Agriculture\u2014Domestic Food Programs\u2014Food and Nutrition Service\u2014Commodity Assistance Program.' The CR provided funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program at $253,952,000, with $186,935,000 allocated for the program. Anomalies in the CR included funding for the Presidential Inauguration, which was not budgeted for in FY2012 appropriations. The CR extended expiring statutory authorities, including the authority provided by Section 801 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. Extensions of statutory authorities in the CR were in effect through March 27, 2013. The full-year CR included anomalies relating to the amount and purpose of funds provided, as well as anomalies that extend expiring statutory authorities. Extensions of statutory authorities are currently in effect. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the annualized amount of discretionary spending for FY2013 using two different measures: \"total regular appropriations\" and \"total spending.\" The total amount of annualized budget authority for regular appropriations in the part-year CR was $1.047 trillion, an increase of $4.001 billion from FY2012. When spending designated under Section 251(b) of the BBEDCA for OCO/GWOT, continuing disability reviews, health care fraud abuse control, or disaster relief was included, the total CBO-estimated amount of annualized budget authority in the CR was $1.154 trillion. The total amount of annualized budget authority in the CR for FY2013 was $1.154 trillion, a decrease of $26.665 billion from FY2012. The total regular appropriations amount remained the same as FY2012 at $1.043 trillion. When including spending designated for OCO/GWOT, continuing disability reviews, health care fraud abuse control, or disaster relief, the total spending amount increased to $1.196 trillion, an increase of $15.134 billion from FY2012. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 addresses certain spending areas. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aims to prevent exceeding FY2013 discretionary spending limits by implementing across-the-board rescissions for nonsecurity and security budget authority. OMB increased the rescission percentages to 0.2% for nonsecurity and 0.032% for security budget authority after calculating that the limits would be exceeded. The first continuing resolution added new reporting requirements for certain departments and agencies, including the submission of a spending plan to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Reports were to cover spending from the start of the fiscal year through March 27, 2013, and to be submitted within 30 days of any sequestration order by the President. The President required departments and agencies to submit updated operating plans reflecting funding adjustments due to sequestration and any extension of the CR's expiration date. The OMB director had to submit monthly reports to Congress on obligations incurred, comparing them to FY2012. The full-year CR maintained reporting requirements from P.L. 112-175 with some technical changes. The operating plan for specified agencies must consider sequestration under Section 251A of the BBEDCA and be submitted by April 26, 2013. Monthly reports from the OMB Director are due from May 15, 2013, to November 1, 2013."
