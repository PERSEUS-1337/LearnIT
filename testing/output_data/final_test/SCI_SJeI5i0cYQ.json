    "content": "The framework presented enables ordering image patches for analysis of dataset relationship to learnability in a classification task using CNN. Smart shuffling of patches can expedite training by exposing important features early on. Experimental evidence shows that CNN's generalization does not correlate with human recognizable features in training samples. Spatial locality of features within samples does not affect generalization, and ordering image regions using mutual information measure can expedite convergence with similar performance. Advances in Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks have significantly improved computer vision tasks. The training process involves successive feature extraction and abstract representation of training data using convolution operations. Ordering image regions based on mutual information between adjacent patches can accelerate CNN convergence during training. The training process utilizes backpropagation algorithm with supervision and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize error deviation from true labels. The theoretical characterization of deep learning and CNNs is still in its early stages, with research focusing on understanding the number of layers needed for optimal performance. Deep learning's success has led to various research avenues exploring deep network generalization performance, with a promising theoretical characterization using an information theoretic view of feature extraction. The characterization of deep learning through an information theoretic view focuses on efficient feature extraction using the information bottleneck method. Deep learning is modeled as representation learning, with each layer of a neural network containing summary statistics that retain relevant information from the training set. This approach aims to maximize the information related to the target output while minimizing irrelevant details. The information theoretic view of deep learning focuses on efficient feature extraction using the information bottleneck method. It aims to capture relevant information in the input variables that describe the output variable. This leads to the question of how to obtain good feature representations in supervised learning. In supervised learning for image classification tasks, a training set is constructed with human labeling to enable good prediction of the label BID9. The ability of CNNs to learn from 'scrambled' samples was investigated in BID6, showing they can easily fit training sets containing such samples. Results show that CNNs can fit training sets with samples unrelated to labels, challenging the traditional view of feature hierarchy. Information theory is used to improve feature extraction in CNNs, reducing convergence time. Human recognizable features matching labels are not necessary for CNNs to generalize well. Our approach utilizes similarity and information theoretic measures to preprocess and extract features from images during training. We provide a framework and algorithms for reordering image patches to minimize entropy and improve convergence. Ranking samples based on the relationship between adjacent patches also accelerates convergence compared to traditional methods. Our approach involves reordering image patches to improve convergence, utilizing the Inception architecture for evaluation. Adams optimization with cross-entropy loss is used for training, validation, and testing. Experimental results show faster convergence compared to standard training methods. The success of CNNs lies in their ability to automatically learn feature extractors and construct a hierarchy of feature representations. The learnability of a classification task is closely related to the amount of information in the dataset that enables distinguishability of classes. Techniques were developed and experiments conducted to explore this claim, with results summarized in section 4. The results in section 4 summarize how ordering at a sample level can expedite training by exposing important features for class separation early on. For example, in Fig. 1, a person classifying two images can quickly identify patterns in one image but may take more time to ensure all digits are present in the other. This time cost is of interest in the study. Ordering patches of training images to be 'closer' to each other by similarity measure could expedite training and improve generalization. This process can be justified by the fact that images are easier to classify when features are captured in order. Convolution-based feature extractors use a similar concept to distinguish classes by scanning input images with convolution filters. The features are extracted by scanning the input image using convolution filters and constructing a feature map. Implementation in deep learning frameworks maintains spatial locations of features for deconvolution. The feature map encodes both the feature and its location on the input image. Encoding of location is necessary for detection and localization tasks. The work of Tishby and Zaslavsky (2015) relates deep learning training to the Information Bottleneck principle. Techniques were developed to reconstruct training images by breaking them into patches and using information theory-based measures for ranking. Standalone measures were used to characterize patches, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio. The curr_chunk discusses various similarity measures for comparing patches, including L1-norm, L2-norm, Structural Similarity, Joint Entropy, KL-Divergence, and Mutual Information. These measures are used to quantify information content and uncertainty in a distribution. The curr_chunk explains how information theoretic measures, such as entropy, can be applied to image processing and computer vision. It defines Shannon entropy as a measure of information content in a discrete random variable. This measure can be extended to analyze images as realizations of random variables, assuming each pixel is an independent and identically distributed random variable. The model assumes each pixel is an independent random variable. Entropies are expressed with sums for discrete images. Probability distribution is obtained by binning pixel values into histograms. Normalized histogram estimates pixel intensity probabilities. Image entropy is computed using the model. Patch ordering is illustrated in the figure. Training set comprises input values. The training set includes input values and desired output values. Entropy measures like joint entropy, kl-divergence, and mutual information are used for image analysis. Joint entropy is calculated by creating a joint histogram between two images, and mutual information measures the relationship between random variables. Mutual information (MI) is a measure of statistical dependency between random variables. It can be defined in terms of individual entropies and joint entropy. Maximizing MI between patches helps find complex overlapping regions by minimizing joint entropy. MI is successful in various application domains. K-L Divergence is another measure used to assess patch similarity within a sample. The distance between two pixel distributions can be measured using various metrics such as L2 norm, SSIM index, and PSNR. These metrics help assess similarity between images and predict image quality. SSIM index considers mean, variance, and covariance of the two vectors, while PSNR is widely used in assessing picture quality in CODECs. The PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is an objective metric used in CODECs to assess picture quality based on mean squared error (MSE). It compares two patches using the maximum pixel value of the reference patch. Experiments were conducted using CATSvsDOGS and CIFAR100 datasets with various network architectures. The impact of algorithm POR TAB2 on training was evaluated through two sets of experiments. The experiments evaluated the impact of algorithm POR TAB2 on training. The first experiment analyzed the correlation between preprocessing techniques and network training performance, while the second focused on the impact of patch granularity. Results showed that mutual information technique accelerated learning rate, while some techniques slowed it down initially but all converged to the same performance after 10000 iterations. The experiments showed that reordering patches based on mutual information (MI) measure can help training by enabling faster convergence. Dataset reordered using MI achieved similar accuracy in \u00bc of the total iterations. Informed ordering techniques enable robust feature extraction and efficient learning, but further experiments with different setups are needed to conclusively prove this hypothesis. Based on experiments showing that reordering patches using mutual information can improve training speed, it is claimed that the performance of classification networks is not related to human ability to separate classes. The impact of patch-ordering preprocessing on convolutional neural networks is analyzed using the mutual information metric, which outperforms other metrics in measuring statistical dependency between patches. The mutual information index measures the information content of one image about another based on pixel values. Patches are ordered by their MI index, with adjacent patches explaining each other well. This patch reordering technique improves training speed and enhances the performance of convolutional neural networks. The algorithm uses Adam optimization and SoftMax cross-entropy loss for training neural networks with online training mechanism. Preprocessing samples with mutual information measure accelerates progress in training by rearranging inputs to have similar pixel distributions for adjacent samples. The algorithm uses Adam optimization and SoftMax cross-entropy loss for training neural networks with online training mechanism. To maintain resolution, 0-padding is used before applying convolution. A 3x3 max pooling operation generates a down-sampled feature-map for input to compute probability scores in a binary classifier. SoftMax cross-entropy loss can be computed using normalized probabilities. The cross-entropy loss is 4.60 when the probability of the correct class is 0.01. Patches are ranked based on mutual information indices. After ranking 3x3 patches using the MI measure and preprocessing the sample, the resulting sample has ordering grey, green, pink, and blue. The MI of green with the grey patch is 0.557, while the blue has an MI index of 0.224. Using l2-norm measure to sort the patches results in a higher loss of 4.71 compared to the original sample. Larger loss slows down training as more iterations are needed for convergence. Controlled experiments varied patch size to characterize its effect. The network shows rapid progress when trained on 4x4 patch ordered datasets, indicating the impact of patch ordering combined with small patch size. Swapping patches with the same MI index can result in increased loss, slowing down training. Automated patch ordering techniques were proposed to evaluate their effect on training. Several automated patch ordering techniques were proposed to assess their impact on training and the relationship between dataset characteristics and generalization performances. Traditional image similarity measures and information theory-based content measures were used to rank and reorder patches of every sample. The methods were tested using various architectures designed for high accuracy on image classification tasks, showing that training a convolutional neural network with ordered patches at the patch level improves classification performance. Supplying inputs with ordered patches at the patch level, based on mutual information between adjacent patches, accelerates loss reduction in optimizing non-convex functions. This systematic approach shows no correlation between image characteristics and network performance, challenging the notion of CNNs learning features in increasing abstraction. The view that CNNs learn features in increasing abstraction does not explain their ability to fit images with no recognizable features. Further investigation using theoretical characterizations like the IB method is necessary to formally characterize the learnability of a training set with CNNs. A typical CNN architecture consists of layers with neurons and connections between them, including convolutional and pooling layers. In CNNs, a filter is connected to a small patch of a feature map from the previous layer through weights. The weighted sum is passed through an activation function for non-linear transformation. Pooling layers reduce computation time by subsampling from convolution outputs and build spatial and configurational invariance. Discrete image convolution is used to extract information from training samples. In CNNs, the input consists of feature maps from the previous layer. The output of a layer is determined by filters and bias matrices. During training, CNNs adjust weights to approximate target mapping using supervised training procedures with a training set. The objective is to minimize deviation of the network output from the desired output values. The objective function in deep learning measures the deviation of the network output from the desired target output. Common measures include cross-entropy error and squared-error measures. Stochastic training aims to minimize the error with respect to the network weights using gradient descent. This iterative optimization approach finds optimal values for the parameters to approximate the mapping between training samples and desired outputs. Gradient descent is used for parameter optimization in deep learning. Stochastic training involves updating network weights based on error functions. Convolution in a single layer is illustrated in Figure 1."
