    "content": "Every federal law imposing environmental standards raises the question of whether states can set stricter standards. The Clean Air Act allows stricter state standards for stationary sources of air pollution but generally preempts states from adopting their own emission standards for new motor vehicles or engines. This is to avoid fragmentation of the national market and increase in costs for manufacturers. The Clean Air Act generally preempts states from setting their own emission standards for new motor vehicles or engines, except for California which can qualify for a waiver under CAA Section 209(b) if its standards are as protective as federal standards. California has obtained Section 209(b) waivers over 54 times since 1967 to enforce stricter motor vehicle emission standards, leading to the development and adoption of innovative technologies nationwide. This includes the introduction of catalytic converters and cleaner fuels. Currently, California can mandate a portion of each manufacturer's sales to meet Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) and Partial ZEV requirements. California's legislation, AB 1493, requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, focusing on carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons. The regulations apply to vehicles manufactured in the 2009 model year and beyond. CARB adopted regulations in 2004 for gradual reductions in fleet average GHG emissions, with separate standards for different vehicle classes. Passenger cars, light duty trucks, and SUVs under 3,750 lbs. must reduce emissions by 36.5% by 2016, while light trucks and passenger vehicles over 3,750 lbs. must reduce emissions by 24.4%. The regulations allow flexibility through credit generation from alternative fuel vehicles and credit trading among manufacturers. CARB adopted regulations in 2004 for gradual reductions in fleet average GHG emissions, with separate standards for different vehicle classes. Manufacturers must equalize credits and debits within five years, with penalties starting in 2014 at the earliest. After CARB's adoption, a waiver request was submitted to the U.S. EPA in December 2005, which took two years to respond due to debate within the Bush Administration. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are considered \"air pollutants\" under the Clean Air Act, giving EPA regulatory authority over emissions like carbon dioxide and methane. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 granted EPA regulatory authority over greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrofluorocarbons. Following this decision, EPA considered California's waiver request, holding public hearings and facing pressure from California leaders. EPA Administrator Johnson announced a decision on the waiver request would be made by the end of. Johnson announced he would decide on the waiver request by the end of 2007. Over 60,000 comments were received during the public comment period, with the majority urging the waiver's approval. Support came from various groups and governors, while the auto industry and DOT opposed the waiver grant. The auto industry opposed a waiver grant for California's emission standards, claiming no difference in impact on air pollutants and stating that GHG regulations have zero benefits. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson denied the waiver against the advice of his staff, leading to an increase in emissions from California's auto fleet. The EPA Administrator denied California's waiver petition, leading to legal challenges. A decision document was signed on February 29, 2008, published in the March 6, 2008 Federal Register. Lawsuits were filed by California, 18 other states, and environmental groups in the D.C. Circuit challenging the decision. Delegation, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senators Boxer and Feinstein, are participating in the case as amici on behalf of the petitioners. Legal arguments of petitioners and respondent EPA are summarized in the \"Waiver Criteria\" section of this report. California is the only state permitted to adopt more stringent emission standards under the waiver provision of Section 209(b). Briefing in the case is underway, with a decision likely in spring 2009. California and 14 other states, along with the District of Columbia, have adopted or announced their intention to adopt California's greenhouse gas emission controls. These states account for 44% of the total U.S. population, indicating significant environmental and industry implications beyond California. The consequences of California's emission standards extend beyond the state, impacting the auto industry nationwide. Section 209(b) allows for waivers if state standards are as protective as federal ones, with specific criteria for granting waivers. Originally enacted in 1967, the process now involves California's initial determination of protectiveness, which EPA can reject based on an \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard. The 1977 amendments to Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act reinforced California's authority to set emission standards that EPA can only reject on an \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard. California argued that its standards met all criteria under the CAA, including being at least as protective as federal standards and consistent with Section 202(a). The state argues that its standards and enforcement procedures are consistent with Section 202(a) and it faces compelling conditions such as rising sea levels, diminishing snow pack, and higher temperatures exacerbating ozone nonattainment. California believes it does not need to show unique threats from GHG emissions as EPA must consider the entire motor vehicle emissions program in evaluating the waiver request. In its denial of California's waiver request, EPA focused solely on CAA Section 209(b)(1)(B), stating that California did not need its GHG emission standards to address compelling and extraordinary conditions. This decision required EPA to change its interpretation of \"State standards\" in the statute. The EPA denied California's waiver request for GHG emission standards, citing that they did not need to address compelling and extraordinary conditions. This decision required a change in interpretation of \"State standards\" in the statute. EPA found it appropriate to consider the need to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions with reference to GHG regulations alone, as they address a global problem. California's motor vehicle program and waiver requests historically focused on local and regional air pollution issues, not global greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. EPA concluded that California's GHG emission standards were not necessary to address climate change as GHG impacts were not considered compelling or extraordinary conditions as intended by Congress. The 1967 legislative history of Section 209(b) referred to California's unique problems, suggesting a lack of nexus between local conditions and global GHG concentrations. California petitioned the EPA for a waiver based on the state's unique climate change impacts, including temperature increases, a large agriculture-based economy, and coastal population. However, the EPA denied the waiver, stating that global climate change affects all states similarly. California, along with other states and environmental groups, filed a lawsuit against the EPA's decision, arguing that the agency erred in not considering California's motor vehicle emissions program as a whole. Petitioners argue that the entire California motor vehicle emissions program must be assessed, citing the Chevron framework for judicial review of federal agency action. Under Chevron, the court first determines if Congress has directly addressed the issue, and if not, proceeds to Chevron step two to assess the agency's interpretation. Petitioners challenge EPA's exclusion of climate change impacts in California from \"compelling and extraordinary conditions\" under Chevron step one, arguing it violates the plain meaning of Section 209(b)(1)(B). They contend that the broad language of Section 209(b) should not be confined to the dominant concern of smog reduction in 1967. This is supported by the argument that requiring unique conditions in California contradicts CAA Section 177. The petitioners argue that California's authority to set unique conditions is not contradicted by CAA Section 177. They question the logic of allowing other states to adopt California's standards if California's authority is limited to addressing state-specific issues. Additionally, they challenge EPA's interpretation of compelling and extraordinary conditions under Chevron step two, stating that it conflicts with the Supreme Court's view on climate change and infringes on state sovereignty. The Bush Administration EPA reversed its practice of assessing California's vehicle emissions control program in the aggregate. In response to petitioners' arguments, EPA argued that its waiver rejection should be upheld, citing reasonable interpretations of an ambiguous statute and the need for California to demonstrate unique local conditions for its standards. The fate of the California v. EPA litigation depends on the actions of the newly arrived Obama Administration officials at the EPA. They could reverse the Bush Administration's waiver denial, leading to potential legal challenges. California has requested waivers under Section 209(b) multiple times, but the exact number is unclear. The complexities of potential courses of action are explored in the final section of the report. The EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality states that determining the number of waiver requests from California is challenging due to the varying nature of the requests. California has requested waivers for new or amended standards around 55 times and \"within the scope\" determinations around 42 times. In total, there have been nearly 100 waiver requests, all of which were granted either fully or partially. EPA has consistently found that California faces unique environmental conditions and requires its own standards to address them. The legislative history emphasizes that Congress intended to prevent federal interference with California's auto emission standards, ensuring that the state's judgment is not overturned lightly. The House committee report on the 1977 CAA Amendments strengthened California's position in seeking a waiver, stating that the Administrator should not substitute his judgment for that of the state. The EPA must have clear and compelling evidence to deny a waiver for California's auto emission standards. The agency has granted waivers in part before, but never outright denied one until the 1977 CAA amendments. EPA denied a waiver for the 1977 model year but granted it for 1978. There was a waiver granted for the 2007-2011 model years but no decision made for later years. Active litigation is ongoing regarding state regulation of mobile source GHG emissions, particularly in relation to California's standards. Auto dealers, trade associations, and manufacturers are seeking to prevent the implementation of these standards, even if the EPA's waiver denial is overturned. Courts have acknowledged that without a California waiver, state regulation of GHG emissions from vehicles is preempted by the CAA. The main legal theory in this litigation is based on the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The chief non-CAA preemption theory in the ongoing litigation is based on the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), which gives authority to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to establish corporate average fuel economy standards (\"CAFE standards\"). EPCA preempts states from adopting laws \"related to\" federal fuel economy standards, which the auto industry argues is fatal to state regulation of GHG emissions from cars. This argument is based on the idea that improving gas mileage is the only known way to reduce GHG emissions, making state regulations on auto GHG emissions invalid. The district court rejected non-CAA preemption theories in the ongoing litigation, emphasizing the interplay between EPCA and the Clean Air Act (CAA). NHTSA has historically considered EPA-approved California emissions standards as part of federal motor vehicle standards, indicating EPCA's intention to coexist with the CAA. The court found harmony between the CAA and EPCA provisions, as seen in the Massachusetts v. EPA decision. The court found that the CAA and EPCA provisions were harmonious, with no conflict between them. Preemption analysis concluded that Vermont's GHG standards were not preempted by EPCA or federal foreign policy authority. Similarly, in another case, California's GHG emissions regulations were not precluded or preempted by EPCA. Appeals are pending in both cases. The district court ruled that auto manufacturers and trade associations were barred from relitigating issues in a case challenging Rhode Island's adoption of California standards. However, Rhode Island auto dealers were allowed to proceed as viable plaintiffs. New Mexico's adoption of California GHG standards is also being challenged. The incoming Administration faces decisions on greenhouse gas regulations. EPA has received multiple petitions on the California waiver. The EPA has received petitions to regulate greenhouse gases from various sources, including vehicles, ships, nonroad engines, and fuels. Lawsuits are also pushing for regulations on stationary sources like power plants and refineries. The Obama Administration and Congress are supportive of greenhouse gas controls. President Obama is likely to reverse EPA's denial of the California waiver request for GHG controls, as he has ordered a review of the decision. The waiver decision, not a formal regulation, may set a precedent for GHG regulations under existing CAA authority. The EPA Administrator's decision on the waiver request for GHG controls could be reversed relatively easily, as it only requires notice, public hearing, and a rationale for the reversal. This process is simpler than reversing a formal regulation. The EPA Administrator's decision on the waiver request for GHG controls could be reversed by the new Administrator, following California's formal request and arguments. A hearing is scheduled for March 5, 2009, in Arlington, VA, with public comments accepted until April 6. The EPA Administrator's decision on the waiver request for GHG controls could be reversed by the new Administrator, following California's formal request and arguments. A hearing is scheduled for March 5, 2009, in Arlington, VA, with public comments accepted until April 6. Interest in the issue is expected to remain high until it is resolved."
