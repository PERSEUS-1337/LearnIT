A deposit or account will not escheat to the state if the owner has owned another deposit or account with the banking organization in the previous three years, or has owned an individual retirement account or similar account under a retirement plan, and has engaged in specified activities with the account. The banking organization must have communicated with the owner regarding the deposit or account that would otherwise escheat. \"Communications\" under subparagraph (A) includes account statements or statements required by US tax laws. No banking organization can stop interest on savings deposits due to account inactivity. Certain types of deposits and accounts will not have interest or dividends paid if the owner has not made any transactions for more than three years, excluding allowable service charges.

A deposit or account will not escheat to the state if the owner has owned another deposit or account with the financial organization in the previous three years, or if the owner has owned an individual retirement account or funds held under a retirement plan. The financial organization must have communicated with the owner regarding the deposit or account that would otherwise escheat. \"Communications\" under subparagraph (A) includes account statements or statements required by US tax laws.

Any traveler's check outstanding for over 15 years without communication from the owner may be payable by the business association. Any sum payable on a written instrument held by a banking or financial organization for over three years without owner communication may be considered abandoned.

Additionally, any funds held in retirement accounts must remain untouched for at least three years to avoid abandonment. The curr_chunk discusses actions related to managing property, such as adjusting the principal, accepting payments, and corresponding about the property. Funds held in retirement accounts or plans by a business association shall not escheat to the state if the owner has had another account with the association in the past three years and has engaged in specified actions. Communication with the owner regarding the account is required to prevent escheatment. The curr_chunk states that the information required to prevent escheatment includes account statements or statements needed under US tax laws. The funds in accounts or plans are not distributable unless distribution is mandatory under the terms or the owner is 70 1/2 years old.
