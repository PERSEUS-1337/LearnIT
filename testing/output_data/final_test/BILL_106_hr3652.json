    "content": "The Act titled \"Mud Dump Permanent Closure and Remediation Act of 2000\" prohibits permanent dumping at a historic area remediation site. Section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 is amended to prohibit dumping at the Historic Area Remediation Site, allowing permits for remediation purposes before permanent closure. The Secretary will not issue permits for transporting dredged materials to the Historic Area Remediation Site once the specified goal is met. Existing permits issued before this change will not be valid if they allow dumping in violation of the new regulations. The Secretary must give advance notice of permits to the Governors of New York and New Jersey and relevant Members of Congress. The Secretary must provide advance notice of permits to relevant authorities. SEC. 3. STANDARDS FOR REMEDIATION MATERIALS. Standards for evaluating dredged materials for remediation purposes at the Historic Area Remediation Site will be developed by the Administrator within 90 days of enactment. The materials must contain significantly lower levels of pollutants. The Administrator will develop standards for evaluating dredged materials at the Historic Area Remediation Site to reduce contaminants and minimize negative effects on marine life. The Administrator will develop standards to reduce contamination levels at the Historic Area Remediation Site to match ocean ambient levels. Public comment is required before finalizing the standards. Definitions include background ambient contamination levels equivalent to or lower than biota contamination levels. The levels of contamination in biota and sediments found naturally in the ocean and clean reference sediments used by the EPA for testing remediation materials at the Historic Area Remediation Site. Clean reference sediments are free of contaminants and similar to dredged material and disposal site sediment. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a \"Historic Area Remediation Site\" as a dredged material disposal area located east of Sandy Hook, New Jersey. It reflects conditions in the vicinity of the disposal site if no dredged material disposal had ever occurred."
