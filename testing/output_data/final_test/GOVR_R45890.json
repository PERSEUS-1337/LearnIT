    "content": "The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System was established in 1968 through the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to preserve designated free-flowing rivers for present and future generations. Designated rivers, known as wild and scenic rivers, are classified into three categories - wild, scenic, and recreational - based on their characteristics at the time of designation. Wild rivers are free from impoundments and generally inaccessible, scenic rivers are undeveloped but accessible in some areas, and recreational rivers allow for more development. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, established in 1968, preserves free-flowing rivers classified as wild, scenic, or recreational. Congress continually expands the system, now comprising 226 river units in 41 states and Puerto Rico. Congress shapes the system through legislation, funding, and specific provisions for river management and land use. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, established in 1968, preserves free-flowing rivers classified as wild, scenic, or recreational. Congress continually expands the system through legislation, funding, and specific provisions for river management and land use. Ongoing issues for Congress include designating additional Wild and Scenic Rivers, addressing local and federal roles on nonfederal river segments, and the process of adding rivers to the system either through congressional designation or state nomination to the Secretary of the Interior. Congress may require a study to determine suitability for designation, or direct the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to evaluate rivers for inclusion. The President ultimately decides on proposed additions based on these studies. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, established in 1968, preserves free-flowing rivers classified as wild, scenic, or recreational. Congress expands the system through legislation, funding, and specific provisions for river management and land use. The President submits recommendations to Congress on proposed additions based on studies that discuss outstandingly remarkable values, land ownership, future uses, administering agency, acquisition costs, and management cost sharing. Congress may specify river classifications, but the Secretary of the Interior can also add Wild and Scenic Rivers. The Secretary of the Interior can add Wild and Scenic Rivers to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System through administrative action. State-nominated rivers can be added if approved by the Secretary of the Interior and permanently administered by a state agency. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act provides protections for study rivers designated by Congress, lasting through the study process and for three years after the final study report is transmitted to Congress. After Congress designates a river segment as a Wild and Scenic River (WSR), it falls under the jurisdiction of one of the four major federal land management agencies. The National Park Service (NPS) administers rivers entirely on nonfederal lands, providing technical and financial assistance and ensuring compliance with the WSRA. The WSRA authorizes or prohibits certain activities to protect the values for which the rivers were established. Following designation as a Wild and Scenic River (WSR), rivers are administered by either the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior through federal land management agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or Forest Service. Depending on the agency administering the river, it may become part of the National Park System or National Wildlife Refuge System. Following designation as a Wild and Scenic River, rivers administered by federal land management agencies like the Bureau of Land Management or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service become part of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The agency then prepares a management plan (CRMP) to protect river values by addressing development, user capacities, and other management practices. The CRMP must address resource protection, development of lands, user capacities, and other practices to achieve the purposes of the WSRA. Agencies may provide specific directions for CRMP components, such as describing existing resource conditions and defining goals for protecting river values. The CRMP (Comprehensive River Management Plan) is developed after a river is designated as Wild and Scenic to protect its values. It addresses water quality, instream flow, compliance with other authorities, regulatory agencies, and monitoring strategies. The plan must be completed within three fiscal years and may include boundaries of areas along the designated river. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA) designates corridors of land along rivers to protect aesthetic, scenic, historic, archaeological, and scientific features. The WSRA prohibits water resource projects that would have a direct adverse effect on designated river values. Management of lands within wild and scenic corridors varies based on the class of the designated river. The management of wild and scenic rivers varies based on the designated class, values, managing agency, and land ownership in the river corridor. Federal lands within wild WSRs are withdrawn from mining and mineral leasing laws, prohibiting new claims or leases. Existing valid claims may continue with regulations to protect river values. NPS and FWS generally prohibit mineral development on their lands. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act generally prohibits mineral development on federal lands within designated WSRs, affecting activity on FS and BLM lands. Existing valid claims or leases within WSR boundaries remain in effect with regulations to minimize environmental impact. Section 7 of the WSRA prohibits water projects that would adversely affect the values of the river. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act prohibits projects that would harm the designated river segments' resources. This includes prohibiting new dams, water conduits, and other projects that directly affect the river. Managing agencies, such as the NPS, are responsible for assessing the impact of proposed projects on the rivers they oversee. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act prohibits projects that harm designated river resources, including new dams and water conduits. Managing agencies assess the impact of proposed projects on the rivers they oversee, focusing on impacts to identified values and free-flowing condition. Different agencies manage federal lands based on specific criteria, such as sustained yield of multiple uses for FS and BLM, preservation and public enjoyment for NPS, and conservation for FWS. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act guides the management decisions of federal land management agencies like FS and BLM, who manage their lands for multiple uses including grazing, timber harvesting, and recreation. They create Comprehensive River Management Plans (CRMPs) for each designated river to address how lands in or surrounding the corridor may be used. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act directs federal agencies like FS and BLM to create CRMPs for designated rivers, outlining management objectives. Activities like insect treatment, transportation systems, and recreation must adhere to the CRMP. Timber harvesting and certain developments are generally not allowed in wild river corridors, while more development is permitted in scenic and recreational river corridors. FS prohibits motorized travel in wild river corridors, and BLM discourages new rights-of-way and utility corridors. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act directs federal agencies like FS and BLM to create CRMPs for designated rivers, outlining management objectives. FS prohibits motorized travel in wild river corridors, while BLM discourages new rights-of-way and utility corridors in all WSR areas. FWS manages WSRs under the provisions of the WSRA and any provisions under which the NWRS is administered. NPS manages rivers under the National Park System. The National Park Service (NPS) manages the National Park System under a dual mission to preserve unique resources and provide for public enjoyment. Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs) managed by NPS are subject to the provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA) and any other relevant regulations. WSRs may flow through federal or nonfederal lands, with those on nonfederal lands managed at the state, county, or other nonfederal level known as partnership WSRs. Partnership Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs) are designated through an administrative process, with states applying for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (NWSRS). These rivers are managed at the state level and do not have federal ownership. The term \"partnership WSRs\" is used to refer to WSRs with similar features, with the National Park Service (NPS) administering them. Local organizations often play a role in creating and approving river management plans for partnership WSRs. Partnership Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs) are managed by local organizations with oversight from the National Park Service (NPS). The NPS provides technical assistance, while land use and management are governed by nonfederal authorities. Costs are shared, with some federal support, and partnership WSRs are usually congressionally designated. Designation can occur through state nomination, with features codified in legislation or developed locally during the process. Partnership Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs) are managed by local organizations with oversight from the National Park Service (NPS). Congress typically designates partnership WSRs following a study, which may identify existing forms of protection in the river corridor and additional options for protection within local jurisdictions. During a Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSR) study, local governments may strengthen land use requirements, such as passing zoning ordinances, to demonstrate protection before requesting congressional designation. Congress has prohibited condemnation in WSR corridors in urban areas with adequate zoning ordinances. Stakeholders may develop a river management plan during the study, sometimes with NPS assistance and funding. NPS administers all partnership WSRs, even though it is not required by the WSRA. Congress may specify which local jurisdictions manage designated areas. Local jurisdictions manage designated partnership Wild and Scenic Rivers through cooperative agreements. Management councils or similar local organizations are formed on each partnership river. WSR designation on nonfederal land does not transfer ownership to the federal government. Local authorities continue to govern land use and management. Partnership WSRs are managed according to the established CRMP, with local jurisdictions making laws and carrying out management actions. The WSRA allows federal agencies to cooperate with state and local governments for managing designated Wild and Scenic Rivers. NPS can provide assistance for managing river resources, while remaining responsible for Section 7 reviews of water projects. States seeking WSR designation for nonfederal lands must establish permanent river protections and apply to the Secretary of the Interior for approval. NPS evaluates compliance with WSRA provisions before inclusion in the NWSRS. The WSRA requires NPS to evaluate if a river meets criteria for inclusion in the NWSRS, with state or local agencies managing administratively designated rivers. Federal funding and land acquisition are precluded for state-administered WSRs. NPS reviews water resource projects, and Congress can designate WSRs with federal and nonfederal land segments. Congress can designate WSRs with segments on federal and nonfederal land, leading to varied management approaches for nonfederal segments. Funding for operations and maintenance of rivers administered by federal land management agencies is provided through annual congressional appropriations. State-administered rivers typically do not receive federal funding. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA) authorizes federal agencies to assist states, landowners, and organizations in planning and managing Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs). The National Park Service (NPS) administers partnership WSRs and provides financial and technical assistance. Funding for NPS-administered WSRs depends on the location of the designated river, with some receiving appropriations from other National Park System units and others having their own line-item appropriations. The budget for Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs) includes separate line items for partnership WSRs. Funding for WSRs is listed individually in the NPS budget, while BLM and FWS incorporate WSR funding into broader budget activities. WSR designation has been controversial, especially for WSRs containing nonfederal lands. Initially, Congress primarily designated rivers on federal land, while rivers on nonfederal land were added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System through state nominations. Since 2004, Congress has designated all Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs) on federal and nonfederal land, with an increase in authorizing river studies on nonfederal lands. Concern has arisen regarding local control of newly designated lands and the potential for federal acquisition, particularly through condemnation authority, which has rarely been used in relation to WSRs according to the Interagency Wild and Scenic Rivers Council. Opinions on the balance of federal and local control over partnership Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs) vary. Some stakeholders believe the current partnership model is successful, while others are concerned about potential loss of local control. There are also worries about the adequacy of local laws in protecting partnership WSRs. Each partnership WSR's attributes are determined by individual laws or agency choices, rather than a defined category in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA). The state-nominated process for designating Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs) differs from the partnership model in terms of fixed provisions and precluding federal management or land acquisition. Congress intended state nomination to be the primary method for nonfederal river segments to be included in the system. The state-nominated process for designating Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSRs) was intended by Congress to be the primary means for nonfederal river segments to be included in the system. However, this method has not been used since 2004 due to costs and state politics. Congress may need to decide whether to encourage the use of the state-nominated process or continue establishing partnership WSRs through individual designating statutes."
