    "content": "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest food assistance program in the US, serving 42.2 million recipients monthly at a cost of over $68 billion in FY2017. It is jointly administered by the federal government and states, providing means-tested benefits for eligible recipients to purchase food at authorized retailers. Detecting and preventing errors and fraud in the program is complex due to the involvement of various stakeholders and the need to monitor retailer acceptance, recipient use of benefits, and states' administration performance. Many governmental entities, including human services and law enforcement, work to detect and prevent fraudulent SNAP activities. SNAP is reauthorized in a farm bill every five years, with the most recent reauthorization in 2014. Policymakers are discussing error and fraud in preparation for the next farm bill in September 2018, with the Trump Administration announcing related policy changes. Some policymakers defend the program's integrity against criticism. This report aims to define terms related to errors and fraud in SNAP. The report defines terms related to errors and fraud in SNAP, addressing issues such as trafficking SNAP benefits, retailer fraud, errors in household applications, and fraud by state agencies. It distinguishes between errors and intentional fraud, discussing challenges in combating these issues and proposing strategies to address them. SNAP fraud is different from errors and may be unintentional. While trafficking is always considered fraud, other activities like duplicate enrollment can be due to error or fraud. SNAP fraud is rare, with retailer trafficking being a significant type. Retailer trafficking is a key measure of fraud, but not the only one. The federal entity focuses on trafficking and retailer application fraud, while 53 state agencies handle recipient violations, leading to varied approaches and reporting. The national payment error rate (NPER) is a key measure of SNAP payment accuracy but has limitations. Policies to reduce fraud and increase accuracy may conflict with other objectives and have unintended consequences, such as limiting access to SNAP-authorized stores for participants. Implementing better data collection and accountability systems may require more staff and incur additional costs. This report synthesizes resources on error and fraud in SNAP, relying on data from USDA-FNS, USDA-OIG, and GAO. It defines types of fraud and errors by recipients, retailers, and state agencies. Abbreviations used in the report can be found in Appendix A. The USDA-FNS is responsible for administering the retailer side of SNAP and pursuing retailer fraud, while states oversee the recipient side and pursue recipient fraud. \"Trafficking\" refers to the illegal exchange of SNAP benefits for cash or other prohibited items. \"Trafficking SNAP benefits involves illegal exchanges for cash or prohibited items, diverting funds from their intended purpose. Retailer and recipient trafficking are serious forms of SNAP fraud, with retailers misrepresenting themselves to participate in the program.\" Retailer application fraud in SNAP involves misrepresentation or circumventing disqualification by submitting false information to obtain authorization. This includes providing personal and business details to meet eligibility requirements. Fraud can also occur when store owners transfer ownership to avoid disqualification. The practice of \"straw ownership\" involves disqualified store owners transferring ownership to a spouse or relative who then applies for SNAP benefits. This is considered retailer application fraud by USDA-FNS. This type of fraud allows retailers more likely to engage in trafficking to enter the program. Additionally, errors and fraud can occur in determining eligibility and benefit amounts for SNAP recipients. To continue receiving SNAP benefits, applicants must provide personal information and documentation to their state agency for eligibility determination. Errors like misunderstandings, miscalculations, or unintentionally providing incorrect information can lead to overpayments. Inadvertent household errors (IHE) occur when errors are unintentional. Intentionally providing false information results in intentional program violations (IPV) or recipient application fraud. SNAP overpayments or underpayments can also occur. State agency employee fraud, also known as \"insider threats,\" refers to intentional efforts by state employees to illegally generate and benefit from SNAP overpayments. This type of fraud typically involves eligibility workers abusing their positions and access to the SNAP program. State agency fraud involves state officials misleading federal authorities to obtain federal funds or avoid penalties, often by falsifying program-related data. A notable case identified in 2017 involves multiple states falsifying Quality Control data to receive bonuses and evade penalties, dating back to 2008. USDA-FNS publishes an annual report summarizing their administrative activities. The USDA-FNS publishes an annual report summarizing administrative activities related to SNAP retailers, including participation data, investigations, and sanctions. In FY2016, 260,115 retailers participated in SNAP, with 1,842 stores permanently disqualified for trafficking. Every three years, studies estimate retailer trafficking rates based on redemption data. The national retailer trafficking rate for SNAP benefits was 1.50% in 2012-2014, up from 1.34% in the previous study. This equates to about $1.1 billion in benefits trafficked each year at participating stores. The September 2017 USDA-FNS Retailer Trafficking Study found that the national store violation rate for SNAP benefits was 11.82% during the period, up from 10.47% in the previous study. The increase in retailer trafficking was attributed to smaller stores participating more in the program, with convenience stores making up about 63% of the growth in SNAP-authorized stores over the last 10 years. According to the September 2017 USDA-FNS Retailer Trafficking Study, convenience stores represent 5% of total SNAP redemptions but 57% of retailer trafficking. Approximately 18% of SNAP benefits used at authorized convenience stores are trafficked, with 19% of these stores engaged in trafficking. These rates are significantly higher than national averages for all stores. The increase in SNAP participation by smaller stores correlates with a rise in retailer trafficking. USDA-FNS reports annually on actions taken against retailer application fraud. In FY2016, USDA-FNS sanctioned 126 stores for business integrity violations, including retailer application fraud. This amounts to less than 1 store sanctioned for every 2,064 participating stores. The SNAP Quality Control system measures improper payments in SNAP, established in 1977. State agencies conduct monthly reviews comparing overpayments and underpayments to total issuance. The state agencies calculate their state payment error rate (SPER) by reviewing overpayments and underpayments compared to total issuance. USDA-FNS validates state findings through annual reviews to determine the national payment error rate (NPER), which estimates all improper payments in SNAP. The NPER is not a measure of fraud but includes overpayments and underpayments due to recipient errors, fraud, and agency errors. Only overpayments and underpayments above $38 (inflation-adjusted annually) are counted in the Quality Control threshold for calculating the payment error rate. In FY2017, the National Payment Error Rate (NPER) was 6.30%, comprising a 5.19% overpayment rate and a 1.11% underpayment rate. The NPER reflects inaccurate payments exceeding the Quality Control threshold, not federal dollars lost to fraud. SNAP agencies must recover overpayments by establishing claims against households and collecting them. In FY2017, an estimated $3.3 billion in benefits were overpaid. In FY2017, an estimated $3.3 billion in benefits were overpaid, and $710 million were underpaid. States established over $684 million in claims to recover overpayments in FY2016. Data quality concerns led to the absence of SNAP national payment error rates in FY2015 and FY2016. USDA found data quality issues in many state agencies' reporting in 2014, some due to protocol violations and others due to deliberate cover-ups. In FY2017, USDA-FNS suspended error reporting for FY2015 and FY2016 to improve state quality control procedures. The agency implemented new controls and a modernized review process, resulting in a substantial increase in the FY2017 national payment error rate to 6.30% from 3.66% in FY2014. The FY2017 NPER of 6.30% is significantly higher than FY2014's 3.66%. USDA-FNS notes the increase is due to improved data collection but cautions against direct comparisons. The SNAP overpayment rate in FY2017 totaled about $3.3 billion, but the NPER does not specify the breakdown of errors and fraud. State agencies administer the recipient side of SNAP and report data on recipient errors, recipient fraud, and agency errors in the SNAP State Activity Report. When an overpayment occurs due to errors or fraud, the household is required to repay the amount. Data on claims resulting from these errors is provided in the state report. The state report provides data on recipient errors, fraud, and agency errors in SNAP. Claims establishment can indicate the extent of these issues. Recipients committing fraud are disqualified from SNAP. However, not all overpayments or fraud cases are detected or result in claims. The state report provides data on recipient errors, fraud, and agency errors in SNAP, based on FY2016 data. Claims establishment reflects the extent of these issues, with total claims established of 884,301 and total claims dollars established of $684,197,891. Despite limitations in data collection, these measures imperfectly show the prevalence of errors and fraud in the SNAP caseload. Recipient fraud in SNAP is detected and punished by 53 different agencies, with a lack of standardization leading to the absence of a national fraud rate. The FY2016 SNAP State Activity Report shows that for every 10,000 households in SNAP, about 14 contained recipients committing fraud resulting in overpayments. In FY2016, recipient fraud in SNAP led to $73,403,758 in fraud claims established, with about 3% of claims due to recipient fraud. Approximately 11% of total claims dollars were established due to recipient fraud. 55,930 recipients were disqualified for violating SNAP rules, with about 1.5% receiving permanent disqualifications. For every $10,000 in benefits issued, about $21 were lost due to recipient application fraud. In FY2016, $136,475,242 in SNAP program loss was associated with disqualified recipients due to recipient fraud. State agencies established 394,883 recipient error claims, totaling $421,934,288, with 45% of claims and 62% of claim dollars attributed to recipient errors. In FY2016, about 52% of total claims were due to agency errors, totaling about 28% of claim dollars. Four states accounted for 65% of claims and 55% of claim amounts, representing 30% of SNAP participants. For every 10,000 households in SNAP, 47 were overpaid due to agency errors, totaling 459,144 agency error claims. For every $10,000 in benefits issued, $28 were overpaid, totaling $188,859,846 in agency error claims. In FY2016, 52% of total claims were due to agency errors, totaling 28% of claim dollars. California accounted for 80% of agency error claims and 64% of agency error claim dollars. State and federal efforts to detect and correct errors, as well as deter fraud, are detailed. USDA-FNS administers the retailer side of SNAP and pursues retailer fraud, while USDA-OIG collaborates with law enforcement agencies. The USDA-FNS, along with FBI, Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies, investigates and pursues criminal charges against retailers involved in retailer trafficking. Detection methods include analyzing EBT transaction data and conducting undercover investigations. In FY2016, USDA-FNS reviewed transactions of nearly 9% of stores, with over 80% of retailer trafficking cases identified through EBT transaction analysis. In FY2016, USDA-FNS investigated over 1% of participating stores for SNAP trafficking. State agencies may have SLEB agreements to detect trafficking, and tips and referrals from various sources can lead to cases of retailer trafficking. USDA-OIG operates a hotline for reporting fraud, referring 4,320 complaints to USDA-FNS in FY2016. If a store is found guilty of trafficking, all owners may be held accountable. Penalties for retailer trafficking include disqualification from SNAP program participation. Trafficking SNAP benefits results in permanent disqualification. Stores disqualified from SNAP are also disqualified from WIC. Restitution of Benefits Trafficked (Claims) involves retailers repaying illegally redeemed SNAP benefits, considered a federal debt. USDA-FNS can collect claims by offsetting against a store's SNAP redemptions or bond. Public Disclosure of Disqualified Retailers allows USDA-FNS to publicly disclose store and owner names for disqualified retailers. The 2016 USDA-FNS Final Rule aims to deter retailer trafficking by disclosing information. Retailers face a Transfer of Ownership Civil Money Penalty (TOCMP) if they sell or transfer ownership during disqualification. In FY2016, 257 penalties were assessed with an average value of $29,284. Exclusion from the GSA-SAM system prohibits individuals or entities from doing business with the federal government. As of September 2017, 10,307 retailers have been permanently disqualified from SNAP participation for trafficking benefits and listed as exclusions in GSA-SAM. This exclusion can lead to criminal charges and penalties, including fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment up to 20 years. USDA-OIG collaborates with law enforcement to pursue charges against retailers involved in trafficking SNAP benefits. In FY2016, USDA-OIG opened 208 SNAP fraud investigations, resulting in 600 indictments, 510 convictions, and $95.3 million in monetary penalties. USDA-FNS reviews retailer applications for suspicious items to detect fraud, and may request additional documentation from applicants. State law enforcement may also pursue criminal charges against individuals involved in retailer trafficking. Government entities verify questionable items for retailer applications. Denial of application for failure to meet requirements or falsification. Retailers may face permanent disqualification for falsification of substantive matters. Retailers engaging in falsification, such as store information, may face a three-year disqualification. Permanent disqualification for falsification can lead to various penalties, including SNAP certification evaluation and potential criminal charges. During the SNAP certification process, errors by recipients or agencies can lead to incorrect issuance of benefits. Eligibility workers gather information from applicants and may verify it through data systems or collateral contacts. In FY2016, 62% of overpayment dollars were due to inadvertent household errors during the application process. Recipient errors in the SNAP program can lead to payment accuracy issues for states. Implementing data matches can help identify errors quickly, reducing overpayments. Six data matches are mandated for SNAP certification, including the use of the U.S Department of Health and Human Services' New Hire File to verify employment information. The New Hire File is used to verify household employment information, mandated by the 2014 Farm Bill. Other systems like SSA-PVS, SSA-DMF, USDA-FNS-eDRS, and DHS-USCIS-SAVE are used to verify incarceration status, death, SNAP disqualification, and immigration status respectively. Alien Verification for Entitlements (DHS-USCIS-SAVE) is used to verify household members' immigration status, mandated by the 2014 Farm Bill. SNAP agencies utilize the Income and Eligibility Verification System (IEVS) to confirm eligibility and income information provided by applicants. The 2016 USDA-FNS notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the requirement to utilize this data match has not been finalized yet. The 2014 Farm Bill mandates the use of the Income and Eligibility Verification System (IEVS) to verify eligibility and income information provided by SNAP applicants. States use mandatory and optional data matches to confirm earned and unearned income for determining benefit allotment. The policy is pending implementation, with a final rule yet to be published by USDA-FNS. States use mandatory and optional data matches to verify earned and unearned income for SNAP eligibility. Optional matches include state databases for disqualifications, criminal justice system matches, vital information system matches, and foster care matches to ensure accurate household size. State agencies use data matches to verify household size and eligibility for SNAP benefits. Matches against state and federal crime databases help exclude individuals with crime-related restrictions. Data matches with other public benefit programs ensure accurate implementation of disqualification policies. Agency errors are primarily due to human error and can be mitigated through training and supervision of eligibility workers. Ongoing process improvements help detect agency errors. State agencies detect agency errors through ongoing process improvements, supervisory case reviews, and system audits. Overpayments result in claims against households, considered federal debt to be repaid by adult members. Underpayments must also be corrected by agencies. Low dollar overpayments may not always result in claims. State agencies may choose not to establish claims for low dollar overpayments below their threshold. They can retain a percentage of collected amounts from recipient fraud claims. State agencies are responsible for detecting and pursuing recipient fraud, including trafficking. USDA-FNS provides support and technical assistance to state agencies in these efforts. USDA-FNS supports state agencies in detecting recipient fraud, including trafficking, by providing technical assistance and setting policy. USDA-OIG collaborates with law enforcement to pursue recipients who traffic SNAP benefits in high dollar amounts or engage in criminal activity. Fraud can be detected through EBT transaction data analysis and monitoring social media for suspicious activity. State agencies use automated tools and manual monitoring to detect trafficking of SNAP benefits on social media and online commerce websites. Undercover investigations are conducted to uncover recipient trafficking and application fraud. Recipients who frequently request replacement EBT cards are flagged for review as potential traffickers. USDA-FNS granted a waiver for one state to contact recipients who request a replacement card more than two times in a 12-month period. Some state agencies enter into agreements with State Law Enforcement Bureaus to combat recipient fraud. State agencies use various methods to detect recipient trafficking and application fraud, including entering into State Law Enforcement Bureau (SLEB) agreements, utilizing tips and referrals, and employing data matching and verification processes. These efforts help flag potential traffickers and fraudulent recipients for further investigation. The certification process can help detect recipient application fraud in the SNAP program. If fraud is found, the individual may face penalties like disqualification. Other household members are not automatically penalized, but adult members may have to repay any overpayment or trafficking claims. Recipient fraud can lead to disqualification ranging from one year to permanent. The chart shows how state agencies prioritize investigations into intentional program violations in SNAP administration. SNAP households must repay overpaid benefits due to fraud or trafficking. Comparable disqualification is imposed if a recipient is disqualified from other assistance programs. Criminal charges and penalties may apply for fraud. Criminal charges and penalties for recipient fraud in SNAP are typically pursued by states, with varying penalties. USDA-OIG collaborates with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute cases of fraud, including state agency employee fraud. Penalties for state agency employee fraud vary by state. Penalties for state agency employee fraud vary by state and may include imprisonment, probation, and monetary restitutions. SNAP uses Quality Control (QC) to measure improper payments and levy financial penalties on low-performing states. In June 2018, USDA-FNS released a FY2017 NPER under new QC procedures due to concerns of misreporting errors. This section discusses false claims by state agencies regarding QC. The section discusses false claims by state agencies regarding Quality Control (QC) data and state payment error rates (SPERs). The SNAP Quality Control system measures improper payments by comparing overpayments and underpayments to total benefits issuance. State agencies analyze data to determine state payment error rates, which are reviewed by USDA-FNS to calculate the SNAP national payment error rate (NPER). High-performing states receive bonuses, while low-performing states face penalties. USDA-FNS awards bonuses to up to 10 states with the lowest or most improved state payment error rates annually. The total annual amount awarded for SPER high-performance bonuses is $24 million. State sanctions, known as \"liabilities,\" are used to punish states with high payment error rates. If a state exceeds the liability level for two years in a row, it is assessed a penalty. State agencies may be assessed a penalty if they exceed the liability level for two consecutive years. Most states improve their payment error rates within one or two years to avoid repayment. Only 9 states have had to repay penalties, totaling $1.5 million over 10 years. USDA-FNS oversees state agencies through Quality Control reviews to incentivize high payment accuracy. USDA-FNS oversees state agencies to ensure high payment accuracy through various oversight mechanisms. USDA-OIG conducted audits and found concerns in state-reported Quality Control data. USDA-FNS disputed USDA-OIG's findings, stating they were based on unconfirmed information and misunderstandings of SNAP policy. The USDA-FNS disputed concerns over Quality Control data in eight states, attributing issues to administrative issues rather than fraud. DOJ findings revealed state agency fraud in Virginia, Wisconsin, and Alaska, involving falsification of data to improve payment error rates. Hearings before Senate and House Committees addressed this fraud, with entities required to repay funds obtained through fraud under the False Claims Act. Three state agencies admitted to DOJ that they falsified QC data and violated the False Claims Act in their administration of SNAP. Settlements with DOJ required Virginia to pay $7,150,436, Wisconsin to pay $6,991,905, and Alaska to pay $2,489,999. These payments represent high-performance bonuses awarded for low state payment error rates while engaged in fraudulent practices. USDA-FNS found data quality issues in 79% of state agencies in FY2015, but not all issues indicate fraud. All three states had hired the same Quality Control consultant firm. The USDA-OIG investigation into state agency fraud is ongoing, with Mississippi under investigation for Quality Control fraud. Ann M. Coffey mentioned at a Senate hearing that many states are still under investigation. Various stakeholders have identified issues complicating error and fraud detection in SNAP, proposing strategies to address these challenges. Proposed strategies to address errors and fraud in SNAP include rulemaking actions, statutory changes, and state pilots. Balancing program objectives, such as payment accuracy and recipient access, is a consideration for policymakers. USDA-FNS will deny new store applications if the owner was permanently disqualified from SNAP participation. The USDA-FNS policy allows store owners to remain in the SNAP program despite a permanent disqualification at one of their stores. This policy, identified as a weakness in combating trafficking, has allowed 586 store owners to continue participating in SNAP. USDA-OIG recommended changes to SNAP regulations to address this issue. USDA-FNS proposed requiring collateral bonds or letters of credit for all authorized stores linked to a permanently disqualified owner or new stores with an owner connected to trafficking. USDA-OIG found this alternative policy inadequate, stating that allowing known traffickers to participate in SNAP undermines efforts to combat trafficking. Proposed changes to SNAP rules aim to increase monetary penalties for retailers involved in trafficking SNAP benefits, with fines potentially reaching $100,000 per violation. This is in response to an estimated $1.1 billion in annual SNAP benefit trafficking, with only $7.5 million in fines imposed by USDA-FNS in FY2016. The goal is to deter retailers from engaging in fraud and recoup federal funds lost to trafficking. USDA-FNS imposes civil money penalties on retailers who traffic SNAP benefits, with fines up to $100,000 per violation. Proposed rule changes to increase penalties have not been implemented yet, so current limits remain at $11,000 per violation and $59,000 per investigation. The USDA-FNS imposes civil money penalties on retailers trafficking SNAP benefits, with fines up to $100,000 per violation. In FY2016, the mean value of penalties assessed was $29,284, potentially increasing deterrent effect. Currently, only a limited share of trafficking retailers are fined, with firms permanently disqualified subject to penalties when a sale is detected. In FY2016, USDA-FNS assessed civil money penalties on retailers for trafficking SNAP benefits. However, most store owners found guilty of trafficking face no monetary penalty. USDA-FNS proposed a new penalty called trafficking civil penalty (TCP) in 2012, but the rulemaking action is currently inactive. This new fine would be based on the retailer's fraud volume and imposed at the time of permanent disqualification to deter trafficking and recover misappropriated funds. The 2014 Farm Bill changed the requirement for SNAP-authorized retailers to pay for their own EBT equipment and services, leading to the use of third-party companies for POS equipment. This has made it more challenging for USDA-FNS to detect retailer trafficking and has enabled new forms of fraud. The 2014 Farm Bill changed SNAP-authorized retailers' requirement to pay for their own EBT equipment, leading to the use of third-party companies for POS equipment. This change has made it more challenging for USDA-FNS to detect retailer trafficking and has enabled new forms of fraud, such as an account executive illegally providing unauthorized stores with active SNAP EBT devices, resulting in $6.5 million in benefits redeemed. Retailers have been required to meet stocking standards since 1994, with a minimum of 12 food items, which may contribute to retailer trafficking by making it easier for fraud-prone retailers to enter the program. The 2014 Farm Bill modified SNAP retailer requirements, leading to the use of third-party companies for POS equipment. This change has made it harder to detect retailer trafficking. The December 2016 USDA-FNS Final Rule aimed to increase stocking standards for retailers, but full implementation was prevented by the 2017 Omnibus Act. Current implementation requires stores to stock a minimum of 36 food items to curb retailer trafficking. The USDA-FNS has found that some retailers exploit delays in the disqualification process to continue trafficking SNAP benefits. The 2008 Farm Bill required the use of the EBT system to immediately suspend payment of redeemed SNAP benefits. The USDA-FNS is required to use the EBT system to suspend payment of SNAP benefits to stores involved in retailer trafficking. High-risk stores with a history of trafficking may be required to provide a bond or letter of credit for SNAP authorization. The USDA-FNS may require high-risk stores to provide a bond or letter of credit for SNAP authorization. Some suggest adding recipient photographs on EBT cards to reduce trafficking, but there are challenges with this strategy. Photo EBT cards can only show the head of the household, even though all members can use the card. Some states have implemented photo EBT cards since 1996, with mixed results. Maine and Massachusetts currently use them, citing increased program integrity. However, evidence of reduced trafficking is lacking, and the implementation incurs upfront and ongoing costs to the state and federal government. Upfront and ongoing costs of implementing photo EBT vary widely across states. For example, Missouri discontinued photo EBT after incurring $1.8 million in costs, while other states like North Carolina spent up to $25.1 million upfront. Annual ongoing costs range from $65,000 in Virginia to $8.4 million in Arizona. There is no standard measurement of recipient fraud, making it difficult to observe trends and evaluate enforcement strategies. GAO and USDA-OIG recommend creating a national recipient trafficking rate, but it is deemed infeasible without statutory changes and additional resources. USDA-FNS also expressed concerns about the feasibility of developing a recipient trafficking rate. USDA-FNS may conduct a study to determine recipient trafficking of SNAP benefits, standardize state agency reporting, and implement changes to accurately document the national recipient trafficking rate. Financial incentives are provided to reward states with low error rates, but not for effectively detecting and penalizing recipient fraud. The USDA-FNS does not incentivize state agencies to pursue recipient trafficking cases, despite a 2016 GAO report recommending federal financial incentives for anti-fraud strategies. FNS has decided against bonus awards for anti-fraud and program integrity activities. Establishing a standard to measure performance for these bonuses would likely require a national recipient trafficking rate. The August 2014 GAO report suggested increasing the retention rate for state agencies collecting on claims resulting from fraud, like recipient trafficking, to enhance efforts in combating trafficking. This strategy could lead to net savings for SNAP if increased collections outweigh the increased amount states receive in retentions. USDA-FNS oversees state agency administration of SNAP and may require statutory changes for implementation. USDA-FNS conducts management evaluations on high and low priority areas in SNAP. If a state agency is non-compliant, a corrective action plan is developed. USDA-FNS created a \"recipient integrity\" evaluation in response to a 2012 report. State agencies investigate recipient trafficking, while USDA-FNS investigates retailer trafficking. Collusion between recipients and retailers is a significant cause of trafficking. Collusion between recipients and retailers is a significant cause of trafficking. State agencies face challenges in investigating retailer trafficking due to delayed notification from USDA-FNS, leading to difficulties in surveillance and evidence collection. Providing advance notice to state agencies regarding ongoing investigations may compromise the integrity of the cases. USDA-FNS investigations of retailers may jeopardize proceedings as different burdens of proof apply to retailer and recipient trafficking cases. Disqualifying a SNAP retailer requires meeting a lower burden of proof, while disqualifying a SNAP recipient for fraud requires a higher burden of proof. Evidence sufficient for proving retailer trafficking may not be enough for recipient trafficking cases. In FY2016, a permanent disqualification was based on suspicious transaction patterns analyzed using the ALERT system. EBT transaction data alone is often insufficient for disqualifying SNAP recipients. Grants for integrity activities were awarded in FY2014 and FY2015 but not in FY2016 or FY2017. USDA-FNS is developing a \"SNAP Fraud Framework\" to prevent fraud, launching in FY2018 with grant opportunities for states. USDA-FNS plans to launch the SNAP Fraud Framework in FY2018, offering states grant opportunities to implement it. Retailers submit applications with owners' personal information, including SSNs. USDA-OIG found 3,394 stores with owners using SSNs matching deceased individuals in a January 2017 report. USDA-OIG found 3,394 stores with owners using SSA-DMF matched SSNs. USDA-FNS does not verify retailer-submitted SSNs against the SSA-DMF due to statutory restrictions. USDA-FNS plans to implement a new workflow process for ongoing SSN checks if granted authority. In July 2013, USDA-OIG recommended USDA-FNS use MOUs with state licensing agencies to verify retailer information. Instead, USDA-FNS tested data brokers in 2014 but found low ROI due to inability to use SSNs. Store owners with certain convictions are denied SNAP authorization, but USDA-FNS can't verify if retailers falsify information. A 2008 USDA-OIG report suggested using the Interstate. The USDA-OIG reports recommended using the Interstate Identification Index for background checks on SNAP retailers. USDA-FNS agreed to require high-risk retailers to provide self-initiated background checks, but lacks the authority to compel all applicants. The proposed rulemaking action is currently inactive. The USDA-FNS proposed rule changes for SNAP retailers include penalties for failing to report ownership changes and denying applications for disqualified recipients. The rulemaking action is currently inactive. The USDA-FNS proposed adding recipient fraud to business integrity standards for SNAP retailers. Data matches with eDRS are needed to determine disqualifications, but statutory restrictions on SSN use pose implementation challenges. Illegal retailer-to-retailer transfers of SNAP authorization are prohibited. USDA-FNS proposed penalties for retailers involved in illegal SNAP authorization transfers, including permanent ineligibility and fines. Retailers failing to pay fines may have their authorization withdrawn based on business integrity standards. USDA-FNS proposed penalties for retailers failing to pay fines, allowing denial or withdrawal of authorization. GAO recommended restructuring financial incentives to encourage effective pre-certification investigations to prevent fraud. State agencies allocated minimal resources to pre-certification investigations based on FY2016 data. In FY2016, five state agencies conducted extensive pre-certification investigations, accounting for 96% of all investigations despite serving only 32% of SNAP participants. These efforts resulted in $369 million in prevented improper federal expenditure. However, recovering overpayments from poor and near-poor households remains challenging, with states improving the rate of claims establishment but not collection efforts. The total annual dollar value of claims established has increased to 28% of estimated overpayments, showing increased activity by state agencies. However, the total annual dollar value of claims collected remains at 16%, indicating persistent difficulties in collection. States' struggles in collecting overpayments raise concerns about resource availability for investigations. Duplicate enrollment is prohibited, but it may still occur. Duplicate enrollment, also known as \"dual participation,\" can lead to a 10-year disqualification from SNAP for intentional fraud. Some states detect duplicate enrollment by sharing data with neighboring states. The National Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC) was created to prevent duplicate enrollment by analyzing SNAP state data from five participating states. The NAC was initially funded as a pilot project from April 2013 to May 2015 by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Since the pilot ended, the five states have continued NAC operations to identify and prevent duplicate enrollment. In 2015, five states continued NAC operations to prevent duplicate enrollment in SNAP. An evaluation in October 2015 showed that NAC reduced duplicate enrollment by almost 50% within a year, saving $548,336 in monthly overpayments. The monthly state agency work effort costs were $81,913, resulting in $6.69 in monthly overpayments prevented for every $1.00 spent. The estimated annualized savings from using NAC in the first year was $5,597,076. In 2015, NAC saved $5,597,076 annually, with startup costs of $1,652,287 for five states. Nationalizing NAC could result in $114,072,753 in yearly savings. The House proposed expanding NAC to all states, but it was not included in the final law. States must verify household data for SNAP applications. Expanding states' use of additional data matches for verifying household data in SNAP applications can be costly and burdensome for state agencies. While using high-fidelity sources is preferred, less authoritative data matches may lead to errors and require more employee hours. State agencies prefer verified upon receipt data matches to minimize costs and delays, but only one of the six federally required databases is considered verified upon receipt. Some states find the implementation of these data matches burdensome. The implementation of data matches is burdensome for state agencies with minimal cost avoidance. Anecdotal evidence suggests limited return on investment for non-verified data matches. USDA-OIG audits found improper handling of mandatory SSA-PVS data matches in five states. Some states choose not to perform mandatory matches due to perceived low return on investment. While some optional data matches are considered worthwhile, others are underutilized. State agencies find SSA benefit program databases useful. State agencies find SSA benefit program databases useful for verifying unearned income data, but not all utilize state systems for eligibility and income verification. Some face statutory obstacles in using federal data sources like the CMS Hub. Concerns arise about duplicate payments for data matching services for SNAP and Medicaid beneficiaries. Certain states have piloted data sharing agreements in 2017 to address these issues. Earned income verification through data matching poses challenges and costs. The USDA-FNS has proposed a single contract for state agencies to verify earned income data at a reduced cost. However, there are concerns about the lack of encouragement for state agencies to adopt best practices in data matching. The QC system's vulnerability lies in its \"two-tier\" structure, allowing states to manipulate outcomes. The USDA-FNS proposed a one-tier QC process to prevent fraud in the system, but noted it could increase federal costs. USDA-OIG recommended this change due to states' potential motive to manipulate outcomes for financial gain. USDA-FNS had initiated new rules in response to federal law and audit findings, but none had been completed before their actions were suspended.

Regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) requires submitting a regulatory work plan to OMB, publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register, and considering public comments before publishing the final rule. USDA rules were made public in July 2017 by the Trump Administration and termed \"inactive.\" During the SNAP certification process, states use various data sources to verify household income data, including optional matches with SSA databases. These matches are considered useful by all state agencies surveyed in 2016. State agencies can match with SSA-BEER and HHS-ACF-PARIS to verify income and public assistance data. SSA-BEER match is conducted by 24 state agencies, while HHS-ACF-PARIS match is conducted by 40 state agencies. HHS-ACF-PARIS match is considered useful by 31 state agencies. The HHS-ACF-PARIS Federal/VA File matches are conducted by 31 state agencies and considered useful by 20. The Work Number is a commercial verification service used by 45 state agencies and considered useful by 43. HHS-ACF National Directory of New Hires includes Unemployment Insurance and Quarterly Wage Files for income verification. The Wage File compiles non-verified earned income data from state workforce agencies. State agencies can also conduct verified data matches with State Unemployment Insurance Benefits and Child Support Payments Databases to verify applicants' unearned income. These matches are considered useful by a majority of state agencies surveyed. State agencies can match with SWICAs that gather wage and new hire data to verify applicants' income. This is similar to the HHS-ACF-NDNH. SWICA matches are considered useful by 46 out of 51 state agencies. State agencies can match with state taxation agencies and state human or social services agencies to verify applicants' unearned and earned income. This data match is conducted by 7 and 42 of the 51 state agencies respectively. The database matching is considered useful by 38 agencies. From FY2007 to FY2016, convenience stores participating in SNAP grew from 36% to 46% of all stores. Convenience store retailer trafficking rates were over 1000% of the national rates, and violation rates were over 150% of the national rates. Table D-3 shows convenience store shares of redemptions and trafficking, with convenience stores averaging more than half of total trafficking. Appendix E provides state-by-state payment error data from FY2010-FY2014, including state payment error rates and bonuses. Alabama received a bonus in FY2012 with a 1.85% SPER. In FY2012, Alabama received a $1.9 million bonus based on a 1.85% SPER."
