    "content": "The Act titled \"Behavioral Health Care Integration Act of 2016\" amends the Public Health Service Act to establish Integration Incentive Grants for primary and behavioral health care integration programs. The Secretary will establish a grant program for primary and behavioral health care integration, awarding funds for improvements in integrated settings with merged practices. Integrated care involves full collaboration in shared practice spaces, ensuring prompt and dignified services with consistent team-based communication. The grant program for primary and behavioral health care integration aims to establish team-based care with shared decision-making, evidence-based services, culturally competent staff, integrated screening and treatment services, and targeted case management for accessing necessary services. The integrated care team includes medical doctors, behavioral health professionals, case managers, and other allied health professionals to provide services for special populations. Special populations include adults and children with mental illnesses or serious emotional disorders, older adults with mental illness, individuals with substance use disorder, and populations facing significant healthcare disparities. The grant program aims to address disparities in mental health and substance use services for special populations, promoting collaboration between primary and behavioral health for integrated care models. The grant program targets disparities in mental health and substance use services for special populations by supporting integration of behavioral health into primary care settings. Eligible entities include State departments of health, mental health or addiction agencies, Medicaid agencies, and licensed healthcare providers. Preference may be given to States with existing integrated care models. Application for grants or cooperative agreements must be submitted by eligible entities. Entities applying for a cooperative agreement must submit an application to the Administrator with a plan for collaborative agreements to serve special populations. This includes addressing state-specific barriers to integrated care and developing a patient registry to track treatment outcomes while complying with privacy laws. The maximum annual grant amount under this section is $2,000,000, with a 5-year duration. Recipients must report on reducing barriers to integrated care and functional outcomes of special populations. Functional outcomes of special populations include participation in supportive housing, independent living programs, social or education activities, job training, employment opportunities, attendance at medical and mental health appointments, compliance with treatment plans, and engagement in learning opportunities related to improved health and lifestyle practices. The program aims to provide information, training, and technical assistance to entities receiving grants to help special populations with serious emotional disorders and co-occurring conditions improve their health outcomes and lifestyle practices. The technical assistance program aims to help entities meet requirements by providing support in developing integrated care models, disseminating evidence-based interventions, establishing organizational practices, and other activities as determined by the Secretary. Information and resources from the program will be available to States, political subdivisions, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act authorizes funding for various healthcare organizations, including outpatient mental health and addiction treatment centers, community mental health centers, certified community behavioral health clinics, and primary care organizations. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2021, with $2,000,000 allocated for a technical assistance program."
