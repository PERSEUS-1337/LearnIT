The tradition of creating personalized Congressional Gold Medals has a rich history, with no permanent statutory provisions specifically outlining their creation. Special actions by Congress are taken to authorize the production of these medals, which bear the portraits or actions of the honorees. The Congressional Gold Medal is a prestigious award given by Congress to honor distinguished achievements. The tradition dates back to the late 1700s, with the first medals being issued by the Continental Congress. The medals are considered rare and valuable, symbolizing the highest achievements. The first gold medals were struck in Paris under the direction of Colonel David Humphrey. Congress commissions gold medals as tributes for exceptional accomplishments, with silver and bronze medals also being awarded. The Congressional Gold Medal is a prestigious award given by Congress to honor distinguished achievements. The first gold medal was authorized in 1776 for George Washington for his leadership in the Revolutionary War. Additional gold medals were awarded to military leaders during the next 12 years. The gold medal awarded to Major Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee for his bravery during a raid in New Jersey was the first to be struck in the United States. After the first Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to George Washington in 1776 for his leadership in the Revolutionary War, subsequent medals were given to military leaders. Captain Thomas Truxtun and Commodore Edward Preble received the first two medals in 1800 for their gallant efforts in naval battles. Congress then awarded medals primarily for military achievements in the War of 1812 and the Mexican War. General Zachary Taylor and General Winfield Scott led expeditions that earned them Congressional Gold Medals. In 1854, Congress expanded the criteria for awarding the medal prompted by Commander Duncan N. Ingraham's actions aboard the USS St. Louis. The Congressional Gold Medal was initially awarded for military achievements, but in 1854, the criteria expanded to include nonmilitary heroic activities. Gold medals were issued to individuals like Cornelius Vanderbilt, Cyrus W. Field, and Private George F. Robinson for their contributions. The scope of the Congressional Gold Medal continued to broaden in the 20th and 21st centuries to include recognition in various fields such as the arts. The Congressional Gold Medal expanded to recognize excellence in diverse fields such as arts, athletics, aviation, diplomacy, entertainment, exploration, medicine, politics, religion, and science. Notable recipients include George M. Cohan for patriotic songs, the Wright brothers for aerial navigation, Lincoln Ellsworth for polar flights, Walter Reed for yellow fever research, and Alben W. Barkley as the first political honoree. In 1921, Vice President Alben W. Barkley was the first political honoree of the Congressional Gold Medal. Since then, numerous individuals have been honored for various contributions, including civil rights activism and humanitarian efforts. The process for considering legislation for the medal varies between the House and Senate, with no specific rules in the House regarding gold medal bills. The process for considering Congressional Gold Medal legislation varies between the House and Senate. In the House, legislation must be cosponsored by at least two-thirds of members, while in the Senate, at least 67 Senators must cosponsor a bill before it is considered by the committee. However, many enacted gold medal bills in the Senate receive no formal committee consideration. In the Senate, the discharge of a bill from committee is often done by unanimous consent after the required number of cosponsors sign on. Congressional Gold Medals are created through ad hoc legislative action without permanent statutory provisions. There is no limit on the number of medals that can be struck in a year, and the legislation typically includes findings on the recipient's history, awarding specifications, and design instructions. Congressional Gold Medal legislation includes details for awarding the medal, design instructions, permission to mint duplicates, and certification requirements. Findings in the legislation often provide historical facts about the recipients. The Rights March in March of 1965 legislation authorizes the Smithsonian to display and loan the gold medal. The legislation also allows for the Secretary of the Treasury to strike and sell duplicate medals in bronze, with duplicates sold in two sizes. Gold medal legislation generally considers these awards as national medals for the U.S. Mint's statutory requirements. The U.S. Mint produces national medals as authorized by legislation, with specific funds allocated for the cost of the medal. Designs vary for each Congressional Gold Medal issuance, with proceeds from duplicate sales deposited back into the Mint Public Enterprise Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury consults with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) when designing a Congressional Gold Medal. The CCAC advises on theme and design, consisting of 11 members appointed by the Secretary, with input from congressional leadership. They meet regularly to consider design suggestions for coins and medals. The CCAC advises the Secretary of the Treasury on thematic, technical, and design issues for coins. Recommendations are published on the committee's website. The U.S. Mint also seeks recommendations from the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts for coin designs. The CFA advises on the selection of artists and art-related matters for statues, fountains, and monuments in the District of Columbia. The U.S. Mint presents alternative designs for Congressional Gold Medals, with recommendations from the CFA. The Secretary of the Treasury finalizes the design after input from the CCAC and CFA. Congressional Gold Medal measures may be considered by Congress, raising various issues for individual Members. Individual issues for Members of Congress regarding Congressional Gold Medals include choices on who to honor and design elements. Institutional issues involve committee rules and standards for issuing gold medals. Recipients range from individuals like Arnold Palmer to larger groups like military units. Members evaluate whom or what to recognize based on their beliefs. Congressional Gold Medals are awarded to individuals or groups for national achievements in patriotic, humanitarian, and artistic endeavors. There are no specific criteria for eligibility, with each case judged on its merits by Congress. Design elements for the medals are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, unless specified in the authorizing legislation. The Secretary of the Treasury works with congressional intent to design the gold medal, which may limit design choices and affect costs. Congressional Gold Medal legislation typically specifies where the medal will be located after being awarded, often at the Smithsonian or with an organization representing the honored group. Members of Congress can help determine the medal's location. Congress can help determine the location of the Congressional Gold Medal. In the 116th Congress, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs requires at least 67 Senators to cosponsor a Senate Congressional Gold Medal bill before it is considered. The House Financial Services Committee does not have specific rules for considering Congressional Gold Medal legislation, but has required a minimum number of cosponsors in the past. Committee rules can be changed from Congress to Congress. The Financial Services Committee may adopt rules requiring a minimum number of cosponsors for gold medal legislation, potentially limiting the bills considered. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs has a rule for cosponsors, leading to different paths for bills in each chamber. Adoption of similar language for consideration could occur in the House, Senate, or both. Formal codification of the gold medal consideration process could streamline award consideration for sponsors, but it may also restrict congressional flexibility and reduce the number of proposals. Congress could establish limits on the number of Congressional Gold Medals awarded each year or in total, similar to standards set for commemorative coins. Legislation has been introduced to limit the number of gold medals authorized, with a bill passing the House during the 109th Congress. The purpose was to maintain the prestige of the medal by restricting the number awarded each year to individuals, not groups. The bill did not progress in the Senate. Opponents argue that Congress should have the right to authorize as many gold medals as needed, without restrictions on the number issued each year. Representative Joseph Crowley believes rushing to limit medals is unnecessary, as there are deserving recipients who may be overlooked. He points out that restricting medals could have prevented honoring individuals like the Little Rock Nine, President and Mrs. Reagan, and Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King. Congressional Gold Medals are a significant way for Congress to show appreciation for historical events and achievements. The number of medals awarded has increased in recent decades. Each Congress introduces legislation to award these medals, with a notable increase in bills introduced in the 113th, 114th, and 115th Congresses. In 2017-2018, 55 bills were introduced in Congress to award gold medals, recognizing patriotic, humanitarian, and artistic achievements. Considerations include who should be honored, how many medals to award, and the design elements. These factors will continue to be important as Congress considers future gold medal legislation."
