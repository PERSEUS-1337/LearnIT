    "content": "The Administration's proposal to reduce the size of the Army and restructure units and headquarters has national security implications for Congress to consider in terms of setting endstrength, authorizing funds for restructuring, and impacting local defense-related industries and communities. The Administration's decision to reduce the size of the Army was influenced by the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and the plan to hand over security responsibilities in Afghanistan. This drawdown and restructuring process began in early 2011, with additional details provided in January 2012. In January 2012, the Administration announced force structure and global posture changes, including reducing Army endstrength by 27,000 troops starting in 2015. Secretary Gates mentioned excess force structure in Europe but no immediate action would be taken. In January 2012, senior DOD leaders unveiled a new defense strategy focused on a smaller, agile, and technologically advanced military. The strategy aimed to rebalance global posture, with emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East, while maintaining presence in Europe, Africa, and Latin America through partnerships and alliances. This included reducing Army endstrength by 27,000 troops starting in 2015, with an additional 22,000 troops being divested by 2013. The Army force structure decisions highlighted during the briefing include sustaining Army structure in the Pacific, adjusting posture in Europe by eliminating two forward-stationed Army brigades, maintaining NATO commitments, and reducing Active Army endstrength from 570,000 to 490,000 troops in the Future Year Defense Plan. The Army will reduce its force from 570,000 to 490,000 troops in the Future Year Defense Plan. It aims to preserve expertise in security force assistance and counterinsurgency, retain a more senior force for potential growth, maintain organizational structure and training force, sustain readiness, and maintain key combat capabilities. Additionally, commitments include maintaining a significant land force presence in Korea and an operationally responsive presence in the Middle East. The President plans to use the BRAC process to restructure forces overseas. The Army will focus on full-spectrum training, develop versatile capabilities, and align a BCT with each combatant command. General Odierno mentioned 90,000 soldiers deployed and 96,000 forward-stationed overseas. The Active Army will reduce from 570,000 to 490,000 soldiers by 2017, with minimal changes to the National Guard and Reserve. The Army plans to reduce its endstrength to 490,000 soldiers by 2017, with a focus on maintaining a combat-seasoned force and investing in special operations and cyber capabilities. They also aim to improve command and control capabilities, modularize brigade combat teams, increase aviation assets, and leverage lessons learned from 10 years of combat. Additionally, they plan to eliminate at least eight Active Duty BCTs and remove two armored BCTs from Europe.

Additionally, they plan to eliminate at least eight Active Duty BCTs and remove two armored BCTs from Europe. The Army also stated that two ABCTs would be removed from Europe and not re-stationed in the United States but instead eliminated from Army force structure. The V Corps Headquarters would not return to Europe after its deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom in late FY2013, and two ABCTs would be inactivated (the 170th BCT in FY2013 and the 172nd BCT in FY2014). Additional Army enabler forces, potentially around 2,500 soldiers, could be reduced from Europe as part of the Total Army Analysis process. Press reports suggested the Army might cut more than eight BCTs Army-wide. The Army plans to reduce its endstrength to 490,000 soldiers by 2017, focusing on maintaining a combat-seasoned force and investing in special operations and cyber capabilities. Additional cuts to BCTs and ABCTs are expected, with a reorganization of the BCT's structure. The 170th ABCT and 172nd ABCT stationed in Germany have already been eliminated. Forces in the Pacific will remain at current levels, with plans to keep Stryker, infantry, and aviation units in Hawaii. The Active Army is realigning and restructuring to no longer be sized for large stability operations. The Army is restructuring its forces, reducing endstrength to 490,000 soldiers by 2017. They plan to maintain a combat-seasoned force, invest in special operations and cyber capabilities, and realign to no longer be sized for large stability operations. Changes include sustaining Army force structure in the Pacific, maintaining a presence in the Middle East, rotating forces through Europe, allocating a U.S.-based heavy brigade to the NATO Response Force, aligning a brigade combat team (BCT) with each geographic combatant command for engagement operations, and examining BCTs for optimal design which could lead to further reductions.

Changes include maintaining a combat-seasoned force, investing in special operations and cyber capabilities, and realigning to no longer be sized for large stability operations. Additionally, there are plans to realign bases in the United States through a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, potentially requiring some Army units to move to new or existing bases. The Army is restructuring its forces, reducing endstrength to 490,000 soldiers by 2017. Plans include maintaining a combat-seasoned force, investing in special operations and cyber capabilities, and realigning bases in the United States through a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. This may require some Army units to move to new or existing bases, including establishing smaller bases for rotational forces. The fate of Army bases at Baumholder and Grafenwohr is uncertain. Specifics on reductions in Reserve Component endstrength and maintaining readiness and support capabilities remain unspecified. The Pentagon's decision to cut the active force by 80,000 soldiers would increase reliance on the National Guard and Reserves in case of two major long-term combat operations. The United States would need to keep its reserve forces at a higher state of readiness. General Odierno suggested that in the event of fighting two large, simultaneous, long-term wars, the US would rely more on allies and mobilize reserves on a large scale. A new readiness model would be needed to maintain the National Guard and Reserves at a higher state of readiness. The Department of Defense announced force structure changes for the U.S. Army in Europe, with elements of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team relocating within Germany and to Italy in 2013. Four battalions will be relocated, with two moving from Germany to Italy and two from Germany to Grafenwoehr, Germany. Additionally, V Corps Headquarters and the 170th and 172nd Infantry will be inactivated. In addition to the previously announced inactivation of V Corps Headquarters and the 170th and 172nd Infantry Brigades, 2,500 enabling forces will be affected as follows: In 2012, the 170th Infantry Brigade and 167th Medical Detachment were inactivated. In 2013, several units in Germany were inactivated, while some returned to the United States or Italy. In 2014, several units in Germany were inactivated, including engineer and signal battalions, military police companies, and an engineer company. Additionally, some units returned to the United States. In 2015 and 2016, various military units in Germany were inactivated and returned to the United States, including engineer, military police, and aviation regiments. The restructuring also involved reducing soldier spaces in specific locations. Information on other units in closing military communities will be provided soon as part of the ongoing DOD resource restructure. The Army announced force structure decisions and stationing plans in response to fiscal constraints, including reducing Active Component BCTs from 45 to 33 and reorganizing Infantry and Armored BCTs. Additional force reductions may be necessary if funding cuts continue. The Army announced the elimination of 10 BCTs in addition to previously announced cuts, leaving the Army with 12 Armored BCTs, 14 Infantry BCTs, and seven Stryker BCTs. The reductions also include reorganizing non-BCT units to address fiscal constraints. The Army is reducing non-BCT units as part of the drawdown due to budget constraints. Sequestration and funding threats are leading to significant cuts in end-strength, readiness, and modernization. The downsizing of the Army's active component end-strength to 490K by FY15 is being accelerated. Maintaining a certain number of units at a higher readiness level is necessary to meet contingency requirements. The Army plans to accelerate the drawdown by reducing almost 42,000 soldiers by September 2015. This will involve involuntary separation programs, leading to turbulence for soldiers and their families. Approximately 5,000 officers and 20,000 enlisted soldiers with good service records will be forced to leave active duty. The Army plans to convene reduction-in-force boards for captains and majors in over strength year groups in early 2014. The Army National Guard is reorganizing six of its 28 BCTs this fiscal year, with the goal of matching its primary fighting formations with those in the active Army. Each BCT will receive a third maneuver battalion, additional engineer and fires capabilities, and once completed, will have enhanced capabilities. The Army National Guard is reorganizing six of its BCTs this fiscal year to align with the active Army, adding soldiers and enhancing capabilities. Plans include reorganizing more BCTs in the following years to decrease costs. Army leadership is considering cutting up to 25% of personnel in two-star and above headquarters, including Army Forces Command and Training and Doctrine Command. This also applies to Army corps, division headquarters, and service component commands like Army Africa and Army Pacific. The cuts would involve soldiers, Army civilians, and contractors over five years. The Administration's FY2015 Budget Guidance aims to reduce the active duty force to 420,000 soldiers, Army National Guard to 315,000, and Army Reserve to 185,000 by FY2019, resulting in 24 BCTs for the Active Component and 22 BCTs for the Army National Guard.

This would involve soldiers, Army civilians, and contractors over five years. The Administration's FY2015 Budget Guidance aims to decrease the active duty force to 420,000 soldiers, Army National Guard to 315,000, and Army Reserve to 185,000 by FY2019, resulting in 24 BCTs for the Active Component and 22 BCTs for the Army National Guard. The Army believes that a force structure of 24 AC and 22 RC BCTs lacks the capacity for major combat operations, defense at home, presence in critical regions, and retaining a Global Response Force. A force of 450,000 Active Component, 335,000 Army National Guard, and 195,000 Army Reserve with 28 active BCTs and 24 reserve BCTs is considered the \"smallest acceptable force\" to implement the defense strategy. If the Army reduces to 420,000 active duty force level, issues may arise from eliminating additional BCTs and enabling forces, leading to more aggressive separation programs. The Army is proposing restructuring Army aviation brigades by eliminating airframes/fleets, consolidating AH-64 Apache attack helicopters in the Active Component, transferring LUH-72 Lakota light utility helicopters to Ft. Rucker, AL, and employing AH-64s in an armed scout role. The Army is proposing to restructure Army aviation by transferring light utility helicopters to Ft. Rucker, AL for training purposes and moving UH-60 Blackhawks to the National Guard for disaster relief operations. The National Guard Association objects to the proposal, citing the loss of attack and reconnaissance capabilities with the elimination of AH-64s. The Army is proposing to restructure Army aviation by transferring light utility helicopters to Ft. Rucker, AL for training purposes and moving UH-60 Blackhawks to the National Guard for disaster relief operations. Secretary of Defense Hagel emphasized the need for a highly ready and capable Army, leading to a planned reduction in active-duty soldiers from 520,000 to 490,000. This decision was influenced by the Strategic Choices and Management Review and the QDR, which determined that a smaller force size is sufficient for current demands. The Army is planning to reduce its active-duty end-strength to 440-450,000 soldiers and terminate the Ground Combat Vehicle program to focus on developing a next-generation platform. This decision aims to ensure a well-trained and superior Army, capable of decisively defeating aggression despite the added risk of extended or simultaneous ground operations. If sequestration-level cuts are re-imposed in 2016, the active-duty Army would have to draw down to an end strength of 420,000 soldiers, with the Army National Guard and Reserves also reducing their numbers. The Army National Guard would decrease to 335,000 soldiers and the Reserves to 195,000 soldiers by 2017, with further reductions to 315,000 and 185,000 respectively if sequestration returns. The goal is to maintain a ready and capable force while facing budget constraints. The recommended reduction in Guard and Reserve soldiers is smaller than the reduction in active-duty soldiers. While some argue for protecting the reserve component from cuts due to cost-effectiveness, the defense strategy prioritizes readiness, capability, and agility over sheer numbers. Analysis shows that reserve units are roughly the same cost as active duty units when mobilized and deployed. The cost-effectiveness of reserve units is comparable to active-duty units when mobilized and deployed. Specialties requiring extensive training for combat proficiency and service integration should be in the full-time force. Guard and Reserve units complement the active force, with recommendations to transfer Apache attack helicopters to active-duty units and Blackhawk helicopters to the National Guard for disaster relief and emergency response capabilities. The Army is realigning its aviation fleet to modernize and increase capability while reducing costs. The Kiowas and \"JetRanger\" training helicopters will be retired, leading to a 25% decrease in the Active Army's fleet. The Guard's fleet will decrease by 8% but will gain new Blackhawks. The Guard's helicopter force will still be important for operational and strategic needs, as well as for homeland defense and disaster relief. If sequestration-level cuts are reinstated in 2016, 50 helicopters may need to be cut from the Guard force. The Army is realigning its aviation fleet to modernize and increase capability while reducing costs. The Guard's helicopter force will still be important for operational and strategic needs, as well as for homeland defense and disaster relief. Military drawdowns have historically had a negative impact on morale and military careers. During the recent post-Cold War drawdown, Congress implemented voluntary and involuntary tools to shape the military force, emphasizing voluntary separations with financial incentives. Every soldier was at risk of separation, and resources were focused on transition assistance for military alumni. U.S. military forces have been engaged in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the past decade. The deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have been long and frequent, with limited dwell time between rotations. Service members have faced high levels of stress, leading to increased divorce and suicide rates. Despite this, they have received consistent support from the American public and political leaders, who often refer to them as \"America's Heroes\" and \"Wounded Warriors.\" The military is transitioning from combat operations to training and downsizing, which may impact morale and unit effectiveness. Leaders need to refocus to minimize negative impacts. The military is transitioning from combat operations to training and downsizing, which may impact morale and unit effectiveness. The focus will be on reducing accessions to minimize negative implications. The military acquires new personnel annually based on congressionally established endstrength. The Army recruited 75,000 to 80,000 enlisted soldiers annually during OIF/OEF to reach a target strength of 562,000. However, they must reduce to 490,000 by FY2017, requiring a reduction of 72,000. The accessions program could absorb a decrease of nearly 15,000 per year while still maintaining force readiness and training standards. Congress authorized increased enrollment at the U.S. Military Academy and expanded Officer Candidate School and ROTC programs to address the changing force size. The Army announced a Selective Early Retirement Board to involuntarily retire up to 30% of Active Duty Colonels and Lieutenant Colonels due to high retention rates and a reduction in officer requirements among senior officers. This excess of Colonels and Lieutenant Colonels may result in a reduction of officer accessions, potentially affecting the size of the Reserve Officer Training Corps program. The Army announced a Selective Early Retirement Board to involuntarily retire up to 30% of Active Duty Colonels and Lieutenant Colonels due to high retention rates. The SERB will consider eligible officers for early retirement based on the best interest of the Army. In order to maintain mid-grade leaders for future ground war readiness, the Army plans to retain about 90,000 soldiers from its non-operational forces. The Army plans to reduce end-strength by 80,000 soldiers from the operational Army, considering placing mid-grade leaders in Army educational institutions. Secretary of Defense Hagel recommends reducing active-duty Army end-strength to 440-450,000 soldiers. If sequestration-level cuts are re-imposed in 2016, the Army would draw down to 420,000 soldiers. The active-duty Army plans to reduce end-strength to 420,000 soldiers, with the Army National Guard and Reserves also drawing down. By 2017, the Army National Guard would have 335,000 soldiers and the Reserves 195,000. If sequestration returns in 2016, the Army National Guard would further decrease to 315,000 and the Reserves to 185,000. Army leadership considers a 420,000 soldier force insufficient to implement the defense strategy. General Raymond Odierno stated that having 450,000 active soldiers is necessary for the Army's capabilities, as the last 30,000 makes a significant difference. The Army argues that a force of 450,000 is needed to execute the nation's defense strategy, despite the proposed reduction to 420,000. Further examination and discussion on these force levels may be required, including a detailed review of the Army's process to reach the minimum acceptable level of 450,000 soldiers. The Army's active soldier minimum requirement of 450,000 is crucial for executing the nation's defense strategy. Army leadership believes that having a minimum of 52 BCTs is necessary, with 28 active and 24 Army National Guard units included in the plan. A comprehensive examination and discussion with Congress could lead to a better understanding of the Army's position and potentially identify alternative active component endstrength. The Army and National Guard have differing views on the force structure needed to meet defense strategy requirements. The debate centers around the number of BCTs and the balance between the Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC). Advocates for a larger reserve component argue that it is cost-effective, but Pentagon leadership warns that relying too heavily on the RC could jeopardize national security due to lower readiness levels. The debate over the force structure between the Army and National Guard revolves around the balance of Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC). Some suggest moving mission-essential AC units to the RC for cost efficiency, a sensitive issue due to strong constituencies. The Army argues that AC forces are best suited for unpredictable operations due to their high readiness levels. The Army notes the need for predictability to build RC readiness, requiring 80 to 195 preparation days for deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Training many units to battalion or brigade level proficiency makes it difficult to incorporate RC units into early operation phases. Transferring AC units to RC for cost-saving could limit availability for short-notice operations and increase military risk. Congress is interested in examining Army force mix in detail. The National Commission on the Structure of the Army, referred to the House Armed Services Committee in 2014, calls for a comprehensive study to determine the proper force mixture of the active and reserve components. The Association of the U.S. Army views the commission as unnecessary, but congressional involvement in the Army force mix debate could be beneficial. The debate on involuntary separation in the defense community is timely, with Title 10 authorities allowing for selective early retirement of senior officers who have not been promoted. These tools were sparingly used post-Cold War and require approval from the Secretary concerned. The Army has various involuntary programs for downsizing officer cohorts, including the Selective Early Retirement Board (SERB) and Reduction-in-Force (RIF). SERB targets those with 20 or more years of service, while RIF is for those with 6 to 20 years of service. The 2012 Enlisted Qualitative Service Program (QSP) was initiated for staff sergeant through command sergeant major grades. The 2012 Enlisted Qualitative Service Program (QSP) offers voluntary separation for soldiers in the grades of staff sergeant through command sergeant major. Title 10 Drawdown Authorities provide voluntary retirement incentives for retirement-eligible servicemembers with 20-29 years of service. The Title 10 Drawdown Authorities offer retirement incentives for servicemembers with 20-29 years of service, capped at 675 officers, expiring on December 31, 2018. The Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI) is for those with 6-20 years of service, with an annual annuity formula based on monthly basic pay and years of service, ending on December 31, 2001. The VSI program, terminated in 2001, was reinstated by the FY2012 NDAA until 2018. The Special Separation Bonus (SSB) is a lump sum payment for eligible Armed Forces members with 6-20 years of service. VSI and SSB were complementary programs, with VSI being an annuity program and SSB a lump sum payment. The Temporary Early Retirement Authority (TERA) allows eligible military personnel to retire before completing 20 years of service. TERA retirees have their retired pay reduced for every year less than 20 but remain eligible for retired pay, military healthcare, commissary privileges, and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation activities. The program was reauthorized in 2012 and began in 2011. The Voluntary Early Release/Retirement Program (VEERP) was implemented as part of the FY2012 NDAA, targeting junior and senior officers for early retirement or resignation with reduced service obligations. Junior officers could resign before fulfilling their active duty obligation, while senior officers could retire at their current rank with waived retirement eligibility criteria. This program was originally authorized in the FY1991 NDAA. The FY2012 NDAA expanded the authority for \"Early Outs\" allowing Service Secretaries to discharge enlisted servicemembers up to one year before the end of their term of enlistment with no loss of benefits. Members taking advantage of this opportunity are not entitled to pay and allowances for the period not served. Enlisted Retention Control Points are used to separate personnel who do not progress in a timely manner before the end of their term of service. Retention control points dictate how long a servicemember can stay at their current rank before being promoted. Failure to promote in a timely manner can lead to separation before the end of their term of service. Officer promotion non-selection can result in involuntary separation if an officer fails to promote after being considered twice for the next higher grade. During the OIF/OEF period, many non-selected officers were allowed to continue in their current grade due to high promotion selection rates. During the OIF/OEF period, there were high promotion selection rates and reduced time-in-grade before promotion consideration. However, with the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, the services are now enforcing promotion and retention standards. The Air Force recently separated 157 majors who were twice non-selected for promotion. Appendix B provides a brief history of past Army drawdowns post-World War II. The Army's post-World War II demobilization plans aimed for an Active and Reserve structure capable of mobilizing 4 million troops within a year of a future war outbreak. The demobilization process involved releasing troops based on point credits for various criteria like length of service, combat participation, and time spent overseas. Pressure for faster demobilization came from the public, Congress, and the availability of shipping and processing capacity for discharged soldiers. The Army responded to pressure for faster demobilization by easing eligibility requirements and releasing half of its 8 million troops by the end of 1945. Public opposition decreased after the Army reduced its strength by more than half in the first six months of 1946. President Truman's efforts to balance the national budget led to a new maximum Army strength of just over 1 million in FY1947, achieved by stopping draft calls and releasing eligible troops. By June 1947, the Army had 684,000 ground troops and 306,000 airmen, resulting in equipment deterioration. The post-war reduction saw a 93% manpower decrease from 1945 to 1950, with 10 divisions and half deployed overseas. In 1950, most U.S. military divisions were below authorized strength and lacked necessary equipment, leading to a weak response during the Korean War. Post-Vietnam, the Armed Forces were shaped to fight two and a half wars simultaneously. The Vietnam War led to the growth of the Army to over 1,570,000 soldiers in 1968, with a disproportionate number of lower-income and non-college-educated individuals. The perceived unfairness of the draft and the prolonged nature of the war contributed to the transition to the All-Volunteer Force in 1970 through a reduction in force initiative. In 1973, the U.S. Army underwent a transition to an all-volunteer force after the end of direct involvement in Vietnam. Despite efforts to remove low-performing soldiers, many good soldiers were released, leading to morale and discipline issues. The war's unpopularity also resulted in returning soldiers facing a hostile reception. The withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973 also marked a period of decreased defense budgets. In 1973, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger implemented the Total Force due to budget constraints, leading to a smaller Army with 13 Active Duty divisions. General Creighton Abrams believed this was insufficient for global requirements. The Army could only field 12 divisions, with 4 rated as \"combat ready.\" Abrams gained approval to increase active divisions to 16 without raising endstrength. The Total Force initiative increased the Army's active divisions to 16 without raising endstrength. This was achieved by shifting soldiers, assigning reserve brigades, and moving support units to the Reserve Component. Issues included manpower strain, poor Active-Reserve relationship, and heavy reliance on reserve forces for support. The \"hollow force\" of the mid-1970s and early 1980s recovered due to senior DOD leaders' arguments, congressional action, and the defense build-up under the Reagan Administration. In 1987, the Active Army... In 1987, the Active Army consisted of 780,815 personnel comprising 18 divisions, with 2 divisions still forming. The demise of the Soviet Union in late 1989 led to a \"peace dividend,\" resulting in a 30% cut in the Active Duty force to 535,000 soldiers, the smallest since 1939. This period saw a fundamental rethinking of U.S. defense policy and Army force structure, with a recommended force level of 15 divisions and 640,000 soldiers known as the \"BASE Force.\" In 1993, the Clinton Administration announced defense budget reductions of $88 billion from FY1994 to FY1997. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin initiated a Bottom Up Review to modify force structure based on threats to national security. The Bottom Up Review in 1993 recommended emphasizing U.S. air power, reducing Army endstrength to 495,000 soldiers, and maintaining the ability to fight two MTWs simultaneously. This led to Active Army endstrength reductions and the elimination of 2 out of 12 divisions."
