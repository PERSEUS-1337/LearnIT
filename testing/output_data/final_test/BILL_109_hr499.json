The Secretary of Commerce is responsible for identifying deficiencies in seismic stations worldwide to detect tsunamigenic earthquakes in real time. They must also collaborate with other departments to improve the US network of seismic stations for better detection capabilities. The Secretary of Commerce is tasked with identifying and deploying tsunami sensors globally to detect potential tsunamis from various disturbances like earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, and meteor impacts in oceans and seas for complete global coverage. The Secretary of Commerce is responsible for deploying tsunami sensors globally to detect tsunamis from earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, and meteor impacts in oceans and seas. This includes coordinating with regional systems, procuring sensors, establishing measurement and forecast systems, and disseminating warnings to potentially affected nations. Upon enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce must report to Congress on the progress of implementing the requirements outlined in subsection (a). INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GLOBAL TSUNAMI DETECTION AND WARNING. Congress suggests convening an international conference on global tsunami detection and warning within 180 days to prevent human loss from future disasters and establish effective funding and deployment methods. After an international conference on global tsunami detection and warning, the President may determine if an international agreement has been reached within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. NETWORK OF NATIONS POTENTIALLY AFFECTED BY TSUNAMIS. The Secretary of State, with the Secretary of Commerce, will develop a strategy to identify coastal nations at risk of tsunamis, work with organizations for disseminating warnings, and establish a Global Tsunami Warning structure with cooperating nations. The Global Tsunami Warning System will establish regional operational headquarters, a chain of command structure, and a forecasting system with early detection and monitoring instrumentation. The Global Tsunami Warning System aims to utilize forecasts for appropriate warnings, develop a communication system for rapid dissemination, collaborate with nations for educational and response planning partnerships, and seek funding assistance for sensor systems. The Secretary of State must report to Congress within 180 days on the strategy for funding sensor systems and their ongoing operation and maintenance. The report should detail the strategy and progress made in implementing it. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- Funds authorized for this Act:\n  - Fiscal year 2005: $30,000,000\n  - Fiscal years 2006-2014: $7,500,000 per year"
