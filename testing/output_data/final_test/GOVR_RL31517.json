    "content": "The Congressional Research Service sponsored a seminar in 2002 on lessons for U.S. policy from other countries' experiences in handling terrorism. Experts discussed policy lessons that the United States could draw from these countries, relevant to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations in 2004. The introduction summarizes key points on utility reform and Commission recommendations related to security, civil liberties, security risks, costs, international cooperation, and terrorist financing. The debate at the seminar focused on the need for economic, political, and social reforms in Muslim countries, particularly in education, with a controversial discussion on the effectiveness of these reforms in reducing terrorism levels. The seminar discussed how economic reforms did not decrease terrorism levels, with possible reasons including terrorists finding reforms counterproductive, intensifying activities during negotiations, government's inability to deliver needed reforms, and the timeframe of the study not being long enough to show true results. The seminar discussed the impact of economic reforms on terrorism levels. One speaker highlighted the importance of evaluating policies over time. There was a debate on addressing Islamist terrorism through long-term programs like secularized education. The idea of changing educational systems abroad to prevent terrorism was considered, with a comparison to the influence of education in diminishing the power of the Ku Klux Klan domestically. The educational system was seen as a significant factor in predicting terrorism occurrences. The seminar discussed the impact of economic reforms on terrorism levels, with a focus on evaluating policies over time. Speakers debated the influence of nationalist indoctrination in Northern Ireland's schools on separatist movements. The discussion also touched on the United States' policies in the Middle East and tradeoffs raised by the 9/11 Commission regarding security and civil liberties. The seminar discussed the importance of balancing security and liberty, emphasizing the need for good intelligence to minimize repressive tactics. Recommendations highlighted the challenges of evaluating risks with limited resources, particularly in protecting transportation assets. Despite efforts to prioritize high-risk targets, it was acknowledged that complete preparedness cannot prevent all terrorist incidents. The seminar emphasized the need for balancing security and liberty, highlighting the importance of good intelligence to minimize repressive tactics. Recommendations focused on evaluating risks in protecting transportation assets, acknowledging that complete preparedness cannot prevent all terrorist incidents. The Commission Report called for international cooperation in developing a comprehensive strategy against Islamist terrorism, with speakers pointing to the control of support sources like financing and arms. Martha Crenshaw discussed the complexities of developing a viable terrorism policy. Martha Crenshaw, a scholar with over 30 years of experience studying terrorism, discussed developing a viable policy towards terrorism. Christopher Hewitt, a Professor of Sociology, conducted a comparative study on government policies towards terrorism in modern democracies. The study included cases of ethnic/separatist and revolutionary terrorism. The final speaker at the event was Peter Probst, an experienced consultant from the CIA and Department of Defense, who highlighted deficiencies in current U.S. policy. Three other participants included Imad-ad-dean Ahmad, Marc Gopin, and Ulrich Seidt, who discussed methods of dealing with terrorist organizations such as targeting leadership and money flows. The speakers discussed various strategies to combat terrorist activity, including targeting leadership and money flows. They debated the effectiveness of policy reforms and civil liberties in enhancing public security. The report concludes with considerations for U.S. policy moving forward. The speakers agreed on the nature of terrorism and the seriousness of the current threat to the United States. They emphasized that terrorism is a tactic used by individuals willing to inflict violence on military and civilian targets for various reasons. Avoiding labeling organizations as terrorist was suggested to facilitate clearer analysis and policymaking. Ahmad provided a definition of terrorism as the deliberate targeting of civilians to create an atmosphere of terror. The speakers agreed on the nature of terrorism and the seriousness of the current threat to the United States. They emphasized that terrorism is a tactic used by individuals willing to inflict violence on military and civilian targets for various reasons. Ahmad offered a definition: \"deliberate targeting of civilians to create an atmosphere of terror with the intention of advancing one's particular cause.\" There was general agreement that terrorism tends to become a long term, self-perpetuating problem, as it engenders a cycle of violence. Several speakers cautioned that policymakers must anticipate unintended consequences when formulating anti-terrorism policies. Crenshaw highlighted Israeli policies in the late 1980s that inadvertently led to the emergence of more dangerous adversaries like Hamas. The threat of terrorism, they warned, will persist despite high alertness and preparation. In the late 1980s, Israeli policies inadvertently led to the emergence of Hamas as a rival to the PLO, creating a more dangerous adversary. Israel also invaded Lebanon in 1978 and 1982 to protect its northern borders from PLO incursions, leading to the creation of Hezbollah. The most effective policy tool to reduce terrorist violence was the \"model of attrition,\" involving the arrest, internment, or killing of terrorists. According to Hewitt, the most effective way to reduce terrorist violence is through the arrest or elimination of key terrorists. This strategy requires good intelligence obtained through surveillance, informants, and captured terrorists. Repressive tactics and mass searches are less effective and may be counterproductive. Hewitt emphasized the importance of targeting key terrorists through arrests or eliminations, citing successful examples in Northern Ireland and Italy. Probst and Crenshaw agreed that good police work and intelligence are effective in combating terrorism, with Crenshaw highlighting the need to address the root causes of terrorist organizations. Crenshaw highlighted the importance of addressing the root causes of terrorist organizations to prevent the creation of stronger adversaries in the long run. She mentioned cases where arresting top leaders had negative impacts on movements, such as Abdullah \u00d6calan and An\u00edbal Guzman. The Israeli experience with arrests and assassinations of leaders was seen as mixed and deserving of further study. Crenshaw discussed the dilemma of removing top leaders from terrorist organizations, highlighting the potential consequences of such actions. She pointed to the Algerian government's experience in the 1990s, where jailing the leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front led to difficulties in negotiating with the group. This raised questions about the effectiveness of assassination policies in dealing with terrorist organizations. Crenshaw weighed the pros and cons of targeting leaders of terrorist organizations for assassination. She mentioned advantages like efficiency in crippling an organization and cited disadvantages such as the potential for mistakes and innocent casualties. Crenshaw discussed the potential drawbacks of targeting leaders of terrorist organizations for assassination, including the risk of mistakes, public backlash, the possibility that targets may not be critical, and the potential for others to step into their roles. Probst questioned the morality and effectiveness of assassination as a tool in counterterrorism, comparing it to bombing raids and highlighting the risks of mistakes and collateral damage. Probst questioned the morality and effectiveness of assassination in counterterrorism, emphasizing the need to consider unintended consequences. Others discussed the morality of assassination in the Middle East. Debate over Assassination in the Middle East. Crenshaw and Ahmad discussed Israel's retaliatory assassination policy and its consequences, including the cycle of violence with Palestinian suicide bombings. Ahmad suggested Hamas offered to stop bombings if Israel ceased killings. Gopin argued that an assassination policy is counterproductive as it invites retaliation, citing Hamas' suicide bombings as not being a response to Israeli killings. He also mentioned that Israelis view assassinations as a more humane tactic compared to other forms of violence. Gopin and other discussants questioned the effectiveness of assassination policies in countering terrorism, highlighting concerns about retaliation and the willingness of individuals to die for their cause. They emphasized the need to control sources of support for terrorist acts, with some suggesting international cooperation is necessary. Hewitt acknowledged the value of cutting off funding but expressed doubts about its ability to fully curb terrorism due to the backing of powerful terrorist groups. Crenshaw emphasized the importance of cutting off funding for terrorist groups, highlighting the need for international cooperation in implementing such policies. She noted the success of the British in countering the Irish Republican Army through cooperation with the Republic of Ireland and other governments in intercepting arms shipments. Gopin highlighted the role of outside powers in exacerbating the Middle East situation, pointing out contributions from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and western charities to support structures for suicide bombings in Israel. Hewitt discussed the challenges of negotiations, noting that in cases examined, negotiations broke down due to polar demands. Hewitt and Gopin discussed the challenges of negotiations in conflict resolution, highlighting the difficulty when demands are polarized and no compromise is possible. Cease-fires are seen as opportunities for re-equipping and regrouping, leading to increased conflict when negotiations fail. They emphasized the importance of addressing grievances before terrorist violence begins. The importance of addressing grievances before terrorist violence begins is emphasized by Hewitt and Gopin. They suggest cutting off potential sources of violence before terrorist structures develop. The challenges of negotiating with diverse factions in conflict resolution are discussed, drawing parallels with past situations like the Irish Republican Army in Britain and groups in Germany. Ahmad suggested that understanding the differences among factions in a conflict can be achieved by recognizing the value each group places on specific issues. Outsiders need to differentiate between peripheral and core issues, focusing negotiations on widely accepted legitimate core issues to potentially impact the political dynamics of negotiations with terrorist groups. Ahmad emphasized the importance of focusing negotiations on legitimate core issues to impact political dynamics with terrorist groups. By supporting demands that adhere to international law, it can appeal to groups against terrorism. This approach could improve the possibilities of negotiations in the Middle East. Seidt and Gopin suggested ways to improve negotiations, emphasizing the importance of involving a third party mediator and implementing measures to increase the rule of law for successful peace processes. Gopin emphasized the need for anti-corruption measures in peace processes to isolate terrorism and avoid funding corrupt systems that support terrorists. Different strategies may be required to address leadership and supporters of terrorism. Leaders' negotiation abilities depend on followers' perceptions of potential outcomes and the current situation. Hewitt's study on terrorism and reforms found that addressing root causes through political and economic changes did not lead to the cessation of terrorism. Even when terrorists' grievances were addressed, levels of terrorism only decreased but did not end. Improving economic conditions also did not have a significant impact on reducing terrorism. Hewitt's study found that improving economic conditions did not reduce terrorism levels. Despite addressing root causes, terrorism persisted. Audience members questioned the generalizability of Hewitt's findings across different time frames and cases. Various hypotheses were proposed to explain why his findings may hold true in some instances. Gopin and Ahmad emphasized the importance of distinguishing between the effects of policies on terrorists and their supporters in controlling terrorism. They highlighted the significance of understanding the support groups and how they can destabilize efforts to stabilize countries like Palestine or Pakistan. Economic, psychological, and cultural factors play a crucial role in this dynamic. Probst suggested that terrorists may feel threatened by economic reform, as it could reduce their recruiting pool. Hewitt's data showed that violence spiked during periods of political and economic reforms, indicating that terrorists may escalate violence to force concessions from the government. Hewitt speculated that reforms may not work due to the government's limitations and the cycle of violence. Economic improvements may be hindered by ongoing violence, creating a vicious cycle. Timing of reforms could also play a role in their effectiveness. Ahmad and Hewitt discussed the ineffectiveness of late reforms in breaking the cycle of violence. Hewitt mentioned that timely concessions by governments could prevent violence among ethnic groups with territorial grievances. Economic motivations for terrorism were also debated, with Hewitt noting a lack of correlation between deprivation and terrorism incidence. Nationalist terrorists were highlighted as not necessarily coming from the most disadvantaged groups. Ahmad pointed out that terrorists come from a cross-section of society, with revolutionary terrorists often from privileged classes. He mentioned the Basques as an example, noting that economic deprivation can contribute to terrorism through a sense of \"theft\" from one group to another. Ahmad emphasized the importance of considering economic motivations in a collective, rather than individualistic, manner. Ahmad highlighted the impact of economic deprivation on terrorism, drawing parallels between post-World War I Germany and Iraq's situation leading to the rise of Hitler and Osama Bin Laden, respectively. The speakers discussed how economic conditions influence terrorists and their supporters differently, with Gopin distinguishing between motivations of suicide bombers. Gopin differentiated between motivations of suicide bombers, noting the distinction between highly organized and trained terrorists and those driven by economic desperation. He mentioned outside funding supporting families of suicide bombers as a form of life insurance. Some discussed long-term solutions to address terrorism by changing the social and psychological factors that fuel it. Ahmad highlighted the impact of the \"scope of one's view\" on perceptions of policy effectiveness over time. Gopin suggested expanding counterterrorism research to consider long-term cultural influences on terrorism. Suggestions for change included educational reform and cultural shifts to address terrorism. Crenshaw discussed the potential impact of changing educational systems in developing countries to prevent terrorism, citing examples like the transformation of the Ku Klux Klan and the rise of Martin Luther King Jr. as valid precedents. Gopin emphasized the need for a global educational strategy as part of a comprehensive counter-terrorism approach. Hewitt highlighted the importance of educational systems in predicting terrorism, pointing out the influence of socialization on terrorists and supporters. He compared the impact of nationalist indoctrination in Northern Ireland's schools to the lack of it in Quebec, emphasizing the role of education in shaping ideologies. Hewitt found similarities between Northern Irish Catholic and Greek Cypriot groups in emphasizing education for their cause. Crenshaw warned against focusing too much on long-term policies over short-term ones. She highlighted the influence of various global factors on terrorism. Hewitt discussed the potential for cultural shifts to undermine support for terrorism in Northern Ireland. Gopin discussed the changing perceptions in Northern Ireland as an example that could help clarify possibilities for Israel. He highlighted the impact of the Irish Republic's constitution on the culture in Northern Ireland, which contributed to terrorism. Gopin drew a parallel between this document and the founding documents of the PLO, emphasizing the importance of leaders in promoting a shift in perception to combat terrorism. Gopin emphasized the significance of leaders in influencing perceptions to combat terrorism, citing General Musharraf's speech in Pakistan as a revolutionary shift in the concept of Jihad. Hewitt discussed European anti-terrorist laws in the 1970s and 1980s, highlighting the importance of their implementation for effectiveness. Effective implementation of anti-terrorist measures relies on gathering good intelligence to target terrorists without alienating the population. This intelligence is obtained through surveillance, cash payments, infiltration of terrorist groups, and dealing with captured terrorists for information. Lessons from European experiences emphasize the importance of intelligence in combating terrorism. Crenshaw discussed the resilience of European democracies in the face of domestic terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, highlighting that civil liberties survived despite severe anti-terrorism policies. She emphasized the challenge of controlling factors that promote international terrorism, particularly the threat of Islamist terrorism. Crenshaw and Ahmad discussed the challenges of controlling factors that promote international terrorism, particularly the threat of Islamist terrorism. Crenshaw emphasized the difficulty in achieving a perfect solution and managing public expectations of security measures. Ahmad highlighted areas in the Middle East that the United States can control, such as sanctions against Iraq, arms supply to Israel, and American presence in the region. Ahmad suggested that the US should stop supporting the Israeli occupation of the West Bank to align with American interests in the Middle East. He advised against legitimizing terrorism through engagement or sponsorship and urged against unjust policies that provoke terrorism. Probst disagreed, arguing that changing US policy would be a capitulation of American interests. Probst disagreed with the idea of changing US policy towards the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, stating that it would be a capitulation of American interests. He emphasized the importance of defending US interests candidly to prevent conflicts and misread signals that could lead to war. Crenshaw raised the question of whether the US needs a \"grand strategy\" towards terrorism. Crenshaw questioned the need for a \"grand strategy\" towards terrorism, highlighting the difficulty in formulating such a policy due to cost-benefit decisions and societal tolerance of risk. She pondered whether the US is willing to pay the high costs associated with a comprehensive strategy to defend against terrorism. Crenshaw questioned the feasibility of a grand strategy against terrorism due to cost and societal risk tolerance. Germany organized its bureaucracy effectively to combat terrorism since 1972, but doubts the US can do the same. Germany's strategy focused on strategic rather than operational levels, using attrition against threats like the Red Army faction and Palestinian organizations. The strategy against terrorism in Germany integrated traditional intelligence work and focused on understanding the mindset of terrorists. Implementing the strategy faced challenges due to conflicting operational thinking among state agencies. Crenshaw recommended that the State Department office of counterterrorism play a more significant role and that implications for terrorism be considered in all foreign policymaking. Crenshaw emphasized the need to integrate counterterrorism efforts into overall foreign and defense policy, highlighting the importance of consistent funding for studying and addressing terrorism. Probst called for increased funding for security measures that are often neglected until a crisis occurs. Probst and others discussed the importance of protecting natural targets from terrorist attacks, citing the threat of weapons of mass destruction. They highlighted the vulnerability of the United States' economy and Wall Street, emphasizing the need for increased security measures. Crenshaw pointed out that even with high preparedness, terrorists may target secondary locations if primary targets are well-guarded. Crenshaw emphasized the need for policymakers to consider risks and costs of guarding potential targets, suggesting that protection may be deemed too expensive. Participants called for further study on terrorism causes and conduct, noting inconsistent attention and funding for counter-terrorism measures. Seidt recommended patience and steady investment based on the German experience. Crenshaw highlighted the lack of comparative policy studies and the ongoing process of sorting through various issues. Participants at the meeting discussed the need for further study on terrorism causes and the long-term effects of assassination policies in countries like Israel, South Africa, and France. Probst suggested establishing a multidisciplinary center to study terrorism, emphasizing the importance of understanding the motivations of terrorists and the unique dynamics of different groups. He noted the significant spending on security measures but highlighted the lack of comparative policy studies in the field. Gopin emphasized the need for more funding and priority on programs exploring the psychology of terrorism. He advocated for a joint effort between policy analysts and the academic field of anti-terrorism to understand terrorist groups better. Additionally, he called for research on cultural determinants of terrorism and the long-term effectiveness of anti-terrorism policies. Hewitt suggested studying the impact of one big terrorist event versus chronic terrorism on a country. Seidt suggested studying different branches of Sufi Islam. Perl recommended studying criminal networks and policy responses, such as the kingpin approach. Lee proposed examining factors for successful negotiations and programs for terrorist network members' reintegration.
