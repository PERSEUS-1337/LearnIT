    "content": "In an Earth Day speech, President Obama emphasized the need to develop clean energy sources to address economic issues related to U.S. dependence on oil. He highlighted the connection between federal deficit, trade deficit, and global warming with oil dependency. The President also discussed consumer behavior towards oil prices and how government policies like taxes can influence consumption. The President's FY2010 budget proposal includes subsidies for alternative energy sources and increased taxes on the oil industry to lower private costs and reduce consumption. The report analyzes the economic effects of the proposed tax increases on the oil industry, which historically received favorable tax treatment to keep petroleum product costs low and encourage consumption. The tax treatment historically kept petroleum product costs low, encouraging consumption. High gasoline prices in 2008 led consumers to shift towards more fuel-efficient vehicles, impacting the U.S. automobile industry. Transitioning from oil to alternative fuels will involve adjustment costs for consumers and industry. Under economic recession and financial crisis, proposals to increase taxes on the oil industry aim to control the federal deficit by eliminating tax expenditures and equalizing treatment of oil producers. Proposed tax changes could generate deficit reduction by 2014 if enacted by Congress. Proposed tax changes aim to equalize treatment of oil producers by eliminating preferential tax treatment for independent companies compared to major oil companies. Three key proposals are expected to increase total taxes on the oil industry: an excise tax on Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas production, rescinding the manufacturing tax deduction, and repealing percentage depletion. These changes are estimated to have a significant effect by 2014, potentially reducing the federal deficit. The Gulf of Mexico currently has varying royalty rates for oil production, with new production after March 2008 subject to an 18.75% royalty rate. However, a program allowed for zero royalties until a certain production level was reached. The 2010 budget introduces new royalty provisions for this production, which could be seen as reversing an earlier tax expenditure. The impact of an excise tax on oil and gas production may not follow normal economic circumstances due to the global market determining oil prices. During 2004-2009, oil prices reached record levels, leading to high profits for the industry. An excise tax leveling the playing field for Gulf producers may not raise consumer prices or reduce output. The existing royalty payment exclusion incentivizes exploration, but keeping it in place may not be necessary if wells are already profitable. The imposition of an excise tax may not significantly reduce oil production or investment incentives, as companies may not easily find better alternatives. The government take in the U.S. is low compared to other nations, suggesting little change in investment activity even with the repeal of the royalty exclusion. The enhanced oil recovery tax credit allows for a credit of 15% of allowable costs associated with the use of oil recovery technologies, including the injection of carbon dioxide to enhance production of older wells during periods of low oil prices. The credit has not been in effect over the past several years and its elimination would likely not affect current oil supplies unless oil prices fell. Keeping older, high-cost, low-production rate wells operating during periods of excess supply may not be the optimal strategy due to the inability of oil prices to cover operating costs. The federal tax code has allowed the expensing of intangible drilling costs since 1913 to attract capital into the risky oil investment. Technological advances have reduced the risk of finding oil, making expensive \"dry holes\" less likely. The full expensing provision is currently only available to independent oil producers. The elimination of the tax provision for intangible drilling costs is expected to contribute over $1.8 billion in deficit reduction from 2010 to 2014 and around $3 billion by 2019. The Independent Petroleum Association of America estimates that removing this provision could reduce investment in U.S. oil development by $3 billion in the future, based on the assumption of a dollar for dollar decline in investment activity for every extra dollar of tax paid. The actual impact on oil resource development will depend on the price of oil, with a potential reduction in drilling activity if oil prices remain low. The burden of additional tax expense could reduce drilling activity, especially in deep waters like the Gulf of Mexico. Higher oil prices would lessen the impact of these taxes. Tertiary injection expenses can be deducted, supporting the importance of tertiary recovery and environmental benefits. Repeal of these deductions could reduce output, especially if profit margins are low. The marginal well tax credit was implemented to keep low production oil and gas wells active during periods of low prices. It accounts for up to 20% of U.S. oil production and 12% of natural gas production. The credit, enacted in 2004, may not be significant if prices remain high or if the U.S. transitions to alternative energy sources. The United States may eliminate high-cost wells in the marginal well category if alternative energy sources reduce petroleum demand. The repeal of the passive loss exception for working interests in oil and gas properties is a small revenue item, totaling $19 million from 2010 to 2014. This provision allows deductions of losses in oil and gas projects against other active income, serving as an incentive for investors to finance such projects. The proposed budget includes the repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for the oil and natural gas industry, estimated to generate $4.9 billion in tax revenue from 2010 to 2014, potentially increasing to $13 billion by 2019. This deduction was initially enacted in 2004 to promote American manufacturing employment growth, with the oil industry being eligible for phased-in deductions starting at 3% in 2005 and reaching 9% in 2010. The manufacturing tax deduction for the oil and natural gas industry, enacted in 2004 to promote American manufacturing employment growth, allowed for phased-in deductions starting at 3% in 2005 and reaching 9% in 2010. The deduction aimed to reduce labor costs, increase employment, output, and competitiveness in the world market. Oil and gas industries differ from traditional manufacturing as production levels are not directly tied to employment levels. The manufacturing tax deduction for the oil and natural gas industry, enacted in 2004, aimed to reduce labor costs and increase competitiveness. However, the level of employment is indirectly related to wage costs, with the industry being capital intensive. Despite record profits in the oil industry since 2004, employment growth has been minor. Oil exploration is influenced by high prices, leading to variability in investment based on price expectations. The percentage depletion allowance in the oil industry, dating back to 1926, deducts a percentage value from gross income to account for extracted oil deposits. It is limited to American production by independent producers and serves as an analog to depreciation for capital equipment. The allowance is more crucial for investment budgets than the elimination of a low-wage tax cap.

It is limited to American production by independent producers and serves as an analog to depreciation for capital equipment. The allowance is more crucial for investment budgets than the elimination of a low-wage tax cap. Percentage depletion was eliminated for major oil companies in 1975, affecting their profits but not their oil production. Ownership of oil in the United States is allowed, unlike in most other countries where it is vested in the national oil company, resulting in lower revenues for companies. Repealing the percentage depletion allowance is projected to yield significant deficit reduction. The Obama budget proposal aims to extend the amortization period for independent oil producers to seven years, equalizing treatment with major integrated oil companies. This change is projected to contribute almost $1.2 billion in deficit reduction. The Obama budget proposal aims to extend the amortization period for independent oil producers to seven years, projected to contribute almost $1.2 billion in deficit reduction over 2010-2019. Independent producers may reduce exploration activities dollar for dollar due to this change, but if market prices remain strong, investment is unlikely to decrease significantly. However, if prices decline near production costs, investment may be curtailed even with more favorable tax treatment. In times of stagnant oil prices, small changes in tax expenses could impact investment and production activities. In a time of high and volatile oil prices, small changes in tax expense are overshadowed by price variations. Proposed deficit reduction items could act as effective tax increases on oil and gas industries, potentially decreasing exploration and production while increasing prices and foreign oil dependence. These proposals may also eliminate tax preferences that have favored these industries, making oil and gas products artificially inexpensive. The proposed deficit reduction items could act as effective tax increases on the oil and gas industries, potentially reducing exploration and production while increasing prices and foreign oil dependence. However, the real effects of these proposals on oil production, consumption, and imports are likely to be small relative to both the federal deficit and the revenues of the oil industry."
