    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Computer Security Enhancement Act of 2000\". The Congress finds that the National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for developing standards to ensure security and privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems. The Federal Government plays a crucial role in protecting sensitive, unclassified information. Cryptography-based technology can be provided by private sector companies to secure information. Encryption technologies in industry should be market-driven, not government-mandated. The Act aims to strengthen the National Institute of Standards and Technology's role in securing unclassified information in Federal computer systems and promote private sector technology solutions for enhancing Federal computer system security. SEC. 3. SECURITY OF FEDERAL COMPUTERS AND NETWORKS. Section 20(b) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to provide guidance on protecting security and privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems, promoting compliance with existing guidelines, and assisting in response efforts related to unauthorized access. Section 20(b) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to provide guidance on protecting security and privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems and assisting in response efforts related to unauthorized access. SEC. 4. COMPUTER SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION. Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to emphasize technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security, promote commercially available products for security in Federal computer systems, and develop measures for assessing quality and effectiveness. The amended Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act focuses on technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security, promoting commercially available security products for Federal systems, and developing measures to assess quality and effectiveness. This includes conducting evaluations and tests, promoting accreditation procedures, providing assistance with security technology selection, and developing uniform testing procedures for security product conformance. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act amended Section 20 to focus on technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security. It includes promoting security products for Federal systems, conducting evaluations, promoting accreditation procedures, and developing uniform testing procedures for security product conformance. The Institute will maintain a list of tested security products and provide an annual report to Congress. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act amended Section 20 to focus on technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security, including promoting security products for Federal systems, conducting evaluations, promoting accreditation procedures, and developing uniform testing procedures for security product conformance. The Institute will maintain a list of tested security products and provide an annual report to Congress containing findings, planned evaluations, recommendations to Federal agencies, and agency responses. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act amended Section 20 to focus on technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security, including promoting security products for Federal systems, conducting evaluations, promoting accreditation procedures, and developing uniform testing procedures for security product conformance. The Institute will maintain a list of tested security products and provide an annual report to Congress containing findings, planned evaluations, recommendations to Federal agencies, and agency responses. SEC. 5. COMPUTER SECURITY REVIEW, PUBLIC MEETINGS, AND INFORMATION. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act amended Section 20 to focus on technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security. The Institute will solicit recommendations from the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board regarding standards and guidelines for submission to the Secretary. $1,030,000 for fiscal year 2001 and $1,060,000 for fiscal year 2002 are authorized for the Board to address emerging issues in computer security, privacy, and cryptography. The Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board focuses on technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security, privacy, and cryptography. They convene public meetings, receive presentations, and publish reports for public distribution on these subjects. SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON PARTICIPATION IN REQUIRING ENCRYPTION AND ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION STANDARDS. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to restrict the Institute from setting encryption and electronic authentication standards for non-Federal computer systems. SEC. 7. MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS. Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to improve computer security for Federal computer systems by enhancing coordination and making necessary adjustments. This includes changes in subsections (b)(8), (e), (e)(2), and (f)(1)(B)(i) to address computer networks and security measures. SEC. 8 of the Computer Security Act of 1987 is amended to emphasize protecting sensitive information in Federal databases and computer sites accessible through public networks. SEC. 9 establishes a Computer Security Fellowship Program. SEC. 9 authorizes $500,000 for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 for a Computer Security Fellowship Program to support students in computer security at higher learning institutions. The funds are not subject to percentage limitations. The Secretary of Commerce will contract the National Research Council to study electronic authentication technologies within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The study will assess technology support, deployment plans, interoperability, scalability, integrity, and other relevant issues. The National Research Council will conduct a study on electronic authentication technologies, with full cooperation from all federal agencies. A report with findings and recommendations for public policy on electronic authentication technologies will be submitted to relevant committees within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The National Research Council will not recommend specific electronic authentication technology for the Federal Government. $450,000 is authorized for the Secretary of Commerce in fiscal year 2001 for this purpose. SEC. 11. PROMOTION OF NATIONAL INFORMATION SECURITY.\n\nThe Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology will promote the use of security techniques and tools to enhance the protection of the Nation's information infrastructure, establish a central repository of information on security vulnerabilities, and promote the development of national standards-based infrastructures to support encryption technologies.\n\nSEC. 12. ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION INFRASTRUCTURES. The Director, in consultation with industry and Federal agencies, will develop technology-neutral guidelines and standards for electronic authentication infrastructures to be used by Federal agencies. These guidelines aim to ensure security and interoperability of electronic authentication technologies. The Director will develop guidelines for electronic authentication products, including protection profiles, interoperability specifications, and validation criteria. These guidelines will be periodically reviewed and revised as needed. The Director will maintain a list of approved electronic authentication products for Federal agencies. Core specifications for electronic certification and management technologies will be established for Federal agency use. The Director will maintain a list of electronic certification and management technologies approved for Federal agency use. Reports to Congress will include analysis of agencies' utilization and implementation progress of electronic authentication technologies. The section defines terms related to electronic authentication, infrastructure, certification, and management technologies. It explains the meaning of electronic authentication as methods to authenticate identity in electronic communication and electronic authentication infrastructure as resources and procedures needed for electronic authentication technologies. Additionally, it defines electronic certification and management technologies as systems enabling electronic authentication and protection profile as a list of security functions and assurance levels for products. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act authorizes $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 for NIST activities. This Act aims to enhance NIST's ability to improve computer security."
