    "content": "The U.S. farm sector is vast and varied, encompassing production activities related to field crops, livestock, poultry, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Farm income and rural economic conditions vary across the country based on market conditions and other factors. Annual U.S. net farm income is a key indicator of the sector's well-being, reflecting economic activity across production processes and marketing. The U.S. farm sector's economic well-being is reflected in national net farm income and the farm debt-to-asset ratio. In 2019, U.S. net farm income is projected to increase by 4.8% to $88.0 billion, with net cash income also expected to rise by 7.2% to $112.6 billion. Government support in 2019 is a key factor driving the increase in net farm income, projected at $19.5 billion, up 42.5% from 2018. The projected net farm income for 2019 is $88 billion, with government support expected to increase by 42.5% to $19.5 billion. Direct government payments are anticipated to be the largest since 2006, representing 22.2% of net farm income. This forecast is slightly above the 10-year average and reflects ongoing economic weakness in the agriculture sector since 2013. The net farm income for 2019 is projected to be on par with the average since 1940, at $86.8 billion. Total production expenses for 2019 are projected to be slightly higher than 2018, driven by increased costs for feed, labor, and property taxes. Global demand for U.S. agricultural exports in 2019 is expected to decrease due to a decline in sales to China. Farm asset values and debt levels are projected to reach record levels in 2019, with asset values at $3.1 trillion and farm debt at $415.7 billion, pushing the debt-to-asset ratio to 13.5%, the highest since 2003. Abundant supplies of grains and oilseeds indicate weak commodity prices in 2019. Uncertainty surrounds the 2019 growing season and market conditions for 2020 due to delayed crop development and the risk of an early freeze. The 2019 growing season faced challenges such as delayed crop development, record prevented planting acres, and uncertainties due to international trade disputes affecting U.S. exports to China. In 2019, the Corn Belt experienced record prevented planting acres due to prolonged wet conditions, resulting in delays in planting corn and soybean crops. U.S. farmers reported 19.8 million acres of prevent plant acres, including 11.4 million acres of corn and 4.5 million acres of soybeans, setting new records. In 2019, a significant portion of the U.S. corn and soybean crops were planted later than usual, leading to important implications for crop development and increasing the complexity of producer decision-making. Planting delays pushed both crops' growing cycle into hotter, drier periods of the summer and increased the risk of plant growth being affected by an early freeze. In 2019, late planting of U.S. corn and soybean crops led to complex decisions for producers. The late planting period forced producers to choose between prevented planting indemnity payments or planting with reduced insurance coverage. The Secretary of Agriculture's announcement further complicated choices by limiting trade damage assistance payments to producers with planted acres. Corn and soybeans are the largest U.S. commercial crops, with strong growth in productivity and output in recent years, leading to stockpile accumulation. Soybean production in the U.S. has been rapidly expanding since 1990, leading to record harvests and ending stocks in 2018. The increase in soybean plantings has come at the expense of the wheat sector, with soybean acreage surpassing corn for the first time in history. However, the record harvest in 2018, combined with the loss of the Chinese soybean market, discouraged many producers from planting. The wet spring in 2019 discouraged soybean planting, leading to a 14% drop in soybean acres. Despite expectations of a switch to corn, large corn plantings were unlikely due to the wet conditions. USDA's June acreage survey for corn showed 91.7 million acres, above market expectations. However, due to delayed planting, a re-survey of major corn-producing states was conducted, confirming 90.0 million acres planted. The USDA released results on August 12, confirming higher-than-expected corn plantings at 90.0 million acres. The outlook for the U.S. corn crop is uncertain due to delayed growing conditions, with projected ending stocks surpassing 2 billion bushels. Strong domestic demand and robust export outlook are expected to support the farm price at $3.60/bushel. In contrast, U.S. soybean production is projected to drop by 19% to 3.68 billion bushels, with lower carry-over stocks and the loss of China as a buyer impacting the market. The USDA projects lower soybean farm prices for the 2019/20 marketing year due to the loss of China as a buyer, with soybean prices at $8.40/bushel, the lowest since 2006. Wheat and upland cotton prices are also projected to decrease slightly. The United States is a major exporter of corn and soybeans, with the export outlook critical for farm profitability and regional economic activity. The trade dispute with China has impacted this outlook. The trade dispute between the United States and China has led to lower purchases of U.S. agricultural products by China, causing uncertainty in the agricultural sector. Livestock sectors are slower to adjust to market conditions compared to the crop sector. USDA projects livestock and dairy production and prices an extra year into the future through 2020. High feed and forage prices, along with drought in the Southern Plains, have impacted the U.S. cattle industry from 2007-2014. The U.S. cattle inventory contracted by 8% due to high feed prices and drought in the Southern Plains. This led to higher producer and consumer prices, record profitability for cow-calf producers in 2014, and triggered a slow rebuilding phase in the cattle cycle. Despite weakening profitability, the cattle expansion continued through 2018, but appears to have levelled off in 2019 with an estimated population of 103 million cattle and calves. Producers are now producing more beef with fewer cattle, which may hinder further expansion. The U.S. cattle inventory contracted by 8% due to high feed prices and drought, leading to record profitability for cow-calf producers in 2014. Despite weakening profitability, the cattle expansion continued through 2018. Producers are now producing more beef with fewer cattle. U.S. hog and poultry flocks are also growing, with modest production expansion projected for beef, pork, broilers, and eggs in 2019 and 2020. Demand growth may not keep up with production, leading to lower prices and profit margins for livestock. The U.S. livestock sector is facing lower prices and profit margins, with ratios of livestock output prices to feed costs showing eroding profitability for cattle, hogs, and milk producers. Despite production growth for red meat and poultry, prices are vulnerable to weak demand, leading to financial difficulties for many producers. The U.S. livestock sector is experiencing lower prices and profit margins due to weak demand. Both U.S. and global milk production are expected to increase in 2019, putting pressure on milk prices. Farm sector revenue sources in 2019 include crop revenues, livestock receipts, government payments, and other farm-related income. Total farm sector gross cash income for 2019 is projected to increase driven by direct government payments and other farm-related income. Total crop sales peaked in 2012 at $231.6 billion due to a nationwide drought, but in 2019, sales are projected at $193.7 billion, down 1.7% from 2018. Projections for 2019 show varying changes in different crop categories, with livestock sector cash receipts also experiencing fluctuations. The livestock sector experienced steady growth from 2009 to 2014, peaking at $212.3 billion. However, there were declines in 2015 and 2016 due to price decreases. Cash receipts in 2017 recovered with 8.1% growth to $175.6 billion, slightly increasing in 2018. Projections for 2019 show a 0.5% increase to $177.4 billion, with varying changes in different livestock categories. Government payments in 2019 are projected to reach $19.5 billion, a 42.5% increase from 2018. This surge in federal subsidies includes various types of payments such as direct payments, price-contingent payments, conservation payments, ad hoc disaster assistance, and other miscellaneous outlays. This would be the largest taxpayer transfer to the agriculture sector since 2005. The surge in federal subsidies in 2019 is mainly driven by large \"trade-damage\" payments under the MFP initiated by USDA in response to the U.S.-China trade dispute. MFP payments in 2019 are reported to be $10.7 billion, including outlays from the 2018 MFP program and expected payments under the 2019 MFP program. USDA ad hoc disaster assistance is projected to increase by 87.1% to $1.7 billion. Payments under the Agricultural Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage programs are expected to decrease by 12.4% to $2.8 billion in 2019. Conservation programs are forecasted to provide $3.7 billion in direct payments to producers in 2019. Government payments to producers are estimated at $19.5 billion in 2019, representing 5% of projected gross cash income. The 2018 farm bill introduced the Dairy Margin Coverage program, offering expanded margin coverage options for milk producers. The program allows coverage up to $9.50/cwt. on the first 5 million pounds of milk. The Dairy Margin Coverage program introduced in the 2018 farm bill offers expanded margin coverage options for milk producers, with a $9.50/cwt. payment threshold. Government payments to producers are estimated at $19.5 billion in 2019, with the DMC program expected to make $600 million in payments. Total production expenses for the U.S. agricultural sector are projected to be slightly up from 2018 at $346.1 billion in 2019. Production expenses are projected to turn upward in 2019, affecting crop and livestock farms differently. Feed costs, labor expenses, and property taxes are all projected to increase, while fuel, land rent, interest costs, and fertilizer costs are projected to decrease. Prices received index generally declined from 2014 through 2016, rebounded in 2017, then declined again in 2018. Since 2002, about 39% of agricultural land used in U.S. farming operations has been rented, with the majority of rented land coming from non-operating landlords. Renting land is a way for farmers to enter agriculture without incurring debt from land purchases and allows for quicker adjustments to market conditions. In 2017, 29% of all land in farms was rented from non-farm sources. In 2017, 29% of all farmland in the U.S. was rented from non-operator landlords, generating income for some farm operators. Net rent to non-operator landlords is projected to decrease by 2.1% to $12.5 billion in 2019. Average cash rental rates for 2019 increased by 1.4% to $140 per acre. National rental rates peaked at $144 per acre in 2015, reflecting high crop prices and large net returns from 2011-2014. Agricultural exports have been a significant contributor to farm income since 2005. The financial success of the U.S. agricultural sector is closely tied to international demand for U.S. products. The downturn in agricultural exports since 2015 has deepened the decline in farm income from 2013 to 2016. The sector's trade outlook is vulnerable due to international trade disputes, especially with China. Improved international trade prospects are necessary for market-based farm income growth. USDA projects a decrease in agricultural exports to $134.5 billion in FY2019. In FY2019, U.S. agricultural imports are projected to increase to $129.3 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $5.2 billion, the lowest since 2006. The surge in U.S. agricultural exports between 2010 and 2014 was driven by higher-priced grain and feed shipments, including record oilseed exports to China and growing animal product exports to East Asia. Export values have leveled off as commodity prices stabilized. China, Canada, and Mexico were the top three markets for U.S. agricultural exports in FY2017, accounting for 46% of total exports from FY2014 to FY2018. In FY2019, U.S. agricultural exports to China are projected to decline, leading to a shift in the top markets to Canada, Mexico, the EU, Japan, and China. China's imports of U.S. agricultural products are forecasted to decrease significantly due to the U.S.-China trade dispute. The EU and Japan, the fourth- and fifth-largest export markets, have shown limited growth compared to the rest of the world. In FY2019, U.S. agricultural exports to China are projected to decline due to the trade dispute, leading to a shift in top markets to Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Japan. The \"Rest of World\" component of U.S. agricultural trade is expected to grow to 19% in FY2019, driven by import growth in South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. High-valued exports are forecasted to reach $94.0 billion, accounting for a 69.9% share of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019. Bulk commodity shipments are forecasted to have a record low share of total U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019 at $40.5 billion, compared to an average share of over 60% in the 1970s and 1980s. The export share of agricultural production was estimated at 19.8% from 2008 to 2016, indicating U.S. agriculture's dependence on foreign markets. The export shares of agricultural products vary by category, with food grains and oilseeds at the higher end ranging from 50% to 80% and 47% to 58% respectively. Fruit, tree nuts, and meat products fall in the mid-range from 37% to 45% and 27% to 41%. Vegetable, melon, dairy products, and agricultural-based beverages have lower export shares ranging from 15% to 18%, 9% to 24%, and 7% to 13% respectively. Despite a stable financial position in 2019, there is uncertainty due to downward price outlooks and an increasing reliance on international markets. Farm asset values are projected to increase by 2.0% in 2019 to $3.1 trillion, with real estate values and nonreal-estate values both expected to rise. Crop land values have leveled off since 2015 due to stagnant commodity prices, and USDA forecasts a decline in prices for major commodities in 2019. Farm asset values are projected to increase by 2.0% in 2019 to $3.1 trillion, with real estate values and nonreal-estate values both expected to rise. Prices for major commodities are forecasted to decline in 2019, with farm debt reaching a record $415.7 billion (+3.4%). Farm equity is projected to be slightly up at $2.7 trillion in 2019, with the farm debt-to-asset ratio forecasted to increase to 13.5%. The average farm household income in 2019 is projected to be $116,060, with 17% coming from farm production activities and the remaining 83% earned off the farm. Since 2014, over half of U.S. farm operations have had negative income from agricultural operations, and farm household incomes have surpassed average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s. The average farm household income in 2019 is projected to be $116,060, with 17% from farm production activities. USDA data shows monthly farm prices for major commodities and aggregate farm income variables. Farm household incomes have exceeded average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s."
