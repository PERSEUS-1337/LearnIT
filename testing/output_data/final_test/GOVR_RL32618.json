    "content": "Medicare has a history of offering managed care coverage through private plans as an alternative to traditional fee-for-service. Private health plans began contracting with Medicare in the 1970s, with the risk contract program established in 1982. In 1997, the Balanced Budget Act replaced the risk contract program with the Medicare+Choice program, aiming to reduce spending and payment variation. Monthly payments were made in advance to private health plans for each enrolled beneficiary. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 made substantial changes to the Medicare+Choice program, creating the Medicare Advantage program to increase private plan availability for Medicare beneficiaries. The act introduced enhancements and payment structure changes, including regional plans similar to Preferred Provider Organizations. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 introduced the Medicare Advantage program, which includes regional plans similar to Preferred Provider Organizations. The program provides financial incentives for plans to participate in the regional option, and beneficiaries will have access to a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan in 2006. Additionally, starting in 2010, there will be enhanced competition among local MA plans and between private plans and FFS Medicare in selected geographic areas. The act also made changes to the payment system for Medicare managed care plans, with immediate changes in 2004 and further changes in 2006 and 2010. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 introduced the Medicare Advantage program, including regional plans and local plans in cost containment areas. Immediate changes in 2004 included adding a new payment mechanism for MA payments based on fee-for-service payments for traditional Medicare beneficiaries. Statutory formulas for MA payments were also modified. The Medicare Advantage program introduced changes in 2004 to increase payments to MA plans. Starting in 2006, the Secretary will determine MA payment rates by comparing plan bids to a benchmark. If a plan's bid is less than the benchmark, its payment will equal the bid amount negotiated by the Secretary. The Medicare Advantage program introduced changes in 2004 to increase payments to MA plans. Starting in 2006, the Secretary will determine MA payment rates by comparing plan bids to a benchmark. If a plan's bid is less than the benchmark, its payment will equal its bid plus a rebate of 75% of the difference. The remaining 25% will be retained by the federal government. If a plan's bid is equal to or above the benchmark, its payment will be the benchmark amount and each enrollee will pay an additional premium equal to the amount by which the bid exceeds the benchmark. The local benchmark will not be determined in a competitive manner. Beginning in 2006, MA plans offering prescription drug coverage will receive a benchmark payment based on plan bids. This introduces new competition into the program. Additionally, MA regional plans will be offered in 26 regions, covering both in- and out-of-network services with a limit on out-of-pocket expenses. The regional benchmark for MA plans includes a statutorily determined increase and a weighted average of plan bids, introducing competition among plans. Plans with bids below the benchmark receive a rebate, while those above require an additional enrollee premium. Financial incentives are provided to encourage regional plan participation, including a stabilization fund established in 2007. The MMA introduces a stabilization fund in 2007 to incentivize regional plans to join and stay in the MA program. It also includes risk-sharing with MA plans, additional payments to high-cost hospitals, and a comparative cost adjustment program in specific geographic locations from 2010 to 2015. The program aims to compare efficiency among local private plans and between MA program and traditional Medicare. Payments to local MA plans will be based on competitive bids, and Part B premiums for traditional Medicare may be adjusted based on costs. The program will be phased in over four years with a 5% annual limit on premium adjustments. All MA plans can offer Part D Medicare drug coverage starting in 2006. In 2006, managed care organizations offering MA plans with prescription drug coverage must estimate the cost of Part D coverage. Plans can also offer supplemental benefits like vision or dental coverage. Plans must submit bids for any supplemental benefits. The MA payment structure and the impact of the MMA on Medicare managed care are discussed in detail. The Medicare statute sets the annual managed care per capita rate based on three amounts calculated for each county. The revised law for the MA program introduced a new payment type in 2004, where MA plans are paid based on the highest of several factors. Starting in 2005, MA payments no longer receive annual updates based on certain criteria, but the national growth percentage is included in the minimum increase amount. In 2006, the MMA changed the payment structure for MA local plans by establishing benchmarks. The benchmark amount for local MA plans is calculated by increasing the previous year's payment rate by the minimum increase or 100% of the per capita FFS amount. The goal of the blended rate is to reduce variation in payments across the country by shifting county rates towards a national average rate. The blended rate for Medicare Advantage plans aims to reduce payment discrepancies by adjusting county rates towards a national average. It is based on a mix of local and national per capita costs, with adjustments made for factors like graduate medical education payments. The national rate for Medicare Advantage plans is a weighted average of local area-specific rates, adjusted for input prices like hospital labor costs. Budget neutrality adjustments are made annually, except for payments in March 2004. The blend was used once between 1998 and 2003, and the MMA waived budget neutrality for 2004, affecting plans in 3% of counties. The Medicare Advantage plans' payment rates are adjusted annually, with additional payments considered for VA/DOD services. CMS did not implement the adjustment due to data limitations. Each county has a floor rate to raise payments, with different rates established based on population and location starting in 2001. For 2001, the floor rate was $525 for aged enrollees within the 50 states. In 2001, Medicare Advantage plans' payment rates were adjusted based on population and location. The floor rate was $525 for aged enrollees within the 50 states and the District of Columbia residing in Metropolitan Statistical Areas with a population of more than 250,000. Outside these areas, the floor rate was $475. The floor amounts were increased annually, with the 2002 floor at $553 for larger MSAs and $500 for other areas within the 50 states. In 2003, the floor rates decreased to $548 for larger MSAs and $495 for other areas within the states. In March 2004, the floor rates were $614 for larger MSAs and $555 for other areas within the states. The floor rates for Medicare Advantage plans were adjusted based on population and location in 2001. The floor amount was included in the original payment structure to reduce payment variation across the country. The introduction of the floor increased the lowest plan payments, narrowing the gap between the lowest and highest payments. By 2004, plans in about 67% of counties were paid based on the floor, leading to an increase in the gap between lowest and highest payments. The minimum payment for Medicare Advantage plans increased to $592 in 2004 and is expected to continue rising under new payment rules. The minimum increase rule was implemented to protect counties with small payment increases. The calculation of the minimum percentage increase changed under the MMA, ensuring a 2% increase over the previous year's payment rate. Under the new MA payment rules, plans now have their prior year amount increased by the higher of the minimum update or the increase in the national growth percentage. This change could result in higher payments to plans than under the previous system. The new MA payment rules incorporate the minimum increase and national growth percentage, with adjustments for prior year errors. By 2006, all counties will receive the minimum update payment. A fourth payment type was added in 2004, with payments based on fee-for-service payments for traditional Medicare enrollees. The average per capita cost for MA payment areas is adjusted annually to remove direct medical education costs and include the VA/DOD adjustment. In 2004, 26% of counties had payments based on fee-for-service (FFS) payments, with rebasing occurring at least once every three years. The Secretary rebased FFS rates in 2005 to reflect recent growth in expenditures. In 2005, payments in about 21% of counties are based on updated FFS rates, with larger local growth rates than the national average. About 80% of counties had slower growth in FFS compared to national rates, resulting in the minimum update being applied. The Secretary will not rebase FFS rates in 2006, with any changes announced in the annual \"Advance Notice.\" GME payments must be excluded from payments to M+C plans as per the BBA. The BBA excludes GME payments from payments to M+C plans, phased in over five years. The MMA allows a GME carve-out for MA plans based on 100% of FFS for Direct Medical education costs. Starting in 2005, there will be no carve-out for Indirect Medical education costs when the blend payment is no longer used. Adjustments for Direct Medical education costs will be limited to MA plans based on 100% FFS. Medicare payments to plans have rarely been based on the blend, which allowed a GME adjustment prior to the changes. The BBA required a budget neutrality adjustment for final MA payments to local plans based on county rates. However, achieving budget neutrality was not always possible due to limitations on reducing rates below certain amounts. This led to discrepancies in payments for certain years. In response to discrepancies in payments for certain years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waived the budget-neutrality rule for 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2003 rates, costing about $1 billion in 2002 and $900 million in 2003. The MMA eliminated budget neutrality for 2004, affecting blend payments, which will no longer be used after 2004. This ensured that blend payments did not have to be reduced in 2004. The national growth percentage for Medicare expenditures was -1.3% in 2001, with adjustments made for errors in previous spending projections. In 2002, the estimated increase was 8.3% over the pre-BIPA payment amount. The Medicare expenditures for 2002 included a 5.3% increase for the floor payment, reflecting a 5.6% projected per capita increase and a 0.3% reduction set by the BBA. For 2003, there was a projected decrease of 2.9%, with a 0.9% increase in per capita costs and a negative 3.8% adjustment for prior year errors. The 2003 floor update was -1%, with a 0.9% increase in per capita costs and a 1.9% decrease for prior year errors. The Medicare expenditures for 2002 included a 5.3% increase for the floor payment, reflecting a 5.6% projected per capita increase and a 0.3% reduction set by the BBA. For 2003, there was a projected decrease of 2.9%, with a 0.9% increase in per capita costs and a negative 3.8% adjustment for prior year errors. The 2003 floor update was -1%, with a 0.9% increase in per capita costs and a 1.9% decrease for prior year errors. In 2003, the minimum percentage increase was the only positive update, resulting in the highest M+C payment for most counties. The projected national growth percentage increase for 2004 was 9.5% for the blend and 8.2% for the floor, but due to the passage of the MMA, it was revised to 12.9% for the blend and 12.1% for the floor. The projected national growth percentage increase for 2005 is 6.6%, reflecting a 0.5% correction for prior year's estimates, and for 2006, it is 4.8%, reflecting a -0.3% correction for prior years' estimates. The MMA eliminates adjustments for prior year errors before 2004, leading to higher MA payments in 2004. The increase would have been 29.4% for the blend and 16.9% for the floor, compared to the actual 12.9% and 12.1% respectively. This change would have resulted in higher payments for many counties. The increase in Medicare Advantage payments in 2004 would have been significantly higher, affecting payments in many more counties. Payments are risk-adjusted to account for variations in healthcare costs among beneficiaries. The risk contract program adjusted AAPCCs for demographic risk factors, including age, gender, working status, Medicaid coverage, and health status variations using PIP-DCGs. The new risk adjustment methodology introduced demographic and health-status variations in per capita payments to Medicare plans. Changes made by the BBRA and BIPA slowed down the implementation of the new system to reduce aggregate payments. By 2003, 10% of payments included risk adjustment using the PIP-DCG method, while 90% were based on the older demographic method. BIPA further modified risk adjustment to better account for variations in health status. The new risk adjustment methodology, implemented in 2004, incorporates data from ambulatory settings and is phased in gradually. It is based on a \"selected significant condition\" model with approximately 61 disease groups. M+C organizations began collecting information on selected diagnoses in 2002. The MMA in 2006 expands risk adjustment by introducing a new measure for adjusting beneficiary rebates based on demographic and health history risk characteristics. The MMA in 2006 introduces a new risk adjustment methodology for calculating beneficiary rebates in MA plans. This methodology considers demographic and health history risk characteristics to determine the rebate amount. The Secretary has discretion to calculate average risk based on different factors, ensuring that equally efficient private plans offer the same rebate to beneficiaries. The MMA in 2006 expands the Secretary's discretion in risk adjusting payments to private plans by considering local payment rate variations. Payments are now based on the plan's bid and benchmark to ensure they do not exceed the estimated cost of serving beneficiaries. Table 2 provides a summary of payments made to local MA plans for covered Medicare services, including risk adjustment explanations. The table explains how risk adjustment is applied to payments for Medicare services in MA plans. Plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage receive additional payments. The Secretary adjusts payments to ensure they do not exceed the plan bid, considering demographic and health factors. Rebates can be used for additional benefits, reducing cost sharing, or premiums. Between 1997 and 2003, Medicare Advantage plans were paid based on three rules: blend, minimum increase, and floor, adjusted for budget neutrality. In 2004, a fourth rule was added, incorporating 100% of fee-for-service payments for traditional Medicare enrollees. The distribution of payment types varied each year, with some counties not receiving payments based on the blended-rate rule due to low national growth percentages. In 2001, no county was paid using the blended-rate rule. About 72% of county payments were set at the floor, with the rest receiving a 3% increase. In 2002, 79% of counties had payments set at the floor, with the remainder at a 2% increase. In 2003, almost all counties received a 2% increase, except for six counties set at a higher floor payment. In 2004, 26% of counties were paid 100% of FFS, 67% were paid the floor, 4% received the minimum update, and 3% received a blend. In 2005, the Secretary rebased payment rates to equal 100% of FFS or the previous year's rate plus a 6.6% increase. In 2005, county payment rates were based on 100% of FFS or a minimum percentage increase. In 2006, all county rates were set at a 4.8% increase above the 2005 rate. Selected 2004 county payment rates were calculated using different rules, such as minimum update, floor amount, blended rate, and 100% FFS. In 2005, county payment rates were based on 100% of FFS or a minimum percentage increase. The M+C payment method aimed to reduce variation in county payment rates. Changes in payment rules in the MMA will no longer decrease variation and may increase over time. The MMA rule changes will no longer decrease variation in county payment rates, leading to an increase over time. In 2004, the gap between the highest and lowest payment rates increased to $592. In 1997, the range from highest to lowest payments was $546, with the lowest rates in two rural Nebraska counties at $221 and the highest rates in Richmond County, New York, and Dade County, Florida at $767 and $748 respectively. In 2003, Medicare payment rates ranged from $495 to $873, with an average payment of $582 per beneficiary. By 2004, rates increased further, with the highest rate in St. Bernard at $1,147 and the lowest floor rate at $555 in non-MSA areas. In 2005, Medicare payment rates ranged from $592 to $1,222, with an average payment of $630 per beneficiary. In 2006, all rates will increase by 4.8%, with the highest rate being $1,281 in St. Bernard and the lowest rate at $620 in certain counties. Payment rates vary geographically, with higher payments in urban areas. The Medicare payment rates in 2005 ranged from $592 to $1,222 per beneficiary, with an average payment of $630. In 2006, rates will increase by 4.8%, with the highest rate at $1,281 in St. Bernard and the lowest at $620 in certain counties. Urban areas generally receive higher payments compared to rural areas. Payment rates for Medicare Managed Care vary widely across geographic areas, with plans in Miami receiving $986 per month in 2005 compared to $654 in Fairfax County, Virginia. Even neighboring areas like Dade County and Palm Beach County show differences of $123 in 2005 and $128 in 2006. Payment variations can also occur within the same market, affecting plan participation and enrollment. In 2006, the MA program will allow plans to operate regionally, serving single or multiple regions. The regional program aims to expand coverage to rural areas and operate like Preferred Provider Organizations. Plans in the new regional program will have a network of providers with specified reimbursement and cover all benefits, regardless of network use. Medical Savings Account (MSA) and Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans can also serve one or more regions. The Secretary established 26 regions for Account (MSA) plans and Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans, considering factors like eligible beneficiaries, existing plans, payment rate variation, and patient flow. Table 5 shows the 26 MA regions, beneficiary numbers, risk-adjusted rates, and rate differences. Region 24 (California) has about 4 million beneficiaries, while Region 26 (Alaska) has around 50 thousand. The Secretary established 26 regions for MA plans, with beneficiary numbers ranging from 4 million in Region 24 (California) to 50 thousand in Region 26 (Alaska). The difference in risk-adjusted MA rates within regions varies, with a high of $493 in Region 17 (Texas) and a low of $64 in Region 1 (Maine and New Hampshire), Region 21 (Arizona), and Region 25 (Hawaii). Regional plans cannot offer different benefits or cost-sharing requirements within the same region, and only regional plans are required to have a single deductible for Parts A and B services and a catastrophic limit on expenditures. The law specifies a catastrophic limit on expenditures for Medicare Advantage plans, with different deductibles for in-network services. Payment rates are risk-adjusted and based on regional benchmarks, with each region having a single deductible for Parts A and B services. The regional benchmark for Medicare Advantage plans includes a statutory component based on local payment rates and a plan-bid component based on MA regional bids. The benchmark for regional plans depends on all plan bids submitted, impacting payment amounts for participating plans. The MA monthly region-specific non-drug benchmark amount is determined by competition among plans in the region. It is calculated based on the statutory region-specific non-drug amount and the national market share percentage of MA eligible individuals. The plan-bid component of the benchmark for MA plans is calculated based on the weighted average of plan bids in a region and year. It considers the number of individuals enrolled in each regional plan during the reference month. The non-statutory market share percentage complements the statutory market share percentage and represents the proportion of MA eligible individuals enrolled. The Secretary calculates the benchmark for MA plans based on plan bids and enrollment numbers in each region. Risk adjustment factors are applied to adjust for demographic factors, health status, and intra-regional variation. The benchmark is adjusted annually, and estimates are generated for regions without previous plan offerings. The Secretary adjusts payments to MA regional plans to ensure they cover the unadjusted bid amount, with variations accounted for. A regional plan stabilization fund is established to support plans serving different regions and encourage their continued participation. Initially funded with $10 billion in 2007, additional amounts may be added, with funds available until December 2013. The Secretary determines the allocation of funds to MA regional plans based on statutory requirements. The regional plans are supported by a stabilization fund to ensure coverage of bid amounts. A national bonus payment of 3% of the benchmark amount is available for MA organizations offering plans in all regions without a national plan in the previous year. Regional bonuses may be awarded if no national plan is offered, and the Secretary may increase benchmarks in regions with no previous MA plans. The Secretary determines bonus amounts based on plan bids, which can vary by region. Funding may be available for multiple years. If a plan leaves a region, the Secretary may increase the benchmark for up to two years to retain new plans. Plans entering a region cannot receive a retention bonus the following year. The increased payment is either 3% of the benchmark or an amount equalizing two ratios. The Secretary determines bonus amounts based on plan bids, which can vary by region. Funding may be available for multiple years. Plans entering a region cannot receive a retention bonus the following year. Medicare will share risk with MA regional plans in 2006 and 2007 to encourage plan participation. Plans will assume only a portion of the risk for unexpected high costs and return savings to Medicare for unexpected low costs. Allowable costs will be measured against a target amount. If a plan's allowable costs are within 97% and 103% of the target amount, there will be no payment adjustment. Costs exceeding 103% but not more than 108% will receive an additional payment. For costs above 108%, payments will increase based on a formula. Conversely, if a regional plan's costs are below 97% but above 92% of the target amount, payments will be reduced. If costs are below 92% of the target amount, adjustments will be made accordingly. The MMA allows for adjustments in monthly payments based on allowable costs. If costs are less than 92% of the target amount, the Secretary will reduce the payment. Additionally, certain hospitals may receive increased payments for providing inpatient services to MA regional plan enrollees. This is to help MA organizations offering regional plans meet provider access requirements. To qualify, the organization must certify inability to reach an agreement with an essential hospital and show that costs exceed Medicare Part A payment. Beginning in 2006, there is $25 million available annually for payments to MA regional plans for Medicare services. The payments are based on the plan's bid or benchmark, with additional payments for enrollee premiums or rebates. Plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage receive a separate payment. Starting in 2006, the Secretary must adjust payments to regional MA plans to ensure they do not exceed the plan bid. The rebate to the plan can be used for additional benefits, reducing cost sharing, or applied towards premiums. A program for comparative cost adjustment will be established in 2010 for six years to test competition among local MA plans. The program for comparative cost adjustment in local MA plans will test competition in select areas with specific enrollment criteria. The Secretary will choose qualifying Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) where at least 25% of MA eligible individuals are enrolled in an MA local plan and where at least two MA local plans were offered before 2010. Up to six MSAs or 25% of qualifying MSAs will be selected as Competitive Choice Areas (CCA). In 2010, an MA local area in an MSA will be excluded from the CCA area if it does not offer at least two MA local plans from different organizations. The benchmark for MA local plans in a CCA area is calculated using a formula that weights the FFS portion and a local plan portion. Part B premiums for Medicare beneficiaries in FFS will be adjusted based on whether the FFS amount is more or less than the CCA area benchmark. The FFS amount compared to the CCA area benchmark affects Part B premiums for Medicare beneficiaries in traditional Medicare FFS. If the FFS amount is higher than the benchmark, Part B premiums increase, but if it's lower, premiums decrease by 75% of the difference. These adjustments are capped at 5% of the national Part B premium. Low-income beneficiaries below 150% of poverty are exempt from premium increases. Starting in 2010, the CCA non-drug monthly benchmark is calculated based on a formula involving MA plan bids. The MA plan bids are used to calculate the weighted average for an area, while the MA market share percentage represents the proportion of MA eligible individuals enrolled in an MA plan. The FFS component is determined by the FFS area-specific non-drug amount, which is the adjusted average per capita cost. The FFS market share percentage is the complement of the MA market share percentage. It represents the proportion of MA eligible individuals not enrolled in an MA plan. The benchmark for each CCA area is computed annually, starting in 2010, with the program phased-in over four years. Beginning in June 2004, MA plans could offer Medicare-endorsed drug discount cards to their enrollees through the drug discount card program. These cards provide discounts on drug prices, even if the plan does not have a drug benefit or if the plan benefit cap is reached. MA plans may offer Part D prescription drug coverage starting in 2006, but enrollment in Part D is voluntary. This could lead to a situation where only MA plans offering prescription drug coverage are available in an area. Plans available in an area must offer prescription drug coverage, with at least one MA-PD plan required if only one organization offers an MA plan. If multiple plans are offered by an MA organization, only one plan needs to provide Part D prescription drug coverage. Each organization in the area must offer at least one plan with prescription drug coverage, and MA-PD plans will receive drug subsidies for enrollees. MA-PD plans offering prescription drug coverage will receive subsidies for their enrollees, including a direct subsidy based on the plan's bid amount, a reinsurance payment, and reimbursement for low-income enrollees. Beneficiaries must pay the standard Part D premium, but MA-PD plans can offer rebates that can be used as a credit towards the monthly prescription drug premium. This could lead to different coverage and potential cost or enrollment changes in MA plans. MA plans offering prescription drug coverage may be able to decrease costs or increase services, making them more attractive. This could be achieved by leveraging their experience with Medicare beneficiaries, using funds for prescription drugs to offer more generous coverage, transferring funds to other services, and realizing savings from Medicare's prescription drug coverage. However, enrollment in MA plans could decrease if beneficiaries switch to fee-for-service plans for less restricted prescription drug coverage. The MMA brought significant changes to the healthcare landscape. The MMA made substantial changes to the Medicare managed care program, aiming to increase private plan participation and provide more beneficiaries with an alternative to fee-for-service coverage. The success of these changes will depend on private plans' willingness to comply with new statutes, with major program changes not taking effect until 2006. It will take a few years to determine the effectiveness of these changes."
