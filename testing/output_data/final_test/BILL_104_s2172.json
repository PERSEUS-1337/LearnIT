FINDINGS.\" The Congress acknowledges Alaska's management authority over fish and game resources, the state constitution's equal access requirement, the rural subsistence priority, and the precedence of subsistence uses on public lands. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the rural preference violated equal access provisions. The subsistence statute violated the equal access provision of the Alaska Constitution, leading to the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior taking over subsistence management on public lands in Alaska. Despite efforts by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor to resolve the issue, an impasse remains, causing division among various groups in Alaska. The Congress declares it is timely to address this issue. The Congress declares the need to review Federal and State policies on subsistence in Alaska to ensure fair priority for citizens and maintain State authority over fish and game resources. The Congress declares the need to review Federal and State policies on subsistence in Alaska to ensure fair priority for citizens and maintain State authority over fish and game resources. SEC. 2. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTER. The President appoints a Special Master to mediate issues related to subsistence use in Alaska. The Special Master's office will be in Alaska and will review state and federal laws on subsistence use after consulting with various stakeholders. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, along with the Alaska Congressional delegation, propose specific actions to Congress and the State of Alaska. These actions include state statutory amendments, changes in management structures, constitutional amendments, and modifications to title VIII of ANILCA. The recommendations aim to ensure Alaska regains and maintains management authority over fish and game on all lands, while also preserving subsistence uses for residents, including Natives and non-natives, on public and Native lands. These measures are crucial for the physical, economic, traditional, and cultural well-being of Alaska Natives and non-natives.
