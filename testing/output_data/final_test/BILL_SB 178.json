    "title": "SB 178",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 3.6 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in Title 12 of the Penal Code defines terms like \"adverse result\" and \"authorized possessor\" related to electronic communications. An adverse result includes danger to individuals, flight from prosecution, evidence tampering, witness intimidation, and trial delays. An authorized possessor is the owner or someone authorized by the owner of an electronic device. Electronic communication involves the transfer of various forms of data through different systems. Electronic communication information includes details about electronic communications such as contents, sender, recipients, format, and location. It also covers the time and date of the communication, as well as information about individuals or devices involved, excluding subscriber information. Electronic communication service refers to services that enable users to send or receive electronic communications, including intermediaries in transmission or storage of communication information. An \"electronic device\" stores, generates, or transmits information electronically. \"Electronic device information\" includes data stored on or generated by the device, including its current and prior locations. \"Electronic information\" encompasses electronic communication and device information. A \"government entity\" is a state department, agency, or individual acting on its behalf. A \"service provider\" offers electronic communication services. \"Service provider offers electronic communication services. Specific consent is direct consent to government entities seeking information. Subscriber information includes contact details provided to establish an account.\" Government entities are restricted from compelling the production or access to electronic communication information from service providers or electronic device information from unauthorized individuals. Accessing electronic device information through physical or electronic means is prohibited, except when voluntarily disclosed by the intended recipient of the communication. Government entities can only compel the production of electronic communication information or electronic device information under specific circumstances, such as with a warrant, wiretap order, or order for electronic reader records. Government entities can access electronic device information through a warrant, wiretap order, or with the consent of the authorized possessor of the device. Subpoenas can also be used under certain conditions, but not for investigating or prosecuting criminal offenses. Government entities can access electronic device information with specific consent from the authorized possessor or owner, especially if the device is reported lost or stolen, in emergencies involving danger, or if the device is believed to be lost, stolen, or abandoned for the purpose of identifying the owner. The warrant for electronic information must specify the information to be seized, including time periods, target individuals or accounts, applications or services, and types of information sought. The warrant for electronic information mandates that any unrelated information obtained must be sealed and not used without a court order, which can be granted if the information is relevant to an active investigation or required by law. The warrant for electronic information must comply with California and federal law, including provisions on search warrants. Service providers must verify the authenticity of produced electronic information. Courts have discretion to take certain actions when issuing warrants for electronic information. Appoint a special master to ensure only necessary information is accessed through warrants. Unrelated information must be destroyed after investigations. Service providers can voluntarily disclose information not prohibited by law. Government entities must destroy voluntarily provided information within 90 days unless certain circumstances apply. The entity can retain information from electronic communications with specific consent, court order, or for child pornography investigations. If a government entity obtains electronic information in an emergency involving danger of death or serious injury, they must file for a warrant within three days. The court must promptly rule on the application and order the destruction of the information if the emergency is not justified. If the facts do not justify an emergency or if the warrant application is rejected, the information must be destroyed. Government entities can use various subpoenas to require disclosure of electronic communication information, including subscriber information. Government entities must provide subscriber information to identified targets of a warrant or emergency request, along with a notice detailing the nature of the government investigation. The notice must be served contemporaneously with the execution of a warrant or within three days after obtaining electronic information. When a warrant is sought in an emergency under Section 1546.1, a government entity can request an order delaying notification if there is reason to believe that notification may have an adverse result, for up to 90 days. The court may grant extensions of the delay for another 90 days each. Upon expiration of the delay period, the government entity must serve the identified targets of the warrant with a document containing specified information and either all obtained electronic data or a summary. This includes details on the disclosed records, creation dates, and grounds for the court's decision to delay notification. (c) If there is no identified target of a warrant or emergency request at the time of its issuance, the government entity must submit all required information to the Department of Justice within three days of execution. If a notice delay order is obtained, the information must be submitted upon expiration of the delay period. The Department will publish these reports on its website within 90 days, with the option to redact personal information. Nothing in this chapter shall restrict a service provider from disclosing information about any request for electronic data. Any person in a trial, hearing, or proceeding may move to suppress electronic information obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment or this chapter. The Attorney General can initiate a civil action to enforce compliance with this chapter. An individual or entity can petition the court to void or modify a legal process that violates the law or constitution. A corporation and its employees are protected from legal action for complying with lawful warrants or orders."
