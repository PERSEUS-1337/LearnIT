    "content": "The \"Nepal Trade Preferences Act\" aims to use trade policies to reduce poverty and hunger. Congress believes in this objective. Eligibility requirements are outlined in the Act. The President can grant preferential treatment to articles imported directly from Nepal into the US if Nepal meets certain requirements outlined in the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Trade Act of 1974. Withdrawal, suspension, or limitation of preferential treatment for Nepal will follow the same provisions as stated in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 grants preferential treatment to articles imported from Nepal into the US, following the same provisions as beneficiary developing countries under title V of the Act. SEC. 4. ELIGIBLE ARTICLES. Eligible articles from Nepal can enter the US customs territory duty-free if they meet specific criteria, including being directly imported from Nepal and classified under certain subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Eligible articles from Nepal can enter the US customs territory duty-free if they are directly imported from Nepal and classified under specific subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. The text chunk consists of a list of specific subheadings from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, including codes like 4202.11.00, 4202.22.60, and 4202.92.08. These codes correspond to different articles eligible for duty-free entry into the US from Nepal. The curr_chunk contains a list of specific subheadings from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, including codes like 5701.10.90, 5702.91.30, and 5703.10.80. These codes correspond to different articles eligible for duty-free entry into the US from Nepal. The curr_chunk lists various subheadings from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, such as 6504.00.90, 6505.00.30, and 6506.99.60. These codes represent specific articles eligible for duty-free entry into the US from Nepal. The President can determine if an article is not import-sensitive from Nepal and if the cost or value of materials produced in Nepal is at least 35 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time of entry. Paragraph (1)(A)(i) states that an article can qualify by undergoing simple combining or packaging operations, or dilution with water or another substance that does not alter its characteristics. The cost of materials and processing operations in the US for the 35-percent requirement under paragraph (1)(E) cannot exceed 15 percent of the article's appraised value at entry. Verification for transshipment of textile and apparel articles is required periodically by the Commissioner. The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection verifies annually that textile and apparel articles from Nepal are not unlawfully transshipped into the United States. If any transshipment is found, the Commissioner reports this to the President. SEC. 5. TRADE FACILITATION AND CAPACITY BUILDING. Congress finds that Nepal, as a land-locked least-developed country, faces challenges in reaching markets and exporting goods. In 2015, Nepal's exports were around $800 million annually, with India being the major market at $450 million. The United States imports $80 million worth of goods from Nepal, accounting for 10% of Nepal's total exports. The World Bank reports a decline in Nepal's export competitiveness since 2005, citing high export costs compared to other low-income countries. The text highlights weaknesses in Nepal's trade facilitation, including automation of customs, involvement of local exporters, and export finance. Implementing the Agreement on Trade Facilitation could address these issues. A trade facilitation and capacity building program will be established for Nepal to enhance its export promotion agency and support successful exporters. The program aims to support exporters in Nepal, provide export finance training, maintain trade regulations, and facilitate a public-private dialogue for trade facilitation reforms. The program aims to support exporters in Nepal and increase access to guides for importers and exporters on the Internet, including rules and documentation for United States tariff preference programs. The President must report to Congress annually on the implementation of the Act, Nepal's compliance, and US trade policy with Nepal. Preferential treatment under the Act ends on December 31, 2025, and the Act takes effect on January 1, 2016."
