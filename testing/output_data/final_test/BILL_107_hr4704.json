    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Food Allergen Consumer Protection Act\". The Congress finds that approximately 7,000,000 Americans suffer from food allergies, with 30,000 receiving emergency room treatment and 150 dying from anaphylactic shock each year. Eight major foods cause 90% of allergic reactions, and there is currently no cure for food allergies. Consumers rely on accurate ingredient labeling to avoid allergens. The Food and Drug Administration found that 25% of bakery products, ice creams, and candies failed to list peanuts and eggs, posing a serious health threat to those with food allergies. Only slightly more than half of manufacturers checked their products for accurate ingredient labeling, leading to an increase in recalls due to unlabeled allergens. The number of recalls due to unlabeled allergens rose to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier. Mislabeling occurs when allergens are introduced into the manufacturing process through shared production lines and utensils. Individuals with food allergies may outgrow them by strictly avoiding the allergen, but low levels of allergens in foods make it difficult to avoid repeated exposure. Good manufacturing practices can help minimize unintentional allergen presence, and advisory labels can warn of potential cross-contamination. The Food and Drug Administration is responsible for regulating food to protect public health. They ensure proper labeling and manufacturing practices, penalizing violators. Americans should have confidence in the safety and labeling of their food. SEC. 3. FOOD LABELING; REQUIREMENT OF INFORMATION REGARDING ALLERGENIC SUBSTANCES. Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require bold labeling of known food allergens in non-agricultural commodities. The information can be included in labeling other than the main label if deemed sufficient by the Secretary for public health protection. The Secretary's determination of known food allergens is effective upon publication in the Federal Register. Known food allergens include milk, egg, fish, Crustacea, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, gluten-containing grains, and any other food causing allergic or adverse responses. The labeling requirement for spices, flavorings, colorings, or incidental additives containing known food allergens is applicable. Raw agricultural commodities with known food allergens must have bold-faced labeling. The labeling must use a single, easy-to-read type style in black on a white background. The labeling requirements for food packaging include using a single, easy-to-read type style in black on a white background, with no letters touching. The text must be at least 8 point type with one point leading, and comply with regulations for consumer readability. Civil penalties may apply for non-compliance. In an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, regulations are updated to minimize allergens in food and address misbranding issues. The term 'known food allergen' is defined, and these changes take effect 180 days after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act addresses the unintentional presence of known food allergens in food labeling. The labeling must include a statement if the food may contain the allergen, with compliance regulations issued by the Secretary. The effective date of this amendment is after a four-year period from the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue proposed and final rules within one and two years, respectively, after the enactment of the Act to implement labeling amendments regarding food allergens. The final rule takes effect after a four-year period from the Act's enactment. The proposed rule under this paragraph will take effect as a final rule. Regulations will require good manufacturing practices to minimize unintentional presence of known food allergens in food, including record-keeping and advisory labeling when necessary. The regulations prohibit the use of labeling for known food allergens to protect human health. The Secretary will prescribe a format for ingredient labeling. The Office of Management and Budget must review proposed rules within 10 days, or the rule will be published immediately. The rule shall be published in the Federal Register without review by OMB if the Secretary does not complete it within the specified time frames. SEC. 6. FOOD LABELING; INCLUSION OF TELEPHONE NUMBER. Section 403(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require manufacturers, packers, or distributors with annual gross sales over $500,000 to provide a toll-free telephone number for consumer inquiries. For those with sales under $500,000, they must provide a mailing address or website. The amendments made by subsection (a) take effect after 180 days from the enactment of this Act. SEC. 7. DATA ON FOOD-RELATED ALLERGIC RESPONSES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will annually publish national data on food allergies, deaths, injuries, hospitalizations, and drug usage related to allergic responses to foods. A study will be conducted within one year to gather information for this purpose. State governments and relevant parties will conduct a study to assess existing systems for reporting, collecting, and analyzing national data on specified subjects. The Secretary will educate healthcare providers to improve data reporting. Activities developed under this section should include Child Fatality Review Teams. Under this section, activities will involve utilizing child fatality review teams to identify and assess child deaths related to allergic responses to foods. The Secretary must report to Congress on progress within 18 months of the Act's enactment. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2003, with additional funding as needed for subsequent years. This section becomes effective upon the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a panel to review food allergies research efforts and develop a plan for expanding research activities. A report must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. This section becomes effective immediately. SEC. 9. Federal recommendations for avoiding and responding to food-related allergic responses. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is tasked with developing and disseminating recommendations for training emergency medical technicians on administering epinephrine auto-injectors and ensuring emergency vehicles have an adequate supply. They are also responsible for increasing awareness in the restaurant industry about preparing allergen-free foods and developing guidelines for food prepared for students in schools. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for developing and disseminating recommendations for preparing allergen-free foods in schools, with a focus on life-threatening food allergies."
