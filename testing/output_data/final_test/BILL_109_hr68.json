The \"NASA and JPL 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act\" authorizes the minting of $50 gold coins and $1 silver coins to commemorate the establishment of NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The $50 gold coins weigh 33.931 grams and contain 1 troy ounce of fine gold, while the $1 silver coins weigh 26.73 grams and contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper. The coins minted under the \"NASA and JPL 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act\" are legal tender and considered numismatic items under the United States Code. SEC. 3. DESIGN OF COINS. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the achievements of NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Each coin will include the coin's value, the year \"2008\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\", as well as other inscriptions determined appropriate by the Secretary. The $50 coins issued under this Act will feature the sun on the obverse and a design honoring fallen astronauts on the reverse. The edge will bear the names and dates of spacecraft missions where astronauts lost their lives. The design will be in high relief. The $1 coins issued under this Act will have high relief designs on both the obverse and reverse. The obverse will feature images of the 9 planets of the solar system, including Earth, while the reverse will depict discoveries and missions of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory related to the planet shown on the coin. The $1 coins issued under this Act will feature high relief designs of the 9 planets of the solar system on the obverse. The reverse of the Earth coin will honor NASA missions, while the reverse of the Jupiter coin will depict missions related to Jupiter. The $1 coins issued under this Act will feature high relief designs of the 9 planets of the solar system on the obverse. The reverse of the Jupiter coin will include a scientifically accurate depiction of the moon Europa and depict both past and future missions to Europa. The reverse of the Saturn coin will include a scientifically accurate depiction of the moon Titan. The reverse of the $1 coins issued under this Act will feature an image of the planet Pluto and a design emblematic of telescopic exploration of deep space by NASA and the search for Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. The designs of $1 coins should bear names, dates, or mission types related to the planet depicted on the obverse. The images must be realistic, scientifically accurate, and reminiscent of the artwork from the \"Golden Age of Coinage\" in the United States. Noted sculptors and artists like James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens should be involved in the selection process. The design for the coins minted under this Act shall be selected by the Secretary after consultation with the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens Coin Advisory Committee. The design for coins minted under this Act will include metals that have flown in space. The Federal agencies and institutions of the United States possessing space-flown craft must retrieve metals suitable for coin production as determined by the Director of the US Mint. These metals are then deposited with the Director for use in minting coins. The metals retrieved from space-flown crafts must be deposited with the Director of the US Mint for use in producing coins. The metals will be blended with other necessary metals to ensure all coins contain a proportion of the space-flown bullion. Federal agencies should maintain accurate records for the Mint Director to provide certificates of authenticity with the coins. The Act requires certificates of authenticity for coins made from metals retrieved from space-flown crafts and a list of missions they flew in. Federal agencies must secure metals from private crafts for coin production. Federal agencies and instrumentality of the United States must comply with recordkeeping procedures for metals retrieved from privately-held crafts that have flown in space. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in proof quality only, with a specific facility of the United States Mint designated for each denomination and quality combination. The Secretary is authorized to begin issuing these coins on January 1, 2008, but minting authority will cease after December 31, 2008. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing the coins. Prepaid orders will be accepted at a reasonable discount, and the Secretary will determine appropriate methods of presentation for the coins. The Secretary will provide a presentation case for the $50 gold coin surrounded by $1 silver coins in an elliptical orbit. SEC. 7. SURCHARGES. All sales of coins minted under this Act include a surcharge: $50 per $50 coin and $10 per $1 coin. Surcharges received will be distributed to the NASA Family Assistance Fund and the Smithsonian Institution for specific purposes. The National Air and Space Museum preserves space artifacts, including the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. Funds from coin sales go to the NASA Family Assistance Fund and the Smithsonian Institution for specific purposes, including the establishment of a new National Museum of Money. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue guidance to limit the number of commemorative coin programs issued in a calendar year to avoid exceeding the annual issuance limitation under section 5112(m)(1) of title 31, United States Code. The Secretary is authorized to strike and sell bronze duplicates of $50 gold coins at a price determined appropriate."
