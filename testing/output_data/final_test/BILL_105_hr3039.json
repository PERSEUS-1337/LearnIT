    "content": "The \"Veterans Transitional Housing Opportunities Act of 1998\" is introduced to provide loan guarantees for multifamily transitional housing for homeless veterans under a new subchapter in the United States Code. The \"Veterans Transitional Housing Opportunities Act of 1998\" establishes definitions for terms like 'veteran' and 'homeless veteran,' and grants the Secretary authority to guarantee repayment of loans for transitional housing for homeless veterans. The guarantee of a loan under the Act must be sufficient to sell it in a commercial market, with a limit of $100,000,000 in total guaranteed loans. Approval from the Secretary is required before guaranteeing a loan, and contracts with nonprofit organizations are made for advice on loan terms and conditions meeting specific requirements. The Secretary may guarantee loans under this subchapter without prior appropriations. Loans must meet requirements for construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of multifamily transitional housing projects. The Secretary may guarantee loans for projects involving acquisition of furniture, equipment, supplies, or materials, or providing working capital. The loan must be connected to funding or property/services provided by a government or nongovernmental entity. The maximum loan amount is determined based on prudent underwriting principles to ensure repayment. The Secretary may guarantee loans for multifamily transitional housing projects that provide housing to homeless veterans. The loan must be of sound value, secured, and subject to reasonable terms and conditions determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may guarantee loans for multifamily transitional housing projects that provide housing to homeless veterans, with supportive services, job counseling, employment requirements, reasonable fees, sobriety guidelines, and potential retail or job training space. Transitional housing may also be provided to non-homeless veterans and homeless individuals, with a focus on homeless veterans' needs in the project area. The Secretary may guarantee loans for multifamily transitional housing projects that provide housing to homeless veterans, with supportive services, job counseling, employment requirements, reasonable fees, sobriety guidelines, and potential retail or job training space. The housing needs of homeless veterans in the project area have been met, and the provisions of subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (1) are met. In determining whether to guarantee a loan, the Secretary shall consider the availability of Department of Veterans Affairs medical services to residents and the extent to which needs of homeless veterans are met in the community. The Secretary is required to take steps to recover defaulted loans guaranteed under this subchapter. Lenders can file a claim for the difference between the outstanding loan amount and the sale proceeds. Additionally, audits are mandated during the initial three years of operation for multifamily projects. During the first 3 years of a multifamily transitional housing project with a guaranteed loan, an annual independent audit is required. The audit must detail the project's operations, activities, and accomplishments for the year. The responsible party for obtaining and paying for the audit must be determined before the guarantee is issued. The curr_chunk provides definitions, general authority, requirements, default, and audit procedures for a loan guarantee program for multifamily transitional housing for homeless veterans."
