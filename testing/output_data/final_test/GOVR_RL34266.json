    "content": "The focus of policy-makers on climate change science has shifted to debate over the magnitude and patterns of future climate change, potential impacts, and how projections may inform policy choices. There is growing recognition of a wider variety of human-related \"forcings\" of climate change beyond greenhouse gases, hindering understanding due to uncertainties in climate models. The curr_chunk discusses feedbacks to climate change, socio-economic factors, policy responses, and the importance of further research. It highlights major scientific observations and conclusions from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report. The focus has shifted to debate over future climate change impacts and policy choices. The IPCC in 2007 declared that the Earth's climate has warmed by 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. Observational evidence shows that natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, with precipitation increasing over the past century. Greenhouse gas concentrations are attributed to observed increases in ocean temperatures, altered wind patterns, extreme weather events, melting glaciers and sea ice, and changes in the timing of seasons. The global climate has been warming with natural variability, influenced by greenhouse gas forcing. Despite fluctuations, a warming trend persisted through 2008, ranking it as the eighth warmest year globally since 1880. Climate varies annually and over longer cycles, with a century-long trend towards warming. Regional and local climates exhibit even more variability, cautioning against hasty trend detection. Individual hot or cool years and extreme weather events may not signify more than normal variability, with factors like La Nina and solar variability impacting global temperatures. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) produced a new synthesis report in 2008, reanalyzing the U.S. climate from 1950 to the present. The researchers estimated average warming over North America to have been 0.9 o C (1.6 o F) from 1951 to 2006, with the largest yearly average regional temperature increases occurring over northern and western North America. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program's 2008 report analyzed climate trends in North America from 1950 to the present. It found a 0.9 o C (1.6 o F) average warming, with the most significant temperature increases in northern and western regions. The report also noted no significant changes in precipitation trends since 1951, but highlighted increased competition for water resources in some areas, leading to heightened vulnerability to drought. The IPCC's 2007 assessment attributed most of the global temperature increase since the mid-20th century to human-induced greenhouse gas concentrations. The dominant driver of climate change since the 1970s is the increase of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere due to human activities. The reanalysis of North American climate data concluded that more than half of the average continental warming since 1951 has been due to human activities. Sea surface temperatures have likely affected temperature trends and regional differences in temperature and precipitation. The increase of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere due to human activities has been the dominant driver of climate change since the 1970s. Sea surface temperatures have likely contributed to multi-year droughts. Policy attention has focused on six gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol, with carbon dioxide being the most important human-influenced greenhouse gas globally. Other greenhouse gases and human-related factors that could offer climate change abatement opportunities have received less policy attention. The curr_chunk discusses various types of air pollutants, including ozone, tropospheric ozone (smog), regional scale pollutants like sulfates and black carbon aerosols. These pollutants can impact local climate changes and contribute to environmental and health effects. Scientists have shown that black carbon aerosols can accelerate climate changes and increasing melt on snow. Abatement of black carbon aerosols could help slow atmospheric changes. Some researchers argue that abatement of black carbon aerosols could help slow atmospheric warming and melting in the Arctic and mountainous regions. New types of emissions, like nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3), have small but potentially growing effects on climate change. Land use changes also influence local and global climates, with the built environment often using dark materials like asphalt. The built environment, with dark materials like asphalt, contributes to urban heat islands. Other factors like loss of snow cover and changes in vegetation also impact climate change. While CO2 emissions remain important, these additional influences offer opportunities for mitigation locally and globally. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased from 280 ppm to 386 ppm in 2008. The IPCC concluded in 2007 that human activities, primarily the use of fossil fuels, have significantly increased CO2 and methane concentrations in the atmosphere. Despite a shift towards cleaner fuels, CO2 emissions per unit of energy supplied have been increasing since 2000. Methane concentrations have also risen, but the growth rate has slowed due to various factors like economic restructuring and methane recovery for energy purposes. Since around 1999, methane concentrations have slightly increased, with a notable uptick in 2007. Nitrous oxide emissions are steadily growing, while CFC and HCFC levels have remained stable or declined since the early- to mid-1990s. The United States and China are the top contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, with China surpassing the US in CO2 emissions around 2005. China's industrialization, heavily reliant on coal, is expected to keep it as the largest CO2 emitter, despite efforts to improve energy efficiency and promote renewable energy. The IPCC has established ambitious policies to improve energy efficiency, promote renewable energy, and reduce polluting emissions. Future greenhouse gas emissions are expected to grow rapidly in developing economies as they aim to eliminate poverty and increase income levels. The trajectory of future GHG emissions is uncertain and depends on economic growth, technology, and policy choices. Human influences have likely contributed to various climate changes, including sea level rise, changes in wind patterns, temperature increases, and an increased risk of heat waves and drought since the 1970s. The anthropogenic warming over the last three decades has likely influenced global changes in physical and biological systems, including increased risk of heat waves, drought, and heavy precipitation events. Sea ice at the poles plays a crucial role in the Earth's climate system, affecting Arctic atmospheric circulation, polar warming, and human activities like shipping and tourism. Shrinking Arctic sea ice levels have been observed since satellite measurements began in 1979. Since satellite measurements began in 1979, Arctic sea ice cover has decreased significantly. In September 2008, the average sea ice extent was 4.67 million square kilometers, compared to the record low of 4.28 million square kilometers in September 2007. The rate of sea ice decline has been approximately 11% per decade, exceeding climate model predictions. Factors such as GHG-induced warming and changing wind patterns have contributed to the rapid loss of Arctic sea ice. The Arctic sea ice has been decreasing significantly since satellite measurements began in 1979. In 2008, there were near-record lows despite more \"normal\" wind and atmospheric conditions. Melting ice triggers a positive feedback loop that increases ocean warming, leading to further ice melting. Updated estimates project the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer by 2040 or sooner if current trends continue. Some scientists are concerned about a potential spiral of warming feedbacks. The melting of Arctic sea ice contributes to concerns about global warming due to its impact on warming Arctic waters and atmosphere, as well as the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Recent changes in melting rates of the Greenland Ice Sheet show variability in the climate system, with accelerated ice flows from glaciers surprising scientists. The lack of prediction of this phenomenon led the IPCC to exclude ice sheet melting from its projections of sea level rise. The high melting rates of the Greenland Ice Sheet in 2005 raised concerns about sea level rise due to global warming. Some scientists warn about potential catastrophic impacts if certain \"tipping points\" of the climate system are passed. Melting rates returned closer to average in 2006, revealing greater variability and complexity in ice dynamics. Warming waters near glacier outlets accelerate ice flows, but glaciers can regain stability on their grounding rock after a retreat. The Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass overall, mainly from the western Antarctic ice sheet. Snow is melting farther inland and at higher altitudes, with increased melting on the Ross Ice Shelf. Some high elevation regions show less melting. Changes in temperatures are linked to melting in Antarctica, indicating a connection to global climate change. The Antarctic survey revealed that 300 glaciers increased their flow rate by 12% from 1993 to 2003 due to thinning at the edge of the sea. This acceleration is linked to local warming on the Antarctic Peninsula, where 87% of glaciers have retreated. In 2008, parts of the Wilkins Ice Sheet disintegrated, showing similarities to the Larsen A and B ice shelves. The disintegration of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002 was the first in 12,000 years, possibly influenced by warming ocean waters. Some glaciers in Antarctica have increased flow rates due to thinning at the sea edge, while others in the south-western Antarctica Peninsula have seen doubled snow accumulation since 1850. In Europe, glaciers at high altitudes have experienced less change compared to those at lower altitudes. Some glaciers have experienced increased flow rates due to thinning at the sea edge, while others have seen doubled snow accumulation since 1850. Melting ice from glaciers and ice caps contributes to sea level rise, with further warming potentially accelerating dynamic ice melt and raising sea levels by 4 to 10 inches by 2100. Recent articles have proposed new estimates for sea level rise in the 21st Century, with Pfeffer et al. suggesting a maximum of 2 meters (6.6 feet) and Grinsted et al. predicting 0.9 to 1.3 meters (3 to 4.3 feet) by 2100. Human factors may have influenced 60% of changes in the hydrological cycle in the western United States between 1950 and 1999, impacting river flows, winter temperatures, and snow pack. The authors highlighted studies in 2008 showing the impact of climate change on ecosystems. One study found warming in the Southern Ocean threatening King penguin populations. Other studies emphasized threats to coral reefs globally from heat stress and ocean acidification. Almost one-third of reef-building coral species face an increased risk of extinction, with the Caribbean having the highest share. The Caribbean region has the highest share of corals at risk of extinction, while the Coral Triangle in the western Pacific has the greatest share of coral species at risk. A 2008 study on Australia's Great Barrier Reef showed a 14% decrease in coral calcification since 1990, with unprecedented decline. Risks to coral reefs from global warming and ocean acidification are well-studied, but impacts on reef fish communities are not well-documented. Another 2008 study assessed coral bleaching events in the Indian Ocean, showing variable impacts on fish communities. The authors found that the ocean scale integrity of fish communities was lost due to coral bleaching events, impacting size structure, diversity, and food-chain composition of reef fish. Management regimes did not affect ecosystem responses, highlighting the need for strategies to enhance system-wide resilience to climate variability. Some corals may adapt to bleaching by changing the types of algae they depend on. Climate change, land-use, and other factors have led to range contractions, species extinction, and shifts in animal and plant behavior. Polar bears and other species are facing challenges due to changes in sea ice patterns. Observations show lower survival rates among cubs and young bears in various regions. Forest systems are adapting to climate change, with U.S. forests showing resilience and productivity linked to tree species diversity. Amazon forests in Brazil have also shown resilience to changing conditions. In Brazil, Amazon forests have shown resilience to short severe droughts in 2005, with increased productivity and above-ground biomass. Changes in plant species composition favor fast-growing species due to global environmental changes like elevated CO2 levels. High temperatures initially increase CO2 uptake in tropical forests but then decline, suggesting a threshold is being approached. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program released a report in 2007 on scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric concentrations. The research explored future GHG emissions scenarios and the impact of economic growth and fossil fuel use on the Earth's radiation balance. It also examined scenarios to stabilize GHG concentrations at different levels, including 750 ppm, 650 ppm, 550 ppm, and 450 ppm. The analysis of greenhouse gas emissions concluded that emissions reductions vary across different radiative forcing stabilization levels. Under the most stringent levels (450-550 ppm), emissions decline immediately or within decades, while under less stringent levels (750 ppm), CO2 emissions peak late in the century at 1\u00bd to over 2\u00bd times today's levels in 2100. The results are similar to the IPCC's 2000 Special Report on Emission Scenarios, projecting global GHG emissions to increase by 25-90% from 2000 to 2030 without mitigation policies. Concentrations in the atmosphere are expected to reach 600-1550 ppm. Scientists project that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will continue to rise, potentially reaching 600-1550 ppm. This increase is likely to raise global average temperatures by at least 1.5 o Celsius (2.7 o Fahrenheit) above 1990 levels, with a possibility of exceeding 5 o C (9 o F). Climate models suggest a temperature rise of 2.5 o to 3.5 o C (4.5 to 6.3 o F) by 2100. Future climate change may lead to more extreme weather events, with wet regions getting wetter and dry regions becoming drier. Floods, droughts, storms, and other extreme events are expected to increase, impacting both ecosystems and human populations. Short-lived air pollutants like tropospheric ozone and black carbon aerosols could contribute up to 20% of global warming by 2050, with a climate model predicting significant temperature increases and rainfall decreases over the continental United States. Addressing short-lived air pollution alongside long-lived greenhouse gases offers opportunities to mitigate near-term climate change and reduce health and environmental impacts. Sea levels could rise by 18 to 59 centimeters (7 to 23 inches) with projected global warming. Sea levels could rise by 18 to 59 centimeters (7 to 23 inches) by 2100 due to global warming, with concerns about potential abrupt \"tipping points\" in the climate system. IPCC scientists were unable to estimate risks of accelerated melting from Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets due to limited understanding of their dynamics. Figure 3 shows estimates of dangerous \"tipping points\" in the climate system relative to future global temperature increases. The curr_chunk discusses the likelihood of global temperature increases due to human-related greenhouse gas emissions since 1750, potentially leading to various impacts such as ice-free Arctic summers and melting of glaciers. It also mentions that some impacts of climate change may be beneficial in certain locations with a few degrees of warming. Impacts of climate change are expected to be mostly adverse, including lower agricultural productivity, drought, rising sea levels, and spread of disease vectors. Risks of abrupt environmental changes are likely to increase with global temperature rise, potentially leading to major ecosystem reorganization and stresses on human systems. Impacts on water resources are also expected to be significant. Impacts of climate change on water resources are expected to be serious due to rising demand and management issues. Earlier melting of snowpack and ice in some regions will reduce water supply to settlements dependent on snowmelt, while sea level rise is submerging low-lying lands and increasing coastal flooding. Coastal development, natural processes, and climate change contribute to impacts on coastal areas. Ecosystems and geological systems can shift with rising water levels in undeveloped areas. However, developed coastal areas with buildings and infrastructure are more vulnerable. High population density, climate change effects, storms, and environmental stressors increase vulnerability to sea-level rise. Agriculture in tropical regions may face productivity losses due to higher temperatures and limited irrigation. Rising growing season temperatures could lead to extreme heat events. Climate change poses challenges for agriculture, including increased pest survival and expanded ranges, leading to higher costs and decreased yields. Studies also highlight risks to human health, such as diarrhoeal disease, heat stress, and respiratory issues, with potential benefits of reduced cold weather mortality. Climate change is likely to have significant impacts on human health, including malaria, cholera, malnutrition, and respiratory issues due to elevated air pollution. Mental health concerns are also raised, with potential effects on birth ratios and male longevity. Changes in ecological systems and species ranges are expected, with risks of extinctions for species with narrow distributions. Climate change impacts are projected to lead to novel climates in 12% to 39% of Earth's land areas by 2100. Disparities across regions will increase pressure on international aid and migration, potentially affecting political stability and security. Adaptation may help alleviate impacts, but it becomes more challenging with widespread, uncertain, and severe climate changes. Government officials from most countries, including the United States, agreed on a Summary for Policymakers of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report on November 16, 2007. The report represents a consensus among officials and researchers and will be the core source of information for policymakers to base their actions on in the coming years. Key conclusions include the unequivocal warming of the climate system and the impact on natural systems worldwide. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of human activities on global greenhouse gas emissions, particularly the significant increase in CO2 levels since pre-industrial times. It also highlights the role of fossil fuel use in driving these emissions and the observed increase in globally-averaged temperatures due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations on climate change, including the expected warming trends and potential irreversible impacts. It also mentions the acidification of oceans due to increased carbon uptake and the inevitable sea level rise. Loss of several meters could occur if warming exceeds 1.9-4.6 o C above pre-industrial levels sustained over centuries. Certain ecosystems like tundra, boreal forests, and mountain regions are sensitive to warming, while Mediterranean-type ecosystems and tropical rainforests face reduced rainfall. Coastal ecosystems like mangroves and salt marshes, marine ecosystems like coral reefs, and water resources in dry regions are also at risk. Agriculture in low-latitudes, low-lying coastal systems, and human health are all vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Efforts to reduce vulnerability to climate change require more extensive adaptation, but barriers, limits, and costs are not fully understood. International cooperation can help reduce global costs for mitigation and improve environmental effectiveness through various actions. Decisions on non-climate policies can significantly impact emissions, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability. Determining 'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system' is crucial in relation to the UNFCCC. \"Efforts to reduce vulnerability to climate change require extensive adaptation. International cooperation can help reduce global costs for mitigation. Decisions on non-climate policies impact emissions, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability. Determining 'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system' is crucial in relation to the UNFCCC. Mitigation can reduce impacts, and achieving stabilisation levels is feasible with current or expected technologies and effective incentives. A carbon-price signal could significantly enhance mitigation potential in all sectors.\" Global carbon prices are projected to rise to 20-80 US$/tCO2-eq by 2030 for stabilisation at around 550 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. Induced technological change could lower these prices to 5-65 US$/tCO2-eq in 2030. Energy efficiency will play a key role in reducing emissions, with investments needed for rapid diffusion of low emissions technologies. Mobilizing financing for low-carbon technologies is crucial for achieving significant emission reductions. \"Mobilizing financing for low-carbon technologies is crucial for achieving significant emission reductions. The macro-economic costs of mitigation rise with the stringency of the stabilisation target. Estimates of the social cost of carbon vary widely due to different assumptions, and aggregate estimates of costs underestimate damage costs.\" \"Choices about the scale and timing of GHG mitigation involve balancing economic costs of rapid emission reductions against medium and long-term climate risks.\""
