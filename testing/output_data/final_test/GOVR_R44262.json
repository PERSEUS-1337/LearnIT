    "content": "The report discusses the FY2017 budget request for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) under the Obama and Trump administrations. The Trump Administration proposed an $18 billion decrease in nondefense appropriations for FY2017, with uncertainty on how it would affect EERE. The FY2018 budget blueprint focuses on limited, early-stage applied energy research and development activities, requesting $28.0 billion for DOE, a 5.6% decrease from FY2017. The Trump Administration proposed a $1.7 billion cut for the DOE in the FY2018 budget blueprint, with uncertainties on how it would impact EERE programs. The blueprint specifies the elimination of the Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program. The Obama Administration had requested $4.2 billion for EERE in FY2017, a significant increase from the previous year. The FY2017 energy and water appropriations bill allocated $2.1 billion for EERE, impacting goals such as sustainable transportation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. The funding level could affect EERE's involvement in clean transportation plans and industry competitiveness. This report does not discuss the economic value or commercial status of renewable energy technologies selected by EERE. EERE leads DOE's efforts to accelerate development. EERE leads DOE's efforts to accelerate development of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. It is organized into four offices and collaborates with industry, academia, and national laboratories to develop technology roadmaps and reduce market barriers for new technologies. EERE manages a portfolio of research and development programs. EERE manages research and development programs supporting state and local governments, tribes, and schools. It oversees the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and receives funding from the annual E&W appropriations bill. Despite budget requests for increased funding, Congress has provided lower levels of funding, averaging $1.86 billion annually over the last six years. The appropriations are split into sustainable transportation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and corporate support categories. The Obama Administration requested $4.2 billion for EERE programs in FY2017, with $2.9 billion in discretionary funding and $1.3 billion in mandatory funding. This represents a significant increase from the FY2016 level. The FY2017 EERE request allocates 61% of appropriations to sustainable transportation and energy efficiency, with energy efficiency receiving less than in FY2016. Renewable energy and corporate support receive 21% and 10% of the request, respectively. The request includes support for the Electric Vehicle Everywhere Grand Challenge to reduce costs by 50% by 2022. The FY2017 EERE request allocates funds for sustainable transportation and energy efficiency, including support for the SuperTruck II initiative to improve freight-hauling efficiency, explore energy efficiency at the transportation system level with the TAS initiative, and support the conversion of cellulosic and algal-based feedstocks to bio-based gasoline. The FY2017 EERE request allocates funds for the conversion of cellulosic and algal-based feedstocks to bio-based gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at a target cost of $3.00 per gallon of gasoline equivalent by the end of 2017. It also includes support for a Synthetic Biology Foundry to improve biomass conversion efficiencies and for reducing the cost of hydrogen from renewable resources to less than $4.00/gge by 2020. Additionally, funds are allocated to support the SunShot Initiative goal of making solar power cost-competitive without subsidies by 2020. The FY2017 EERE request allocates funds for various renewable energy projects including concentrating solar power, offshore wind R&D, hydropower development, wave energy test facility, geothermal technology, and energy efficiency. Total funding amounts to $1.1 billion. The FY2017 EERE request allocates funds for renewable energy projects including concentrating solar power, offshore wind R&D, hydropower development, wave energy test facility, geothermal technology, and energy efficiency totaling $1.1 billion. Initiatives include control of fractures and fluid flow, energy efficiency, Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, Low-GWP Advanced Cooling R&D, Metropolitan Systems initiative, appliance and equipment standards, and home weatherization services for low-income households. Total funding for these initiatives amounts to $1.1 billion. The Obama Administration's EERE initiatives aimed to reduce energy costs for low-income households through various programs, including the 3C Energy Program with $26 million in funding. Other initiatives focused on technology-to-market activities and international collaborations. Additionally, a new innovation initiative program was proposed in the FY2017 budget to fund research, development, and demonstration projects. The Obama Administration proposed a new 21st Century Clean Transportation program funded at $320 billion over 10 years. It aims to create a cleaner, more sustainable transportation system through a $10 per barrel fee on oil and one-time revenues. The Obama Administration proposed a new 21st Century Clean Transportation program funded at $320 billion over 10 years. It includes a $10 per barrel fee on oil phased in over five years and one-time revenues from pro-growth business tax reform. The EERE FY2017 budget request would provide $1.3 billion of mandatory funding to support the program, with more than half allocated to low-carbon fueling infrastructure deployment. EERE will seek to support this effort with $11.3 billion over 10 years, focusing on developing regional low-carbon fueling infrastructure.

EERE will seek to support this effort with $11.3 billion over 10 years, focusing on developing regional low-carbon fueling infrastructure. The program aims to accelerate cutting the cost of battery technology, establish public-private partnerships for low carbon transport, create a smart mobility research center, and conduct R&D on biofuel feedstock logistics and cleaner vehicle fleets.

The EERE FY2017 budget request includes $1.3 billion of mandatory funding to support the program, focusing on low-carbon fueling infrastructure deployment. This funding would significantly increase compared to the FY2016 enacted appropriations for EERE. The plan may involve efforts previously dismissed by Congress, such as establishing regional fueling infrastructure for low-carbon fuels. Congress may need to examine the impact on clean transportation expansion, clean energy sources, and conventional energy sources, as well as the program's implementation speed and effectiveness. The Senate passed the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 2028) on May 12, 2016, providing $2.1 billion for EERE. The House rejected a similar bill (H.R. 5055) on May 26, 2016, which would have allocated $1.8 billion for EERE. Funding is currently provided by a continuing resolution."
