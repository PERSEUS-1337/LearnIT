    "content": "The security situation in Central America has worsened in the past decade due to the expansion of gangs, drug traffickers, and criminal groups. This has led to increased levels of crime and violence, particularly in the \"northern triangle\" countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Citizens in these nations now consider crime as the top issue, leading to a rise in emigration. The economic impact of crime and violence in the region ranges from 2.5% to 10.5% of GDP. Some analysts believe that organized crime in Central America poses a greater threat to regional security than past civil conflicts. Despite the worsening security situation in Central America due to gangs, drug traffickers, and criminal groups, U.S. policymakers only recently increased attention and financial support to the region. In the 1980s, the U.S. provided significant economic and military assistance to prevent Soviet influence. However, attention declined in the 1990s after civil wars ended. Security assistance to the region only substantially increased in FY2008 with the M\u00e9rida Initiative, focusing on counterdrug and anticrime efforts primarily in Mexico. In FY2010, the Central America portion of the M\u00e9rida Initiative was re-launched as the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) to address a broader array of security concerns in the region. Congress has appropriated nearly $1.2 billion for Central America through the M\u00e9rida Initiative and CARSI since FY2008. The M\u00e9rida Initiative was re-launched as CARSI in FY2010 to address security challenges in Central America. Despite funding for over seven years, the region still faces significant security issues. Congress may consider the scope of challenges, current efforts by Central American governments, and U.S. support. Policy issues for Congress include strategy, funding levels, human rights promotion, and the impact of U.S. domestic policies on regional security conditions. Central America, particularly the northern triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, are experiencing escalating homicides and crime by drug traffickers and gangs. The security situations in these countries are more dire than in Mexico, with higher homicide rates. Common crime is also widespread, with a significant portion of the population being victims within the past year. Recent studies have shown that victims of crime or those perceiving an increase in crime express less support for the political system and rule of law. Vigilante killings have been carried out by both civilians and police, as seen in recent incidents in El Salvador. Central American countries face challenges of poverty, inequality, and unemployment, particularly affecting youth populations. These countries, except for Costa Rica and Panama, are low-income with high poverty levels and significant income disparities. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has found that countries with large income disparities have higher homicide rates. Poverty and inequality in Central American countries have been reinforced by limited social mobility and persistent unemployment. Family disintegration due to emigration has weakened the social fabric. Central American countries, except for Belize and Costa Rica, have histories of armed conflicts and dictatorships, hindering the development of democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law. Protracted armed conflicts in Central American countries have led to the widespread proliferation of illicit firearms and a cultural tendency towards violence. Former combatants have joined criminal groups, with illicit networks evolving into transnational criminal organizations smuggling drugs, weapons, and other goods. Governance issues have made many countries vulnerable to criminal influence, with governments lacking operational control over their territories. For example, the Mexico-Guatemala border is 600 miles long and poorly monitored. Resource constraints and corruption in Central America have hindered territorial control, with security forces lacking manpower and equipment to effectively monitor remote regions. Governments have been reluctant to increase tax collection, leading to low tax revenue in the region. Corruption is prevalent in the police, prisons, judicial, and political systems, partly due to the failure to implement post-conflict institutional reforms in the 1990s. Criminal groups have exploited these weaknesses to exert influence. In the 1990s, post-conflict institutional reforms were not fully implemented in Central America, leading to corruption in various sectors. Transparency International's 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index highlighted high levels of public sector corruption in the region. Guatemala and Honduras have faced major corruption scandals, with top officials being implicated and even the resignation of a president. Weak state institutions have allowed criminal groups to influence public officials and elections. Weak state presence, corruption, and criminal infiltration in Central America have led to widespread impunity and eroded public confidence in governments. Only 4% of homicides in Honduras between 2010 and 2013 resulted in convictions, contributing to low trust in law enforcement. Private security firms are increasingly being used by businesses and wealthy individuals in the region, with more authorized private security personnel than police. Non-state actors like drug trafficking organizations and gangs are also gaining influence in governance. Criminal organizations, including drug trafficking groups and gangs, are exerting control in areas where national governments have failed to establish a strong presence. They take advantage of the instability and institutional weakness in Central America to engage in various illicit activities, from extortion and robbery to drug trafficking and human smuggling. This leads to violence when challenged by rivals or security forces. The region serves as a key pathway for illegal drugs, like Andean cocaine, entering the United States. The primary pathway for illegal drugs, including Andean cocaine, entering the United States is through Mexico. Recently, traffickers have started using Central America as a transshipment point due to increased enforcement in Mexico and instability in certain Central American countries. About 84% of cocaine trafficked to the United States passes through Central America and Mexico, along with opiates, foreign-produced marijuana, and methamphetamine. President Obama identified all seven Central American nations as \"major drug transit\" countries for the fifth consecutive year. Mexican and Colombian drug trafficking organizations tend to use local drug trafficking groups in Central America to transport drugs, but Mexican drug traffickers like the Sinaloa DTO and the Zetas are increasingly taking over transshipment activities. Mexican DTOs are active in Guatemala, battling for control over drug smuggling routes and increasing drug consumption in many countries. The DTOs, particularly the Zetas, have taken control of migrant smuggling routes in Central America, leading to disputes over drug markets. Central American governments, media, and analysts often attribute violent crime to transnational youth gangs like the \"18th Street\" gang and Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) with ties to the United States. The 18th Street gang was formed in the 1960s by Mexican youth in Los Angeles, while MS-13 was created by Salvadorans in Los Angeles during the 1980s. MS-13 and 18th Street gangs were formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s. They later expanded to Central America, especially after the US began deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records back to the region in 1996. Estimates vary, with a State Department official suggesting 85,000 gang members in the northern triangle countries in 2012, while UNODC estimated a more modest 54,000 members in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. El Salvador has the highest concentration of gang members. Central American countries, particularly El Salvador and Honduras, have a high concentration of gang members, with gangs being blamed for a large percentage of homicides in recent years. Gangs are involved in extortion, kidnapping, and smuggling activities, extorting millions of dollars from residents and businesses in the region. Nicaragua has a significant number of gang members but fewer MS-13 or M-18 members due to lower deportation rates from the United States. Other countries like Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama also have local gangs. The MS-13 and M-18 gangs have expanded their presence and illicit activities in Central America. Gangs in El Salvador have ties with gangs in Los Angeles and Washington, DC. Gang involvement in drug trafficking is increasing, with the 18th Street gang in Honduras focusing on extortion and the MS-13 on local drug dealing. There is a transactional relationship between gangs and drug trafficking organizations in El Salvador. Some MS-13 members are hired by Mexican DTOs for revenge killings. The term transnational gangs like the maras primarily focus on local issues such as extortion and drug distribution. Other criminal organizations in the region are involved in various illicit activities like arms trafficking, human trafficking, and money laundering. Some groups have ties to legitimate businesses for revenue. Some criminal enterprises in Central America operate at different scales, with some focusing on specific areas while others, known as \"organized crime,\" have the resources to run sophisticated operations and infiltrate state institutions. These groups can be domestically-based or transnational, with domestic organizations in Guatemala, known as \"hidden powers,\" involving members of the political and economic elite. Transnational criminal groups operate across borders in the region. Central American governments are facing increasing threats from domestic and transnational criminal groups. The northern triangle countries have taken aggressive measures like tough anti-gang laws and military deployment to address rising violence. However, these reactive policies have not effectively reduced crime rates and have led to unintended negative consequences. Experts recommend adopting holistic approaches and experimenting with alternative policies like gang truces to improve citizen security. Central American governments have implemented tough anti-gang policies, known as mano dura, in response to escalating gang-related crime. These policies involve incarcerating youth with visible tattoos and increasing sentences for gang-related crimes. While initially popular, the long-term effects have been disappointing, with most arrested youth being subsequently released. Regional coordination among Central American governments continues, with a shift towards modern policing techniques and crime prevention programs. The mano dura policies in Central America have been largely disappointing, with many arrested youth being released due to lack of evidence. Some wrongly arrested youth were recruited into gangs while in prison. Gang leaders have used prisons to increase discipline. Alternative policies, such as truces between gangs in Belize and El Salvador, have been short-lived. Central American governments have increasingly relied on their militaries for assistance. Central American governments have increasingly turned to their militaries for public security, deploying troops to assist underpaid and poorly equipped police forces without clear end dates for these deployments. Guatemala has 21,000 troops for security, El Salvador created new military battalions, and Honduras heavily relies on a military police force. Central American governments have heavily relied on military forces for law enforcement tasks, raising concerns about the \"re-militarization\" of societies. Despite this trend, evidence shows that military involvement has not significantly reduced crime rates. The U.S. government recommends employing \"intelligence-led policing\" and providing law enforcement tools to police and prosecutors. Costa Rica and Panama are adopting COMPSTAT systems for real-time analysis of criminal activity, while wiretapping legislation is being enacted region-wide to assist in evidence gathering. Many Central American nations are implementing wiretapping legislation to aid police and prosecutors in gathering evidence. However, security analysts emphasize the need for institutional reforms to enhance investigative capacity and conviction rates. Improving trust, information-sharing, and coordination between law enforcement entities is crucial, but limited resources and political will hinder these reforms. Proper recruitment, vetting, training, and internal controls are necessary to combat corruption in police and prosecutors. Some Central American governments are seeking outside assistance for institutional reform due to limited resources and political will. There is a move towards comprehensive approaches to dealing with gangs and crime, with countries creating institutional bodies and police units for prevention efforts. Some governments, with support from UNDP and other donors, are encouraging municipalities to develop crime prevention plans. Central American governments have limited resources and political will for institutional reform. Prevention and rehabilitation programs for gang members are mostly funded by church groups or NGOs due to government budget constraints. El Salvador and Honduras are increasing funding for prevention and reinsertion programs to reduce gang violence. Central American countries are focusing on crime prevention programs, with a third of seized assets allocated to this purpose. Experts emphasize the importance of providing education and job opportunities to youth to deter gang involvement. There is debate on the effectiveness of regional security cooperation in combating transnational organized crime, with differing opinions on the obstacles and priorities. Despite theoretical agreement on the need for collaboration, governments differ on the biggest security threats and strategies. Disputes among countries sometimes overshadow efforts to address shared security challenges. Central American leaders and officials, along with their U.S. and Mexican counterparts, have been meeting regularly to coordinate security efforts and information sharing on criminal groups. The Security Commission of the Central American Integration System (SICA) has been organizing these regional security meetings since 2006. Despite receiving $1.1 billion in funding for projects at a donors' conference in 2011, SICA lacks the institutional capacity to manage these projects effectively. In 2011, SICA received $1.1 billion in funding but lacks the capacity to manage projects effectively. In 2014, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras collaborated with the IDB to create the \"Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle\" to address security and economic issues driving emigration. The $22 billion plan aims to stimulate the productive sector, develop human capital, improve public safety, and strengthen institutions, with the three governments funding 80% and seeking support from the private sector and international donors. The United States has long been concerned about Central America's proximity. During the Cold War, the United States focused on Central America due to security threats from the region. Attention waned in the 1990s but increased again in the past decade due to rising violence and emigration. The Central America Regional Security Initiative was a key component of this renewed engagement. The U.S. viewed links between the Soviet Union and leftist movements in Central America as a potential threat to its strategic interests. During the Cold War, the United States heavily supported anti-communist forces in Central America to prevent Soviet allies from gaining influence. This included backing the Salvadoran government against the FMLN insurgency and the contras in Nicaragua against the FSLN government. U.S. assistance to the region averaged over $1.3 billion annually between 1979 and 1992. After the Cold War, the focus shifted to combating drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere. During the Cold War, the US supported anti-communist forces in Central America. Post-Cold War, the focus shifted to combating drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere, with a concentration of US security assistance in Colombia and other cocaine-producing nations. US economic and military aid to Central America averaged $514 million annually between FY1993 and FY2007, primarily directed towards economic and political development. During the post-Cold War era, US assistance in Central America focused on USAID rule-of-law programs and security cooperation, particularly in response to concerns over narcotics flows and escalating crime. President George W. Bush's discussions with Central American and Mexican leaders emphasized the need for regional security dialogue and cooperation against drug trafficking and organized crime. The Bush Administration developed the M\u00e9rida Initiative to support Mexico and Central America in fighting organized crime and improving law enforcement communication. Congress and the Obama Administration re-launched it as the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) in FY2010, providing equipment, training, and technical assistance to the seven nations of the isthmus. The Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) provides equipment, training, and technical assistance to support law enforcement operations and strengthen the capacities of Central American governments. Its goals include creating safe streets, disrupting criminal movements, supporting capable governments, establishing state presence in at-risk communities, and fostering cooperation among nations to combat security threats. The U.S. government allocated nearly $1.2 billion to Central America from FY2008 to FY2015 under CARSI. The U.S. government allocated nearly $1.2 billion to Central America under the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI). Majority of the funds were appropriated under the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account managed by the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), with additional funds from the Economic Support Fund (ESF) managed by USAID. The Obama Administration requested $286.5 million for CARSI in FY2016 as part of a broader $1 billion request for a new \"U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America.\" The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 would provide $750 million for Central America, including $348.5 million for CARSI. Assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras is conditioned on improvements in border security, combatting corruption, increasing revenues, and addressing human rights concerns. Majority of CARSI funding between FY2008 and FY2012 went to the northern triangle nations of Central America. Nearly 20% of CARSI funding in the first five years was allocated to regional programs benefiting multiple countries, with the majority going to the northern triangle nations. The State Department has not disclosed specific distribution since FY2012, but Guatemala received 22.5%, Honduras 17.3%, El Salvador 16.3%, Panama 10%, Costa Rica 6.9%, Belize and Nicaragua 3.9%. Various U.S. and partner agencies are involved in implementing CARSI activities, with State Department and USAID managing the majority of funding. The CARSI program involves various U.S. agencies like DOD, Treasury, DHS, ICE, CBP, DOJ, FBI, DEA, ATF, and OPDAT for interagency coordination. U.S.-SICA dialogue and bilateral coordination are used for regional and country-specific coordination. $984 million out of $1.2 billion allocated for CARSI between FY2008 and FY2015 had been obligated for contracts and purchase orders. As of September 30, 2015, $457 million (40%) of the allocated $984 million for CARSI had been expended. Implementation of CARSI has been hindered by challenges such as delayed appropriations bills, procurement processes, staff shortages, and legislative withholding requirements. Negotiating agreements with seven countries has also been difficult due to changes in governments and officials. Through CARSI, the U.S. funds activities to support security objectives in Central America. CARSI-funded activities support U.S. and Central American security objectives by providing equipment, technical assistance, and training for narcotics interdiction and disrupting criminal networks. The program also helps improve law enforcement and justice sector institutions in Central America, as well as supports prevention efforts to reduce drug demand and provide opportunities for at-risk youth. Many activities build on previous security efforts in the region. CARSI provides equipment, maintenance, technical support, and training for narcotics interdiction and law enforcement operations in Central American nations. This includes aircraft, boats, vehicles, communications, border inspection, security force equipment, and training tailored to each country's needs to enhance security forces' capabilities and territorial control. U.S. assistance through CARSI provides helicopters and support to Guatemala for security forces to access difficult areas, limit sanctuaries for DTOs, and disrupt transnational gangs and trafficking networks. FBI-led TAG units, supported by CARSI, have expanded into Guatemala and Honduras, leading to successful arrests and extraditions. Other agencies like DEA, ICE, and INL also conduct investigations and support specialized law enforcement units in Central America. The U.S. government supports law enforcement efforts in Central America through CARSI, focusing on investigations into money laundering, trafficking of narcotics, and violent crimes. Programs aim to build long-term capacity in law enforcement institutions and improve community policing. CARSI also supports forensic laboratory assessments to enhance investigative capacity in the region. CARSI funding in Central America supports forensic laboratories, wiretapping centers, and criminal investigative schools. It also implements ATF's eTrace System for tracking firearms and expands the FBI's CAFE for fingerprint and biometric capabilities. Additionally, CARSI aims to enhance judicial systems by providing training and technical assistance to improve prosecutorial capabilities and court management. In Honduras, assessments are conducted to identify weaknesses and recommend policy changes. CARSI funds prevention programs in Central America to address underlying conditions that lead to crime and violence, focusing on at-risk youth by providing educational, recreational, and vocational opportunities. USAID supports these efforts to combat social and economic exclusion that contributes to involvement in criminal organizations. In El Salvador, USAID's Community-Based Crime and Violence Prevention Project works with municipalities to empower local governments, civil society organizations, and youth to address crime and violence issues. Prevention councils analyze community problems and develop plans for vocational training and social entrepreneurship projects. CARSI funds have established over 120 outreach centers providing opportunities for at-risk youth in the region. INL offers assistance to at-risk youth through its Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) and Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) programs. USAID contracted Vanderbilt University to evaluate the impact of community-based crime and violence prevention programs funded by CARSI. The study found positive results in neighborhoods in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. The study found that USAID interventions in crime and violence prevention programs led to significant improvements in treatment communities. Residents reported fewer robberies, extortion attempts, and murders. Perception of neighborhood insecurity was lower, and trust in police was higher. However, there is limited information on the impact of INL programs funded through CARSI. INL's community policing programs have shown reduced homicide rates in Lourdes and Santa Ana, El Salvador. Other INL-backed programs have produced mixed results. INL has increased monitoring efforts and funded a study to measure the impact of its programs in Central American countries. Despite progress in some communities, overall security indicators at the country level have not significantly improved. While some Central American countries have seen declining homicide rates, others like El Salvador have experienced a significant increase in violence. The number of asylum seekers from the northern triangle has surged, indicating deteriorating security conditions. Despite U.S.-backed efforts to strengthen institutions, polling data shows low confidence in police and justice systems. Central America still faces security challenges despite funding for CARSI, prompting Congress to consider additional support. The U.S. government is considering additional funding for the initiative in Central America to address issues such as strategy, funding levels, human rights promotion, and the impact of U.S. domestic policies on security conditions in the region. Congress has been reexamining the strategy and funding levels necessary to achieve U.S. objectives in Central America, focusing on goals like creating safe streets, disrupting criminal activity, supporting accountable governments, establishing state presence, and fostering cooperation among nations in the region. The U.S. government lacks a comprehensive strategy for the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), leading to disjointed efforts and potential conflicting objectives among U.S. agencies. Critics argue that CARSI is a collection of individual security assistance programs without clear priorities or measurable benchmarks. This has resulted in stove-piped programs focusing on various issues like citizen safety, drug trafficking, and human smuggling. The U.S. government's Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) lacks a comprehensive strategy, leading to disjointed efforts and conflicting objectives among agencies. Despite some willingness to overlook corruption, inter-agency coordination is improving with a new \"place-based strategy.\" However, officials acknowledge that CARSI, as currently formulated, cannot substantially improve security in Central America. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson emphasizes the need to focus on improving government efficiency and accountability. The Administration drafted a new \"U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America\" to promote prosperity, enhance security, and improve governance in the region with a requested $1 billion of assistance in FY2016. Some Members of Congress support the strategy, while others argue security should remain the primary focus. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 would provide $750 million for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, including $348.5 million for CARSI. The bill would significantly increase assistance for addressing socioeconomic and governance concerns in Central America. It also requires a multi-year spending plan with objectives, progress indicators, and implementation timeline. Congress supports increased security cooperation with Central America, including efforts to prevent illicit trafficking, build partner capacity, support inter-agency activities, and promote human rights. Additional funding is provided for U.S. Southern Command operations in the region. The FY2016 request for U.S. Southern Command operations in Central America emphasizes the need for internal reforms in the region to improve security conditions. Analysts and policymakers agree that Central American nations must commit to structural changes to see lasting improvements. Recent corruption scandals have raised doubts about the region's willingness to enact reforms, but some progress has been made. Without continued advancements, U.S. initiatives like CARSI could suffer the same fate as previous programs that faded away when U.S. assistance decreased. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (H.R. 2029) would require withholding 75% of funds for the central governments of El Salvador. The State Department plans to withhold 75% of funds for the central governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras until they improve border security, combat corruption, increase revenues, and address human rights concerns. Congress is concerned about human rights abuses in Central America and wants accountability for security forces. Central American nations are subject to legal provisions for assistance. Central American nations are subject to legal provisions that require vetting of assistance for foreign security forces and prohibit funding for units with credible evidence of human rights violations. Appropriations legislation from FY2008 to FY2011 included human rights conditions on security aid, withholding 15% of assistance until governments took action in areas such as establishing police complaints commissions. The US Congress has implemented reforms to improve the judiciary's capacity and independence in Central American nations. They are also investigating and prosecuting federal police and military forces for human rights violations. Congress did not include the 15% withholding requirement in appropriations legislation for FY2012 and subsequent years. Additionally, separate human rights conditions have been placed on assistance to security forces in Honduras since FY2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 would prevent the obligation of 75% of assistance for the central governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras until certain conditions are met. The Secretary of State certifies that the governments of Central American countries must implement reforms to improve transparency, strengthen public institutions, investigate and prosecute human rights violations, cooperate with regional entities, and protect the rights of political opposition parties and civil society activists. The bill requires the Secretary of State to review government progress and suspend assistance if insufficient. Human rights organizations support human rights conditions on aid to Central American nations. The State Department's report highlights security forces' involvement in rights violations in Central America. Analysts suggest thorough vetting of aid recipients to prevent counterproductive outcomes. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, implemented in 2005, has faced delays in funding release due to restrictions and consultations related to human rights conditions. U.S. officials argue that aid restrictions should be based on objective criteria to enhance security cooperation in the region. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, implemented in 2005, focuses on \"shared responsibility\" among the United States, Mexico, and Central America to address crime and violence. The U.S. government pledges to tackle drug demand, money laundering, and weapons smuggling, while Mexican and Central American governments commit to addressing corruption and reforming law enforcement and judicial institutions. There are concerns about the U.S. government's commitment to matching words with deeds, which may impact future support for the initiative. The U.S. government needs to modify domestic policies to fulfill pledges to Mexico and Central America for support. The 2015 National Drug Control Strategy emphasizes reducing U.S. drug demand, with stable cocaine users but an increase in heroin users. The FY2016 drug control budget includes increased funding for prevention and treatment programs. Supply reduction activities like law enforcement and interdiction are also highlighted. Supply reduction activities such as domestic law enforcement, interdiction, and international programs accounted for 55% of the funding request. Drug policy experts have praised the Administration's focus on reducing consumption, but some argue for a shift towards treatment and demand reduction programs. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have increased operations against bulk cash smuggling and money laundering, with CBP increasing southbound inspections for cash flowing into Mexico and Central America. ICE opened a bulk cash smuggling detection center in 2009 to assist law enforcement agencies in tracking illicit funding flows. Despite these efforts, illicit monetary transfers and shipments continue. The Department of Justice and ATF are working to stop illegal gun trafficking from the US to Mexico and Central America. They have increased enforcement of gun control laws and improved coordination with regional law enforcement. ATF provides training on the eTrace program to help track seized firearms and identify trafficking trends. In 2014, almost 8,200 guns were seized in Central America and submitted to ATF. In 2014, around 8,200 guns were seized in Central America and sent to the ATF for tracing, with about 3,300 originating from the United States. Analysts suggest various ways for U.S. policymakers to reduce arms trafficking to the region, including tightening regulations and ratifying the CIFTA treaty. Military and police stockpiles in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are highlighted as major sources of illegal firearms in the area. Central American governments need to improve oversight over government stockpiles, destroy excess arms, and prosecute corrupt officials involved in illegal arms trafficking. Concerns have been raised about the impact of increasing U.S. deportations on gang violence in the region, but recent deportations are seen to have minimal effect on security conditions. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador have received the highest numbers of U.S. deportees. In recent years, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador have received high numbers of U.S. deportees, with a significant percentage having prior criminal convictions. Central American officials have requested the U.S. to provide complete criminal history for deportees, leading to the development of the Criminal History Information Sharing (CHIS) initiative funded by CARSI. This initiative allows law enforcement officials in these countries to access relevant criminal history records of deportees before their removal from the United States. The Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) provides detailed information on gang members to El Salvador and Honduras through the Criminal History Information Program (CHIP). Central America faces security challenges due to criminal threats, fragile political and judicial systems, and social hardships. Congress has allocated nearly $1.2 billion to CARSI from FY2008 to FY2015. While some CARSI programs have improved security conditions in certain communities, country-level security indicators remain poor in several Central American nations. The Obama Administration asserts that a broader U.S. effort with more resources is needed to improve conditions in Central America. Analysts believe that improving security in the region will be challenging due to incomplete reforms, weak tax bases, and lack of opportunities for youth. International donors must provide extensive support for an extended period, and stakeholders need to coordinate efforts for long-term strategies addressing root causes of insecurity. Without these efforts, conditions are likely to remain poor in Central America. The Bush Administration requested $50 million for Central America through the M\u00e9rida Initiative, focusing on public security and law enforcement programs. Congress later appropriated $60 million for the region through the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act. In P.L. 110-252, Congress allocated $60 million for Central America, distributing funds among various accounts. $25 million in ESF funds was designated for an Economic and Social Development Fund, with $1 million supporting the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. The State Department was required to withhold 15% of INCLE and FMF assistance until improvements in human rights were reported. In FY2009, Congress allocated $105 million for Central America, with $35 million earmarked for judicial reform, anti-corruption, and rule-of-law activities. The funds were subject to human rights conditions. In FY2010, Congress appropriated additional funds for the region. In FY2010, Congress allocated $83 million for Central America to combat drug trafficking, violence, and organized crime. The State Department allocated an additional $12 million for crime prevention programs, and later reprogrammed $76 million, bringing total funding to $171 million under the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI). The Obama Administration supported this change to focus on the region's security situation. The Obama Administration embraced the change to focus on Central America and U.S. efforts in the region. The FY2011 Appropriations Act directed the Secretary of State to report on regional threats and goals for U.S. actions. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act did not specify funding for CARSI but required the Obama Administration to report back to Congress on fund allocations. The Department of State allocated $101.5 million for CARSI in FY2011, subject to human rights conditions. In FY2012, President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 without designating a funding level for CARSI, but supported a $100 million budget request. The State Department submitted a spending plan to Congress in June 2012 for CARSI activities. The FY2012 CARSI spending plan presented to Congress in June 2012 increased funding to $135 million. The legislation did not include previous human rights provisions but introduced a new requirement for withholding 20% of funds for Honduran military and police forces until certain conditions were met. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 provided funding for federal programs through the end of FY2013, including $146.2 million allocated for CARSI in FY2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated $61.5 million in ESF aid and $100 million in INCLE assistance for CARSI in FY2014. The act also increased restrictions on security aid to Honduras, including raising the withholding requirement to 35% and adding more human rights conditions. In FY2015, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act allocated $100 million in ESF aid and $170 million in INCLE assistance for CARSI. The act maintained restrictions on security aid to Honduras but reduced the withholding requirement to 25% and broadened exceptions for programs related to maritime security or human trafficking. The Administration was directed to use CARSI funding to address key factors in Central American countries contributing to the migration of unaccompanied minors to the United States. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act allocated $100 million in ESF aid and $170 million in INCLE assistance for CARSI in FY2015. The funding aimed to address key factors in Central America contributing to the migration of unaccompanied minors to the United States, focusing on education, vocational training, employment opportunities, strengthening families, border security, anti-trafficking, anti-gang programs, and counternarcotics activities."
