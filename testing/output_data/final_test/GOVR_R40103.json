    "content": "Energy efficiency refers to the technical changes in energy conversion devices that allow them to provide the same service while using less energy, resulting in energy conservation. Buildings can improve energy efficiency through design changes like insulation, thermal windows, and solar orientation. This can reduce energy resource use and environmental impacts like CO2 emissions. Energy efficiency is influenced by energy prices, technology availability, and equipment turnover. Studies since the 1970s have shown significant potential for energy efficiency improvements in buildings, with technical fixes capable of saving up to 50% in office buildings and 80% in some new houses. By 1990, improved building design could save a third of national energy use. A 1981 study suggested that through energy efficiency, the U.S. could achieve full employment, increase productivity, and reduce national energy consumption by nearly 25%. Recent studies have identified significant electricity conservation potential, with estimates ranging from 15% to 33% in technical savings and achievable potential. These findings highlight the importance of promoting energy-efficient products and technologies to meet future demands. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of energy-efficient products and technologies to save up to 30% on energy bills in commercial buildings and homes. Despite various electricity efficiency initiatives over the past 40 years, actual conservation levels have been lower than the suggested 25%-30% potential. A 2004 analysis of federal and utility-sponsored programs concluded that incremental electricity conservation has been modest. The curr_chunk discusses energy efficiency programs and standards that have collectively saved up to 4.1 quads of electricity annually, representing about 6% of nontransportation energy consumption. A study on California's 2001 energy demand reduction initiative reported a 6% decrease in electricity usage, with only 25%-30% attributable to energy efficiency projects. A 2008 analysis projected a 7% electricity savings potential in the U.S. beyond baseline levels without market intervention. Studies show a perpetual opportunity for 25% electricity conservation, but challenges persist in achieving savings beyond 5-7% due to economic complexity and barriers to adoption of energy efficiency technologies. Various barriers to adoption of efficiency technologies have been identified, including limited market availability of new measures, incomplete consumer information, insufficient capital for investments, discouraging fiscal or regulatory policies, builder focus on first costs, lack of consumer focus on energy costs, and energy prices not reflecting full social costs. Conservation advocates and policymakers have proposed additional policy approaches to overcome these barriers, but there is limited consensus on their effectiveness. The barriers to adoption of efficiency technologies have been identified, including limited market availability, incomplete consumer information, and discouraging policies. Despite various legislative proposals, the key uncertainty remains in capturing more electricity conservation potential cost-effectively. Carbon control studies project efficiency savings of 5% to 10% over a 20-year timeframe. Efficiency savings of 5% to 10% over 20 years are achievable in U.S. conservation programs, potentially aided by future CO2 costs in electricity prices. Conservation impacts do not scale up easily like physical infrastructure, and policy makers may need to consider alternative or aggressive policies for large impacts. Renewable energy sources in the electricity sector include geothermal, solar, and wind power plants. The electricity sector includes geothermal, solar, wind, biomass, and municipal solid waste/landfill gas power plants. There are high expectations for renewable generation to reduce CO2 emissions in the United States, with goals such as producing 20% of U.S. electricity from wind by 2018. Various groups have different targets for renewable power development in the U.S. EPRI assumes renewable sources for power generation. EPRI predicts renewable sources could contribute 9% of electricity by 2030. Biomass and wind have high economic potential to reduce CO2 emissions. Wind power is fuel-free and mature technology, making it attractive for CO2 mitigation in the electricity sector. The United States has the potential to generate 20% of its electricity from wind power, with federal assistance and state standards. Wind plants currently contribute just over 1% of U.S. electricity generation. Studies suggest that by 2050, wind could account for about 25% of all generation in the U.S. The Department of Energy has examined the possibility of achieving 20% wind power production by 2030. The DOE report concluded that achieving a \"20% Wind Scenario in 2030\" is feasible but faces challenges related to integrating wind power into the grid, improving turbine technology, and siting wind facilities. The main obstacle is investing in the transmission system to transport power from remote wind resources to population centers. The U.S. transmission network is constrained, limiting transmission capacity for new wind farms. Transmission grid constraints are the main impediment to wind power expansion. Despite evidence of reliable integration, obstacles persist due to inadequate transmission access, remote wind sources, underinvested infrastructure, and lack of investment policies. The DOE estimates building over 12,000 miles of transmission at a cost of $20 billion to achieve 20% wind energy in the U.S. The U.S. transmission network is constrained, limiting capacity for new wind farms. AEP's plan estimated 19,000 miles of new transmission lines at a cost of $26 billion. Expanding transmission quickly could stress resources and face community opposition. Public challenges to transmission projects are considered serious in the energy sector. The U.S. energy sector faces challenges with transmission constraints for wind power projects. Despite efforts to increase federal authority for approving transmission projects, delays persist. Analysts are concerned about the feasibility of transmitting large amounts of wind power in the near future. The DOE and experts question the practicality of widespread wind power deployment without a solution to grid issues. The key uncertainty for wind power is whether the electric grid will expand sufficiently to support its rapid expansion. Biomass power plants recycle CO2 emissions through carbon sequestration in crops grown for fuel. Most biomass plants use waste materials, but future expansion may rely on dedicated fuel crops. Biomass power accounted for 1.3% of U.S. electricity generation in 2008, with potential expansion limited by various factors. The availability of biomass fuel is a key factor constraining the expansion of biomass power in the United States. Competition for land with food crops and other traditional crops is a concern, but using waste from existing agricultural production or growing fuel crops on non-agricultural lands could mitigate this. Studies suggest that biomass power generation capacity could increase significantly without conflicting with land requirements for existing crop production. The potential for a seven-fold increase in biomass consumption for bioenergy and biobased products raises questions about the limits of biomass fuel supply in the United States. Uncertainty surrounds the cost and supply of future biomass feedstocks, especially with the possible expansion of biomass demand for transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. Aggressive pursuit of biomass for power and liquid fuels could lead to competition for agricultural resources on a significant scale. Increased biomass production may have adverse environmental and economic impacts due to land conversion, potentially leading to higher food prices. Analysts suggest that competition for land between biomass crops and forest carbon sequestration could arise. Importing biomass fuel or food crops to alleviate domestic land constraints may raise concerns about energy and food supply independence. The 2007 MIT study concluded that restricting USA biofuels to domestic production would require 500 million acres of land, making the USA a substantial agricultural importer. This challenges the idea of biomass energy as a significant domestic resource. Nuclear power, on the other hand, has been a significant part of the U.S. electricity sector, with 104 licensed reactors generating 20% of the nation's electricity. No new nuclear power plants have been ordered in the USA since 1978. Despite no new nuclear power plants being ordered in the USA since 1978, there is renewed interest in nuclear power due to factors such as high fossil fuel prices, federal subsidies, and CO2 mitigation policies. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has received applications for 20 new nuclear reactor projects, seen as essential for reaching long-term CO2 mitigation goals. President-elect Obama and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change support expanding nuclear power as a way to build a clean energy future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and EPRI propose significant increases in U.S. nuclear power capacity by 2030 and 2050, respectively. However, not all groups support nuclear power as a key element of carbon control due to concerns about cost, proliferation risks, and environmental damage. Other issues include fuel supply constraints, safety, security, and public acceptance. The uncertainty surrounding the viability of a U.S. nuclear resurgence lies in questions about long-term nuclear fuel supply constraints, plant safety and security, and public acceptance. Even if these issues were resolved, the fundamental uncertainty remains about whether nuclear power plants could be constructed quickly enough to significantly reduce U.S. carbon emissions in a 20-year timeframe. The global capability to construct nuclear plants has diminished since the 1980s, leading to concerns about the pace of U.S. nuclear expansion. The availability of qualified personnel, suppliers, and contractors for nuclear operations and construction remains a challenge in the United States. There is ongoing debate about the potential for rapid nuclear power expansion, with projections suggesting the capability to construct 35-60 reactors per year by 2030 and 70-120 reactors per year by 2050. The 2008 study by the DOE's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee suggested that it would be \"plausible\" to build 30 new U.S. reactors by 2030, although it would be a major challenge. This rate of construction is lower than during the peak period of U.S. nuclear development from 1963 to 1985 when 77 nuclear reactors were built. Some analysts are pessimistic about the rapid expansion of nuclear power in the United States, predicting a long-term decline rather than a flourishing future revival. The debate is complicated by the need to replace retiring nuclear plant capacity to maintain current levels of nuclear power. The U.S. nuclear plant capacity is retiring soon, posing challenges for maintaining current electricity supply from nuclear power. Experts note that new construction may only offset the retirement of older reactors, as the U.S. nuclear capability has declined over the past 30 years. Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman emphasizes the difficulties ahead, while the National Intelligence Council suggests that expanding nuclear power generation by 2025 to meet increasing demand would be nearly impossible due to infrastructure and legal hurdles. Experts disagree on the potential of nuclear power to help meet CO2 mitigation goals due to significant hurdles in human, physical, legal, and construction aspects. The Nuclear Power Joint Fact Finding group has conflicting views on the future expansion of nuclear power, with some believing it may not increase significantly while others think it could rapidly expand to contribute to carbon-stabilization efforts. Congressional policymakers face uncertainty regarding the pace of nuclear industry expansion and its potential contribution to electricity generation. Advanced coal technologies, such as ultra-supercritical pulverized coal plants and integrated gasification combined cycle units, aim to improve efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions compared to conventional coal-fired power plants. These advancements could potentially lead to a significant decrease in CO2 emissions per unit of electricity output. Adding carbon capture and sequestration technology to these plants could further reduce their CO2 emissions. Some analysts and policymakers believe that advanced coal generation, either through new plants or upgrades to existing ones, will help reduce U.S. carbon emissions. They argue that until carbon capture technology is widely available, advanced coal plants offer a cost-effective way to meet electricity demand while limiting CO2 emissions. However, the key uncertainty lies in whether these plants can be built and financed by capital markets. The key uncertainty surrounding advanced coal generation projects is whether they can be built and financed by capital markets. These plants, more efficient than traditional coal plants, still release large volumes of CO2 without carbon capture technology. They may not meet regulatory carbon control objectives and face financial risks from future policies. Major financial institutions are imposing greater requirements on developers seeking capital for new coal projects due to potential carbon-related risks. Financial institutions are imposing stricter requirements on developers seeking capital for new coal plant investments. Regulatory agencies are withholding approval from advanced coal project proposals, leading to cancellations of multiple projects across the country. The EPA ruled that permits for coal-fired power plants must consider the implementation of \"best available\" CO2 controls, potentially halting construction. The EPA ruling could freeze construction of up to 100 new coal-fired power plants in the US, but the Administrator has overruled the decision. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a method to mitigate carbon emissions by capturing and storing CO2 from industrial sources. CCS technologies have the potential to remove 80%-95% of CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial facilities. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) can remove 80%-95% of CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial facilities, making power plants the primary candidates for this technology. Analysts and policymakers see CCS as crucial for meeting CO2 reduction goals globally. CCS is projected to account for 21% of avoided CO2 emissions by 2030, with the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is crucial for reducing CO2 emissions, especially from coal-fired power plants. Despite ongoing interest and successful testing of new CCS technologies, no commercial device is currently available for capturing carbon from coal plants. The technology faces technical challenges and high costs to reach commercial scale. Analysts are uncertain about the widespread availability of CCS technology in the US at a competitive cost with other electricity generation technologies. Policies like carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs could improve CCS competitiveness, but their success is uncertain due to economic factors. Studies show varying opinions on the timeline for large-scale commercial deployment of CCS technology, with some predicting initial deployment between 2015-2020. Imperial College, London, projects initial commercial deployment of CCS technology by 2020. DOE aims for deployable carbon capture technology within a decade. Various sources predict commercial deployment of CCS technology between 2025 and 2030. The OECD questions the feasibility of achieving significant carbon capture and storage (CCS) contributions by 2030, casting doubt on the technology's potential impact on CO2 emissions abatement. Former DOE officials and experts like Steven Chu express uncertainty about the effectiveness of CCS, highlighting the key challenge for policymakers in determining the role of CCS in addressing climate change. The key uncertainty for policy makers regarding CCS is the availability for widespread deployment. A recent development is the potential introduction of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in the next few years, which could lower overall fuel-cycle pollutant emissions, including CO2 emissions. PHEVs would combine an electric motor and battery pack with an internal combustion engine to improve fuel efficiency, with the ability to charge the vehicle on grid power. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are seen as a way to reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles. Studies suggest significant CO2 savings could be achieved by widespread adoption of PHEV technology. However, there are uncertainties about whether enough PHEVs will be purchased to make a significant impact on carbon emissions, given their high cost. The Obama-Biden campaign aimed to have 1 million PHEVs on the road by 2015. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are projected to retail for over $40,000 per vehicle in the near-term, compared to approximately $28,000 for an HEV and $23,000 for a conventional vehicle. The carbon abatement potential of PHEVs is largely dependent upon the concurrent implementation of renewables, nuclear power, and CCS, each facing uncertainties. Distributed energy resources, including rooftop photovoltaics, microturbines, wind turbines, and fuel cells, offer benefits such as lower energy costs, increased power reliability, and reduced CO2 emissions. Combined heat and power systems also increase energy efficiency by utilizing waste heat from electricity generation. CHP systems are more efficient than utility power generation, accounting for nearly nine percent of U.S. electric generating capacity in 2007. They have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions significantly by 2030. However, technical and infrastructure barriers have hindered their full implementation. Combined with the information from the previous paragraph, CHP systems have been around for over 100 years and are proven to be efficient. Despite their track record, they are underutilized. Other DER technologies like photovoltaics and fuel cells also face barriers to implementation due to complexity and cost competitiveness. Analysts question the impact of policies on CO2 emissions in increasing DER adoption. The potential increase in DER adoption due to CO2 emissions costs aligning with cost reduction objectives and the economics of renewables faces uncertainties similar to energy efficiency. Policy research shows that reducing CO2 emissions in the electricity sector requires successful deployment of carbon mitigation measures, but uncertainties remain on their effectiveness. Key uncertainties in the energy sector include challenges in energy efficiency, renewable energy transmission and land availability, nuclear power plant construction speed, funding for advanced coal power, commercial viability of carbon capture technology, availability of low carbon electricity for plug-in hybrid vehicles, and the impact of carbon costs on distributed energy economics. Various proposals have been made to address these uncertainties. Numerous proposals have been made to address uncertainties in the energy sector, including higher efficiency standards, new regulatory authorities, tax incentives, direct subsidies, research and development grants, environmental rules, and public information campaigns. Specific examples include federally-funded CCS demonstration projects and federal preemption of state siting authority for new transmission development. The overall success of a multi-measure CO2 mitigation scheme proposed by EPRI is unpredictable due to the variety of proposals and their potential effects on coal plant costs. The cost of building and operating power plants, including those with CCS systems, as well as the cost of different energy sources and emissions offsets, will influence future decisions. Uncertainties in these variables may lead to unexpected economic drivers for developers. This report focuses on the uncertainties surrounding carbon abatement measures, rather than predicting their success. Expert opinions vary on future CO2 outcomes, making it possible that a portfolio of measures may be needed. EPRI's CO2 scenario is considered \"very aggressive, but potentially feasible.\" Successful reduction of U.S. carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2030 would validate the policy approach. The years leading up to 2050 would provide clarity on the best policy options. Successful implementation of all carbon abatement measures is the goal, but it is possible that one or more measures may be sufficient under a multi-measure strategy like EPRI's. Under a multi-measure strategy like EPRI's, one or more measures may fall short of CO2 reduction expectations. If certain measures underperform, legislators may need to revisit enabling policies. The OECD study suggests that if CCS and end-use efficiency fail, other technologies like nuclear power may need to contribute more. However, this approach may not be realistic based on research cited in the report. Increasing CO2 targets may be unrealistic and could sharply increase uncertainty in mitigation efforts. Legislators could consider revisiting measure-specific policies for improvement, such as offering larger tax credits for renewable energy to encourage investment. Another option is to raise future carbon costs to benefit carbon-mitigating efforts. The National Intelligence Council suggests that current technologies are inadequate to replace traditional energy sources on a large scale, and new energy technologies may not be widely available by 2025. Transitioning to new fuels, even with favorable policies and funding, will be slow. Legislators may face different policy alternatives in light of these challenges. Transitioning to new fuels will be slow. Legislators may consider increasing carbon emissions costs significantly or focusing on a single measure like CCS or nuclear power. They could also reset national CO2 targets to align with the maturation of key reduction technologies. Accepting that near-term targets may not be met, they hope for greater success in the future. Congress is prioritizing reducing U.S. emissions of manmade CO2, with proposed policies aiming to achieve reductions to 1990 levels by 2020 or 2030. Various measures have been suggested, but there are uncertainties in their implementation. Abandoning CO2 reduction efforts in favor of adapting to a hotter climate is also a potential alternative, but it comes with risks and could violate future international emissions treaties. Congress is considering policies to address uncertainties in CO2 mitigation measures, which may impact their effectiveness. Policy makers need a complete understanding of measure-specific uncertainties and their implications on carbon outcomes. One study emphasizes the importance of including uncertainty in technical change and climate damages for understanding the relationship between technical change, climate change, and policy. Optimal policy differs when uncertainty is considered. Monitoring technology and market developments for key measures is crucial for successful CO2 policies. Quick action can be taken to adjust policies or switch to more promising options based on early indicators of success or failure. Congress should also anticipate unexpected changes in the electricity sector due to the complexity of the carbon control problem. The report highlights the potential for new technologies, consumer behavior, and infrastructure developments to rapidly change the nation's carbon emissions trajectory. Electricity supply will need to balance with demand in unforeseen ways, as seen in the recent volatility in global oil prices. Balancing responses to energy market volatility and unexpected structural changes is crucial for maintaining progress towards reducing atmospheric CO2 levels."
