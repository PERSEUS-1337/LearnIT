The \"Ensuring Quality Education for Veterans Act\" includes a revision of the 90-10 rule in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The revision allows for veterans' education benefits to be included in the calculation, and requires notification to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs when a proprietary institution of higher education becomes ineligible or regains eligibility. The amendment defines veterans' education benefits and includes them in the calculation for the 90-10 rule in the Higher Education Act of 1965. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to include Non-Veterans' Education Benefits in the heading of subsection (d) of section 487. Certain proprietary institutions of higher education are ineligible to participate in Department of Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs programs of educational assistance. Certain proprietary institutions of higher education deemed ineligible by the Secretary of Education are also barred from participating in Department of Defense programs of educational assistance. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that no educational assistance is used for education at these institutions during their period of ineligibility.
