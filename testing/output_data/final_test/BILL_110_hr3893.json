SEC. 3. ENCOURAGING STATE INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE BROADBAND. The grant program aims to ensure affordable broadband access, increase technology literacy, empower local technology teams, and promote broadband investment. The Secretary of Commerce will award grants for development based on peer review results. The grant program, under subsection (d), supports statewide initiatives for broadband availability and adoption. Grants are awarded competitively, and eligible entities must submit applications and provide matching funds. The Secretary will require peer review for technical and scientific evaluation. The regulations require technical and scientific peer review groups to review grant applications, provide results to the Secretary of Commerce, and certify confidentiality agreements to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. Grants awarded to eligible entities support broadband availability and adoption initiatives. A grant awarded to eligible entities supports broadband availability and adoption initiatives by conducting baseline assessments, tracking low service deployment areas, identifying barriers to adoption, and assessing demand and supply for broadband services. To support broadband availability and adoption, grants are awarded to create local technology planning teams in each county or designated region. These teams consist of members from various sectors to measure technology use, set goals for improvement, and ensure that supply meets demand for services. To achieve improved technology use, a tactical business plan with specific recommendations for online application development and demand creation is developed. Collaboration with broadband service providers and information technology companies is encouraged to deploy services in unserved and underserved areas. Programs are established to enhance computer ownership and Internet access for these populations, along with collecting and analyzing detailed market data. The program aims to collect and analyze market data on broadband service demand, facilitate information exchange between public and private sectors, and create a geographic inventory map of broadband service in each state. This includes identifying gaps in service availability and assessing statewide broadband deployment. Eligible entities in each state may not receive new grants for these activities.
