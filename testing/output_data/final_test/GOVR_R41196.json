    "content": "President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) into law on March 23, 2010, which includes provisions affecting Medicare payments and benefits. The Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) was signed into law on March 30, 2010, making changes to Medicare-related provisions in PPACA. The Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010, signed on December 15, 2010, also modified certain PPACA provisions related to Medicare. The PPACA includes provisions affecting Medicare payments and benefits. CBO estimates show net reductions in Medicare direct spending reaching close to $400 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. The legislation includes various program modifications, payment method reforms, and program integrity changes to address fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare. The Reconciliation Act includes provisions related to health care, revenues, and amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965. It modifies Medicare fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare outpatient prescription drug programs, as well as addresses reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. The Extenders Act contains provisions that extend or modify certain Medicare-related provisions in PPACA and the Reconciliation Act. It discusses the financial impact on Medicare, changes by provider type and program, efforts to address efficiencies and quality, long-term financing, and program integrity changes. Appendix A provides an overview of Medicare-related provisions in the laws. The Reconciliation Act and the Extenders Act include provisions related to Medicare, with details on timelines for payment updates and effective dates. The Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation issued cost estimates for the PPACA as amended by the Reconciliation Act. CBO estimates that provisions in PPACA and the Reconciliation Act will reduce direct spending by $511 billion over FY2010-FY2019, with Medicare accounting for $400 billion of the reduction. Total Medicare reductions in direct spending over 10 years are estimated at $465 billion, offset by payment increases of close to $65 billion. Medicare-related provisions in the Extenders Act are estimated to cost an additional $1.9 billion through FY2020. Medicare spending under PPACA and the Reconciliation Act from FY2010 to FY2019 is shown in Figure 1. Key savings provisions include permanent reductions in fee-for-service payment rates, tying Medicare Advantage payment rates to fee-for-service levels, reducing payments to DSH hospitals, and modifying high-income adjustments for Part B premiums, totaling $378.3 billion in estimated savings over 10 years. The health care reform legislation includes various cost-saving measures such as adjustments for Part B premiums, an Independent Payment Advisory Board, new taxes on high-income individuals, and investment income. These measures are projected to save billions over 10 years and slow down the growth of Medicare spending compared to previous years. However, there is uncertainty in the estimates, particularly regarding the sustainable growth rate mechanism for Medicare physician payment rates. Physician payment rates were set to go back into effect in 2010, with a projected 21% cut in payments. The Independent Payment Advisory Board established by PPACA aims to reduce costs, but it is unclear if this will be achieved through greater efficiencies or if it will impact the quality of care. Medicare covers health services for individuals 65 and older, as well as disabled individuals under 65, with different parts responsible for various benefits and financing mechanisms. Traditional Medicare pays for services on a fee-for-service basis. Medicare payment rates are set annually by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) using different payment systems. Updates are made to reflect inflation and other factors, with some linked to the consumer price index or provider-specific market basket index. CMS implements payment methods through detailed rule-making. Medicare payment rates are set annually by CMS using different payment systems, with updates reflecting inflation and other factors. MedPAC makes payment update recommendations to Congress in March each year, examining Medicare payments' adequacy for efficient providers and assessing likely provider cost changes. Medicare's payment systems aim to encourage efficiency gains similar to the economy at large, linking expectations for efficiency improvements to productivity gains achieved by firms and workers funding Medicare. MedPAC's update recommendations for Medicare payment rates depend on provider circumstances. Part A covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing, home health, and hospice care for beneficiaries. Approximately 20% of Part A enrollees use these services annually. Prior to PPACA, Part A spending was projected to increase significantly. Provisions in the PPACA and Reconciliation Act will reduce Part A spending by constraining payment updates to hospitals, restructuring payments for treatment inefficiencies, and reshaping DSH hospital subsidies. Additionally, the exception allowing physician-owned hospitals to refer Medicare and Medicaid patients will be eliminated for new hospitals or those not meeting criteria. Medicare's annual payment updates to Part A hospitals will be adjusted for productivity increases, leading to significant cost savings. The PPACA provision will adjust payment updates for Part A hospitals using a 10-year moving average of productivity gains, leading to significant Medicare spending reductions. This includes savings for outpatient and inpatient services for all hospitals, with potential additional savings for acute care hospitals serving low-income patients. The PPACA provision will reduce hospitals' DSH payments starting in FY2014 by 25%, based on MedPAC's recommendations. Additional payments to acute care hospitals will be determined by factors such as changes in the uninsured population and the amount of uncompensated care provided. This policy is estimated to save $22.1 billion from FY2015 onwards. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required the establishment of a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) to cover all services provided, including room and board, nursing, therapy, and drugs. SNFs receive a daily payment based on 1995 costs adjusted for inflation, with profits retained by the SNF and losses absorbed by the SNF. The daily base payment varies by urban or rural location and is further adjusted for area wages using the hospital wage index. The daily payments for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are adjusted for variations in area wages using the hospital wage index. SNF per diem payments are also adjusted for HIV-positive or AIDS residents. Medicare payments to SNFs were found to be adequate in a 2009 report, recommending the elimination of the market basket update for 2010. The market basket update for FY2010 was 2.2 percentage points, and a revised case-mix classification methodology (RUG-IV) was established for FY2011. The FY2010 final rule revised the case-mix classification methodology (RUG-IV) and implementation schedule for FY2011. Changes were made to correct for budget neutrality estimates exceeding payments for medically complex patients. The rule also addressed billing therapy concurrently in SNFs, requiring them to adjust how they bill for therapy given to Medicare patients. The FY2010 final rule required SNFs to report individual therapy minutes on the MDS 3.0 for billing purposes. Changes were made to billing for high-cost staff-intensive services. The RUG billing system no longer includes costs of certain services as a proxy for medical complexity due to poor analysis results. PPACA made significant changes to the SNF PPS, including productivity adjustments and modifications to therapy and look-back period requirements. Home health agencies are paid under a PPS that covers various services, excluding durable medical equipment. The base payment amount for the national standardized 60-day episode rate in home health agencies is annually increased by an update factor tied to the home health market basket index. HHAs must submit health care quality data to the Secretary, with penalties for non-compliance. MedPAC reported in March 2009 that payments to HHAs have consistently exceeded costs since the PPS implementation in 2000, indicating financial stability for most agencies. MedPAC recommended eliminating the increase in the Medicare home health base payment for 2010 and accelerating payment coding changes. They also suggested rebasing HHA rates to better reflect care costs. The final rule for CY 2010 increased the HH base payment by 2.0% and implemented a cap on outlier payments to address potential fraud. CMS made refinements to the home health PPS in CY 2008 to improve payment efficiencies. The Secretary made changes to the home health agency (HHA) case-mix index to adjust payment rates downward for CY2008 to CY2011. The final rule for CY2010 also required the submission of OASIS data by HHAs for payment. PPACA provisions impact HH payments, including a reduction in the HH market basket update by 1.0 percentage point in 2011, 2012, and 2013. The PPACA requires a reduction in the HH market basket update by 1.0 percentage point in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Annual updates will be subject to a productivity adjustment starting in 2015, potentially slowing payment growth to HHAs. The Secretary will rebase home health payments in CY2014 to reflect services and costs, with adjustments made before annual updates. A four-year phase-in, ending in 2017, will limit reductions to 3.5% per year in standard home health resource group amounts. The PPACA mandates a reduction in home health payments and establishes limits on outlier payments. Changes in the Medicare program may impact physicians' practices. The PPACA includes provisions that will have immediate and long-term effects on physicians, such as changes to physician reimbursement and incentives for improving care delivery. Immediate modifications include extensions of existing Medicare programs and payment policies, like the gainsharing demonstration and revisions to the fee schedule. PPACA introduces changes to physician reimbursement, incentives for quality care, and new reporting requirements under the Physician Feedback Program. It extends Medicare programs like PQRI through 2014, implements penalties for non-reporting providers starting in 2015, and offers bonuses for meeting MOCP requirements. PPACA introduces new reporting requirements for physicians under the Physician Feedback Program, including the development of an episode grouper for care payment and public reporting of physician performance on the Physician Compare website. It also gives CMS flexibility to review and adjust misvalued codes under the physician fee schedule. The PPACA and the Reconciliation Act provisions impact physicians by creating new structures and payment models, such as the CMS Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation and the National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling. These changes aim to expand access to primary care and general surgery services and may fundamentally alter how physicians deliver care in the future. The PPACA and the Reconciliation Act provisions introduce new payment models like the ACO model and value-based payment modifier. These changes aim to provide insights on alternative treatments' impact on patient outcomes and how payment methods influence provider incentives and patient outcomes. The Innovation Center has the authority to adopt new payment alternatives that meet specific criteria. These modifications have the potential to significantly impact physicians and related providers. Medicare Advantage (MA) is a payment model where private health plans receive a set amount to cover all Medicare benefits for enrollees. Plans bid for the amount they will charge, with rebates given if the bid is below the benchmark. If the bid is above the benchmark, the plan must charge a premium. Rebates must be used for additional benefits. Congress historically increases benchmark amounts through specified formulas. The benchmark amounts for Medicare Advantage plans have historically been increased by Congress to encourage plan participation nationwide. The benchmarks currently range from 100% to over 150% of fee-for-service Medicare costs. The Affordable Care Act changed how maximum payments to MA plans are determined, phasing in benchmarks based on FFS Medicare spending percentages. This change will lead to reductions in many benchmarks, but also increases benchmarks in certain counties. PPACA increases benchmarks based on plan quality, with higher increases for qualifying quality plans in qualifying areas. Plans with at least a 4-star rating on a 5-star quality rating scale will receive an increase in their benchmark. New plans or plans with low enrollment may also qualify for a benchmark increase. PPACA also varies plan rebates based on quality, with new rebates set at 50% to 70% of the difference between the plan bid and the benchmark. Additionally, PPACA requires a coding intensity adjustment to plan payments after 2010 to account for the cost of providing care. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required adjustments for coding differences between MA plans and providers under Medicare. PPACA mandates further analysis and coding adjustments post-2010, with estimated savings of $135.6 billion over FY2010-FY2019. This will lead to a 35% decrease in MA enrollment by 2019, with average subsidies for extra benefits decreasing to $67 per month. The Medicare Advantage program is expected to see a decrease in benefits not covered under Medicare in 2019, with estimated subsidies dropping to $67 per month from $135. The impact of payment change provisions will vary by geography and depend on market competition and plan quality. PPACA makes changes to the program that could result in costs or savings of less than $1.0 billion over a 10-year period. Additionally, the Medicare prescription drug program started in 2006 under Medicare Part D, replacing Medicaid as the primary source of coverage. Medicare replaced Medicaid as the primary source of drug coverage for dual eligibles in 2006. Prescription drug coverage is provided through private plans or Medicare Advantage plans. Plans are paid through competitive bidding, and enrollee premiums are tied to plan bids. The standard Part D benefit in 2011 includes a $310 deductible and 25% coinsurance up to $2,840 in total drug spending. Plans bear some risk for enrollees' drug spending. After reaching the initial coverage limit in Medicare Part D, there is a coverage gap where the enrollee is responsible for full drug costs until hitting the catastrophic threshold. Low-income individuals may be eligible for the low-income subsidy (LIS) to reduce out-of-pocket expenses. PPACA and the Reconciliation Act made changes to Part D, increasing premiums for higher income enrollees and setting income thresholds similar to Part B premiums. Starting in 2011, a voluntary agreement with stakeholders impacted the program. The Reconciliation Act made changes to Part D, including discounts for brand-name drugs and phasing out the coverage gap by 2020. PPACA also improved access to LIS plans. PPACA improved access to LIS plans by postponing redetermination of eligibility after a spouse's death, eliminating cost-sharing for Medicaid home care recipients, and expanding plan options for low-income beneficiaries. Additional funding was allocated for outreach and assistance programs. The CBO estimated the cost of changes to the low-income subsidy program at $2.4 billion over 10 years. PPACA also included provisions to enhance consumer protections for Part D enrollees. The Secretary is required to develop a centralized system for handling complaints about Medicare Advantage and Part D plans. Medicare pays for medically necessary services, but some services provided may be unnecessary. MedPAC issues a report to Congress each June on systemic issues affecting the Medicare program. MedPAC issues a report to Congress on systemic issues affecting Medicare, recommending ways to increase value, efficiency, and payment accuracy. They suggest that Medicare's fee-for-service system rewards excessive care and lacks service coordination. Provisions in PPACA align with MedPAC recommendations, such as establishing a pilot program to bundle payments for better patient care and cost reduction. Additionally, accountable care organizations are rewarded for meeting quality-of-care targets and reducing costs per patient. Under Medicare's IPPS, hospitals receive full payment for patient admissions, even for preventable readmissions. PPACA adjusts payments based on preventable readmissions, saving Medicare $4.9 billion over FY2010-2019. The Secretary of HHS can expand this policy to include more conditions in the future. PPACA includes provisions to save money through adjustments in hospital payments for preventable readmissions and penalties for certain high-cost health conditions. It also establishes a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to develop cost-saving care delivery models. Medicare's financial operations are managed through two trust funds. The Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund, maintained by the Department of the Treasury, finance Medicare. The HI trust fund is funded by payroll taxes, projected to become insolvent in 2017. If this happens, Congress would need to decide how to continue funding Medicare Part A. The HI trust fund for Medicare is funded by payroll taxes and may become insolvent in 2017, leading to a decision on funding Medicare Part A. Medicare Parts B and D are financed through premiums and general revenues, while the SMI trust fund remains balanced. PPACA includes provisions to address Medicare's financial challenges. PPACA includes a provision to establish an Independent Payment Advisory Board to reduce Medicare spending growth rates. The Board must develop proposals to reduce per capita growth rates if certain targets are exceeded, with savings estimated at $15.5 billion between 2015 and 2019. Additionally, PPACA will impose an additional 0.9% tax. PPACA will save $15.5 billion between 2015 and 2019. It imposes an additional tax on high-income workers and unearned income. The new taxes are estimated to raise approximately $210 billion between 2013 and 2019. Another provision freezes income thresholds for higher Part B premium rates, saving $25 billion over 10 years. High-income Part D enrollees will pay higher premiums, leading to savings. The CBO estimates that drug program enrollees will pay higher premiums, resulting in savings of close to $11 billion over 10 years. The HI trust fund is projected to increase by $385 billion over the 2010-2019 period, with a balance of about $170 billion at the end of FY2019. The Medicare Boards of Trustees predict that lower Part A costs and higher tax revenues will postpone the depletion of HI trust fund assets until 2029. The CBO and CMS Office of the Actuary warn against combining trust fund accounting with budget rules. Medicare expenditure reductions can extend HI trust fund solvency or offset health insurance expansion costs, but double-counting savings should be avoided. Health care fraud costs billions annually, with estimates ranging from 3% to 10% of expenditures. As health care costs rise, new approaches to combat fraud are crucial. CMS works to prevent, detect, and fight fraud in Medicare and private insurance programs. CMS conducts program integrity activities to prevent, detect, and investigate health care fraud, sharing responsibility with OIG, DOJ, and FBI. OIG detects fraud in federal health care programs, FBI investigates fraud in both private and public programs, and suspected cases are referred to DOJ for prosecution. Anti-fraud provisions in PPACA and the Reconciliation Act target program integrity activities, enforcement efforts, and funding for anti-fraud activities. The legislation provides enhanced oversight and screening measures for providers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, including licensure checks and enrollment fees. Other measures include compliance programs, enhanced authority to suspend payments, and expanding the RAC program. Additionally, new civil monetary penalties are introduced for certain infractions. The legislation introduces new civil monetary penalties for certain infractions, enhances the Secretary's authority to penalize MA plans for contract violations, and increases funding for the HCFAC program. Medicare spending concerns persist as it outpaces economic growth. Studies by CBO, MedPAC, and others attribute most of the cost growth in Medicare to the development and increasing utilization of new treatments and medical technology. PPACA and the Reconciliation Act aim to reduce direct Medicare program spending by $400 billion over the next 10 years through various adjustments and efficiencies in healthcare delivery. There are differing views on how Medicare savings should be used to fund the expansion. The discussion revolves around the use of Medicare savings to fund health care coverage expansion or strengthen the program's financial standing. Concerns are raised about the sustainability of payment reductions in the long term and their potential impact on quality of care and access to services. The appendix outlines Medicare provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) are organized by titles, with Title X and Reconciliation Act provisions included. Changes from the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010 are also noted. Medicare-related sections omitted from the appendix are referenced in footnotes. Title II focuses on the Role of Public Programs, including Subtitle K which addresses Protections for American Indians and Alaska Natives, such as reimbursement for Medicare Part B services provided by certain Indian hospitals and clinics. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 expanded Medicare Part B coverage for services provided by Indian Health Service (IHS), Indian tribes (IT), or tribal organizations (TO) until January 1, 2010. This provision extended reimbursement for physician services, health practitioners, and outpatient therapy services. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 extended reimbursement for IHS, IT, and TO services under Medicare Part B until January 1, 2010. The CBO score is $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program links payment to quality outcomes for acute care hospitals under Medicare. Under the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, hospitals will receive incentive payments from Medicare based on their performance starting in FY2013. Performance will be measured on specific quality measures and conditions, with public reporting playing a key role. Certain hospitals will be excluded from the program if they are already subject to payment reductions for reporting quality data. Under the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, hospitals will receive incentive payments from Medicare based on their performance starting in FY2013. Exemptions include hospitals with immediate jeopardy deficiencies, insufficient measures, or those under Maryland's specific Medicare system with comparable outcomes. The Secretary will choose measures for the program, covering specified conditions and efficiency measures like Medicare spending per beneficiary. The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program will provide incentive payments to hospitals based on their performance, with the Secretary establishing performance standards and methodology. Hospitals with the highest scores will receive larger payments, and there will be no minimum performance standard. Hospitals meeting or exceeding standards will receive increased base operating DRG payments per discharge. Starting in FY2013, incentive payments will be funded by reducing base operating DRG payments by 1.0%. The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program will provide incentive payments to hospitals based on their performance. Reductions in base operating DRG payments will apply to all hospitals, with percentages increasing each fiscal year. Certain adjustments within Medicare's inpatient hospital payment system will not be affected. Individual hospital performance on quality measures will be publicly reported, with a process for appeals to be established. No judicial or administrative review of certain aspects of the VBP program will be allowed. The Secretary will consult with small rural and urban hospitals on the program's application. The VBP program will be modified to consult with small rural and urban hospitals. The Secretary can require hospitals to submit data on additional quality measures. Risk adjustment for quality measures will be provided for FY2013 payments. The GAO will conduct a study on the VBP program with reports due by 2015 and 2017. Three-year VBP demonstration projects will be established in critical access hospitals and hospitals excluded from VBP within two years. The Physician Quality Reporting System was established to provide incentives to eligible professionals who report data on quality measures. The program was made permanent by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. The Physician Quality Reporting System, established to incentivize eligible professionals reporting quality measures, was made permanent by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. The program offers bonuses through 2014, with an increased incentive payment of 2% in 2009 and 2010. PPACA extends PQRI payments through 2014 and introduces penalties for non-reporting starting in 2015. Eligible professionals reporting successfully in 2010 receive a 1% bonus in 2011, with additional bonuses for reporting in subsequent years. An extra 0.5% incentive is available for those meeting Maintenance of Certification Program requirements. The Maintenance of Certification Program (MOCP) focuses on competencies in patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, interpersonal skills, and professionalism. Physicians must maintain a valid US medical license, participate in educational programs, pass a secure examination, and complete MOCP practice assessments. Eligible professionals must participate in MOCP practice assessments more frequently than for board certification. The MOCP submits information to the Secretary on behalf of the professional. The MOCP submits information to the Secretary on behalf of eligible professionals who have successfully met program criteria. Failure to participate in the program results in payment penalties. Incentive payments and adjustments are based on allowed charges for covered services. CMS is required to integrate the PQRI program with standards for meaningful use of certified electronic health records. The provision to integrate the PQRI program with electronic health records under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 would cost $600 million over FY2010-FY2014 and $300 million over FY2010-2019. Improvements to the Physician Feedback Program aim to provide information to physicians on their resource use, allowing them to assess their practice styles and potentially reduce resource use. The Physician Feedback Program established under MIPPA aims to improve efficiency and control costs by providing confidential reports to physicians using Medicare claims data. The program measures resources involved in care on an episode or per capita basis. The GAO will conduct a study on the program's implementation and submit recommendations to Congress by March 1, 2011. The PPACA provision from 2011 requires new reports and data analysis under the Physician Feedback Program, including developing an episode grouper and providing resource use comparison reports to physicians starting in 2012. The PPACA provision from 2011 requires new reports and data analysis under the Physician Feedback Program, including developing an episode grouper and providing resource use comparison reports to physicians starting in 2012. Additionally, the Secretary is required to aggregate episodes of care attributed to a physician into a composite measure per individual, with appropriate adjustments made for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. This provision will not impact spending over the 5 or 10-year budget window. Quality reporting for Long-term Care Hospitals, Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals, and Hospice Programs is also mandated, with current law not requiring these facilities to report quality data to CMS. Medicare payment systems for these facilities will be updated. Starting in rate year 2014, Long-term Care Hospitals (LTCHs) will need to submit data on specified quality measures, with a 2 percentage point reduction in annual update for non-compliance. Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals (IRFs) and hospices will have the same requirement starting in FY2014. The reduction in payment update will not affect subsequent years, and the required measures will be published by October 1, 2012. Sec. 3005 requires quality reporting programs for IPPS-exempt cancer hospitals starting FY2014. Providers can review data before public release, with CBO scores of $0 for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019 Sec. 3006 as modified by Sec. 10301. Plans for a Value-Based Purchasing Program for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), Home Health Agencies (HHAs), and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) require the Secretary of HHS to develop three plans and submit them to Congress by specific dates. These plans must consider measures of quality and efficiency, data reporting, and validation. The Secretary of HHS is required to develop a plan for a Value-Based Purchasing Program for skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and ambulatory surgical centers. The plan must address quality data reporting, payment adjustments, public disclosure of performance information, and other relevant issues. The CBO score for this program is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, a separate payment modifier based on quality is to be applied to the Medicare physician fee schedule. The separate payment modifier for the Medicare physician fee schedule is based on the relative quality and cost of care provided by physicians or groups. Quality is evaluated using risk-adjusted measures established by the Secretary, while costs are assessed using appropriate measures that consider factors like socioeconomic status and health. The Secretary must publish specific quality and cost measures by January 1, 2012, along with implementation dates and performance periods. The Secretary will implement a value-based payment adjustment starting in 2013. Physicians will receive information on the quality and cost of care they provide during the performance period starting in 2014. The payment modifier will be applied to specific physicians and groups starting January 1, 2015, and to all by January 1, 2017. The modifier will promote systems-based care and consider special circumstances in rural and underserved areas. This provision is estimated to have no impact on spending over the budget window. Starting October 1, 2008, hospitals did not receive additional Medicare payment for complications acquired during a patient's hospital stay for certain select conditions known as hospital acquired conditions (HACs). These conditions are high cost, high volume, or both, identified through a secondary diagnosis that results in assignment to a different, higher payment rate MS-DRG. This provision will not impact spending over the 5-year or 10-year budget window. Starting FY2015, hospitals with high national HAC rates will receive reduced payments. Maryland hospitals under state Medicare are exempt if they meet quality and cost criteria. Hospitals will receive confidential HAC reports before public disclosure on the Hospital Compare website. No review is allowed for certain cases. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2012, with recommendations for expanding Medicare's HAC payment policy to various facilities. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$1.4 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare pays for inpatient care at psychiatric hospitals using a unique prospective payment system. The Secretary is directed to establish quality reporting programs for IPFs starting in rate year 2014. Non-compliance will result in a 2 percentage point reduction in annual updates, potentially lowering payments. Measures must be endorsed by a consensus organization and published by October 1, 2012. Providers can review data before public release. Sec. 10326 establishes a pilot pay-for-performance program for certain Medicare providers, including IPFs, LTCHs, IRFs, IPPS-exempt cancer hospitals, and hospice programs. The program aims to control spending without compromising quality of care, with the Secretary having the authority to expand the project if it proves successful. The Chief Actuary of CMS must certify any expansion. The Chief Actuary of CMS must certify that an expansion of the pilot pay-for-performance program would reduce Medicare spending. The Secretary is required to ensure that the expansion does not limit Medicare benefits. The CBO score for the program is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, the Secretary is mandated to post a list of eligible professionals who submitted data on quality measures and develop a plan for a value-based purchasing program under Medicare. The Secretary is required to develop a Physician Compare Internet website with information on Medicare-enrolled physicians by January 1, 2011. By January 1, 2013, a plan for publicly available physician performance information through Physician Compare must be implemented, ensuring data validity and provider review processes. The plan for the Physician Compare Internet website includes robust data on physician performance, care for all patients, attribution of care, timely feedback, and reliable data systems. The Secretary must also consider transitioning to a value-based purchasing program and report to Congress on data collection and publication for physician quality and efficiency. The Secretary will establish a demonstration program to provide financial incentives to Medicare beneficiaries receiving services from high-quality physicians. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation will be established within CMS to test new approaches in healthcare delivery and payment models. The Secretary will establish a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMI) within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to reduce program expenditures under Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP while improving the quality of care. The CMI will focus on models that enhance coordination, quality, and efficiency of healthcare services. The Secretary has the authority to select demonstration models addressing various themes without requiring budget neutrality initially. Factors considered include patient care management, technology utilization, and collaboration among different provider types. The Secretary evaluates demonstration models for quality of care, patient outcomes, and spending changes. Models must improve quality without increasing spending, reduce spending without reducing quality, or do both to continue. States and entities must provide necessary information for evaluation. The Secretary has the authority to expand demonstration duration and scope based on evaluation results, aiming to reduce spending without compromising quality or improve quality without increasing spending. Waiver authority allows the Secretary to waive certain requirements for conducting these demonstrations, exempting them from the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires federal agencies to obtain OMB approval for information collection requests. Funding provisions allocate $5 million for model design in FY2010, $10 billion annually for activities from 2011 to 2019, and $10 billion for each subsequent 10-year period starting in 2020. At least $25 million must be used for specific model design, implementation, and evaluation. Oversight mandates the Secretary to report CMI activities to Congress biennially from 2012, detailing demonstrations, participant numbers, and payments. The CBO score is $0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$1.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare Shared Savings Program includes the Physician Group Practice (PGP) demonstration and accountable care organizations (ACOs) for improving healthcare quality and cost-efficiency for Medicare beneficiaries. Groups of providers meeting certain criteria can participate voluntarily. The Medicare Shared Savings Program allows groups of providers meeting specific criteria to be recognized as ACOs and share in cost-savings for the Medicare program. ACOs must achieve a threshold savings amount to qualify for an annual incentive bonus, with eligibility requiring participation for a minimum of three years. ACOs consist of various practitioners in group practice arrangements, networks of practices, and partnerships. ACOs must meet specific criteria to be recognized and share in cost-savings for the Medicare program. Eligibility for shared savings payments is based on per capita Medicare expenditures being below a specified percentage of the benchmark. The benchmark is calculated using three years of per beneficiary spending, adjusted for beneficiary characteristics and national expenditure growth. The benchmark for per capita expenditures in ACO agreements will be reset periodically. ACOs meeting quality standards can receive a percentage of the difference between their estimated Medicare expenditures and the benchmark. The Secretary will set limits on shared savings payments to ACOs and may use a partial capitation model for payment. This model puts qualifying ACOs at financial risk for some Part A and B services, with limits on participation for highly integrated systems. The ACO model incentivizes organizations to submit quality data and meet specific requirements to earn incentive payments. The Secretary can adjust savings thresholds based on ACO size and impose sanctions for avoiding at-risk patients. The CBO score is -$0.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$4.9 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3023 as modified by Sec. 10308 introduces a National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling for Medicare beneficiaries with complex health conditions. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has suggested testing new payment models to encourage better coordination of care for Medicare beneficiaries with complex health conditions. A national, voluntary pilot program is to be established by January 1, 2013, to provide incentives for providers to coordinate patient care across episodes of care. This program aims to hold providers jointly accountable for the full spectrum of care around a hospitalization. The Secretary can expand a pilot program after January 1, 2016, to reduce Medicare spending without compromising care quality. Provider payment methods may include bundled payments for episodes of care, covering various services like inpatient care, physician services, and post-acute care. The pilot program aims to reduce Medicare spending without compromising care quality by providing post-acute care services to participating beneficiaries. Payment methodology includes care coordination, medication reconciliation, and other patient-centered activities. Beneficiaries must be entitled to Medicare Part A and enrolled in Part B, with specific conditions selected by the Secretary. The program cannot result in increased spending compared to without implementation. The Secretary is required to conduct a Medicare demonstration program to test a payment incentive and service delivery model using home-based primary care teams for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. The program must be evaluated within three years of implementation. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Nurse practitioners work in a team with physicians, nurses, and other staff to provide home-based primary care services to beneficiaries. They make in-home visits, implement care plans tailored to chronic conditions, and aim to reduce expenditures and improve health outcomes. The Secretary will establish a methodology for sharing savings with practices that have expenditures below a target level. The demonstration aims to reduce Medicare expenditures by providing incentive payments to qualifying practices with lower actual annual expenditures compared to estimated spending targets. Agreements with practices under the program are limited to a three-year period. The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation and submit a final report to Congress on the impact of the pilot program on care coordination, expenditures, access to services, and quality. The Secretary will submit a plan by January 1, 2016, for expanding the program if it improves patient care quality and reduces spending. $5 million is appropriated for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2015 for program administration. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program aims to reduce Medicare expenditures by assigning patients to MS-DRGs for payment based on care resources needed. Medicare pays hospitals based on MS-DRGs for patient care, with additional payments for atypical cases, teaching hospitals, disproportionate share hospitals, and low-volume Medicare providers. Maryland hospitals have a state-specific reimbursement system, while other facilities like IRFs and IPFs are reimbursed differently. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) reported that in 2005, a significant percentage of Medicare beneficiaries were readmitted to hospitals within 7 and 30 days, resulting in $15 billion in Medicare spending. A hospital readmissions reduction program was established in 2012 to address preventable readmissions by adjusting Medicare payments based on certain conditions. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) reported a high rate of readmissions among Medicare beneficiaries in 2005, leading to significant spending. A readmissions reduction program was implemented in 2012 to adjust Medicare payments based on specific conditions, exempting certain hospital payments in Maryland. Adjustments include reductions for outlier, IME, DSH, and low volume payments, with a floor adjustment factor and a ratio involving excess readmissions payments for each fiscal year. Beginning in FY2015, the number of applicable conditions for excess readmissions payments is to be expanded beyond the initial 3 conditions to 4 additional conditions identified by MedPAC in 2007. Readmissions do not include those unrelated to the prior discharge, such as planned readmissions or transfers to another hospital. The number of conditions for excess readmissions payments will be expanded from 3 to 4 additional conditions identified by MedPAC in 2007. Readmission data for various types of hospitals must be submitted and made public after review. No judicial or administrative review will be allowed for certain aspects of the readmission program. A program to improve readmission rates through patient safety organizations will be established for eligible hospitals with historically high rates of readmissions. Hospitals and organizations must report on processes used to reduce readmissions. The CBO score is -$0.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$7.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, a Community Care Transitions Program under Medicare will be funded for eligible hospitals and community-based organizations starting January 1, 2011. The bill establishes a program for eligible hospitals to improve care transition services for high-risk Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions or risk factors for readmission. Community-based organizations and hospitals must propose interventions to participate in the program. The program aims to improve care transition services for high-risk Medicare beneficiaries by implementing interventions such as timely post-discharge follow-up and educating patients about responding to health symptoms. Participating entities prioritized include those serving medically underserved populations and rural areas. $500 million will be transferred from trust funds for this program, with the Secretary having the authority to continue or expand it. The Secretary has the authority to continue or expand the Gainsharing Demonstration program to improve care quality and reduce Medicare spending. The program has a CBO score of $0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.5 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Two projects are currently operating in New York and West Virginia, with a budget of $6 million appropriated in FY2006. The project began on October 1, 2008, and was scheduled to end on December 31, 2009, with mandated reports due from the Secretary. The Gainsharing Demonstration project, initially set to end on December 31, 2009, will now be extended until September 30, 2011. The interim report deadline is moved to March 31, 2011, with the final report due on March 31, 2013. An additional $1.6 million will be appropriated in FY2010, with all appropriations available through FY2014. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule is adjusted geographically using Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) to reflect differences in resource costs for physician services. A temporary floor value of 1.00 on the physician work index was set in January 2004 and extended through December 2009 by Section 134 of the MIPPA. Practice expense and medical malpractice indices were not affected. This provision extends the floor and introduces a new methodology for reimbursement calculation. The provision extends the floor on the geographic index for physician work through 2011 and adjusts the practice expense GPCI for 2010 and 2011. It directs the Secretary to analyze current methods for establishing practice expense geographic adjustments. Relief applies to areas with a practice expense GPCI less than 1.0. The Secretary is required to evaluate current methods for establishing practice expense geographic adjustments under the physician fee schedule and make appropriate adjustments by January 1, 2012. The estimated cost of this provision is $2.2 billion over FY2010-FY2012 with no further impact beyond that period. The Extenders Act provision will cost $0.5 billion for FY2011-FY2012 and extends the exceptions process for Medicare therapy caps. The annual per beneficiary payment limits for outpatient therapy services are extended through December 31, 2009. The Temporary Extension Act of 2010, H.R. 4691 extended the exceptions process for therapy caps through December 31, 2010. The PPACA provision extended it further to December 31, 2011, costing $800 million over FY2010-FY2011. The Extenders Act provision will cost $0.9 billion for FY2011-FY2012, extending the exceptions process for another year. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 extended the exception for direct payment to laboratories providing outsourced pathology services until January 1, 2010. The PPACA and Extenders Act further extended this provision until December 31, 2011, with estimated costs of $100 million in 2010 and $0.1 billion in FY2011. Additionally, bonus payments for ground ambulance services in rural areas were extended until January 1, 2010. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 extended direct payment to laboratories providing outsourced pathology services until January 1, 2010. The PPACA and Extenders Act further extended this provision until December 31, 2011. Bonus payments for ground ambulance services in rural areas were also extended until January 1, 2010, with additional increases for rural ambulance services and other areas. The provisions were extended until January 1, 2011, and then further extended through December 31, 2011 by the Extenders Act. The CBO estimates the cost of the PPACA provision and Extenders provision to be $0.1 billion for various fiscal years. Sec. 3106, as modified by 10312, extends certain payment rules for Long-term Care Hospital Services. LTCHs provide extended medical care for complex patients. The LTCH industry has evolved to include co-located hospitals-within-hospitals or satellite facilities. CMS has implemented additional requirements on LTCHs to ensure compliance. Starting October 1, 2004, CMS established limits on the number of discharged Medicare patients that LTCHs can admit and be paid as independent entities. This payment policy was extended to other types of LTCHs, including grandfathered entities, starting July 1, 2007. A three-year moratorium on this policy for certain LTCHs was provided by Congress starting December 29, 2007. LTCHs are paid according to a prospective payment system (PPS) effective for the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2002. LTCHs are paid under a prospective payment system (PPS) with a five-year transition period. CMS proposed a one-time adjustment to correct errors in budget neutrality calculations. The LTCH-PPS includes case level adjustments for short stay and interrupted stay cases. A short-stay outlier payment policy was adopted to reduce payments for patients with stays less than one standard deviation from the average. Additionally, a three-year moratorium on new LTCHs was implemented. The PPACA provision extends the moratorium on new LTCHs for two years until December 29, 2012. The Extenders Act preserves the add-on payment for Medicare mental health services through December 31, 2011. The PPACA provision extends the moratorium on new LTCHs for two years until December 29, 2012, and $100 million over FY2011-FY2012 for the Extenders Act provision. Section 3108 permits Physician Assistants to order post-hospital extended care services in a skilled nursing facility under Medicare law. Post-hospital extended care services are defined as services provided as an extension of care within 30 days after discharge from a hospital stay. The PPACA provision allows a physician assistant to certify the need for post-hospital extended care services for Medicare payment purposes. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3109 exempts certain pharmacies from accreditation requirements under Medicare. PPACA extends the accreditation deadline for pharmacies not in competitive bidding to January 1, 2011. Certain pharmacies are exempt from accreditation requirements if they meet specific criteria. The PPACA extends the accreditation deadline for pharmacies not in competitive bidding to January 1, 2011. Pharmacies must meet specific criteria to be exempt from accreditation requirements. Pharmacies enrolled as DMEPOS providers under Medicare for at least five years with no adverse determinations must submit documentation for verification. The Secretary can establish alternative accreditation requirements. TRICARE, the health care plan for military personnel, was extended to Medicare-eligible military retirees. TRICARE For Life (TFL) was authorized by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to provide supplemental coverage to Medicare-eligible military retirees, their spouses, and dependent children. Beneficiaries must enroll in and pay premiums for Medicare Part B to participate in TFL. Declining Part B results in loss of TRICARE benefits. Veterans who initially decline Medicare Part B can enroll later during an annual enrollment period, but will face a late enrollment penalty. TRICARE coverage is dependent on Part B enrollment, and a special enrollment period is created for military retirees, spouses, and dependent children who are eligible for TRICARE but have declined Part B. This twelve-month special enrollment period allows retroactive coverage without a late enrollment penalty. The Secretary of Defense is required to identify and notify individuals of their eligibility for a special enrollment period (SEP) for Medicare. The late enrollment penalty does not apply to those who enroll during the SEP. Medicare will pay for bone density tests using DXA machines for eligible individuals once every two years. Reimbursement rates for imaging services under Medicare have been reduced significantly since 2006, with DXA services seeing a more than 50% decrease. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 capped reimbursement for x-ray and imaging services, leading to lower payments. In 2010 and 2011, payments for DXA services were set at 70% of the 2006 rates. The Secretary arranged for a study on Medicare reimbursement reductions for DXA services. CBO estimates a cost of $0.1 billion for FY2010 and FY2011. The Medicare Improvement Fund was revised, reducing funding to $275 million for FY2015. The PPACA provision eliminated FY2014 MIF funding. The Extenders Act provision under Sec. 3113 establishes a demonstration project for separate payments to laboratories for complex diagnostic tests provided to Medicare beneficiaries. This includes tests like gene protein expression analysis and cancer chemotherapy sensitivity assays. The demonstration project for separate payments to laboratories for complex diagnostic tests under the Extenders Act provision includes tests not covered by Medicare, with a budget limit of $100 million over a two-year period starting from July 1, 2011. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress two years after the completion of the demonstration project, assessing its impact on access to care, quality of care, health outcomes, and Medicare program expenditures. CBO estimates a cost of $100 million over the next 5 years. Sec. 3114 focuses on improved access for certified nurse-midwife services under Medicare payments. Sec. 10323 establishes Medicare coverage eligibility criteria for individuals exposed to environmental health hazards, including age requirements, disability status, and specific medical conditions like ALS and ESRD. The fee schedule for certified-midwife services is limited to 100% of the fee schedule amount for physician services. The CBO estimates a cost of $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare coverage eligibility criteria for individuals exposed to environmental health hazards include specific medical conditions like ALS, ESRD, and certain lung diseases or types of cancer. Individuals living in areas subject to a public health emergency declaration by the EPA are entitled to benefits under Part A and eligible to enroll in Part B. The Secretary is required to establish a pilot program for comprehensive care for these individuals. The EPA emergency declaration applies to individuals who lived in the affected area for a specified period. Funding is allocated for screening and public information dissemination. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 requires the implementation of a bundled payment system for renal dialysis services. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 requires a study on the impact of including specified oral drugs in the ESRD bundled prospective payment system. The study will analyze providers' ability to furnish oral drugs and comply with state laws. The CBO score for FY2010-FY2019 is $0.0 billion. Part II\u2014Rural Protections Sec. 3121 extends the Outpatient Hold Harmless Provision for small rural hospitals. They can receive additional Medicare payments if their outpatient payments are less than under the prior reimbursement system. For CY 2006-2009, hospitals received a percentage of the payment difference under the prospective payment system. Sole community hospitals with up to 100 beds received a similar payment difference for HOPD services in 2009. In CY 2010, all small rural hospitals and SCHs received 85% of the payment difference. The outpatient hold harmless provisions were extended through December 31, 2011. The CBO score for the PPACA provision is $0.2 billion. Extension of Medicare Reasonable Costs Payments for Certain Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests Furnished to Hospital Patients in Certain Rural Areas. Hospitals with under 50 beds in qualified rural areas receive 100% of reasonable cost reimbursement for outpatient clinical diagnostic laboratory services under Part B. This provision aims to reinstate reasonable cost reimbursement for laboratory services provided by these hospitals, which ended in July 2008. The Extenders Act extends reasonable cost reimbursement for clinical diagnostic laboratory services for qualifying rural hospitals with under 50 beds until July 1, 2012. The CBO estimates the cost of this provision to be between -$50 million and $50 million for FY2011-FY3. Additionally, CMS is running a five-year Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program to test reasonable cost reimbursement for small rural hospitals in low population density areas. The provision extends the demonstration program for an additional five years, allowing up to 30 hospitals in low population density areas to participate. Currently, 10 hospitals are involved, and the extension specifies that 20 states will be included. Participants will receive reasonable cost reimbursement for discharges during the extension period. The CBO estimates no cost for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3124 extends the Medicare-Dependent Hospital (MDH) Program for one year, until September 30, 2012. MDHs are small rural hospitals with a high proportion of Medicare patients, receiving special treatment under Medicare's payment system. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Temporary Improvements to the Medicare Inpatient Hospital Payment Adjustment for Low-Volume Hospitals include a payment adjustment for certain low-volume hospitals under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system. Low-volume hospitals are defined as acute care hospitals located more than 25 road miles from another comparable hospital with less than 800 total discharges during the fiscal year. The Secretary determines an appropriate percentage increase based on the relationship between standardized cost-per-case and total discharges, limited to 25%. The Medicare Inpatient Hospital Payment Adjustment for Low-Volume Hospitals provides a 25% payment increase for qualifying hospitals with less than 200 total discharges located more than 25 road miles from another comparable hospital. A temporary adjustment will increase payments for low-volume hospitals in FY2011 and FY2012, with the percentage increase determined by the Secretary on a sliding scale based on the number of discharges. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.3 billion for. Improvements to the Demonstration Project on Community Health Integration Models in Certain Rural Counties have been authorized. Eligible entities can develop and test new models for healthcare delivery in counties with 6 or fewer residents per square mile. The Secretary will select up to 4 states and 6 counties to participate in the program. Eligible counties must have a critical access hospital providing specified services. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The PPACA authorizes a three-year demonstration project for rural health care providers with a daily inpatient census of 5 or less. The limit of 6 eligible counties is eliminated, and rural health clinic services are no longer included. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. MedPAC is required to review payment adequacy for rural health care providers. MedPAC is mandated to review payment adequacy for rural health care providers and suppliers serving Medicare, analyzing rural payment adjustments, beneficiaries' access to care, Medicare payments to rural providers, and quality of care in rural areas. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) are limited-service rural facilities that receive 101% reasonable, cost-based reimbursement for care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare reimburses Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) for inpatient and outpatient care at 101% of reasonable costs for facility services and 115% of the Medicare physician fee schedule for professional services. Starting October 1, 2009, CMS will lower the facility component of the payment method to 100% of reasonable costs while professional services will remain at 115% of the fee schedule amount. Medicare also pays for ambulance services provided by CAHs at 100% of reasonable costs if they are the sole provider within a 35-mile radius. Medicare will pay the facility component of the all-inclusive elective CAH payment for outpatient services at 101% of reasonable costs. Medicare will also pay for qualifying ambulance services provided by a CAH at 101% of reasonable cost. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3129 extends and revises the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program, including a grant program (FLEX grants) administered by HRSA for States and small rural hospitals. The FLEX grant program is authorized at $55 million for each fiscal year. The FLEX grant program is authorized at $55 million for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2010. Grant funding will be available to assist small rural hospitals in delivery system reforms. Protections for Frontier States ensure a minimum area wage index for hospitals in states with low population density. The provision for adjustments to non-labor related share will not be budget neutral and will apply to covered HOPD services in frontier states after January 1, 2011. A floor of one on the practice expense index will be established for physician services in these states. The CBO score is $0.8 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $2.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Payment adjustments for Home Health Care under a prospective payment system (PPS) are based on 60-day episodes of care for beneficiaries, with adjustments for patient care needs and outlier cases. In CY2008, Medicare HH PPS refinements included a reduction in payment rates for four years to adjust for changes in coding. The final CMS rule for CY2010 continues with a 2.75% reduction to HH PPS rates. This reduction is consistent with previous adjustments for case mix changes, including a cap on outlier payments. The rule implements a cap on outlier payments at 10% of total payments per HHA and no more than 2.5% of total aggregate PPS payments for all of HH. Starting in CY2014, the Secretary will rebase home health payments to reflect the number, mix, and intensity of services. Adjustments will consider differences between providers and a four-year phase-in, ending in 2017, will be implemented. Each increment may not exceed 3.5% of the HH PPS base payment amount. The Secretary is required to reduce standard HHRG amounts by 5% of total PPS payments. Additional payments for outliers cannot exceed 2.5% of total PPS payments. A provider-specific annual cap of 10% of revenues for outlier payments is established. A 3% add-on payment is provided for HH providers in rural areas. MedPAC will conduct a study on the HH payment adjustment implementation. MedPAC will conduct a study on the implementation of the HH payment adjustment under rebasing, analyzing its impact on access to care, quality outcomes, and different types of HH agencies. The Secretary is required to submit a study to Congress on HH agency costs for providing care to low-income Medicare beneficiaries and those in medically underserved areas, considering patient severity of illness. The Secretary will conduct a study on potential revisions to the home health payment system, including adjustments for patient severity of illness and beneficiary access to care. This study will also analyze operational and implementation issues, potential impacts on home health agencies, and the need for additional research. Based on the study's results, a four-year demonstration may be provided. The Secretary may conduct a four-year demonstration starting no later than January 1, 2015, to test payment adjustments for home health services. The demonstration aims to improve access to care for patients with high severity of illness, low income, or underserved Medicare beneficiaries. A transfer of $500 million from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund will be made for the study and related activities. The funds are available for a study, design, implementation, and evaluation of a demonstration related to Medicare's hospice benefit. To be eligible for the benefit, a person must be certified as terminally ill with a life expectancy of six months or less. Medicare payments to hospices are fixed daily amounts based on predetermined units of payment. The provision requires the Secretary to collect additional data for revising payments for hospice care by January 1, 2011. Budget neutral revisions to the methodology for determining hospice payments will be implemented not earlier than October 1, 2013. New requirements will be imposed on hospice providers participating in Medicare. The Medicare program imposes new requirements on hospice providers, including face-to-face encounters for eligibility, recertification, and medical reviews for stays over 180 days. The CBO score is $0.0 for FY2010-FY2014 and -0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, there are improvements to Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments. Medicare's Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments have evolved over time to ensure access to hospital care for poor Medicare and Medicaid patients. However, a significant portion of these payments, amounting to about $5.5 billion in FY2004, was not empirically justified in terms of higher patient care costs. Starting in FY2014, there were changes to how DSH payments were targeted to hospitals' shares of uncompensated care. Starting in FY2014, changes were made to Medicare's Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments to target hospitals' shares of uncompensated care. The Secretary will make DSH payments equal to 25% of what otherwise would be made, based on an empirically justified amount determined by MedPAC. Additionally, hospitals will receive an additional payment based on a formula involving factors such as the difference in DSH payments and changes in the uninsured population. In FY2018 and subsequent years, a 0.2 percentage point subtraction will be made in Medicare's Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments. The calculation will use data certified by the Chief Actuary of CMS. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$22.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3134 addresses Misvalued Codes Under the Physician Fee Schedule, which assigns relative weights to over 7,000 physician service codes. The resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) is used to compare the value of physician services. CMS updates the fee schedule and RVUs with input from the RUC. Increases in RVUs for some services lead to lower fees for others due to budget neutrality. This has resulted in decreased payments for evaluation and management codes compared to codes with increased RVUs. The CMS periodically reviews RVUs for physician services to identify potentially misvalued codes, including those with fast growth, changes in practice expenses, new technologies, low relative values, and codes not reviewed since RBRVS implementation. The Secretary is tasked with reviewing and adjusting work relative value units under the fee schedule, repealing certain sections of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Social Security Act. This provision is estimated to have no impact on spending. Factor for Advanced Imaging Services. Medicare fee schedule separates payments for technical and professional components of services. Imaging procedures have two parts: image taking (technical) and interpretation (professional). Medicare pays separately when components are from different providers. If from one provider, a single global payment is made. CMS calculates reimbursement assuming imaging machines are used 25 hours per week. Lower equipment use factor leads to higher payment for advanced imaging services. The utilization rate for advanced imaging services has been a point of contention, with MedPAC advocating for a higher rate than previously assumed by CMS. The PPACA and Reconciliation Act changed the utilization rate assumption from 50% to 75% for 2011 and subsequent years, overriding CMS's 2010 final rule of a 90% use rate. MedPAC and the GAO suggest opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the Medicare fee schedule. Starting January 1, 2006, physicians receive full technical component fees for the highest paid imaging service during a visit, with a 25% reduction for additional services. This reduction increases to 50% for sequential imaging on contiguous body parts. By January 1, 2013, an analysis will determine if expenditure reductions will exceed $3 billion from 2010 to 2019. The CBO estimates a reduction of -$0.9 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$2.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3136 of PPACA revises Medicare payment for power-driven wheelchairs, limiting lump-sum payments to complex, rehabilitative chairs starting January 1, 2011. Rental payments for wheelchairs are based on a fee schedule, with exceptions in Competitive Acquisition Areas. The provision does not apply to competitive acquisition areas before January 1, 2011. Starting January 1, 2011, rental payments for power-driven wheelchairs will be 15% of the purchase price for the first three months and 6% for the remaining 10 months. The CBO score is -$0.6 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.8 billion for FY2010-FY2019. This is part of Sec. 3137, modified by Sec. 10317 and further by Sec. 102 of the Extenders Act. Additionally, the Hospital Wage Index Improvement adjusts standardized amounts for local wage variations and labor costs in hospital areas. CMS has been adjusting data since FY2005 to account for hospital skill mix. MedPAC recommended changes to the hospital wage index in June 2007, leading CMS to hire a consulting firm to evaluate the impact. Acute care hospitals can apply to MGCRB for reclassification based on wage thresholds. Starting in FY2010, CMS raised the reclassification threshold to ensure budget neutrality. Section 508 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 provided $900 million for a one-time, three-year geographic reclassification of certain hospitals to areas with higher wage index values. These reclassifications were extended legislatively until September 30, 2010, and then further extended through September 30, 2011 by the Extenders Act. The Secretary is required to use FY2010 wage index data for these hospitals starting April 1, 2010. Beginning on April 1, 2010, hospitals with higher wage index data will be included in the reclassified area. Some hospitals will receive additional payment by December 31, 2010, to reflect wage index differences. By December 31, 2011, the Secretary must present a plan to Congress for Medicare wage index system reform, considering MedPAC recommendations. Reclassification thresholds for hospital decisions will be restored to FY2009 levels starting in FY2011. The PPACA provision aims to implement budget neutral wage index reform until one year after the Secretary's plan submission. CBO estimates costs for FY2010-FY2019. Eleven cancer hospitals are exempt from IPPS and OPPS payment systems, ensuring they do not receive less from Medicare. The PPACA provision requires a study on outpatient costs for IPPS-exempt cancer hospitals under Medicare's APCs. If costs exceed those of other hospitals, an OPPS adjustment will be made from January 1, 2011. CBO estimates $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare Part B pays for biologic products administered in various healthcare settings. Medicare Part B pays for drugs administered in outpatient departments or through durable medical equipment, with payments based on average sales price (ASP) for each HCPCS code. Brand-name and generic drugs with the same HCPCS code are priced together. A Part B biosimilar product can be reimbursed at ASP of the biosimilar plus 6% of the reference product's ASP. The CBO score for related sections is -$0.1. Sec. 3140. Medicare Hospice Concurrent Care Demonstration Program allows terminally ill beneficiaries to receive hospice care while also receiving all other Medicare covered services. A three-year demonstration program will examine patient care improvements and cost-effectiveness. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3141. Application of Budget Neutrality on a National Basis in the Calculation of the Medicare Hospital Wage Index Floor for Each All-Urban and Rural State. The hospital wage index adjusts the standardized amount for local wage variation or labor costs. The rural floor ensures urban areas in a state have a wage index no lower than the rural wage index. Budget neutrality is maintained by adjusting the wage index of unaffected hospitals. CMS transitioned funding for this requirement in FY2009. Starting in FY2009, CMS transitioned to fund the budget neutrality requirement through a state-specific adjustment. States without hospitals receiving the rural floor wage index would not have reduced payments. The provision requires a national adjustment to the area wage index for discharges starting October 1, 2010. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3142 involves a study on Urban Medicare-Dependent Hospitals, which are small rural hospitals with a high proportion of Medicare patients. Urban Medicare-Dependent Hospitals (MDHs) are small rural hospitals with a high proportion of Medicare patients. They receive special treatment under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), along with rural referral centers (RRC) and sole community hospitals (SCHs). Critical access hospitals (CAHs) are exempt from IPPS and paid 101% of their reasonable costs. IPPS includes payment adjustments like the indirect medical education (IME) adjustment for teaching hospitals and the disproportionate share hospital (DSH) adjustment for hospitals serving a high proportion of poor Medicare and Medicaid patients. Sec. 3143 of the study examines the need for additional Medicare payments for urban Medicare-dependent hospitals under IPPS. CAHs are excluded. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 10325 is repealed by Sec. 202 of the Extenders Act, revising the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System. SNFs are paid through a PPS adjusted for case mix and area wages. The CMS final rule for FY2010 established a revised case-mix classification methodology (RUG-IV) for SNFs, adjusting payments based on 53 RUGs to account for care needs. The revisions aimed to correct changes made in FY2006 that resulted in payments exceeding budget estimates. The Secretary was prohibited from implementing the revised case-mix classification under PPACA. The Extenders Act repealed the delay in implementing the RUG-IV system under PPACA, specifying it to begin in FY2010. The CBO score for this provision was $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, Sec. 1109 of the Reconciliation Act increased Medicare payments to qualifying hospitals in low-cost counties by $400 million for FY2011 and FY2012. These hospitals are in counties with the lowest Medicare Part A and B benefit spending. The Extenders Act repealed the delay in implementing the RUG-IV system under PPACA, starting in FY2010. Sec. 1109 of the Reconciliation Act increased Medicare payments to qualifying hospitals in low-cost counties by $400 million for FY2011 and FY2012, adjusted by age, sex, and race. Medicare Advantage (MA) is an alternative way for beneficiaries to receive covered benefits, with payments to MA plans determined by comparing plan bids to a benchmark. Each bid represents the plan's estimated revenue requirement for providing required Medicare services to an average beneficiary. Medicare Advantage (MA) is a way for beneficiaries to receive covered benefits, with payments to MA plans determined by comparing plan bids to a benchmark. The benchmark is the maximum amount Medicare will pay a plan, and if the bid is below the benchmark, the plan is paid its bid plus a rebate. MA benchmarks are based on historical Medicare private plan payment rates and are increased each year by the growth in Medicare spending. Local MA plans choose the counties they wish to serve, while regional plans must follow specific guidelines. Under PPACA, MA plans have benchmarks that are adjusted annually based on historical Medicare private plan payment rates. Local MA plans choose the counties they serve, while regional plans must serve entire regions defined by the Secretary. Payments to MA plans are not tied to the quality of care provided to enrollees. In 2012, blended benchmarks will be phased in based on a percentage of a base amount, with adjustments made according to per capita spending in original Medicare. The percentage adjustment to the base amount for county benchmarks under PPACA will be determined by per capita FFS spending relative to other counties. Benchmarks will vary from 95% to 115% of the base amount based on quartiles of per capita spending. Phase-in schedules for new benchmarks range from two to six years depending on the size of the reduction. The Secretary will periodically re-rank counties based on quartile ranking changes, with a one-year phase-in to new ranking levels. Benchmarks under PPACA cannot exceed pre-PPACA levels. Quality plans with a 4-star rating or higher will receive benchmark increases, starting at 1.5 percentage points in 2012 and doubling in 2014. In 2014, the increase is 5.0 percentage points for qualifying plans in a qualifying county. A qualifying county is defined as having lower than average per capita spending in original Medicare, 25% or more beneficiaries enrolled in MA, and a payment rate based on the minimum amount applicable to a metropolitan statistical area. New plans or plans with low enrollment may also qualify for a benchmark increase. Plans with low enrollment will be deemed to qualify for a quality increase in 2012. Rebates are given to MA plans if their bid is below the benchmark. Rebates for MA plans are based on bid vs benchmark. Pre-PPACA, plans received a 75% rebate for extra benefits. PPACA now ties rebates to plan quality: 4.5+ stars get 70%, 3.5-4.5 stars get 65%, <3.5 stars get 50%. Low enrollment plans treated as 4.5 stars in 2012. New plans considered 3.5 stars. The change in rebate percentages for MA organizations will be phased in over three years. Risk adjustment in MA plan payments compensates for treating older and sicker beneficiaries. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required adjustments for diagnosis coding differences between MA plans and providers. PPACA mandates further analyses on coding patterns and specifies minimum coding intensity adjustments starting in 2014. The PPACA mandates minimum coding intensity adjustments starting in 2014, with increases in subsequent years. It also repeals the Comparative Cost Adjustment Program. PPACA repeals the Comparative Cost Adjustment Program and mandates minimum coding intensity adjustments starting in 2014. The CBO score for savings from limits on MA plan administrative costs is -$30.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$135.6 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Plans are required to have a Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) of at least .85 starting in 2014, with penalties for non-compliance. Under PPACA, MA plans must meet MLR requirements of at least .85 starting in 2014, with penalties for non-compliance. Cost sharing in MA plans is determined on a plan-by-plan basis, constrained by the actuarial value of total cost sharing under original Medicare. Beginning in 2011, MA plans cannot charge higher cost sharing than original Medicare for certain services. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Under PPACA, MA plans must meet MLR requirements of at least .85 starting in 2014, with penalties for non-compliance. Cost sharing in MA plans is determined on a plan-by-plan basis, constrained by the actuarial value of total cost sharing under original Medicare. Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in or change their enrollment in MA from November 15 to December 31 each year. Changes go into effect January 1st of the next year. Effective beginning in 2011, PPACA shifts the annual, coordinated election period for MA and Part D to October 15 through December 7. PPACA shifted the annual election period for MA and Part D to October 15 through December 7, starting in 2011. Beneficiaries can disenroll from Medicare Advantage and return to original Medicare during the first 45 days of the new benefit year. Specialized MA plans for special needs individuals were extended under Sec. 3205. Special needs plans (SNPs) can target enrollment to specific groups like institutionalized, dually eligible, or those with severe chronic conditions. SNP authority is extended through December 31, 2013. The Secretary will establish a frailty payment adjustment for fully integrated dual-eligible SNPs. Adjustments to payments for dual-eligible SNPs are only allowed for plans with fully integrated Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Fully integrated dual-eligible SNPs are exempt from the IME payment phase-out for all MA plans. Authority for SNPs without Medicaid contracts is extended through 2012. The provision requires the Secretary to establish a process to transition SNP beneficiaries that do not qualify as special needs individuals to fee-for-service Medicare and other MA plans. SNPs will be required to have approval of the National Committee for Quality Assurance to serve targeted populations. The Secretary is required to evaluate, revise, and publish the MA risk adjustment payment methodology to recalibrate payments for higher medical and care coordination costs for specified conditions. The CBO score is $0.6 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Extension of Reasonable Cost Contracts is also included. Extension of Reasonable Cost Contracts allows Medicare Advantage plans to be reimbursed for actual service costs. These plans were created in 1982 and were supposed to phase out in 1997, but delays have kept them operating. The Secretary can only extend contracts if certain conditions are met. PPACA extends the operation of reasonable cost plans for three years, from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2013, even if other MA plans are available in the area. MA coordinated care plans must meet medical access requirements by forming provider networks. Starting in 2011, PFFS plans sponsored by employers or unions must establish contracted networks of providers to meet access requirements. Non-employer sponsored MA PFFS plans are required to establish contracted networks in \"network areas\" with at least two network-based plans. PPACA allows the Secretary to grant waivers from network requirements for employer-based PFFS plans with enrollment as of October 1, 2009. The PPACA allows the Secretary to grant waivers from network requirements for employer-based PFFS plans with enrollment as of October 1, 2009. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3208 makes the Senior Housing Facility Demonstration permanent, allowing MA plans to target smaller areas of healthier, low-cost enrollees by receiving a waiver to restrict enrollment to residents of a retirement community. Effective January 1, 2010, PPACA requires the establishment of a new type of MA plan called an MA Senior Housing. PPACA requires the establishment of an MA Senior Housing Facility Plan, which serves beneficiaries in a continuing care retirement community. The Secretary has the authority to negotiate bids submitted by MA plans, similar to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. The Secretary has the authority to negotiate bids in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, ensuring actuarial support and reflecting revenue requirements. Private Fee-for-Service MA plans are excluded from negotiation. PPACA clarifies that the Secretary is not obligated to accept every bid from MA or Part D plans. CBO score for this section was included in the estimate for Section 3201. Additionally, new standards are being developed for certain Medigap plans to provide coverage for deductibles, coinsurance, and some services not covered by Medicare. The PPACA law includes standardized plans (Plan A-L) with minimum standards set by NAIC. New model plans C and F with nominal cost sharing are to be created by NAIC in 2015. CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Elimination of MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund created by MMA to encourage plans to enter or remain in the MA Regional Program. Originally set at $10 billion, funds were available from 2007-2013, but subsequent legislation reduced the amount and delayed availability. MIPPA reduced initial funding to one dollar, with money from bidding process flowing into the Fund. PPACA eliminates the Fund, transferring amounts to Part B Trust Fund. CBO score is -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Subtitle D of the Reconciliation Act addresses Medicare Part D improvements, specifically the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program for Brand-Name Drugs. The program aims to close the Medicare Prescription Drug \"Donut Hole\" by providing coverage until a catastrophic threshold is reached. In 2010, Part D enrollees without low-income subsidy assistance would be responsible for a total of $4,550 in drug costs. The Part D low-income subsidy covers $4,550 in out-of-pocket costs before reaching the catastrophic phase, including a $310 deductible, $630 in co-insurance, and $3,610 in the coverage gap. A voluntary agreement with PhRMA provides 50% discounts on brand-name drugs in the coverage gap. Manufacturers must offer discounts to Part D enrollees starting in 2011, with the discount counting towards the enrollee's costs. Low-income subsidy recipients and those in retiree drug plans are not eligible for the discount. The Reconciliation Act added provisions to close the coverage gap by 2020 and reduce costs for Medicare Part D enrollees. A third party entity will administer the drug discount program, with manufacturers needing to agree to participate. In 2010, beneficiaries entering the coverage gap will receive a $250 rebate, and cost sharing for brand-name drugs will decrease to 25% by 2020. In 2011 and 2012, beneficiary cost-sharing for brand-name drugs will be reduced to 50% of the drug price. From 2013 onwards, Medicare will cover additional costs to further reduce cost-sharing, with beneficiary cost-sharing decreasing annually to reach 25% by 2020. Generic drugs will also see a reduction in cost-sharing, reaching 25% for beneficiaries by 2020. The Reconciliation Act in 2011 and 2012 reduces cost-sharing for brand-name drugs to 50% of the drug price, with Medicare covering additional costs to reach 25% by 2020. The Act also modifies the methodology for determining out-of-pocket expenditure amounts for years 2014-2019, reducing the growth rate for Part D enrollees. The CBO score is +$9.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and +$42.6 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3302 improves the determination of Part D Low-Income Benchmark Premium, with the federal government paying up to 100% of premiums for low-income subsidy beneficiaries enrolled in benchmark plans. The regional low-income premium subsidy amount for Medicare Advantage plans offering prescription drug coverage is calculated separately. MA plans can use rebate payments to lower the Part D premium, affecting the regional low-income benchmark. This may result in fewer plans qualifying as low-income plans, reducing options for LIS enrollees. Medicare Advantage rebate amounts are excluded from premium bids when calculating the low-income regional benchmark. Starting in 2011, a new policy allows Medicare Advantage plans to absorb small differences between their bids and the low-income subsidy benchmark to qualify as LIS-eligible plans. The Secretary can auto-enroll LIS beneficiaries into these plans to maintain choices. The CBO score is +$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014. The Secretary establishes the amount for financial assistance under the Part D low-income subsidy program. Beneficiaries must meet income and resource limits set by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. Eligibility is reviewed annually, and monitoring is done by the SSA or individual states for those who qualify for the subsidy. The SSA or individual states monitor eligibility for the Part D low-income subsidy program. Events like marriage, divorce, or death trigger a redetermination of subsidy eligibility, potentially leading to changes in deductible, premium, and subsidy status. The death of a spouse may affect the surviving spouse's eligibility, requiring a redetermination no earlier than one year after the next scheduled review. The death of a spouse may trigger a redetermination of subsidy eligibility for the surviving spouse, ensuring they receive assistance with premiums and cost sharing. The CBO score for this provision is +$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and +$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The provision requires beneficiaries to switch to new plans with bids at or below the benchmark amount to maintain premium subsidies. New plans may have different appeals processes and may not cover all current medications. LIS beneficiaries reassigned to a new plan must be informed of formulary differences and their rights. Funding is allocated for outreach and assistance for low-income individuals. Sec. 3306 extends funding for beneficiary outreach and education activities related to low-income Medicare programs, providing an additional $45 million for outreach and education activities. Funds will be allocated to various organizations for assistance with Medicare low-income assistance programs. Sec. 3307 expands outreach activities for disease prevention and wellness promotion using funds allocated through 2012. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, it improves formulary requirements for Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans. The Secretary protected access to certain drug classes by requiring Part D plans to cover all drugs in six specific categories. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 established criteria for identifying drugs that should be entirely covered by Part D plans. This provision of PPACA gives the Secretary authority to identify clinical drug classes. The PPACA provision gives the Secretary authority to identify classes of clinical concern for inclusion in PDP formularies, removing criteria specified in MIPPA. The provision is effective from the 2011 plan year, with a CBO score of $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, high-income beneficiaries are subject to higher Part D premiums starting in 2007. Beneficiaries with high income levels are required to pay higher premiums for Part B benefits, with thresholds starting at $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for joint returns. These thresholds are adjusted annually for inflation. Part D enrollees exceeding certain income thresholds also face increased premiums, following a similar process to Part B. The provision expands IRS authority to disclose income information to SSA for adjusting Part B and Part D subsidies. CBO scores show a negative impact on the budget. Cost-sharing for certain dual eligible individuals is eliminated, including full-subsidy eligibles with no deductible and minimal cost sharing. Full-benefit dual eligibles in medical institutions have no cost-sharing. This provision also eliminates cost sharing for drugs dispensed to beneficiaries under home and community-based waivers. The provision requires Part D plans to offer contracts to pharmacies for long-term care facilities, ensuring access to Medicare drug benefits for residents. Plan formularies must meet the needs of long-term care residents. Effective date specified by the Secretary, with a positive CBO score for FY2010-FY2019. Starting January 1, 2012, Part D sponsors must use utilization management techniques to reduce medication waste in long-term care facilities by dispensing smaller quantities per fill, such as weekly or daily doses. The CBO score for FY2010-FY2019 is -$5.7 billion. A centralized complaints system within CMS tracks and resolves Part D and MA-related complaints. The Secretary is required to develop a user-friendly system for handling complaints regarding MA and Part D plans or sponsors. The Secretary is required to develop a centralized complaints system within CMS to track and resolve Part D and MA-related complaints. This system includes a model electronic complaint form displayed on Medicare.gov and Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman websites. Annual reports will analyze the numbers and types of complaints, geographic variations, timeliness of responses, and resolution of complaints. The CBO score is $0.0. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Section 1852(g) of the Social Security Act outlines general requirements regarding Medicare Advantage exceptions and appeals processes. The Part D program adapted rules for appeals from the Medicare Advantage program. This provision mandates a uniform exceptions and appeals process for prescription drug plans and MA-PD plans, ensuring instant access through a toll-free number and website. The provision mandates instant access to a toll-free number and website for exceptions and appeals starting January 1, 2012. Full-benefit dual-eligible individuals not choosing a Part D plan will be auto-enrolled, potentially leading to suboptimal coverage. Part D plans were expected to negotiate price concessions with drug manufacturers to reduce costs, but studies suggest this may not be happening effectively. PPACA requires the Office of Inspector General of HHS to report annually on formularies used by prescription drug plans under Part D. A study comparing drug prices paid under Medicare Part D to those negotiated by state Medicaid plans is also required. The report must protect proprietary information and CBO scores estimate no cost impact for FY2010-FY2019. The CBO score estimates no cost impact for FY2010-FY2019 related to drug prices and including costs incurred by AIDS Drug Assistance Programs and Indian Health Service in providing prescription drugs towards the annual out-of-pocket threshold under Part D. Beneficiaries must reach a certain out-of-pocket cost level before catastrophic protection begins in a standard Medicare Part D plan design. True out-of-pocket costs include deductible, cost-sharing, and benefits not paid in the coverage gap, paid by the individual, a family member, a low-income individual under subsidy provisions, or a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program. Part D premiums do not count towards TrOOP. The provision allows costs paid by the Indian Health Service or under an AIDS Drug Assistance Program to count toward the out-of-pocket threshold for costs incurred on or after January 1, 2011. CBO estimates a positive impact on the budget for FY2010-FY2019. Immediate Reduction in Coverage Gap in 2010 was repealed. Improvement in Part D Medication Therapy Management Programs requires Part D sponsors to include MTM programs in their plan benefit structures. Improvement in Part D Medication Therapy Management Programs requires Part D sponsors to include MTM programs for targeted beneficiaries with multiple chronic diseases and taking multiple covered Part D drugs to optimize therapeutic outcomes and reduce adverse events. The program includes elements to promote understanding of medication use and adherence, developed in cooperation with pharmacists and physicians. Annual comprehensive medication reviews are required to be furnished in person or using telehealth technologies. The plan sponsor must provide comprehensive medication reviews in person or via telehealth for targeted beneficiaries with multiple chronic diseases and taking multiple covered Part D drugs. They must also conduct quarterly assessments of at-risk individuals not enrolled in the MTM program and automatically enroll eligible beneficiaries while allowing them to opt out. The Secretary of HHS has the authority to modify MTM program requirements and explore new models through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare providers receive predetermined payment amounts under different payment systems, with annual updates linked to changes in market basket indices. The PPACA provides updates based on market basket indices or the CPI-U for Medicare providers, with a productivity offset equal to the change in economy-wide productivity. This adjustment applies to inpatient hospital services and other providers subject to these updates. The PPACA provides updates for Medicare providers with a productivity adjustment starting in different years for various healthcare services. This may result in lower payment compared to the previous year for most providers. The PPACA introduces payment updates for Medicare providers, including acute care hospitals, long-term care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, inpatient psychiatric facilities, and outpatient hospitals. These updates involve reductions in the Medicare payment update factors for various services over multiple fiscal years. The Medicare payment update factors for various providers will be reduced over multiple fiscal years, starting in 2010. The reductions will vary by percentage points for hospital outpatient services, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and hospice care. The Medicare payment update factors for various providers will be reduced over multiple fiscal years, starting in 2010. Specifically, a 0.3 percentage point reduction to the MB will be contingent upon the level of the insured population relative to projections. The ESRD MB will no longer be subject to a 1 percentage point reduction beginning in 2012, but will be subject to productivity factor adjustments. Ambulance, ambulatory surgical, and laboratory services will also be subject to productivity adjustment factors. In CY2011, Medicare will implement a 1.75 percentage point reduction to the fee schedule update through CY2015, potentially resulting in a negative update. The productivity adjustment factor will be applied to the CPI-U, with certain durable medical equipment and prosthetic devices affected. In CY2011, a reduction will be applied to the fee schedule update for certain durable medical equipment and prosthetic devices. The productivity adjustment factor will also be applied to the CPI-U update for this DME category. Additionally, there will be a temporary adjustment to the calculation of Part B premiums in Medicare. Approximately 1.7 million higher-income beneficiaries face increasing premium shares based on income categories. Income thresholds for these shares are $85,000, $107,000, $160,000, and $214,000. The provision freezes income thresholds at 2010 levels from 2011 to 2019. The CBO score is -$7.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$25.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 3403 establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board to propose Medicare cost reductions to Congress and the President. The Independent Payment Advisory Board will develop proposals to reduce Medicare spending, focusing on payments to MA and PDP plans and reimbursement rates for providers. The Board consists of 15 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Proposals must meet specific savings targets and go into effect unless Congress intervenes. Membership terms are six years, and the first year for proposals to take effect is 2015. The Independent Payment Advisory Board consists of 15 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Members serve six-year staggered terms and may not serve more than 2 consecutive terms. Recommendations for appointees are made by the Senate Majority Leader, the Speaker of the House, the Senate Minority Leader, and the House Minority Leader. The President appoints a Chair for the Board with Senate consent, and the Board elects a Vice Chairman. Members can only be removed by the President for neglect of duty or malfeasance. Additionally, the Secretary of HHS, the Administrator of CMS, and the Administrator of HRSA serve as ex-officio, non-voting members. Qualifications for membership are similar to those required for other members of the Board. The Independent Payment Advisory Board consists of 15 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Members must meet qualifications similar to those required for members of the Medicare Payment Advisory Board. Individuals involved in healthcare services cannot constitute a majority of the Board, and members must disclose any conflicts of interest. Former members are barred from lobbying the Board and relevant agencies for one year. The Chair is responsible for the Board's executive and administrative functions. The Independent Payment Advisory Board is responsible for executive and administrative functions, including employee appointment and fund use. Proposals must be submitted to the President if Medicare spending growth exceeds a target rate, determined by the CMS Office of the Actuary. The first proposal is due by January 15, 2014, for implementation in 2015. If not submitted, the Secretary must provide a contingent proposal to Congress by January 25. The Independent Payment Advisory Board must submit proposals to Congress if Medicare spending growth exceeds target rates. Proposals aim to reduce spending by specific percentage points annually and cannot increase spending over a 10-year period. Starting in 2018, proposals are required only if spending growth exceeds GDP plus 1.0%. The Independent Payment Advisory Board must submit proposals to Congress if Medicare spending growth exceeds target rates. Proposals aim to reduce spending by specific percentage points annually and cannot increase Medicare spending over a 10-year period. The Board is required to prioritize recommendations that extend Medicare solvency, improve the health care delivery system, protect beneficiary access to care, and consider the effects of changes in provider payments. The Independent Payment Advisory Board must submit proposals to Congress to reduce Medicare spending growth. Recommendations should prioritize extending Medicare solvency, improving the healthcare delivery system, and protecting beneficiary access to care. Proposals should not target base beneficiary premiums or full premium subsidies for Part D plans. The Board is prohibited from making recommendations that ration care, raise revenues, increase beneficiary premiums, or restrict benefits. Recommendations must be submitted before December 2018 for implementation in 2020. The Independent Payment Advisory Board submits proposals to Congress to reduce Medicare spending growth, prioritizing extending Medicare solvency and protecting beneficiary access to care. Recommendations must be submitted before December 2018 for implementation in 2020. The Advisory Board's recommendations are to be submitted to the President and then to Congress, with automatic implementation unless Congress enacts legislation superseding the proposals by August 15 of the submission year. The provision establishes special \"fast track\" parliamentary procedures for congressional consideration of legislation implementing the Independent Payment Advisory Board's recommendations. These procedures ensure quick action by Congress on the Board's proposal, with specific timelines for introduction, committee referral, markup, and reporting. The expedited procedure for congressional consideration of legislation implementing the Independent Payment Advisory Board's recommendations includes waiving Senate Rule XV provisions and restricting changes to the Board's recommendations unless they meet specific criteria. This restriction applies to all legislation considered by Congress and can only be waived by a vote. The expedited procedure for congressional consideration of legislation implementing the Independent Payment Advisory Board's recommendations includes waiving Senate Rule XV provisions and restricting changes to the Board's recommendations. A three-fifths vote is required to waive this restriction. In the Senate, a motion to proceed to consider the legislation is privileged and not debatable. Amendments must be germane and may not reduce Medicare savings per capita growth below established targets. Senate debate on each amendment is limited, and overall consideration of the legislation may not exceed 30 hours. If there are bicameral differences, debate on any conference report or amendment exchange is limited to 10 hours. Senate debate on a veto message is limited to one hour. The provision establishes fast track procedures for House and Senate consideration of a joint resolution to discontinue the Independent Payment Advisory Board. It includes limiting debate and amendments, requiring a three-fifths majority for passage, and mandating implementation of the Board's recommendations by the Secretary. Beginning in 2019, any recommendation changing a provider's payment rate will take effect on the first day of the fiscal, calendar, or rate year after August 15th. The Secretary cannot implement the Board's recommendations if certain conditions are met, without affecting the Board's submission requirements to Congress. The Board must share draft proposals with MedPAC and the Secretary for review. Advisory functions begin in 2014 when the Board is not required to submit proposals. Beginning in 2014, the Board will submit advisory reports to Congress on Medicare program matters. These reports may include recommendations to improve payment systems for certain providers. Starting in 2015, the Board will also provide advisory recommendations to slow the growth rate of NHE. These recommendations cannot target federal health care program expenditures and must be coordinated with other Board proposals. Recommendations must be made public and can be implemented administratively or legislatively. The provision appropriates $15 million to the Board to carry out its functions starting in 2012, with annual increases based on inflation. Sixty percent of the funding will come from the Part A Medicare Trust Fund and 40% from the Part B Trust Fund. A consumer advisory council will be established to advise the Board on payment policies, with 10 consumer representatives appointed by the Comptroller General. The GAO will conduct a study on changes in Medicare policies resulting from the Board's actions. The Board's proposal under Medicare will be assessed for its impact on beneficiary access, affordability, and quality of care. The report is due by July 1, 2015, with additional studies to follow. The CBO score shows savings of $15.5 billion for FY2015-FY2019. Subtitle G ensures no reduction in Medicare benefits and mandates that savings be used to extend trust solvency. The savings achieved under the PPACA are intended to extend the solvency of the Medicare trust funds, reduce Medicare premiums and cost-sharing, improve guaranteed Medicare benefits, and protect access to Medicare providers. The provision ensures no cuts in guaranteed benefits for Medicare Advantage plans. Additionally, Medicare covers an annual wellness visit and personalized prevention plan. Medicare covers a one-time initial preventive physical examination (IPPE) within one year of Medicare Part B enrollment, which includes education, counseling, and referrals for preventive services. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force provides evidence-based recommendations for preventive services based on age, gender, and risk factors. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grades services as A, B, C, D, or I. Grades A or B are recommended, C has no recommendation, D is not recommended, and I indicates insufficient evidence. Medicare Part B covers personalized prevention plan services, including health risk assessments and preventive screenings, starting from January 1, 2011. The Medicare Part B covers personalized prevention plan services, including health risk assessments and preventive screenings. Beneficiaries are eligible for these services once a year without any cost-sharing. The Secretary is required to provide guidance and conduct outreach for these services. The CBO estimates the cost to be $1.4 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $3.6 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The provision in Section 1833 of the SSA waives coinsurance and deductibles for certain preventive services covered by Medicare, including colorectal cancer screening and personalized prevention plan services. Coverage remains subject to specific criteria for each service. The provision in Section 1833 of the SSA waives beneficiary coinsurance requirements for most preventive services covered by Medicare, including IPPE, personalized prevention plan services, and services recommended with a grade of A or B by the USPSTF. Medicare will cover 100% of the costs for these services and generally waive the deductible as well. The CBO score for this provision is $0.3 billion. Sec. 4105 authorizes the Secretary to modify coverage of preventive services consistent with USPSTF recommendations and withhold payment for services graded D. The provision does not apply to services for diagnosis or treatment. CBO scores are -$0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Subtitle C\u2014Creating Healthier Communities. Sec. 4202. Medicare Demonstration: Promotion of Healthy Lifestyles.

Sec. 5501 expands access to primary care and general surgery services through Medicare fee schedule reimbursements and bonuses for targeted activities. The Medicare fee schedule offers bonus payments for various activities, such as quality achievements and practicing in underserved areas. Physicians in designated health professional shortage areas can receive a 10% bonus payment under Section 1833(m) of the Social Security Act. Additionally, a new 10% bonus on select evaluation & management and general surgery codes was established for five years starting in 2011. The bonus applies to primary care service codes like office visits, nursing facility visits, and home visits. Eligible practitioners include physicians with specialty designations in family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine, as well as nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, or physician assistants. Practitioners providing major surgical procedures in health professional shortage areas are also eligible for a bonus. General surgeons in HPSAs can receive a 10% bonus on major surgical procedure codes for a five-year period starting in 2011. RVUs will be adjusted accordingly. The review and adjustment of RVUs will be modified for incentives, with only half of bonus costs considered for budget neutrality calculations. An across-the-board reduction to all codes will be implemented through a conversion factor adjustment, except for physicians in health professional shortage areas. The CBO score is $2.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $3.5 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Development and Implementation of Prospective Payment System for FQHCs will be carried out. FQHC services, certified as meeting requirements, receive cost-based reimbursement from Medicare for various healthcare services. Medicare pays FQHCs on an interim basis using an all-inclusive rate for each visit, with certain exceptions. The final payment rate for FQHC services is calculated based on total allowable costs divided by total visits, subject to payment limits. Urban FQHCs have a per-visit limit of $119.29, while rural FQHCs have a limit of $102.58. Starting January 1, 2011, FQHC services will include Medicare's definition of preventive services. The Secretary will develop a prospective payment system for FQHC services, with payment rates based on specific codes and data submission required by January 1, 2011. The new payment system will be established for cost reporting periods starting on or after October 1, 2014, with initial payments equal to 100% of reasonable costs. The prospective payment system for FQHC services will be implemented with payment rates based on specific codes. Payments will be increased by the MEI or a MB promulgated by regulations in subsequent years. FQHCs that contract with MA plans will receive payments under the new PPS. Medicare's payments for FQHC services will no longer be subject to reasonableness tests. Physicians are generally prohibited from referring Medicare patients for certain services to facilities in which they have financial interests, but there are exceptions for whole hospitals. Physician-owned hospitals meeting specific requirements will be exempt from the prohibition on self-referral. The hospital must adhere to limitations on service capacity expansion, conflicts of interest, investments, and patient safety. Exempt hospitals meeting requirements cannot increase operating rooms, procedure rooms, or beds post-enactment. A process allows certain hospitals to expand by Feb 1, 2011, with applications every two years, limited to the main campus. No review is allowed, and the Secretary must ensure compliance with these regulations. Beginning on the effective date, hospitals will undergo unannounced site reviews to ensure compliance with regulations. Audits must start by May 1, 2012. The CBO score is -$0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.5 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 6002 requires manufacturers to report payments to physicians or teaching hospitals annually. Certain transactions below $10 are excluded unless the total exceeds $100. The provision requires manufacturers to report payments to physicians or teaching hospitals annually, with certain transactions excluded unless the total exceeds $100. Penalties apply for failure to submit reports to the Secretary, who must establish procedures for public availability of the information. The section amends the Social Security Act to allow physician referrals for certain imaging services, with the requirement for the referring physician to inform the individual in writing about other options for obtaining the services. The provision requires referring physicians to inform individuals about alternative suppliers for services and mandates drug manufacturers to report drug sample requests and distributions to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The provision mandates drug manufacturers to report drug sample requests and distributions to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including information requested by the Secretary. Applicable drugs are those available by prescription and covered under Medicare or Medicaid. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) administer drug benefit programs and may receive rebates from drug manufacturers for placing drugs on their formulary. This provision requires PBMs managing prescription drug coverage to meet transparency requirements. The provision mandates Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) to disclose financial information to the Secretary of HHS, Medicare Part D plans, or exchanges. This includes information on prescription distribution, generic dispensing rates, rebates negotiated, and passed through amounts. The provision mandates Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) to disclose financial information to the Secretary of HHS, Medicare Part D plans, or exchanges, including details on prescription distribution, generic dispensing rates, rebates negotiated, and passed through amounts. The CBO score for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019 is $0.0 billion. Patient-Centered Outcomes Research aims to provide credible information on clinical strategies' effectiveness. Comparative effectiveness research, also known as patient-centered outcomes research, compares the benefits and harms of different methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor clinical conditions. It aims to tailor decisions to individual patient needs and has been addressed in current law by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The PPACA modifies Title XI of the Social Security Act to add a Part D, Comparative Clinical Effectiveness Research after sections on General Provisions, Peer Review, and Administrative Simplification. It authorizes the establishment of a private, non-profit, tax-exempt organization for research on outcomes, comparative clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness of healthcare services. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute is established as a private, non-profit corporation to conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research. Its purpose is to assist patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakers in making informed health decisions by advancing evidence synthesis and dissemination of research findings. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute is tasked with identifying research priorities, conducting research projects, collecting relevant data, appointing expert panels, supporting patient representatives, and releasing research findings. It must also adopt national priorities, methodological standards, and submit an annual report to Congress and the President. The provision establishes a Board of Governors for the Institute, consisting of Directors of AHRQ and the NIH, along with 17 members appointed by the Comptroller General representing various stakeholders. It includes limitations on the use of CCER, specifying that the Institute cannot mandate coverage or reimbursement policies. The provision establishes a Board of Governors for the Institute, consisting of Directors of AHRQ and the NIH, along with 17 members appointed by the Comptroller General representing various stakeholders. It includes limitations on the use of CCER, specifying that the Institute cannot mandate coverage or reimbursement policies. The Secretary could only use evidence and findings from CCER to make a Medicare coverage determination if the process is iterative and transparent, includes public comment, and considers the effect on subpopulations. CCER is not to supersede or modify Medicare coverage deemed reasonable and necessary, nor authorize the denial of coverage based solely on comparative clinical effectiveness research. The Secretary is prohibited from using CCER evidence and findings in determining Medicare coverage, reimbursement, or incentives. The provision prohibits the use of CCER evidence in Medicare coverage decisions that devalue extending the life of elderly, disabled, or terminally ill individuals. It also prevents the development of measures that discount the value of life based on disability for determining cost-effective care under Medicare. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) is created to fund the Institute's activities, with funding coming from the general Treasury fund, Medicare Trust Funds, and fees on health insurance and self-insured plans. Appropriations from Treasury will be $10 million, $50 million, and $150 million in 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively. Starting in 2013, the PCORTF will also be financed by fees on health insurance and self-insured health plans, with transfers from Medicare funds based on total expenditures. In FY2013, the fee for health insurance policies will be $1 per individual under Medicare Parts A or B. From FY2014 to FY2019, the fee will be $2 per individual, adjusted for healthcare spending increases. A transfer of $150 million from the Treasury is required, along with net revenues from the fees. The fee will sunset after FY2019. The CBO score is $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Subtitle E\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Program Integrity Provisions Sec. 6401 as modified by Sec. 10603 of PPACA, and Sec. 1304 of the Reconciliation Act. Provider Screening and Other Enrollment Requirements Under Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. CMS has implemented regulations requiring providers and suppliers to complete an application to enroll in the Medicare program and receive billing privileges. Providers and suppliers must resubmit and recertify the accuracy of their enrollment information every five years. The Secretary must establish procedures for enrolling providers in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs, including provider screening, enhanced oversight, disclosure requirements, moratoriums on enrollment, and compliance programs. Screening procedures will be developed within six months, with checks for licensure and additional measures like criminal background checks and site visits as needed. The Secretary will implement screening measures for providers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs, including unannounced site visits and database checks. Institutional providers will be charged fees starting at $500 in 2010, increasing annually with inflation. Fees collected will fund program integrity efforts. Providers must be screened within three years to participate in the programs. Enhanced oversight procedures, such as prepayment review, will be established. The provision establishes procedures for enhanced oversight on new providers and suppliers, including prepayment review and payment caps. The Secretary can impose a 30-day to one-year period of enhanced oversight. Starting January 1, 2011, a 90-day enhanced oversight period will be required for DME suppliers at high risk of fraud. The Secretary can also impose temporary moratoriums on enrolling new providers and suppliers to combat fraud. New disclosure requirements are imposed on providers and suppliers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP. Applicants must disclose affiliations with providers or suppliers with uncollected debt or payment suspensions. The provision requires Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP providers and suppliers to establish compliance programs to prevent fraud and abuse. The Secretary can adjust payments or deny enrollment for those posing a risk to the programs. Enhanced oversight procedures for new providers and suppliers include prepayment review and payment caps. Data matching for claims and payment data is part of the enhanced integrity provisions. The provision requires CMS to consolidate claims and payment data for Medicare, Medicaid, and other health-related programs into an Integrated Data Repository (IDR). The goal is to support an integrated data warehouse containing data related to beneficiaries, providers, and health plans. Data sharing agreements with federal agencies are required for integration. The Secretary must enter data sharing agreements with federal agencies to identify fraud, waste, and abuse. The OIG and DOJ have access to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment data for law enforcement activities. The OIG has authority to obtain information from individuals and entities providing medical services under Federal health care programs. The PPACA mandates that federal agencies have access to Medicare Part D data for health oversight activities. Beneficiaries participating in health care fraud schemes face penalties. Overpayments must be repaid to CMS within 30 days to avoid interest and collection actions. Under the PPACA, individuals must report and return overpayments within 60 days to avoid penalties. Health care providers are required to use a National Provider Identifier (NPI) for billing. The Secretary mandated that all Medicare and Medicaid providers include their NPI on claims and enrollment applications by January 1, 2011. HHS OIG has the authority to exclude providers from participation. Exclusions and Civil Monetary Penalties. HHS OIG can exclude health care providers from federal programs for false statements. CMPs of up to $10,000 can be imposed for each false claim. Applies to MA plans, PDPs, and Medicaid managed care plans. The section discusses Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) for false claims in federal health care programs, with penalties of up to $10,000 per claim and up to three times the amount claimed. It also includes penalties for individuals excluded from federal health care programs who order or prescribe items, make false statements, or fail to return overpayments. Additionally, it addresses the federal anti-kickback statute, making it a felony to offer or receive anything of value in return for referrals. The federal False Claims Act (FCA) imposes penalties for submitting false claims or engaging in improper activities involving federal government money. Penalties include treble damages and additional fines for each false claim filed. The PPACA amends section 1128B to include violations as false claims subject to FCA penalties. Section 6402(f)(2) of PPACA amends section 1128B to specify that intent requirements do not necessitate actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation. HHS OIG can impose penalties on those engaging in improper conduct with federal health care programs, including offering remuneration to influence Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. The federal anti-kickback statute, Section 1128B(b), allows for penalties under section 1128A for violations related to remuneration offered, paid, solicited, or received. PPACA amends the definition of \"remuneration\" to exclude certain items or services that promote access to care and pose low risk, as well as waivers of copayment amounts. The Secretary can waive copayment amounts for the first fill of a generic drug for individuals enrolled in a prescription drug plan or MA-PD drug plan. The testimonial subpoena authority allows the Secretary to issue subpoenas and require witness testimony and evidence related to investigations. The Secretary can delegate this authority to the OIG and CMS Administrator for program exclusion purposes. The Secretary has the authority to require surety bonds from DME suppliers and home health agencies to bill Medicare. DME suppliers need a $50,000 bond, while home health agencies need a bond equal to 10% of payments or $50,000. The bond for home health agencies is effective for four years. This provision allows the Secretary to set bond requirements based on billing volume. The Secretary can require surety bonds from DME suppliers and home health agencies to bill Medicare, with bonds based on billing volume. The value of the bond cannot be less than $50,000. CMS can withhold payment if there is evidence of overpayment or fraud, with the Secretary having the authority to suspend payments pending fraud investigations. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account funds programs to combat healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse. Established by HIPAA, it finances investigative and enforcement activities by HHS, OIG, DOJ, and FBI, as well as the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) for program integrity activities by CMS contractors. Congress extended funding for the HCFAC program until 2010 through the Tax Relief and Health Care Act. The HCFAC program received additional funding of $10 million annually from 2011 to 2020, with funds allocated in the same proportion as in FY2010. The CPI adjustment was permanently applied to the HCFAC program and added to the MIP program starting in 2011. Sec. 1303 of the Reconciliation Act also provided extra funding for the HCFAC program from 2011 to 2016, totaling $95 million for FY2011, $55 million for FY2012, $30 million for FY2013 and FY2014, and $20 million for FY2015 and FY2016. The Integrity Program (MIP) under CMS contracts private entities to protect Medicare from fraud, waste, and abuse through auditing, recovery of improper payments, provider education, and data matching. MIP contractors must report performance statistics to the Secretary and OIG, including overpayments recovered, fraud referrals, and ROI. The Secretary evaluates entities every three years and submits reports to Congress on MIP fund use and effectiveness. CBO scores estimate savings of -$1.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$2.9 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 10330 requires the Secretary to develop a plan and budget to modernize CMS computer and data systems to improve care delivery. The plan must ensure timely data availability to providers, support care coordination, and evaluate payment and delivery system reforms. The Secretary must post the plan on the CMS website within 9 months. CBO scores estimate no cost impact for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. The HIPAA of 1996 mandated the creation of the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) for reporting adverse actions against healthcare providers, including civil judgments, criminal convictions, licensing agency actions, and exclusions from Medicare and Medicaid. Only final adverse actions are reportable, while settlements without established liability are not. Administrative fines and certain personnel actions are also not reportable. The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) was established by Congress with the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 to collect data on the professional competence of healthcare practitioners. It includes information on medical malpractice payments, adverse licensure actions, professional society actions, and exclusions from Medicare and Medicaid. Reporting requirements for the NPDB were expanded by Section 1921 of the SSA to include additional adverse licensure actions and actions by State licensing agencies, peer review organizations, and accreditation organizations. States are mandated to report adverse actions to the NPDB. The provision requires the Secretary to maintain a national health care fraud and abuse data collection program for reporting final adverse actions against health care providers to the NPDB. States must also report information on final adverse actions. The Secretary will transfer all information from the HIPDB to the NPDB within one year, eliminating the HIPDB. Fees may be established for information disclosure. The provision requires the Secretary to transfer data from the HIPDB to the NPDB, eliminating the HIPDB. The maximum period for submission of Medicare claims is reduced to not more than 12 months. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The CBO score for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019 is $0.0 billion. Physicians must certify specified services to receive payment from Medicare, including inpatient psychiatric services, post-hospital extended care services, and home health services. Certification for home health services includes the individual being confined to home, needing skilled nursing care or therapy, having a plan for services, and receiving care under a physician. The provision requires physicians to communicate a written order for items and services to suppliers for payment. Physicians ordering DME or HH services must be enrolled in Medicare. The Secretary can extend these requirements to other Medicare items if it helps reduce fraud. CBO scores are -$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.4 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 6406 mandates physicians to provide documentation on referrals to high-risk programs. OIG has the authority to exclude entities or individuals from federal health programs for various reasons, including failure to provide documentation. Beginning January 1, 2010, the Secretary has the authority to disenroll Medicare enrolled physicians or suppliers who fail to provide documentation for payment for DME, home health services, or referrals. The provision also allows the OIG to exclude individuals or entities that fail to provide adequate documentation for ordered health care services. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 6407 requires a face-to-face encounter with the patient before physicians can certify eligibility for home health services or durable medical equipment. Physicians must certify eligibility for home health services or durable medical equipment under Medicare. For home health services, physicians need to certify that the individual was confined to their home and required skilled nursing care or therapy, a plan was established, and services were provided under a physician's care. For DME, payment can only be made if a physician has given a written order to the supplier. Physicians must have a face-to-face encounter with the individual prior to certifying eligibility for home health services or durable medical equipment under Medicare. This requirement applies to both home health services and DME, with specific documentation needed for each type of service. The Secretary can extend the face-to-face encounter requirement to other Medicare services to reduce fraud. Eligible professionals include nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants. Enhanced penalties for improper conduct in federal health care programs are outlined in the PPACA. The PPACA mandates civil monetary penalties for fraudulent claims and failure to grant timely access to the OIG. MA plans can face sanctions for violations such as not providing necessary care or imposing excess premiums. The PPACA mandates civil monetary penalties for fraudulent claims and failure to grant timely access to the OIG. It increases the number of violations subject to sanctions and CMPs by the Secretary for MA and Part D plans. Plans can face sanctions for enrolling individuals without consent, transferring for commissions, marketing violations, or misrepresenting information. Penalties are enhanced for misrepresentation or falsification of information. These new penalties apply to acts committed on or after January 1, 2010.

The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 6409. Medicare Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol. In 1998, the HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS OIG) issued a Self-Disclosure Protocol (SDP), which includes a process under which a health care provider can voluntarily self-disclose evidence of potential fraud, in an effort, to avoid the costs or disruptions that may be associated with an investigation or litigation. On March 24, 2009, HHS OIG issued an \"Open Letter to Health Care Providers\" that makes refinements to the SDP. In the Open Letter, HHS OIG announced that it would no longer accept disclosure of a matter that involves only liability under the physician self-referral law in \"the absence of a colorable anti-kickback statute violation.\" Further, for anti-kickback-related submissions accepted into the SDP following the date of the letter, HHS OIG The Secretary, in cooperation with the OIG, must establish a self-referral disclosure protocol (SRDP) for healthcare providers to disclose violations of the physician self-referral law. A minimum $50,000 settlement is required for anti-kickback-related submissions accepted into the SDP. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, adjustments to the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies Competitive Acquisition Program are required. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) required the establishment of a Competitive Acquisition Program for medical equipment in certain areas to replace the fee schedule. The program was phased-in starting in 2009 in nine metropolitan areas, expanding to 70 areas in 2011, and further expanding to 91 areas under the PPACA. The program is to be extended to all areas by 2016. The CBO score is -$0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$1.4 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Program is expanded to identify and collect improper payments in Medicare Parts A and B. The Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Program was established by Congress to identify and collect improper payments in Medicare Parts A and B. Initially a three-year demonstration program, it was made permanent in 2006 and expanded nationwide by 2010. Unlike other administrative contractors, RACs are paid using contingency fees based on recovered overpayments. The Secretary was required to enter into contracts with RACs for Medicare Part C and D activities by December 31, 2010. The Secretary was required to enter into contracts with RACs for Medicare Part C and D activities by December 31, 2010. The requirements for Part C and D RACs include ensuring anti-fraud plans for MA or PDP plans, reviewing reinsurance payments of Part D plans, and comparing enrollment estimates for high-cost beneficiaries. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 10606 of the PPACA contains provisions related to health care fraud enforcement, including requiring the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and amend federal sentencing guidelines for health care offenses. Certain criminal offenses are deemed federal health care fraud offenses under the U.S. Criminal Code. The new federal health care offenses, including the federal anti-kickback statute, are defined under the U.S. Criminal Code. Convictions for violations of these offenses may result in longer prison terms and higher fines. This section also amends certain subpoena authority relating to health care, such as the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. The Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) allows the Attorney General to subpoena institutions under investigation to protect residents' rights. The information obtained cannot be used for other purposes. The cost estimate for FY2010-FY2019 is $0.0 billion. Additionally, the Reconciliation Act addresses requirements for Community Mental Health Centers to receive Medicare payments. The Reconciliation Act outlines requirements for Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) to receive Medicare payments, including providing core mental health services, being licensed in the operating state, and serving at least 40% of services to non-Medicare eligible individuals. Medicare reimbursement for mental health services in certain settings is restricted, and Medicare contractors can conduct prepayment medical reviews to prevent improper payments and fraud. The Reconciliation Act removes limitations on prepayment review of provider claims and imposes additional taxes on high-income workers for Medicare financing. The Reconciliation Act imposes additional taxes on high-income workers for Medicare financing, including a 0.9% tax on wages exceeding $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for joint filers. Self-employed individuals with incomes above these thresholds are also subject to the tax, which cannot be deducted as a business expense. Additionally, a tax on net investment income is levied on interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, rents, and taxable net capital gains, excluding distributions from qualified annuities from pension plans. The Reconciliation Act imposes a 3.8% tax on net investment income for taxable years after December 31, 2012, applicable to MAGI over $250,000 for joint filers. The tax also applies to income from estates and trusts, but not to active income from trade for self-employed and S-corporations. JCT estimates the provision will increase revenues by $38.3 billion during FY2010-FY2014 and $210.2 billion during FY2010-FY2019. Implementation Timeline of Medicare Provisions in PPACA is provided in chronological order, including start dates, effective dates, and deadlines for changes established by PPACA. Modifications by the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010 are also noted. Specific details such as frequency, duration, and end dates are included, with provisions lacking specific requirements presented separately.
