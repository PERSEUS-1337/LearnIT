The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to allow the Secretary to enter contracts for interim consolidated storage of high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel with licensed facilities. High-level radioactive waste includes Greater than Class C waste, but this does not require disposal in a repository. The Secretary can enter contracts with waste holders for storage at an interim facility, prioritizing waste from sites without operating reactors. Contracts ensure the Secretary's responsibility for waste disposal is fulfilled upon acceptance at the storage facility. The Secretary can enter contracts with waste holders for storage at an interim facility without requiring settlement of claims against the United States for breach of contract. Delivery of waste to the facility transfers title to the Secretary. Amendments allow storage in an interim consolidated facility or monitored retrievable site.
