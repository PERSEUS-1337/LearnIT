    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Health Insurance Tax Credit Assistance Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to health insurance. Congress finds that health care spending in the United States is rapidly increasing, with Medicare and Medicaid costs projected to grow even faster. More Americans with health insurance are facing higher out-of-pocket expenses, leading to a rise in uninsured or underinsured citizens, many of whom have chronic conditions. Many uninsured nonelderly adults with chronic conditions struggle with rising healthcare costs, often forgoing necessary medical care or prescriptions. Families with loved ones requiring expensive treatments face challenges balancing income thresholds for public assistance and high private insurance costs. Nonprofit organizations are developing financial assistance programs to address these issues. Patient assistance organizations (PAOs) provide financial assistance for patients with expensive chronic illnesses to access treatment and therapies, preventing them from depleting resources to qualify for public assistance programs. The Federal Government should reduce costs to public programs like Medicaid by incentivizing beneficiaries to enter the workforce and participate in the private health market. The Federal Government could encourage citizens to donate to qualified Patient Assistance Organizations (PAOs) through targeted tax credits. This tax credit helps transition patients off public programs like Medicaid, lifts them out of poverty, and enables them to access health insurance coverage. Additionally, the tax credit contributes to PAOs covering expenses not included in Medicare part D for disabled and senior citizens, ultimately addressing concerns about uninsured and underinsured citizens. The curr_chunk discusses the impact on uninsured and underinsured citizens, treatment for Medicare beneficiaries in the \"doughnut hole,\" and cost savings for Medicaid. The curr_chunk introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code offering a credit for contributions to private charities providing health insurance premium and drug copayment assistance to the uninsured and underinsured. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows individuals to receive a tax credit for qualified charitable contributions made to certified charities providing health insurance premium and drug copayment assistance to the uninsured and underinsured. The credit is limited to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for joint returns, with qualified charitable contributions defined as cash donations to organizations described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows tax credits for charitable contributions to organizations assisting uninsured individuals with health insurance premiums and drug copayments. Organizations must primarily subsidize these costs to qualify for the deduction. No double benefits are allowed for contributions. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows tax credits for charitable contributions to organizations assisting uninsured individuals with health insurance premiums and drug copayments. Contributions for which a deduction or credit is allowed under subsection (a) are not eligible for the credit. Taxpayers can elect to not have this section apply to their contribution. Tax credits for contributions to the chronically ill uninsured and underinsured will apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
