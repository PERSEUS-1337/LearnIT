    "content": "The livestock and poultry industries have a contentious relationship with animal protection groups, particularly regarding the treatment of laying hens in cages. The United Egg Producers (UEP) has faced criticism for their cage systems, with calls for cage-free egg production. In a surprising move in July 2011, UEP announced a partnership with the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) to advocate for federal legislation regulating table egg production. The UEP and HSUS agreement in 2011 aimed to regulate U.S. table egg production, including setting cage sizes and labeling requirements. Legislation was proposed in 2012 and 2013 to establish federal cage standards, but no action was taken. The bills aim to establish national cage size requirements for table egg-laying hen housing over a 15- to 16-year phase-in period, along with labeling requirements and standards for air quality, molting, and euthanasia. While supported by UEP and various groups, some agricultural producers and animal protection groups oppose the legislation. The Egg Products Inspection Act Amendments of 2013 (S. 820 and H.R. 1731) aim to establish national cage size requirements for table egg-laying hen housing over a 15- to 16-year phase-in period. The bills also include labeling requirements, air quality standards, molting regulations, and euthanasia guidelines for laying hens. The egg legislation in 2013 was a topic of debate among industry groups and lawmakers. While UEP supported addressing it in the farm bill, other livestock groups strongly opposed it. Despite considerations to include the egg bill in the farm bill, it was ultimately not included in the committee draft or considered during the Senate Agriculture Committee markup. Senator Feinstein submitted the egg bill as an amendment during the Senate farm bill debate, but it was not taken up for consideration. During the House Agriculture Committee markup of the 2013 farm bill, Representative King's Protect Interstate Commerce Act (PICA) amendment was agreed to on a voice vote. PICA aimed to prevent states from imposing standards on agricultural products sold in interstate commerce that exceed federal and state laws where the products are produced. It would have impacted laws like California's ban on cage-produced eggs sold after January 1, 2015. The King amendment, included in the House version of the farm bill, aimed to prevent states from imposing standards on agricultural products sold in interstate commerce that exceed federal and state laws. Representative Denham's amendment to exempt some states and state standards failed, and the Rules Committee rejected his proposal to replace a section of the bill with the text of the egg bill. The Senate farm bill did not have a similar provision, and the farm bill conference committee considered the King amendment. The farm bill conference committee, starting on October 30, 2013, did not include the King amendment in the conference report (H.Rept. 113-333) to H.R. 2642 released on January 27, 2014. H.R. 3798, the Egg Products Inspection Act Amendments of 2012, was introduced in the House by Representative Schrader on January 23, 2012, but no further action was taken. A companion bill, S. 3239, was introduced by Senator Feinstein on May 24, 2012. 153 cosponsors signed on to H.R. 3798 and 19 Senate cosponsors signed on to S. 3239 during the 112th Congress. Senator Feinstein offered S.Amdt. 2252 before the Senate floor debate on the omnibus 2012 farm bill (S. 3240) to insert the language from S. 3239. Feinstein offered S.Amdt. 2252 to insert language from S. 3239 into the Senate farm bill, but the amendment was not considered during the floor debate. The Senate Agriculture Committee later held a hearing on S. 3239 with testimony from Senator Feinstein and four egg producers. Three producers supported the bill while one opposed it. In the House, no amendment was offered to include the language of H.R. 3798 in the farm bill, but Representative King introduced the Protect Interstate Commerce Act (PICA) to protect the commerce clause. The Protect Interstate Commerce Act (PICA) was designed to protect the U.S. Constitution's commerce clause and prevent states like California from imposing their standards on national trade. The amendment, supported by Representative King, aimed to prevent a patchwork of state laws from setting agricultural production standards and ensure the free interstate movement of agricultural products. Livestock groups such as the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the National Pork Producers Council supported the amendment. Opponents of the King amendment argued that it undermined state voters' rights and would preempt hundreds of state laws related to animal welfare, environment, public health, and labor. Despite some uncertainty, the King amendment was not included in the Agricultural Act of 2014. In 2014, Missouri challenged the legality of California's egg law in court. Other states, large egg producers, were expected to join the lawsuit. U.S. egg farmers produced 79 billion table eggs in 2011, with most production coming from flocks of 30,000 birds or larger. Egg productivity has increased by about 1% annually over the past decade. In 2011, U.S. egg production totaled $7.4 billion, with Iowa leading in table egg production followed by Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. California, Texas, and Michigan are midsize producers, while Minnesota, Florida, and Nebraska are at the bottom of the top 10 egg-producing states. The top 10 states account for 70% of egg production. The top 10 egg-producing states in the US account for 70% of the total table-egg-laying flock, with an estimated 95% of all eggs produced in conventional cage systems. These cages typically provide each laying hen an average of 67 square inches of floor space. Egg producers adopted conventional cage systems in the 1950s for disease reduction and cleaner eggs. These systems were economically efficient and allowed for more hens in less space. However, they have faced criticism for poor welfare. Only 5% of eggs come from cage-free or free-range systems, with two types of cage-free systems - floor and aviary. Free-range systems are similar to cage-free but hens have outdoor access. Enriched cage systems, developed in the 1980s in Europe, offer larger living spaces with perches and nesting boxes for laying hens to express natural behaviors. The United Egg Producers (UEP) is the largest U.S. egg producer group, representing 90% to 95% of all egg-laying hens in the country. UEP members utilize various production systems, including conventional cage, enriched cage, cage-free, free-range, and organic systems. The United Egg Producers (UEP) leads in legislative and regulatory affairs for egg products. UEP Certified program sets welfare standards for laying hens, requiring 67-86 square inches of floor space and adherence to various flock management practices. Producers must follow guidelines on beak trimming, molting, handling, euthanasia, bio-security, and public trust to market eggs as UEP Certified. Annual audits ensure compliance with UEP Certified guidelines. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) is the largest animal protection organization in the US, with a mission to fight animal cruelty and exploitation. They conduct campaigns against various forms of animal abuse, including advocating for cage-free egg production systems. HSUS has been active in campaigns against cruelty in dog fighting, puppy mills, wildlife protection, and farm animal confinement. HSUS has been actively campaigning for improved conditions for laying hens, working with various entities to change laws and practices. They have successfully influenced Burger King to switch to cage-free eggs by 2017 and have pursued ballot initiatives in states to improve farm animal welfare laws. Notably, they were successful in the 2008 California ballot initiative to ban the use of cages for laying hens by 2015. In 2011, UEP and HSUS agreed to work together to change egg-laying hen production conditions in the US. The agreement included provisions to phase out conventional cages, replace them with enriched cage systems, and mandate labeling on egg cartons to inform consumers about the housing method used. The agreement between UEP and HSUS in 2011 aimed to improve egg-laying hen welfare by phasing out conventional cages, mandating enriched cage systems, and labeling egg cartons nationwide. This marked a significant shift for both organizations, as they had been adversaries over cage systems for years. The HSUS and UEP agreement in 2011 required all U.S. egg producers to end conventional cage use and meet production standards. HSUS agreed to suspend ballot initiatives, not support litigation, and work towards federal farm animal welfare legislation. The UEP and HSUS agreement in 2011 led to negotiations on enriched cages for the U.S. egg industry instead of cage-free standards. Wayne Pacelle, HSUS president, visited EU egg farms with enriched cage systems, influencing consideration in the U.S. Both sides wanted to avoid costly state battles over caged eggs. The agreement was reached through votes by UEP's executive committee, not unanimously. The Egg Products Inspection Act Amendments of 2013 were introduced in Congress on April 25, 2013. The bills introduced in 2013 (S. 820 and H.R. 1731) amend the Egg Products Inspection Act by adding cage size and production requirements for shell eggs. They reflect an agreement between UEP and HSUS to establish national cage size standards for egg-laying hens. The bills also include labeling requirements, air quality standards, and treatment standards. Differences from previous bills include more detailed provisions for California egg producers, setting deadlines for enrichments and floor space requirements based on cage type. The legislation introduced in 2013 (S. 820 and H.R. 1731) includes cage size and production requirements for shell eggs, with a phase-in period for California. Eggs bought or sold in California must meet the state's requirements, and there are provisions to protect California egg producers from out-of-state competition. The bills also allow for excess ammonia levels under special circumstances and include exemptions for educational and research institutes and cages with one egg-laying hen. The legislation introduced in 2013 (S. 820 and H.R. 1731) includes cage size and production requirements for shell eggs, with a phase-in period for California. The bills would prohibit the commercial buying and selling of shell eggs and egg products from laying hens that are not raised according to the new housing requirements. Cages used to house egg-laying hens must include environmental enrichments, such as perch spaces, dusting or scratching areas, and nesting areas, based on the best available science at the time the regulations are defined. The legislation (S. 820 and H.R. 1731) introduced in 2013 includes cage size and production requirements for shell eggs, with a phase-in period for California. Environmental enrichments for new cages must be in place within 9 years of enactment, and for existing cages within 15 years. Minimum floor space requirements for existing and new cages are set, with a phase-in period for egg farmers to provide more space for laying hens. The legislation (S. 820 and H.R. 1731) introduced in 2013 includes cage size and production requirements for shell eggs. For California, cages would need to have 116 square inches for white hens and 134 square inches for brown hens from 2015 to 2023, reaching the national standard of 124 and 144 square inches by 2024. Environmental enrichments and floor space measures would also be required for egg producers within two years of enactment. The legislation (S. 820 and H.R. 1731) introduced in 2013 includes requirements for egg producers to maintain low levels of ammonia in egg-laying houses, not withhold feed or water from laying hens, and follow AVMA guidelines for euthanasia. USDA has the authority to inspect egg imports, which must meet standards set by the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA). This could potentially become a trade issue. The legislation (S. 820 and H.R. 1731) sets benchmarks for the egg-laying industry to transition to new enriched cage systems, aiming for at least 25% of hens in cages with specified square inches within six years. This could potentially become a trade issue if foreign egg imports must meet U.S. production standards. The legislation sets benchmarks for transitioning commercial egg-laying hens to new cage systems with specified square inches of floor space and environmental enrichments by December 31, 2029. California has different phase-in periods, with all cages required to provide the specified space after 10 years. The legislation sets benchmarks for transitioning commercial egg-laying hens to new cage systems with specified square inches of floor space and environmental enrichments by December 31, 2029. If targets are not met, existing conventional cage systems must meet new requirements starting January 1, 2020. California has different phase-in periods, with all cages required to provide the specified space after 10 years. Compliance reports must be submitted to Congress, and housing labels on egg products will be required. The legislation mandates new housing requirements for commercial egg-laying hens by December 31, 2029, with specific square inches of floor space and environmental enrichments. USDA will be responsible for ensuring proper labeling of egg products based on the method of housing. Six exemptions are provided in the bill, and the housing label requirement will take effect one year after the bill is enacted. The bill mandates new housing requirements for commercial egg-laying hens by December 31, 2029, with specific floor space and environmental enrichments. Six exemptions are provided, including for egg farmers who installed new cages between 2008 and 2011, small egg producers, and educational institutions. Agricultural, veterinary, consumer, and animal protection groups endorse the provisions. Support for H.R. 3798 and S. 3239 came from various groups, including egg farmers, family farms in over 30 states, and the American Veterinary Medical Association. Consumer surveys showed strong support for transitioning from conventional cages to enriched cages, with a majority in favor of federal legislation. Respondents overwhelmingly support federal legislation for egg production standards, with public perception shifting away from conventional cages. The UEP-HSUS agreement aims to rebuild trust in egg producers. However, groups like NCBA and NPPC strongly oppose the legislation, citing concerns about mandated on-farm production standards and a one-size-fits-all approach. In a letter to the House Agriculture Committee, farm groups expressed opposition to legislation resulting from the UEP-HSUS agreement. Some animal welfare groups endorsed enriched cages, but others opposed H.R. 3798 and S. 3239, arguing that enriched cages still harm laying-hen welfare. The Humane Farming Association is leading a campaign against the legislation, stating it could nullify state laws, take away citizens' voting rights, and prevent state legislatures from passing hen protection laws. UEP and supporters argue that the legislation is necessary for the egg industry. The egg legislation is seen as crucial for the egg industry to avoid costly battles over production methods. Supporters believe a national standard is necessary for sustainable, family-owned businesses to control their destiny. Opponents fear federal legislation could have negative consequences for all livestock producers, especially small egg farmers. The UEP acknowledges the high costs associated with federally mandated production standards. UEP recognizes the need for federally mandated production methods to avoid costly battles over inconsistent state standards in the egg industry. California and Michigan have enacted legislation requiring egg producers to abandon cage production by 2015 and 2019, potentially putting them at a cost disadvantage. The UEP believes a single national standard would make the egg market more efficient. Opponents argue that mandatory standards are driven by political goals of animal rights groups. The Animal Welfare Act does not apply to farm animals, and federal laws do not dictate how U.S. farmers raise their animals. Livestock and poultry groups have voluntary guidelines for animal welfare. UEP did not negotiate voluntary guidelines due to antitrust lawsuits. Opponents of H.R. 3798 and S. 3239 wanted producers to maintain control of production methods. The UEP and HSUS proposed legislation to address egg production practices in 2008, aiming to prevent price increases and flocks culling. The legislation, embedded in the EPIA, focused solely on the egg industry to avoid impacting other livestock sectors. Both groups emphasized the need for industry agreement for the legislation to succeed in Congress. Any future legislation involving other livestock or poultry sectors would result in the groups withdrawing their support. Successful enactment of H.R. 3798 and S. 3239 would have set a precedent for future federal regulations. The proposed legislation aimed to improve animal welfare in the egg industry, with concerns raised about the lack of scientific basis for cage requirements. Despite opposition from some egg producers, the AVMA believed that the legislation would benefit egg-laying hens. Opponents of the egg legislation argue that it may deviate from established animal husbandry practices based on science and could impact producers, industries, and consumers. They believe that U.S. producers already prioritize animal welfare with science-based practices overseen by veterinarians and through voluntary programs like PQA and BQA. Codifying standards into law may hinder future science-based innovations. Opponents of the egg legislation argue that codifying standards into law may limit future science-based innovations in animal management and welfare. Transition and production costs, especially for small egg producers, are a major concern due to the substantial investment required to convert from conventional cages to enriched cages. Estimated industry costs vary greatly, with some estimating $4 billion over the transition period while opponents claim it could be as high as $8 billion-$10 billion. Some operations may need to invest in new housing structures to accommodate enriched cages, potentially increasing costs further. The Egg Farmers of America, a group of small egg producers, opposed federal legislation on enriched cages due to high conversion costs. Converting to enriched cages can cost $25-$30 per hen, with estimates of $8 million-$9 million for a 300,000 laying-hen flock. Some farms may have to convert despite still having useful conventional cages. Obtaining bank loans for the conversion is a concern. The shift to enriched cages in the egg industry could accelerate consolidation, with medium egg farms looking to expand or exit the business. Small egg farms may focus on niche markets like cage-free or organic. Questions have arisen about future operating costs compared to conventional cages, with one study suggesting a 25% increase for cage-free systems. The study compared production in enriched cage systems to conventional cages at JS West and Companies. Results showed lower hen mortality rate, higher egg output, average weight of eggs, and feed use in enriched cages. The study compared production in enriched cage systems to conventional cages at JS West and Companies, showing lower hen mortality rate, higher egg output, average egg weight, and feed use. A new study by UEP estimated that production under enriched cages would require an additional $2.6 billion in capital investment and production costs for eggs from enriched cages are estimated to be about $0.06 per dozen higher in 2030. The study compared production in enriched cage systems to conventional cages at JS West and Companies, showing lower hen mortality rate, higher egg output, average egg weight, and feed use. Production costs for eggs from enriched cages are estimated to be about $0.06 per dozen higher in 2030, with a 3% increase for retail eggs. Animal welfare has become a significant public issue, with rising awareness of how animals are treated in various industries. Recent animal welfare issues have sparked calls for more enforcement of animal abuse laws and a reduction in meat consumption. The UEP-HSUS agreement and proposed legislation indicate a growing focus on farm animal welfare. Around 95% of laying hens in the US are kept in conventional battery cages, which are cost-effective but raise concerns about hen welfare. Battery cages are cramped structures that restrict hens from natural behaviors. Different housing systems can impact hen welfare in various ways, influenced by genetics, disease, stress, and nutrition. Research on these factors is ongoing. The Poultry Science Association organized a symposium in 2010 to explore the relationship between housing and hen welfare. Researchers reviewed 202 articles on hen behavior and housing systems, highlighting the welfare impacts of conventional cages, enriched cages, cage-free systems, and free-range outdoor systems. The review concluded that assessing hen health and welfare is complex and no single housing system is ideal for hen welfare. The review discussed the effects of various housing systems on hen behavior and welfare. Conventional cages restrict hens from expressing natural behaviors, leading to issues like plumage damage, limited access to food and water, and increased aggression. Higher densities in cages can also result in feather pecking, cannibalism, and smothering. Nesting behavior is a priority for hens, but conventional cages lack materials for nest building. Enriched cages were developed to address criticisms about conventional cages by providing nesting boxes, perches, and dustbathing areas. While they offer more behavioral freedom, limited space restricts hens' ability to exercise and engage in natural behaviors like nesting and perching. Some view enriched cages as an improvement over conventional cages, but concerns remain about space limitations and stress from dominant hens. Cage-free systems offer sufficient space for natural behaviors like foraging, reducing cannibalism and feather pecking. Stocking densities and floor types can impact hen behavior, with low densities triggering aggressive defense behavior. Access to litter, litter quality, and experience with litter during rearing are critical for hen welfare in cage-free systems. The research review highlighted that perches can reduce aggression in hens in cage-free systems, but adequate perch space is often lacking in the United States. Free-range systems allow hens to forage outdoors, increasing behavioral options such as eating preferred foods and sunbathing. However, larger free-range flocks may experience issues like cannibalism and feather pecking. The environmental complexity of free-range systems can also pose challenges in managing disease and parasites. The research review highlights the complexities of managing disease and parasites in different hen housing systems. Conventional cages have higher mortality rates compared to enriched cage systems. Free-range housing offers more behavioral options for hens but can also lead to welfare problems like cannibalism and predation. Overall management of each housing system is crucial for hen welfare. The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) governs the treatment of animals in the United States, excluding farm animals from its oversight. States have laws on animal cruelty and welfare, but the AWA focuses on standards for animal health, transportation, exhibitions, and fighting. Hen welfare is influenced by housing design, breed, rearing conditions, and management practices. Farm animal welfare is primarily regulated by individual producers as most states exclude farm animals from animal cruelty laws. Producer organizations may set voluntary standards for animal care. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address farm animal welfare, such as the Farm Animal Stewardship Purchasing Act and the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act. In the 111th Congress, legislation like the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act (H.R. 4733) aimed to restrict government purchases of animal products to those raised under specific welfare conditions. Proposition 2 in California, approved by voters in 2008, mandates humane treatment of farm animals starting January 1, 2015. The California law A.B. 1437 requires all eggs sold in the state to come from cage-free hens starting January 1, 2015. This law aims to protect consumers from health risks associated with eggs from stressed hens. Egg farms in other states must comply with California's standards to sell eggs in the state. Agriculture regulations in California set standards for cage sizes for egg-laying hens, with a minimum of 116 square inches of floor space per bird required for enclosures with nine or more hens. Proposition 2, which has faced legal challenges, aims to clarify housing requirements for hens but has been criticized for its vagueness. The egg company opened an \"enriched colony\" system in 2010 providing 116 square inches of space per hen, larger than industry standard. Proposition 2 requires cage-free environments, although not specifying cage sizes. The Association of California Egg Farmers joined the suit in 2011. California Superior Court ruled JS West could not challenge the state due to undefined housing requirements. William Cramer filed suit in U.S. District Court in 2012. In 2012, William Cramer, an egg farmer in Riverside County, sued in U.S. District Court, claiming Proposition 2 is vague and violates the commerce clause. He argued that the law creates uncertainty for farmers and will raise egg prices, impacting consumers. The court rejected Cramer's claims, and the Association of California Egg Farmers later joined the lawsuit. The ACEF challenged the vagueness of Proposition 2 in court, but the Superior Court ruled against them, stating that the statute was not facially vague. Missouri later filed a lawsuit against California's egg law, claiming it violated the interstate commerce clause by imposing production requirements on out-of-state egg farmers. Missouri egg producers would have to spend $120 million to meet California cage requirements. Michigan enacted legislation to restrict conventional cages for laying hens, similar to California's law. The Michigan provisions were the result of negotiations between industry groups and the HSUS, preventing a ballot initiative campaign in 2010. The Michigan provisions for egg-laying hens, influenced by a campaign in 2010, go into effect in 2019. The EU recognizes animals as sentient beings and has implemented policies to ensure their welfare. Awareness of animal welfare was raised by the book \"Animal Machines\" in 1964, leading to public pressure to end battery cages in the EU. Research on non-cage systems resulted in an EU Directive in 1986. The UK's Farm Animal Welfare Council analyzed hen welfare and egg production systems in 1986, 1991, and 1997. The European Union phased out battery cages for laying hens by 2012, replacing them with enriched cages or non-cage systems. Thirteen member states faced legal action for breaching the new rules. The EU Commission sent formal notices to 13 noncompliant member states, including the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain, regarding the ban on battery cages. Noncompliance had animal welfare and market consequences. By November 2012, only Cyprus, Greece, and Italy were not in compliance. Some EU countries transitioned to enriched cages ahead of the deadline. Austria, Belgium, and Germany banned conventional cages by specific dates. Switzerland banned battery cages in 1992. The EU has not banned the import of eggs from non-EU countries in battery cages, but they must be labeled as non-EC standard. The ban on battery cages in the EU led to increased egg prices, with table egg prices rising by 44% and wholesale prices for liquid egg increasing by 102% year-over-year. The EU Commission expected egg prices to stabilize by early May. The EU expected egg prices to stabilize by early May despite a 2.5% decrease in total egg production in 2012. EU egg prices peaked in March, remained high in April, but decreased throughout the year. The European Commission issued a new strategy for animal welfare in February 2012, aiming to simplify legislative frameworks with science-based principles for all animals. The European Commission issued a new strategy in February 2012 to simplify legislative frameworks with science-based animal welfare principles, including indicators, consumer information, personnel requirements, and an EU network of animal welfare centers."
