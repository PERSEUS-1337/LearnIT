    "content": "The United States and the Lao People's Democratic Republic cooperate despite ideological differences and U.S. concerns about the ethnic Hmong minority. Bilateral relations are slowly improving as the U.S. focuses more on Southeast Asia and Laos seeks to broaden its foreign ties. The U.S. government is engaging economically with Laos, providing technical assistance to modernize its legal framework. In 2009, the Obama Administration lifted the prohibition on U.S. Export-Import Bank financing for American companies in Laos. The U.S. lifted the prohibition on Export-Import Bank financing for American companies in Laos due to Laos' market opening commitment. Bilateral cooperation has improved, with progress noted in defense attach\u00e9 exchanges and anti-trafficking efforts. Despite remaining restrictions on civil rights, human rights abuses have decreased. Laos is now a transit area for trafficking, but counter-narcotics efforts have significantly reduced opium production. The decline in opium production in Laos between 1998 and 2007 has been significant, with a rise in methamphetamine use among Lao youth. Key areas for U.S. policy consideration include monitoring resettlement of former Hmong militia members, increasing assistance for de-mining activities, granting trade preferences for Lao products, and developing programs for sustainable management of the Mekong River. U.S. foreign assistance to Laos is relatively low, with funding estimated at $5.0 million in FY2009. The focus of aid programs in Laos is on de-mining and counternarcotics efforts. In FY2009, U.S. aid programs in Laos focus on de-mining, counternarcotics, legal and regulatory framework, trade capacity, HIV/AIDS prevention, military education, recovery of MIAs, and public diplomacy programs. Over 2.5 million tons of U.S. munitions were dropped on Laos during the Vietnam War, leading to issues with unexploded ordnance (UXO). Laos faces significant challenges with unexploded ordnance (UXO) from the Vietnam War, causing 120-300 deaths annually. U.S. funding for de-mining has decreased, and assistance is provided through the Leahy War Victims Fund. The country is ruled by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, maintaining a one-party state with a strong security apparatus. Despite restrictions, relations between citizens and the government remain controlled. The government in Laos, led by Prime Minister Bouasone Bouphavanh, has made efforts to revitalize the economy and society, implement pro-market reforms, and combat political corruption. The National Assembly has become more vocal about accountability and passed laws allowing private ownership of media outlets and formation of civil society groups. In 2009, the Decree on Associations was signed to establish a legal framework for local NGOs, facilitating the presence of international NGOs and civil society in Laos. In 2009, the LPDR in Laos ratified the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Anti-government activities like public protests and bombings have decreased since 1999-2004. Rebel militias from Thailand carried out attacks on Lao border posts, and there were bombings in Vientiane and other cities. Despite these incidents, widespread anti-government activity did not occur. Laos' foreign policy now includes Southeast Asian regional powers, moving away from its previous ties to Vietnam. Laos has broadened its foreign policy horizons to include Southeast Asian regional powers and the United States, maintaining a strong relationship with Vietnam since 1975. Vietnam's influence on Laos remains significant, while China's economic influence is growing. China provides economic assistance and investment to Laos, leading some to believe that Vietnam is encouraging improved relations with the United States to counteract Chinese influence. Laos has strengthened ties with the United States to counter Chinese influence and has good relations with neighboring countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma. As a member of ASEAN, Laos is part of the ASEAN Free Trade Area and has hosted various ASEAN meetings and events. The United States and Japan are increasing engagement in the lower Mekong sub-region, which includes Laos. In July 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the ASEAN Regional Forum in Thailand, where the U.S. pledged cooperation in environment, health, and education with Lower Mekong countries. Japan also pledged assistance in response to China's influence. Lower Mekong countries are members of the Mekong River Commission, founded in 1995 for water management. The Mekong River Commission (MRC) is concerned about the impact of Chinese dams on the environment, fish stocks, and agriculture downstream. In 2009, the United States pledged over $7 million for environmental programs in the lower Mekong. Laos, one of the poorest countries in Asia, has seen economic improvement through reforms since 1986. Laos has seen economic growth between 1988 and 2008, with key sectors including agriculture, light manufacturing, services, metals extraction, hydropower, timber, rubber, and tourism. Recent economic policies have attracted foreign investment, but progress towards WTO accession has been slow. Agriculture accounts for 39% of GDP, while light manufacturing contributes 34% and services 27%. The economy grew by 4.5% in 2009. The Lao economy grew by 4.5% in 2009, down from 7.5% in 2008, and is expected to grow by 7% in 2010. Laos is economically integrated with Thailand, Vietnam, and China. Thailand is the largest export market for Lao goods. Vietnam, China, Thailand, and South Korea are the largest foreign investors in Laos. China is becoming a major investor in minerals extraction. U.S.-Laos trade is also growing rapidly. In 2008, Laos saw a significant increase in trade with the United States, with exports doubling to $42 million, mainly in apparel. However, in 2009, there was a drop in clothing exports but a substantial increase in exports of electrical machinery. The U.S. granted nondiscriminatory treatment to Laos in 2004, shaping their trade relations for several years. Between 1997 and 2004, legislation to extend NTR status to Laos faced opposition due to human rights concerns and the situation of the Hmong minority. Laos receives significant bilateral and multilateral assistance, with top sources including the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and the European Union. China is also a major source of economic assistance to Laos. Chinese economic assistance to Laos includes grants, concessional loans, debt relief, public works projects, infrastructure and energy development, construction of medical facilities, agricultural training, and investments on preferential terms. Chinese grants and loans totaled approximately $325 million and $350 million, respectively, from the late 1990s to 2007, while investment projects totaled $876 million in value from 1990 to 2007. China also financed and helped build the main stadium for the 25th Southeast Asian Games held in December 2009 in Vientiane. Some Members of the Lao National Assembly opposed a Chinese plan for development. Some Members of the Lao National Assembly opposed a Chinese plan to develop the area around the stadium, fearing housing for Chinese construction workers. Religious freedom has improved in urban areas, but non-mainstream religious activities face repression at the local level. Laos was recommended as a \"country of particular concern\" for religious freedom violations. The State Department designated Laos as a \"country of particular concern\" for religious freedom violations. In 2004, a joint seminar on religious freedom was held by the Lao government and the U.S. Embassy, leading to Laos being placed on the USCIRF's \"watch list.\" By 2005, Laos was removed from the watch list due to improvements like reopening closed churches and releasing religious prisoners. Decree 92 on religious practice was enacted in 2002, ensuring religious freedom but also allowing government oversight. Despite improvements, there are still instances of local officials targeting Christians with forced renunciations of faith. During the Vietnam War, the CIA trained and armed Hmong guerillas to fight the Vietcong. After the Lao communists took power in 1975, the Hmong army was decimated. The Lao military allegedly committed atrocities against the mountain Hmong, leading to a dwindling population of around 1,000 individuals. Between 2005 and 2007, roughly 2,000 mountain Hmong surrendered to Lao authorities for resettlement. Following the communist takeover in Laos, a significant number of Hmong minorities fled to Thailand, with many eventually resettling in the United States. In the early 1990s, the UNHCR closed its camps in Thailand, giving the remaining Hmong the choice to resettle in third countries or return to Laos. Some Hmong chose to stay in Thailand, while others returned to Laos. In 2003, the United States agreed to accept about 15,000 Hmong refugees from Wat Tham Krabok Temple. Between 2005 and 2009, the Thai government repatriated over 3,000 Lao-Hmong refugees, with approximately 4,500 remaining at the Huai Nam Khao camp in Thailand's Phetchabun province. Thailand has been hesitant to involve UNHCR due to concerns about a refugee influx. Some Hmong fear persecution if they return to Laos, with estimates that 15-25% may qualify as political refugees. In December 2009, the Thai army deported Hmong refugees from Huai Nam Khao and Nong Khai back to Laos. The Nong Khai group, identified as former insurgents, had been granted U.N. refugee status and applied for political asylum in various countries. The Lao government claimed to have granted amnesty to former insurgents and denied mistreatment upon their return. In April 2009, H.Con.Res. 112 was introduced in the House of Representatives to support the designation of a 'National Lao-Hmong Recognition Day.' In June 2009, 31 Members of Congress urged Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to prevent the forced repatriation of Lao-Hmong asylum seekers by the Thai government. U.S. officials have called for greater transparency in the repatriation and resettlement processes for former insurgents and returning Hmong. In December 2009, the U.S. State Department urged Thai authorities to halt the deportation process at Huai Nam Khao."
