    "content": "Tracking changes in energy activity is complex due to variations in different energy markets. These markets operate independently, with events in one influencing trends in another. Oil price movements can impact natural gas prices, which in turn affect electricity prices. This compendium focuses on individual energy sectors like oil, gasoline for transportation, electricity generation, natural gas for heating and industry, coal for electricity, nuclear and hydropower, and renewable sources with potential for energy production. Energy production trends show potential for growth in fuel ethanol and wind power, with significant gains in conservation and energy efficiency over the past three decades. Table 1 displays energy consumption by economic sector from 1950 to present, while Figures 1 and 2 highlight key trends. Oil, coal, and other energy sources are measured in different units, impacting overall consumption patterns. Energy consumption is measured in various units such as million barrels per day for oil, million short tons per year for coal, and trillion cubic feet per year for natural gas. A common measure, British thermal unit (Btu), is used to aggregate different types of energy. One quad is equivalent to one tcf of natural gas or 50 million tons of coal. Electric power generating capacity is expressed in kilowatts (Kw), megawatts (Mw), or gigawatts (Gw). Gas-fired plants are around 250 Mw, coal-fired plants over 500 Mw, and large nuclear power plants about 1.2 Gw in capacity. Total U.S. energy consumption has nearly tripled since 1950, with the industrial sector growing at the slowest rate. Per capita energy consumption increased by about 50%, mainly before 1970. The electricity sector is both a producer and consumer of energy. Consumption figures for residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors include resources directly consumed and energy used to produce electricity. The electrification of residential and commercial sectors, along with some industrial sectors, led to electricity representing a significant portion of energy consumption by 2010. Petroleum has historically been the primary energy source, followed by natural gas, with fluctuations in their shares over time. Natural gas increased its share of total energy consumption from 17% in 1950 to over 30% in 1970, then declined to about 25% in 1995. Since 1995, natural gas has risen to about 27% in 2013, with much of the increase in the electric power sector. Coal consumption declined from 35% in 1950 to about 20% a decade later, mainly used for electric power generation. Coal's share remained around 23% until recent years when natural gas started replacing it as a power-generating source. Since the 1970s, the perception of running out of oil has changed due to improved technology leading to the discovery of new reserves. World production of petroleum has increased, with proven reserves growing by about 50% between 1973 and 1990. The transportation sector remains heavily dependent on petroleum, with gasoline being the primary source. The United States still relies on petroleum for about 40% of its energy consumption, although this proportion has declined to about 36% in recent years. The search for oil slowed in the 1990s, but reserves exceeded production. Improved technology led to significant production from oil sands in Canada and heavy oil in Venezuela. By 2005, 200 billion barrels were added to proven world reserves. Tight oil extraction in the US has also increased world resources estimates. In the residential and commercial sectors, petroleum consumption steadily grew from 1950 to 1970, accounting for about 15% of total consumption. After the 1970s price surge, consumption declined to less than 7% by 1995. Following another price surge after 2005, consumption dropped to about 5%. In the electric power sector, petroleum usage saw a similar pattern, with consumption for power generation increasing to almost 9% in 1975 due to efforts to reduce emissions and convert coal-fired plants to oil or natural gas. Consumption of petroleum for power production peaked at almost 9% in 1975 but declined sharply as alternate sources became available. Industrial consumption has remained at about 25% since 1970, while transportation's share increased to two-thirds by 2000 and 70% in 2010. U.S. domestic production peaked in 1970, but consumption continued to rise except for temporary declines in the 1970s and 2009. Since 1970, U.S. domestic production of petroleum peaked, leading to increased dependence on imported petroleum. However, recent years have seen a reversal in production decline due to expanded production of tight oil. Import dependence rose from less than 20% in 1960 to nearly 60% in 2005, but declined to about 35% in 2013 with decreased consumption and increased production. The transportation sector heavily relies on petroleum, with aviation fuel transitioning from gasoline to jet fuel, growing from 3% of petroleum consumption in 1950 to 12% in 1965 and maintaining that share since then. Diesel fuel consumption in the transportation sector has shown a significant increase over the years. In 1950, it accounted for 6% of total petroleum consumption, rising to 20% in recent years. The shift to diesel was seen in railroads, marine transportation, and commercial trucks. Total diesel fuel consumption increased from 200,000 barrels per day in 1950 to 3.0 million barrels per day in 2007, with a decline in consumption during the economic downturn in 2008. Motor gasoline remains the primary petroleum consumed in the transportation sector. The transportation sector's primary petroleum consumption is motor gasoline, which has almost quadrupled since 1950. Despite the rise in aviation fuel and diesel, gasoline still accounts for about 65% of total consumption. Residual fuel oil, mainly used in large marine transport, is the next largest petroleum product consumed in the sector. Its consumption has gradually declined from 500,000 barrels in 1950 to about 400,000 in 2000. Oil prices are closely monitored due to its widespread consumption and economic importance, especially since the 1970s when OPEC disrupted the market dominated by large oil companies. Since the OPEC cartel broke the dominance of large oil companies, the crude oil market has become volatile. Prices of gasoline and heating oil have been influenced by various factors, including government policies and international events. Despite temporary surges, the long-term trend for many commodities, including gasoline, has been downward when adjusted for inflation. Gasoline prices steadily declined until 1973, peaked in 1980, then fell sharply in the mid-1980s and continued to decrease. The price surge in 2008 surpassed the peak of 1980 in real terms. The surge in oil prices peaked in 2008, surpassing the peak of 1980 in real terms. It is uncertain if prices will remain high or resume a downward trend. Consumer spending on oil as a proportion of GDP increased during price surges in the 1970s and again in 2008. Unlike the 1970s, the recent price increases were not due to supply interruptions. The surge in oil prices in 2008 surpassed the peak of 1980 in real terms. Uncertainty remains on whether prices will stay high or decrease. Consumer spending on oil as a proportion of GDP increased during price surges in the 1970s and again in 2008. The fall of 2005 saw Hurricane Katrina shutting down U.S. refinery capacity and crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to increased demand for oil imports by China. Turmoil in the Middle East and natural disasters like Katrina threatened supply interruptions, putting upward pressure on prices. In 2008, gasoline consumption showed seasonal variations but had an overall upward trend. The surge in crude oil prices led to a commodities bubble, which burst in October 2008 due to the financial crisis in the U.S. The crisis caused a sharp drop in oil prices from $135 per barrel to around $40. By the end of 2010, oil prices started rising again as the economy began to recover. Unrest in Libya disrupted oil supply to Europe, causing another surge in oil and gasoline prices. The global oil market is influenced by various factors, with about 60% of the world's oil supply being traded internationally. Prices of crude oil and gasoline can fluctuate due to supply interruptions or changes in demand, impacting prices globally. The price of oil peaked at $145 per barrel in mid-2008 after a continuous increase since 2003. This surge was different from the oil crises in the 1970s. The oil price peaked at $145 per barrel in mid-2008, unlike the 1970s oil crises with no major supply interruptions. There were no shortages during 2003-2008, except briefly after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Legislation from the 1970s is being revisited due to the rise in U.S. production. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, there were no gas pump lines, but oil prices steadily increased, leading to higher gasoline prices. Despite this, gasoline consumption rose until the 2008 economic downturn. Global oil consumption and prices plummeted during the recession, hitting a low of less than $31 per barrel. Within a year, oil prices rebounded to $70-$85, significantly higher than the previous $20-$30 range. The high oil prices in the market are not solely due to the cost of production, but also influenced by large capital investments, time required for production, future demand and supply expectations, and political decisions in state-owned oil-producing countries. Oil revenue in state-owned countries is often used for governmental purposes rather than enhancing production capacity. Geopolitical factors, including OPEC's monopolistic policies and resource nationalism, also influence oil prices. Developing countries subsidize gasoline consumption, contributing to rapid demand growth. Investors in oil futures have little interest in oil as a commodity, leading to a market focused on future prospects. U.S. gasoline consumption remained high during price increases from 2003-2008, showing insensitivity to cost. Government subsidies in some countries mask the true cost of gasoline, exacerbating the inelastic demand. Oil is traded in dollars, impacting foreign exchange rates. The oil market is influenced by foreign exchange rates and changing views on oil resources, with predictions of future oil production being controversial. Predictions of future oil production are controversial and influence the oil market. There is a shift in demand towards lesser industrialized countries, leading to changes in trade flows and market transparency. The federal tax on gasoline is 18.4 cents per gallon, with varying state fuel tax rates maintained by the American Petroleum Institute. In 2012, the United States consumed approximately 12,000 kilowatthours per person, with annual power generation 10 times higher than in 1950. Coal was the primary source of electricity until recently, with petroleum briefly playing a significant role. In the late 1960s, petroleum briefly became important for power generation due to lower emissions. However, by the 1980s, oil consumption by utilities sharply dropped, with less than 1% of power generation being oil-fired in 2013. Natural gas consumption by the electric power industry gradually increased, but faced challenges such as regulated prices and federal policies discouraging its use for electricity generation. In the 1990s, gas became more popular for electricity generation as technology improved and Clean Air Act requirements tightened. By 2013, gas-fired generation reached 27%, with most capacity additions since 1995 being gas-fired. Nuclear power initially supplied 9% of total generation by 1975 but faced challenges and public opposition, limiting its expansion. The Island accident in 1979 and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 hindered nuclear power expansion. Despite some new projects in licensing and construction stages, the future of nuclear power is uncertain, especially after the Fukushima accident in 2011. Major hydroelectric projects have ceased, with hydropower's share of electricity generation declining. Gas-fired generation became popular in the 1990s, reaching 27% by 2013. In the last decade, wind energy has seen significant growth in the U.S., with over 50 gigawatts of capacity added since 2003. Power generation sources vary by region, with hydropower being prominent in the Pacific Coast states and natural gas in others. Coal remains a major source of electricity in certain regions, while the West South Central region relies heavily on gas. New England has shifted from oil to natural gas for power generation. In 2005, New England relied heavily on oil for power generation, producing 10% of its power compared to the national average of 2.5%. By 2013, oil's share dropped to less than 1%, with almost half of the region's power coming from natural gas. Electricity prices vary by region due to fuel mix and regulatory systems. Prices increased during the 1970s energy crises but declined in the 1980s. Price caps expired in 2000, leading to an increase, but by 2010 prices began to level off due to falling natural gas costs. Natural gas consumption in 2013 was over four times higher than in 1950. In 2013, natural gas consumption was over four times higher than in 1950. Consumption for electric power generation increased significantly, while the industrial sector's proportion of total gas consumption declined. Natural gas prices have become volatile due to increased demand by electric utilities and oversupply from shale gas production. Residential natural gas rates are regulated, but fuel costs can be passed on by local gas companies. The consumption of natural gas has increased significantly since 1950, with a considerable seasonal fluctuation in prices due to winter heating demand. Coal consumption has more than doubled since 1950, but its use has shifted primarily to electricity generation. The residential and commercial sectors consumed a quarter of coal in 1950, but by 1980, less than 1% was used in those sectors. Industry consumed 46% of coal in 1950, but by 2000, less than 10% was consumed by that sector. The consumption of coal has shifted primarily to electricity generation, with the electric power sector using over 90% of coal consumed in 2013. Meanwhile, fuel ethanol has become a major renewable energy source in the United States, reaching about 14.0 billion gallons consumed in 2011, mainly blended into E10 gasohol. Fuel ethanol production has increased rapidly in recent years due to the establishment of the renewable fuel standard. The renewable fuel standard (RFS) requires the use of biofuels in transportation, with fuel ethanol consumption leveling off since 2011 due to barriers to higher blends. Wind-generated electric power production has rapidly grown, accounting for 4% of total electricity generation in 2013. Energy efficiency efforts have been popular in response to energy crises, aiming to reduce energy intensity in various economic activities. Improving motor vehicle efficiency has been a focus due to the transportation sector's heavy reliance on oil. Analysis by the EPA shows a decline in light vehicle fuel economy from 1988 to 2003, mainly due to increased weight and higher performance. However, fuel economy improved after 2004, with tighter standards for light trucks implemented in 2005 and 2012. SUVs, pickups, and vans made up 48% of sales in 2003, more than double their market share in 1983. In 2005, there was an increase in energy consumption, with a further increase in 2012. The relationship between economic growth and energy use is a key concern in energy policy formulation. While economic activity typically leads to higher energy consumption, various factors make the short-term relationship variable. However, over the long term, some energy-related activities have shown a consistent relationship with economic growth. For example, from 1973 to 2010, electricity consumption remained stable at 0.4 kwh per constant dollar of GDP. On the other hand, the consumption of oil and gas significantly decreased after the price spikes and supply disruptions in the 1970s. Oil and gas consumption dropped from 10,000 Btus per constant dollar of GDP in 1973 to just over 6,000 in 1985, and has continued to decline at a slower rate. During 1973 to 1985, oil and gas consumption decreased from 10,000 Btus per constant dollar of GDP to over 6,000, while GDP increased by 45%. From 1987 to 2013, oil and gas consumption increased by 22% and GDP by 94%.
