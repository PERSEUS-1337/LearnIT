    "content": "The Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act of 2015, also known as the \"Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act of 2015\", includes provisions for information transparency and pipeline spill prevention. It covers topics such as notice to property owners, facility operation standards, availability of industry standards, and considerations for high-consequence areas. The Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act of 2015 focuses on information transparency and pipeline spill prevention. It includes sections on assessing oil spill impacts in the Great Lakes, studying water crossings in the Great Lakes Basin, prohibiting crude oil transport on the Great Lakes, and defining worst case discharge. Additionally, it addresses notice to property owners and residents. Section 60102(c)(4) is amended to require pipeline facilities to notify property owners and residents within 2,000 feet of a transmission line about the proximity of the line and specific details for lines on private residential property. The amended Section 60102(c)(4) requires pipeline facilities to notify property owners and residents within 2,000 feet of a transmission line about the line's proximity and specific details for lines on private residential property, including electronic access methods, obtaining pipeline system maps, and other relevant information. The Secretary must provide additional information deemed appropriate and deadlines for notification within 2 years of enactment and every 3 years thereafter. SEC. 103. FACILITY OPERATION INFORMATION STANDARDS. Section 60102(d) is amended to redesignate paragraphs and subparagraphs, and insert new clauses and subparagraphs. After 1 year of the Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act of 2015, the Secretary must set minimum standards for pipeline operators to maintain and provide information to relevant entities. This includes State regulatory officials, local emergency responders, and other appropriate entities. The Secretary will also provide information to local emergency responders as required. The Secretary will maintain information submitted by pipeline operators and provide relevant information to local emergency responders. SEC. 104 amends Section 60102 to ensure that industry standards adopted in pipeline safety regulations are easily accessible to the public free of charge. SEC. 105 addresses considerations for identifying high-consequence areas. SEC. 105 amends Section 60109 to include considerations for identifying high-consequence areas, such as the age of the pipe, inspection methods, crossing open waters of the Great Lakes, and the type of commodity being transported. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research, in consultation with relevant agencies, shall identify measures and assess the effectiveness of responding to oil spills in the Great Lakes to prevent harm to public health, wildlife, and property. The assessment will include new scientific research on impacts. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research will conduct new scientific research on the impacts of oil spills in the Great Lakes, evaluate prevention and response plans, and make recommendations for safety technologies and environmental protection systems. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research will submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the enactment of the Act, detailing the results of the assessment on oil spill impacts, prevention plans, safety technologies, and environmental protection systems. SEC. 202. Great Lakes Basin Water Crossing Study and Alternatives Assessment. The Secretary of Transportation, in collaboration with pipeline owners and State governments, must conduct a water crossing survey of hazardous liquid pipelines in the Great Lakes Basin within a year of this Act. The survey will include mapping all pipeline crossings and assessing their structural integrity. The water crossing survey of hazardous liquid pipelines in the Great Lakes Basin will assess pipeline integrity at each crossing, identify risks of leaks and ruptures, address data gaps in the pipeline network, and make recommendations to prevent future failures. The Secretary of Transportation will collaborate with the National Research Council to conduct a study related to the survey of hazardous liquid pipelines in the Great Lakes Basin. The study will cover elements from previous subsections and consider ways to improve facility response plans and permit approvals. The Water Pollution Control Act requires a risk assessment analysis for pipelines crossing waterways in the Great Lakes Basin, including options like rerouting or decommissioning. This is part of efforts to prevent spills in the Great Lakes. The Water Pollution Control Act mandates a risk assessment for pipelines in the Great Lakes Basin, including options like rerouting or decommissioning to prevent spills. Modifications to operations, such as limiting product transport to natural gas liquids, and other transportation methods are also considered. SEC. 203 prohibits the transport of crude oil on the Great Lakes by vessel, effective from the enactment of the Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act of 2015. SEC. 204 amends the definition of worst case discharge under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include conditions where receiving waters are covered in whole or in part by ice."
