    "content": "Cluster munitions are weapons that disperse smaller submunitions into an area, delivered by aircraft or ground systems like artillery. They are valued for their ability to engage multiple targets with fewer weapons. Newer sensor-fuzed submunitions are being introduced to improve accuracy and reduce unexploded submunitions. Cluster munitions have been used in at least 21 states by 13 different countries, causing significant casualties and leaving behind millions of unexploded submunitions. Notable instances include their use by the United States in Southeast Asia, the Soviets in Afghanistan, the British in the Falklands, and NATO forces in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. The United States and British forces used cluster munitions in Afghanistan and Iraq, resulting in widespread international criticism. Israel also faced criticism for its use of cluster munitions against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon in 2006. Israel faced criticism for firing significant quantities of cluster munitions during the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, resulting in almost 1 million unexploded bomblets and civilian casualties. The use of cluster munitions affected a large portion of southern Lebanon's land and posed long-term explosive hazards. Civilian casualties from cluster munitions are caused by munitions fired into mixed soldier-civilian areas, inaccurate cluster munitions in populated areas, and unexploded submunitions. There are discrepancies in submunition failure rate estimates, with manufacturers claiming 2% to 5% failure rates and mine clearance specialists reporting 10% to 30%. Factors affecting submunition reliability include delivery technique, age, temperature, landing conditions, and damage after dispersal. Some nations are developing \"smart\" cluster munitions with self-destruct mechanisms to reduce the hazard of unexploded submunitions. However, experts warn that using \"dumb\" or high-failure rate cluster munitions alongside smart ones can negate the benefits. China, Russia, and the Republic of Korea argue that replacing all current submunitions with smart ones may not be feasible due to cost constraints. The CCW treaty, negotiated in 1980, initially applied to incendiary weapons, mines, and weapons causing casualties through small fragments. In 2007, states-parties decided to address the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions, but negotiations in 2008 and 2009 did not result in a new proposal. In 2011, negotiations continued with a Draft Protocol on Cluster Munitions. The Republic of Korea, China, and Russia argue that replacing all submunitions with \"smart\" ones may not be feasible due to cost constraints. The experts group continued negotiations in 2011 based on a Draft Protocol on Cluster Munitions. Despite efforts, the CCW states-parties could not reach an agreement on a protocol during their November 2011 review conference. Norway and other CCW members initiated negotiations outside of the CCW in 2007 to ban cluster munitions, leading to an agreement in 2008. During the Signing Conference in Oslo in December 2008, 94 states signed the convention, with some notable countries like the United States, Russia, and China not participating. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) entered into force on August 1, 2010, after receiving the 30th ratification. It bans the use, development, production, acquisition, transfer, and stockpiling of cluster munitions. As of January 2, 2019, 105 states were party to the convention. The CCM allows for exemptions for certain types of cluster munitions, such as those with self-destruction features. U.S. officials were initially concerned about the impact on military operations, but the version signed in 2008 permits non-states-parties to provide humanitarian and peacekeeping support. The United States relies on cluster munitions for defense strategy and prefers technological fixes over a ban. Cluster munitions are crucial for U.S. military operations and are used by every combat aircraft and Army or Marine maneuver element. U.S. forces cannot fight without the possibility of using cluster munitions. The United States argues that cluster munitions are essential for military operations, as they reduce the need for additional aircraft and artillery systems. Officials believe that banning cluster munitions would lead to increased spending on new weapons and logistical resources. The U.S. has stated that its national security interests cannot be fully ensured if cluster munitions are eliminated. States would continue to implement the DOD policy on cluster munitions issued in 2008, emphasizing the need to minimize harm to civilians and infrastructure. The Pentagon's policy required cluster munitions used after 2018 to leave less than 1% of unexploded submunitions on the battlefield. Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan issued a revised policy on cluster munitions in 2017, highlighting their effectiveness in engaging area targets. Cluster munitions are effective in engaging area targets and may result in less collateral damage. Changes in the global security environment have led to under-investment in replacement systems and modernization of the Joint Force. Adversaries have developed capabilities to limit the ability to project power. Both Shanahan and Admiral Harry Harris Jr. support the use of cluster munitions. The revised policy allows for the use of cluster munitions that exceed the 1% unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations. There is no deadline to replace these munitions, and they will only be removed once new munitions meeting the standard are available in sufficient quantities. The Department of Defense will only procure cluster munitions that meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard. The new DOD policy requires cluster munitions to meet specific standards to minimize risks posed by unexploded submunitions. Military departments will replace existing cluster munitions that do not meet these standards starting in FY2019. Operational planners should account for the availability of cluster munitions, and approval to use non-compliant munitions rests with combatant authorities. The responsibility for procuring new cluster munitions lies with combatant commanders, who can use cluster munitions meeting specified standards. Military departments and combatant commands will continue to document cluster munition use, maintain inventories, and ensure operational quality. In urgent situations, commanders may accept transfers of cluster munitions that do not meet the standards. The Department of Defense may accept transfers of cluster munitions that do not meet procurement standards, but they will be removed from inventories and demilitarized once replaced. Cluster munitions with APL submunitions must comply with presidential policy. Combatant Commanders will ensure cluster munition use aligns with international agreements to minimize civilian harm. The Deputy Secretary of Defense expects rapid implementation of this policy. The Department of Defense is working on developing a new generation of cluster munitions with reduced harm to civilians. Factors like delivery technique and environmental conditions can affect the performance of these munitions. Efforts are being made to reduce cluster munitions failure rates through programs like the Army's Alternative Warhead Program. The Pentagon aims to reduce the number of cluster munitions in the Army artillery stockpile due to high failure rates. The Army stopped procuring a warhead with a 5% dud rate, while the Air Force uses cluster munitions with less than 1% failure rate. The DOD's 2017 policy focuses on meeting the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard. The impact of this policy on existing programs and potential new programs remains uncertain. Cluster munitions are becoming less relevant in modern warfare due to the increasing use of precision weapons. The U.S. military suspended their use of cluster munitions in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, reflecting a trend towards greater precision in military operations. This shift mirrors the decline of chemical weapons between World War I and World War II. The military suspended the use of cluster munitions in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003. Congress may review the effectiveness of alternative weapons used in place of cluster munitions. Insights from effects-based weapons systems could inform future U.S. policy on cluster munitions. The DOD's revised policy on cluster munitions raises issues for congressional consideration, including the impact on combatant commanders' operational plans. The DOD's revised policy on cluster munitions raises questions about the impact on combatant commanders' operational plans and the potential implications for defense industry development of systems with a 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard. Funding restrictions may slow or stall programs intended to replace systems exceeding 1%, as there is no longer an urgent operational need. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 prohibits military assistance, defense export licenses, or sale of cluster munitions unless submunitions result in less than 1% unexploded ordnance. This raises concerns about the impact on operational plans and defense industry development. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 prohibits the transfer, sale, or use of cluster munitions unless they are only used against military targets and not in civilian-inhabited areas. Similar provisions have been included in subsequent appropriations laws, such as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019."
