    "content": "Counter-terror measures in Southeast Asia have weakened anti-Western terrorist groups' ability to attack Western targets. The focus has been on radical Islamist groups like Jemaah Islamiyah with ties to Al Qaeda, aiming to establish Islamic states in the region. Attacks have targeted American, Western, and Southeast Asian entities. Al Qaeda utilized its Southeast Asia cells to support global activities, including the September 11 attacks, and provided shelter to operatives like Ramzi Yousef. Surveillance and actions against JI members have weakened the organization, limiting its operations to Indonesia and some in the Philippines. Combating terrorism in Southeast Asia is a foreign policy challenge for the Obama Administration and Congress, though not a top priority compared to other regions like Afghanistan and Iraq. Many Southeast Asian governments feel threatened by Islamic militant groups and are willing to cooperate with the U.S. in combating terrorism. However, they must balance security concerns with domestic political considerations, as anti-American sentiment is on the rise due to U.S. actions in Iraq and perceived bias in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This makes it challenging for governments to accept overt U.S. involvement in their internal security. The challenge for U.S. foreign policy in Southeast Asia is to confront terrorist elements without turning them into heroes or martyrs in the Islamic community. Continued activities of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah require a coordinated international response in a region with weak multinational institutions. Indigenous Islamic militant groups in Southeast Asia traditionally focused on domestic issues like promoting Islamic law and seeking independence. Radical Islamic movements emerged in the 1990s due to various factors. The emergence of radical Islamic movements in Southeast Asia in the 1990s was influenced by various factors such as globalization, frustration with secularist governments, and reaction to the Israeli occupation. Terrorist groups in the region range from separatist Muslims with narrow goals to those with a global anti-Western agenda like Al Qaeda. Groups like JI debate between focusing on Islamist agendas within individual states or targeting Western interests directly. Al Qaeda's Southeast Asian operatives established local cells in the region to plan attacks against Western targets and provide safe haven for operatives fleeing U.S. intelligence services. The Manila cell, founded in the early 1990s, was particularly active in the early-mid-1990s. The Manila cell, led by Ramzi Yousef, planned multiple attacks including the \"Bojinka\" plot to blow up airliners and assassinate the Pope. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Yousef's uncle, assisted in Manila. Al Qaeda's focus in Southeast Asia shifted to Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia in the late 1990s. Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were key locations for strategy meetings among September 11 plotters. Al Qaeda took advantage of loose financial controls in Southeast Asia to raise, transmit, and launder funds. A significant portion of Al Qaeda's strength was in Southeast Asia by 2002. They helped establish Jemaah Islamiyah, a regional terrorist network responsible for the 2002 Bali bombing. Al Qaeda's local cells cooperated with indigenous radical Islamic groups by providing money and training. Al Qaeda's Manila cell provided financial assistance and training to Moro militants like the Abu Sayyaf Group and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Thousands of militants were trained in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan or in camps of local groups in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Al Qaeda also funded and provided trainers for camps operated by local groups in the region. Indonesian intelligence officials accused Al Qaeda of sending fighters to participate in attacks on Christians in the Malukus and Sulawesi. The withdrawal of foreign state sponsors in the 1990s made it easier for Al Qaeda operatives to establish relationships with local groups in Southeast Asia. During the 1980s, Southeast Asian radicals fought in Afghanistan as mujahideen, leading to established personal relationships. Factors contributing to Al Qaeda's presence in the region included weak central government control, corruption, porous borders, and lax financial controls. Al Qaeda's presence professionalized local groups and facilitated cooperation, leading to the discovery of the pan-Asian terrorist network Jemaah Islamiyah after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network, discovered to have cells in several countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, as well as in Australia and Pakistan, has been severely weakened since the Bali bombing in 2002. Crackdowns by various governments in the region, particularly the arrests and killings by Indonesian authorities in 2007 and the reported killing of Noordin Mohammed Top in 2009, have significantly impacted JI. Analysts now believe that JI's administrative structure is confined to Indonesia, with its links to Al Qaeda reportedly weakened. Despite this, individual JI members remain scattered across the region. Most analysts caution that individual JI members are scattered across the region, highly trained, and capable of violence. JI's moderate factions focus on education and indoctrination for their goal of instituting sharia law in Indonesia. JI's long-term activities are being monitored as their goals range from establishing an Islamic regime in Indonesia to waging jihad against the West. There was debate within the organization about which goals to prioritize before more militant factions broke away in the 2005-2007 period. Jemaah Islamiyah leaders have formed alliances with other militant Islamist groups to share resources for training, arms procurement, and financial assistance. Cooperation increased after 2002 due to counterterror actions, leading to closer working relationships with other groups. They have created and trained local radical Islamist groups in Indonesia and engaged in joint operations and training with Filipino groups like the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf Group. The Jemaah Islamiyah network has formed alliances with other militant groups for training and financial support. Cooperation has increased since 2002, leading to closer ties with groups like the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf Group. JI members have been arrested since 2001, with some operating in Mindanao and working with Abu Sayyaf. JI was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2002, leading to arrests of key leaders and increased intelligence sharing among national police forces. The Jemaah Islamiyah network, founded by Abu Bakar Baasyir and Abdullah Sungkar in the 1960s, aimed to establish sharia law in Indonesia. They set up Al Mukmin, a Wahhabi boarding school in Solo, Java, and later fled to Malaysia to support fighters in Afghanistan. Many JI activists arrested were Al Mukmin alumni. JI, founded by Baasyir and Sungkar in the 1960s, established a sophisticated organizational structure and began recruiting for terrorism in Southeast Asia. They coordinated with Al Qaeda in the mid-1990s and gained momentum after the fall of Indonesia's Suharto regime in 1998. The outbreak of sectarian violence in Ambon and Poso in 1999 and 2000 provided JI with opportunities to recruit, train, and fund local activities. After the fall of Indonesia's Suharto regime in 1998, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) capitalized on the sectarian violence in Ambon and Poso to recruit, train, and fund local fighters. Many of these jihadis later became active members in Baasyir's network, which carried out bombings in Jakarta, Manila, and Thailand. While there was debate over JI's relationship with Al Qaeda, leaked reports revealed that they are separate organizations with differing agendas. Al Qaeda focuses globally on targeting the West, while JI aims to radicalize Muslim Southeast Asia, starting with Indonesia. Some JI leaders believe attacking Western targets would undermine this goal. After the fall of Indonesia's Suharto regime in 1998, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) capitalized on sectarian violence to recruit fighters. JI's links to Al Qaeda have dwindled, but they maintain a symbiotic relationship, sharing training camps and personnel. Al Qaeda provides financial support, and they have jointly planned and conducted attacks in Southeast Asia. Riduan Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, played a critical role in coordinating joint operations between JI and Al Qaeda. His arrest in 2003 may have disrupted their cooperation, which was closest between 1997 and 2002. The July 2009 Jakarta hotel bombings raised speculation of renewed ties between Al Qaeda and Indonesian radicals, particularly the cell led by Noordin Mohammed Top. Noordin's death has brought hope that these links may diminish. Jemaah Islamiyah had an estimated peak membership of 500 to several thousand, with influence extending beyond these numbers through education at JI-run pesantrens. JI-run pesantrens have educated many men in Baasyir's and Sungkar's radical interpretation of Islam. JI sought alliances with like-minded organizations and ran training camps to enhance military skills. Interrogations revealed a formalized command structure led by Hambali in 2000-2001, with Baasyir and Sungkar as spiritual advisors. Functional committees and regional brigades were established for various roles such as fundraising, indoctrination, training, and procurement. JI's structure, characterized by indoctrination, military training, and weapons procurement, was decentralized with regional leaders having autonomy. The network's goal of developing indigenous jihadis led to collaboration with local groups outside its control. The arrest of top leaders disrupted the command and control structure, accentuating decentralized tendencies. JI's structure expanded and contracted in response to internal and external factors. Since 2002, JI's structure has become more flexible and weakened due to arrests, leading to the emergence of splinter cells with competing agendas. Noordin Mohammad Top, suspected mastermind of several bombings, led a faction including current and former JI members. Indonesian police claimed to have killed Top in September 2009. In September 2009, Indonesian police claimed they killed Top, a key figure in a faction within JI. Tensions between factions over jihad tactics may have contributed to the breakdown of JI's hierarchy. One faction, led by Hambali, focused on a broader anti-Western agenda similar to al Qaeda, while another group within JI preferred a longer-term strategy of building military capacity and religious proselytization. Surveillance and arrests weakened the anti-Western faction, with Noordin emerging from this group. Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) is not as monolithic as commonly assumed, with divisions among members regarding geographic objectives. In December 2001, JI gained public attention for plotting bombing attacks in Singapore with Al Qaeda's involvement confirmed. Follow-on arrests in Malaysia and the Philippines revealed coordination in the plot. The FBI linked Jemaah Islamiyah to the September 11 attack on the United States through investigations and arrests. Malaysian cell members provided support to Zacarias Moussaoui, who was involved in the September 11 plot. Indonesian police arrested Al Qaeda leader Omar Al-Farouq, who confessed to planning terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in Southeast Asia. Al Qaeda/JI planned simultaneous car/truck bomb attacks against U.S. interests in Southeast Asia. Bush Administration raised threat level to \"high\" and closed U.S. embassies. Al-Farouq identified Baasyir as JI spiritual leader. Al-Farouq escaped from detention center in Afghanistan and was killed in Iraq in 2006. On July 17, 2009, bombings at the J.W. Marriot and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta killed nine and injured over 50, including 6 Americans. Noordin Mohammad Top, a Malaysian member of a radical anti-Western faction, is believed to have planned the attacks. Indonesian police reportedly killed Noordin in September 2009. His exact ties to JI are unclear, but most of his followers were linked to JI-affiliated networks. Members of the JI network provided sanctuary to Noordin, allowing him to evade arrest for years. Analysts believe that uncovering the funding sources for the bombings will reveal the strength and involvement of JI and possibly Al Qaeda in Indonesia. There are concerns that funding for recent attacks may have come from outside Southeast Asia, indicating a potential reestablishment of links with Al Qaeda. Noordin's faction changed its name to the Al-Qaeda Jihad Organisation for the Malay Archipelago, raising worries about their intentions. The Al-Qaeda Jihad Organisation for the Malay Archipelago, formerly led by Noordin, may have ties to Al-Qaeda. Indonesian police are investigating connections between the group and the July bombings, with suspicions of funding facilitation by a former Al Qaeda member. The July 2009 bombings in Indonesia were attributed to increased linkages between regional terrorist groups. Despite the attacks, the US lifted its travel warning on Indonesia in 2008 due to improved security measures. Indonesian authorities believe they have control over the situation. Despite the July bombings, Indonesian authorities have seriously damaged JI, an illegal organization. Detachment 88, the main counter-terror unit, has arrested hundreds of suspects, including Faiz Fauzan, an associate of Noordin Top linked to the Bali bombing. Indonesia's deradicalisation program aims to reintegrate extremists into society and deter terrorism. U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey praised Indonesia's efforts in combating terrorism in June 2008. During a visit to Jakarta in June 2008, the United States praised Indonesia's effective efforts in combating terrorism. Indonesia has been successful in apprehending and convicting terrorists and extremist organizations. There is strong bilateral counter-terror cooperation between Indonesia and Australia, as highlighted during a visit by Australian Prime Minister Rudd in June 2008. During a visit to Jakarta in June 2008, the United States praised Indonesia's effective efforts in combating terrorism, highlighting strong bilateral counter-terror cooperation between Indonesia and Australia. Indonesian police successfully thwarted a plan to assassinate President Yudhoyono after uncovering a militant network and disrupting plans for attacks, including a suicide attack on the President's home. Top, a wanted militant, was reportedly killed during a raid by Indonesian police on his hideout in central Java on September 17, 2009. A laptop found at Top's hideout in central Java on September 17, 2009, revealed linkages between Indonesian militants and Al Qaeda. It also indicated that Bali was a key target for militants and plans to trigger communal conflict in Indonesia. Syaifudin Zuhri bin Ahmad Jaelani, a militant recruited by Al Qaeda in Yemen, is set to lead Top's JI splinter group. Experts believe Syaifudin could effectively lead the network. The government of Indonesia planned to introduce tougher anti-terror measures following the 2009 Jakarta bombings, including amending the 2002 anti-terror laws to allow longer detentions for suspects. Human rights advocates warned of potential abuse of these laws and the risk of radicalizing more militants. President Yudhoyono indicated the use of armed forces in counter-terror operations, expanding beyond police units. Kopassus special forces, known for suppressing Islamist forces under Suharto's regime, played a key role. Abu Dujana and Zarkasih received 15-year sentences in 2008. Abu Dujana and Zarkasih, leaders of JI, were sentenced to 15 years in April 2008 for harboring terrorists and firearms charges. They were key figures in JI, with Dujana linked to multiple bombings. Their sentencing was seen as a success for Indonesia's counter-terror efforts. Members of the Front Pembela Islam (FPI) attacked peaceful demonstrators in Jakarta in support of tolerance and moderation regarding the Ahmadiyah sect. The police were reluctant to intervene, and after the attack, FPI leader Habib Rizieq called for war unless a ban on Ahmadiyah was enacted. The government responded by arresting FPI members. The government reacted to Indonesian moderates' outrage by arresting FPI members and placing a partial ban on Ahmadiyah. Observers believe this shows the government's reluctance to alienate hardline Muslims. Concerns have been raised that extremists may advance their cause through violence. Inter-communal violence between Christians and Muslims could potentially erupt in Papua or elsewhere. In 2007, a dispute over building a Mosque on a site where German Missionaries brought Christianity to Papua in the 19th century caused bitterness in Manokwari and Kaimana in West Papua Province. The religious fault line is linked to the migration of Muslims to Papua and West Papua from other parts of Indonesia. Indonesian President Yudhoyono claimed success in handling terrorism in his State of the Union address in August 2007. President Yudhoyono claimed success in preventing and tackling terrorism in Indonesia, emphasizing the need to address root causes such as poverty, injustice, extremism, and violence. He mentioned improvements in security in Sulawesi and the Malukus, following the capture of JI leaders. Despite significant disruptions to JI organization, the group has not been eliminated. Despite significant disruptions to JI organization and degraded capabilities in Indonesia, JI has not been eliminated and may regroup to conduct future operations. Analysts warn against complacency and urge efforts to prevent terrorist groups from using loosely governed regions in Mindanao, Philippines, and Southern Thailand. Indonesia's appeal to Islamist groups stems from weak central government control, social and political instability, and its predominantly Muslim population. The 1997-1999 Asian financial crisis weakened Indonesia's central government, and the transition to a more democratic but weaker government in 1998 hindered its ability to marginalize Islamist elements. The election of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2004 has strengthened Indonesia's central government in counterterrorist activities, despite growing influence of radical Islamist groups in remote regions. The internal problems in Indonesia, such as separatist movements, economic recession, and religious conflicts, provide opportunities for terrorists to exploit. Despite some support for Islamist agendas, there has been a decrease in backing for violence in defense of Islam. The U.S.-led campaign against terrorism and the war in Iraq have had negative political implications in Indonesia. The war in Iraq has negatively impacted Indonesia, with some support for bombings and attacks against non-Muslims. The danger posed by Jemaah Islamiyah and Al Qaeda was highlighted by the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed around 200 people, mostly Australians and Indonesians. This attack marked a shift in JI's strategy, following a decision by senior leaders to target softer targets. In early 2002, senior JI leaders in Thailand decided to attack softer targets in Asia like tourist sites frequented by Westerners. A second Bali bombing in October 2005 targeted restaurants frequented by foreigners, killing at least 20 people. Indonesian government began investigating JI after the 2002 Bali bombing, with help from Australian and U.S. investigators. Several suspects, including senior JI commander Ali Gufron, were arrested. Trials started in 2003. In August 2003, Amrozi was sentenced to death for his role in the Bali bombings. Subsequent attacks by JI included the Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta in August 2003, the Australian Embassy bombing in September 2004, and the Bali II bombing in October 2005. Noordin Muhammad Top was believed to have planned these attacks, targeting mostly Indonesians. Analysts emphasize the changing nature of jihad networks in Indonesia, focusing on personal contacts and inter-communal strife in the Mulukus and Poso. Militants in these areas aim to establish enclaves based on their interpretation of Islamic principles, potentially forming a basis for an Islamic state. The increased militant activity in Maluku and Poso in 2005 is seen as driven by local dynamics rather than global jihad, with future goals at the state and regional levels. The Bali bombing led to the arrest of Baasyir, who was long suspected of terrorism involvement by U.S. officials. Baasyir, long suspected of terrorism involvement, was arrested after the Bali bombing. Indonesian authorities charged him with past terrorist plots, including an attempt to assassinate Megawati Sukarnoputri. Baasyir denied leading JI but admitted to training suspects. In 2003, he was convicted of plotting to overthrow the government and sentenced to four years in jail. In March 2004, the Indonesian Supreme Court reduced Baasyir's sentence to 15 years. Indonesian police declared him a suspect in other terrorist attacks, extending his detention. Pressure from the United States and Australia was suspected. The prosecution's case against Baasyir was weak, lacking key witnesses connecting him to bombings. Only one witness claimed he was the leader of JI. The prosecution called for an eight-year jail sentence instead of the death penalty. Baasyir's sentence for conspiracy in the 2002 Bali bombings was initially 30 months, later reduced by four months and 15 days. He was released in June 2006 and had his conviction overturned in December 2006. Since then, he has openly preached in Indonesia, advocating for sharia law, criticizing democracy, and urging resistance against Western influence. Baasyir also called for the disbandment of Indonesia's anti-terror unit, Detachment 88, and founded a new organization called Jamaah Ansharud Tauhid (JAT) in 2008, which rejects democracy and promotes the immediate implementation of Islamic law. Bilateral relations between the United States and Indonesia have improved significantly since 2005, driven by Indonesia's democratic progress and its role in combating Islamic extremism. The Bush Administration allowed Indonesia to participate in International Military Education and Training (IMET) in 2005, followed by restarting non-lethal Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Indonesia. President Obama's ties to Indonesia are expected to further enhance these relations. The Philippines and the United States signed an agreement in 1999 for U.S. military forces to train and assist the Philippine Armed Forces against the terrorist Abu Sayyaf group. This cooperation made the Philippines one of the most extensive examples of U.S. counterterrorism cooperation in Southeast Asia. Abu Sayyaf, a violent Muslim group in the Philippines, has a history of killings and kidnappings, with links to Al Qaeda. They kidnapped three Americans in 2001, resulting in deaths and rescues during clashes with Filipino army rangers. Under pressure from U.S.-supported military operations, their armed strength has decreased from 1,000 to about 400. They continue to operate in the Sulu islands and western Mindanao, with a small presence on Basilan since 2006. Abu Sayyaf, a violent Muslim group in the Philippines, has ties with military factions like the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and JI. They engage in joint training with an emphasis on bomb-making and urban bombings. JI personnel trained about 60 Abu Sayyaf members in bomb assembling. Abu Sayyaf has carried out bombings and plotted attacks in cooperation with JI and MILF, including bombings in Manila. The U.S. focus on Abu Sayyaf is complicated by the broader Muslim issue in the southern Philippines, including the presence of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) is a large insurgent-terrorist group in the Philippines with an estimated armed strength of 10,000-12,000. They broke away from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in the late 1970s and aim for separation and independence for the Muslim region in the southern Philippines. There are strong links between some MILF elements and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), with ongoing training of JI terrorists in MILF camps. MILF leaders describe local commanders as younger and more militant. The Philippine National Intelligence Coordinating Agency estimated 30 to 40 JI cadre on Mindanao in mid-2009. A stronger collaborative relationship has developed between MILF commands and Abu Sayyaf since 2002. The MILF and the Philippines government reached a cease-fire agreement in 2003, monitored by Malaysia. Negotiations for a permanent settlement stalled over the issue of the MILF's proposal for a \"Bangsamoro\" autonomous state. Tensions escalated in April 2008 when Malaysia withdrew from the cease-fire monitoring group, criticizing the Philippine government's inflexibility in negotiations. In August 2008, the Philippine government and the MILF signed a Memorandum of Agreement for a settlement to end the MILF insurgency and recognize the ancestral domain of Filipino Muslims. The agreement included the establishment of a Bangsamoro Juridical Entity (BJE) in Mindanao with shared authority and resources, including its own government, economy, and security forces. Economic resources would be divided 75-25 in favor of the BJE, which could also engage in foreign trade relations. The Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Philippine government and the MILF in August 2008 established the Bangsamoro Juridical Entity (BJE) in Mindanao with control over resources within 15 kilometers of its coast. However, the agreement was deemed unconstitutional by the Philippine Supreme Court due to concerns about potential independence for the BJE. This led to renewed fighting between the AFP and the MILF, displacing over 600,000 people. Following the collapse of the accord, over 600,000 villagers were displaced and dozens died. \"Rogue\" commands from the MILF attacked Christian villages, leading to AFP operations against these groups. Malaysia withdrew its troops from the IMT, created in 2004 for the 2003 cease-fire. A new cease-fire agreement was negotiated in July 2009, with plans for peace negotiations in September 2009 involving an International Contact Group. However, prospects for renewed negotiations are poor due to the upcoming 2010 Philippine presidential elections. President Arroyo's administration faces challenges with distrust of the MILF, Malaysia's role, and CPP/NPA attacks on American targets. The Bush Administration labeled CPP/NPA as terrorist organizations and pressured the Netherlands to revoke visas. The European Union also designated CPP/NPA as terrorist groups. NPA armed strength is estimated at 5,000-6,000. The upcoming 2010 Philippine presidential elections add to the uncertainty. The Bush Administration supported the Philippine government's military pressure on Abu Sayyaf and negotiated with the MILF. The United States deployed troops to assist the AFP in operations against Abu Sayyaf in Basilan and Mindanao. U.S. forces provided intelligence and communications support, with a non-combat role, firing weapons on two occasions since 2002. The U.S. provided military support to the AFP in operations against Abu Sayyaf in Basilan and Jolo, including deploying surveillance aircraft, Navy Seal and Special Operations personnel, joint training exercises, and civic action projects. U.S. aid projects focused on Jolo and Tawi Tawi island, with $260 million committed since 2001. AFP operations have become more aggressive and effective, resulting in a decrease in Abu Sayyaf strength to 200-400 members. AFP commanders praised U.S. equipment, intelligence gathering, and assistance in planning operations. The U.S. military's civic action projects on Basilan and Jolo have weakened support for Abu Sayyaf. Major armed clashes continue on Jolo, with reports of collaboration between Abu Sayyaf and elements of the MNLF. Filipino leftist groups strongly opposed the presence of the U.S. military, leading to doubts expressed in 2009. The U.S. military contingent of approximately 600 in the Philippines was announced to be kept indefinitely in 2009. In September 2009, U.S. military personnel were involved in incidents on Jolo, including firing their weapons in response to a terrorist attack and two Navy Seabees being killed by a roadside bomb. The Philippine Senate passed a resolution urging renegotiation of the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States. The Philippine Senate passed a resolution urging renegotiation of the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States due to concerns about the period of stay and activities of U.S. forces. The Arroyo Administration defended the VFA and U.S. military assistance to the AFP, while also announcing a review of the VFA. The Bush Administration supported government-MILF negotiations and there were calls for a more direct role in the negotiations. The State Department supported the Memorandum of Agreement with the Philippine government. Former U.S. ambassadors to the Philippines emphasized the importance of a similar agreement for future settlements. Thailand has faced a separatist insurgency in its Muslim-majority southern provinces since 2004, resulting in over 3,400 deaths. Groups in southern Thailand, driven by perceptions of mistreatment towards ethnic-Malay Muslims, are behind the surge in violence. Their focus is on local autonomy rather than a broader anti-Western agenda. Foreign jihadi groups are not significantly active in the region, but some militants in Southeast Asia draw inspiration from the situation in Thailand. The political turmoil in Bangkok since 2006 has hindered the Thai government's ability to address the insurgency in southern Thailand. A military coup in 2006 removed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, leading to a series of different administrations. The current coalition government, led by Abhisit Vejjajiva, has struggled to find an effective strategy to curb the violence in the region. The southern region of Thailand has a history of separatist violence dating back to the early 20th Century, with ongoing insurgency despite various attempts to curb the violence. The recent death toll of over 3,400 includes both suspected insurgents and victims, predominantly Muslims. The central government declared martial law in the region after coordinated attacks by insurgents in 2004. The government declared martial law in the region due to a pattern of insurgent attacks, leading to major outbreaks of violence in 2004. Thai soldiers killed 108 insurgents in a mosque and 84 local Muslims were killed in separate incidents. The Thaksin government's handling of the violence was criticized as ineffective and inflammatory. After the Thaksin Administration's aggressive approaches to handling violence in the region were widely criticized, interim Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont took a more conciliatory approach by apologizing to Muslim leaders and resurrecting a civilian agency for improving relations. General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, the leader of the coup, advocated negotiations with separatist groups. The first Muslim commander of the Army advocated negotiations with separatist groups, leading to a more conciliatory approach in handling the Southern conflict. The following government focused on its survival amidst protests in Bangkok, leaving management of the conflict to the military. Despite a decrease in violence in 2008, a younger generation of insurgents resisted the new leadership's approach. The current government, under Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, faced renewed violence in 2009 and pledged to take back control from the military. The Administrative Center in the South reports to the Prime Minister instead of the military. Abhisit plans to visit the region with the Malaysian Prime Minister. Martial law allows for arrests without warrants and up to 30 days of detention. \"Operation Southern Protection\" has led to more arrests but also increased local resentment. There have been more lethal attacks, including a car bombing in Pattani. Human rights groups criticize the military for mistreating Muslim suspects. In March 2008, Human Rights Watch accused the army of torturing a Muslim cleric who died in police custody. Insurgents have become more provocative, targeting economic assets owned by ethnic Chinese. The movement is driven by an Islamist agenda, labeling conciliatory Muslims as collaborators. Attacks on state-run schools have led to an increase in enrollment in private Islamic schools. The insurgents' village-level network has expanded, gaining more local support. Fear and division along religious lines have escalated, with reports of 15% of the Buddhist population leaving the region. The movement in the southern provinces has a goal of creating an independent state with Islamic governance. It is a confluence of local separatists, Islamic radicals, organized crime, and corrupt police forces. Experts warn that outside groups like Jemaah Islamiyah may exploit local grievances to forge alliances with regional Islamic militants. The insurgency in the southern provinces aims to create an independent state with Islamic governance. Local separatist groups have ties to regional Islamic militants, with some receiving support from foreign Islamic organizations. The Barisan Revolusi Nasional-Coordinate (BRN-C) is believed to coordinate other autonomous groups, including Pattani United Liberation Organization (Pulo) and Gerakan Mujahideen Islam Pattani (GMIP). Identifying the main directing organization has been challenging, but it is suggested that no single group holds authority over the others. The insurgency in southern Thailand aims for an independent state with Islamic governance. Various separatist groups, including BRN-C, Pulo, and GMIP, are linked to regional Islamic militants. Attempts at dialogue with the Thai government have been limited, hindering peaceful resolution. Concerns about Thailand's vulnerability to international terrorism stem from lax border controls and terrorist activities using Thailand as a base for meetings, arms acquisition, and money laundering. The presence of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) in Thailand has been indicated through various activities such as holding meetings, setting up escape routes, acquiring arms, and laundering money. In 2003, Hambali, a radical figure with suspected ties to Al Qaeda, was arrested in Thailand along with three Islamic leaders planning attacks on foreign embassies and tourist destinations. Close anti-terrorism cooperation between Thailand and the United States is evident through the establishment of the joint Counter Terrorism Intelligence Center (CTIC) in early 2001. Thailand's CTIC, a key security agency, collaborates closely with the U.S. CIA, sharing facilities and intelligence daily. They captured Hambali and other JI operatives based on CIA information. Thailand also provided a black site for CIA interrogation of suspected terrorists. In 2002, two top Al Qaeda members captured in Pakistan were flown to Thailand for questioning. Counterterrorism cooperation between the U.S. and Thailand may have been affected by the U.S. response to a military coup in 2006. The U.S. State Department certified that Thailand had restored a democratically elected government in February 2008, allowing for assistance to continue under the Abhisit government. Malaysia, unlike its neighbors, has no indigenous separatist groups engaging in terrorist activities. The terrorist groups in Malaysia are small, external, and relatively inactive. Malaysia was briefly considered a \"hot spot\" for global terrorism post-9/11 due to some plotters meeting in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia sees itself as a moderate Muslim nation with a better understanding of terrorism causes and solutions. Malaysia, a moderate Muslim nation, believes it understands terrorism causes and solutions better than Western nations. It criticizes U.S. anti-terrorism policies for fueling terrorist groups and advocates addressing root causes like poverty and human rights denial. Despite differences, Malaysia supports some U.S. counter-terrorism programs in Southeast Asia. However, its domestic counter-terrorism efforts have been criticized for restricting civil liberties and suppressing political opposition. The Malaysian government is facing renewed calls for the repeal or reform of its anti-terrorism laws due to perceived leadership weakness following the 2008 elections. Prime Minister Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak took office in 2009, previously serving as Defense and Finance Minister. There are pressures within Malaysia to reexamine the nation's anti-terrorism laws. The Malaysian government is under pressure to review its anti-terrorism laws following the 2008 elections. Prime Minister Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak, who took office in 2009, is facing calls for reform. The link between economic conditions and extremism has been highlighted, with concerns raised about a potential rise in terrorism. The July 2009 Jakarta hotel bombings involving Malaysian national Noordin Top have added to the urgency of addressing terrorism in Malaysia. Pressure is mounting in Malaysia for changes in anti-terrorism laws, particularly the Internal Security Act. Malaysia, a diverse Islamic nation, has aimed to balance its Islamic identity with its multicultural population. The government has been involved in debates within the Islamic community on the true values of Islam and promoting a harmonious, multicultural Malaysia under Prime Minister Najib's leadership. Minister Najib promotes a harmonious, multicultural Malaysia with the slogan \"1Malaysia.\" Malaysia criticizes past U.S. policies on terrorism, citing invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq as fueling terrorist groups. Malaysia also opposes U.S. bias towards Israel and stereotyping terrorism as an issue specific to Islam. During the June 2008 Organization of the Islamic Conference, Prime Minister Badawi addressed the biased view of Islam in the West and criticized actions of a few Muslims. The new Najib Administration's stance on U.S. policy remains uncertain. Concerns persist over piracy and seaborne terrorism in the Straits of Malacca due to its strategic importance to international trade. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand have made progress in addressing these threats through joint patrols. Malaysia and Indonesia have agreed on joint patrols to combat piracy and terrorism in the Straits of Malacca. There are allegations of illegal arms shipments to Iran through Malaysian middlemen, which Malaysia's Home Minister denies. The level of terrorist activity in Malaysia is relatively low compared to other Southeast Asian nations. Minister Hussein has called for evidence to support the claims of illegal arms shipments. The Malaysian government's strict anti-terrorism laws and police efforts have effectively dismantled terrorist networks in the country. Critics argue that these laws are used to suppress political opposition. Extremist groups like Al Qaeda, JI, Abu Sayyaf Group, and KMM have been active in Malaysia. The Abu Sayyaf Group, known for abducting tourists in 2000, split from the Moro National Liberation Front. The KMM aims to overthrow the Malaysian government. The KMM is a small militant group founded in 1995 aiming to overthrow the Malaysian government and establish a pan-Islamic state. It has close links to JI and radical Islamist groups in the region. The Malaysian government has accused HINDRAF of having ties to terrorist groups, leading to the arrest of some of its leaders under anti-terrorism laws. HINDRAF denies any connections to terrorist groups. Uthayakumar, a legal advisor to HINDRAF and leader of the Human Rights Party, was charged with sedition for criticizing Malaysia's ISA. The ISA allows for arrest and detention without charge for up to two years. Other counter-terrorism laws include asset forfeiture and expanded surveillance. Currently, only nine people are detained under the ISA, including Mas Selamat Kastari. The detainee Mas Selamat Kastari, who escaped detention in Singapore, was captured in Malaysia. In August 2009, a leaked Malaysian plan to develop an Internet filtering system raised concerns about censorship and potential abuse for political purposes. Pressure to repeal or reform the ISA has grown in the last two years, with opposition parties calling for its repeal. In June 2008, Malaysian Bar Council urged government to abolish ISA due to political arrests. Gerakan Manuhkan ISA criticized ISA as a tool of state terror. Anti-ISA rally in Kuala Lumpur in August 2009. Gerakan supports narrowing ISA's scope to terrorism. Despite opposition, Malaysian government views ISA as crucial. The Malaysian government sees the ISA as crucial for anti-terrorism efforts, considering amendments to the law. A review paper may be presented to Parliament in October 2009. The United States and Malaysia have signed agreements on counter-terrorism, including a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in January 2009. Singapore has a strong counter-terrorism record, with authorities arresting suspected Islamic militants under the Internal Security Act. They uncovered a plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in 2002, with suspects linked to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Despite this, there was embarrassment over the 2008 prison escape of Mas Selamat bin Kastari, the alleged head of JI in Singapore. Mas Selamat, accused of plotting the embassy bombing, escaped in 2008 but was apprehended in Malaysia in April 2009. Singapore's Joint Counter Terrorism Center coordinates efforts against terrorism, increasing intelligence cooperation since 9/11. Authorities share information with the US on JI and Al Qaeda. Singapore is actively involved in counterterrorism efforts, including being a founding member of the Proliferation Security Initiative and joining the Container Security Initiative. They lead efforts in Southeast Asia to protect shipping lanes from piracy and terrorist attacks. Measures to enhance security include camera surveillance, increased protection of critical infrastructure, and deployment of armed personnel at key locations. Singapore has revamped its national security with a \"Total Defense\" campaign, preparing the public for a terrorist attack. An anti-terrorism exercise in 2005 involved over 1,000 citizens and officials. Border security has been intensified with biometric passports and a Strategic Goods Control system to prevent proliferation. Singapore has implemented a Strategic Goods Control system to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and actively participates in international export control regimes."
