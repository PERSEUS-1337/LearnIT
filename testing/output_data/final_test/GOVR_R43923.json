    "content": "The Office of Science and Technology Policy was established by Congress to provide scientific and technological analysis for the President. Its mission includes providing accurate advice, ensuring policies are based on sound science, and coordinating scientific work for societal benefit. OSTP aims to maximize the impact of federal investments in science and technology on economic prosperity, public health, and the environment. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) aims to maximize federal investments in science and technology for economic prosperity, public health, and environmental quality. It nurtures relationships with government officials, academics, and industry to evaluate scientific advances and provide policy advice to the President. OSTP also serves as a conduit of information for agencies. OSTP serves as a conduit of information for agency executives, helps shape science and technology-related policy objectives, resolves interagency conflicts, and manages other White House science and technology entities. Congressional oversight and influence over OSTP activities are ongoing processes, with potential issues for consideration by the 114th Congress. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) plays a key role in ensuring scientific integrity in federally funded research, communication of scientific information, and STEM education initiatives. Congress has restricted OSTP from certain activities with China, requiring certification to avoid technology transfer risks. Congress has restricted the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) from certain activities involving China, requiring certification to avoid technology transfer risks and interactions with officials linked to human rights violations. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is prohibited from engaging in bilateral activities with China or Chinese-owned companies without specific authorization by law. This restriction has been in place since FY2011, with the Department of Justice and OSTP arguing that it infringes on the President's constitutional authority in foreign diplomacy. OSTP used part of its FY2011 funds for activities with China, which led to a debate on the constitutionality of such actions. The Department of Justice issued an opinion stating that Section 1340(a) of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 is unconstitutional as applied to certain activities of the Office of Science and Technology Policy related to foreign relations. The activities of OSTP fall within the President's exclusive power to conduct diplomacy, allowing its officers and employees to engage in those activities despite the restrictions of section 1340(a). The Government Accountability Office found that the Office of Science and Technology Policy violated Section 1340 of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. Chairman Wolf requested the Attorney General to enforce the law and hold OSTP Director Dr. Holdren accountable. As a result, Congress reduced OSTP's FY2012 appropriations by 32.3%. In response to violations of funding laws, Congress reduced OSTP's FY2012 appropriations by 32.3%. Statutory language in the appropriations act prohibited OSTP from supporting activities that risk transferring sensitive technology to China. However, P.L. 113-6 restored funding levels and continued the prohibition on certain expenditures, with exceptions for certified low-risk activities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 imposed restrictions on OSTP activities involving human rights violators. The position of U.S. chief technology officer lacks a statutory foundation, leading to ambiguity in responsibilities and reporting structure. In November 2007, Senator Barack Obama announced his plan to appoint a federal chief technology officer (CTO). In April 2009, Aneesh Chopra was appointed as the first U.S. Chief Technology Officer by President Obama, with a focus on promoting technological innovation for national goals. Todd Park succeeded Chopra, with a role in harnessing data, technology, and innovation in the federal government. Megan Smith, Park's successor, guides the Administration's information-technology policy and initiatives. The current issue facing Congress is the ambiguity surrounding the reporting structure of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) position within the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). This lack of clarity is due to the absence of specific statutory authority for the CTO position and the lack of a formal position description outlining the CTO's authorities and responsibilities. Additionally, both the first CTO, Aneesh Chopra, and his successor, Todd Park, held multiple titles, further complicating the reporting responsibilities. Chopra and Park held multiple titles within the White House, with different reporting relationships. Park clarified that as U.S. CTO, he focused on technology and innovation policy under OSTP's leadership, while as an Assistant to the President, he operated as a peer to Dr. Holdren. Congress may need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the U.S. Chief Technology Officer and consider establishing the position through statute. Previous attempts have been made to establish the CTO position in statute, with questions to consider including the mission, duties, and authorities of the CTO. The role and placement of the U.S. Chief Technology Officer (CTO) are under consideration, including questions about duties, reporting structure, Senate confirmation, and relationships with other agencies. Congress may need to clarify the CTO's roles and responsibilities through statute. During the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations, actions were taken regarding scientific integrity, with advocacy groups raising concerns about the impact of political agendas on science, particularly in areas like the environment, public health, and national security. Federal scientists and engineers were reportedly restricted in providing information and had their research reports altered. In response to concerns about scientific integrity, Congress directed OSTP to develop principles for open data exchange by federal scientists. OSTP sent a memorandum to federal agencies outlining the \"Core Principle for Communication of Scientific Research Results.\" The Federal government emphasizes the importance of open communication of scientific information to advance science and inform society. NASA's science communications policy serves as a model for other agencies, promoting a culture of openness for sharing ideas and data with the public. President Obama issued a memorandum emphasizing scientific integrity in the executive branch, directing the OSTP Director to ensure its highest level. OSTP Director Holdren further guided departments and agencies on implementing the Administration's policies. Director Holdren's memorandum outlined principles for scientific integrity in four key areas: foundations, public communications, federal advisory committees, and professional development of government scientists. OSTP reviewed agency guidelines for consistency with President Obama's original memorandum. Some departments are developing broad policies for their component agencies, while individual agencies may add specific elements to align with their missions. 19 federal agencies have finalized policies, with four others in the process of finalizing draft policies. The agencies' policies on scientific integrity have received mixed reviews. Some agencies have been praised for promoting a culture of scientific integrity, while others have been criticized for inadequate policies. President Obama rescinded Executive Order 13422 to address concerns about political reviews of scientific documents. S&T policy advocacy groups have proposed additional measures, such as changing the executive branch's scientific communication policy. The Obama Administration issued an executive order for federal agencies to monitor scientific integrity and submit annual reports to OSTP. Other proposals included enhancing whistleblower protections, disclosing scientific studies used in regulatory policy, reforming agency communication policies, and providing the public with scientific results used in policymaking. Some organizations suggested differentiating between scientific judgments and judgments on economics, ethics, and policy matters. The Obama Administration issued an executive order for federal agencies to monitor scientific integrity and submit annual reports to OSTP. Some policymakers have criticized the administration for failing to protect scientific integrity, alleging scientific misconduct in various departments. Congress may seek to influence the direction of existing guidelines on consulting advisory panels and addressing conflicts of interest. Congress may influence existing executive branch activities, provide oversight on scientific integrity issues, establish guidance for agency policies, empower agency Inspectors General, or create alternative reporting mechanisms for scientific integrity complaints. The entity holding the copyright grants free access to articles, contrasting traditional publishing with open access models funded by author fees. Congress authorized NIH to require submission of final articles for public access. Federal open access publishing policies have raised concerns about intellectual property protection and government competition with private publishers. Supporters advocate for open access to reduce journal subscription costs, promote scientific collaboration, and provide public access to taxpayer-funded research. On the other hand, traditional publishers and scholarly associations oppose these policies, fearing negative impacts on the publishing industry and revenue streams. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 required the OSTP Director to establish a working group to coordinate agency policies related to the dissemination of research results supported by Federal science agencies. Respondents generally supported increasing public access to research results. The OSTP Director affirmed the Obama Administration's commitment to making federally funded scientific research results available to the public. Agencies were instructed to develop plans for public access within one year of publication. 20 agencies were expected to submit draft public access plans, with two plans receiving final approval. Release dates will be determined by each agency. The Department of Energy and NASA released their final public access plans in 2014. Congress has supported public access efforts with statutory language. Entities receiving funding over $100 million must implement public access plans. The plans must provide free online access to peer-reviewed manuscripts within 12 months of publication. The provision requires research funded by the Federal Government to be submitted to the designated agency for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Congress has shown support for public access efforts, with entities receiving over $100 million in funding required to implement public access plans for free online access to peer-reviewed manuscripts within 12 months of publication. In FY2014, entities receiving funding over $100 million were directed to implement public access plans for R&D expenditures. Congress and the Administration addressed governance concerns about federal STEM education programs, with a focus on the OSTP Director's role. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 directed the OSTP to establish an NSTC committee to coordinate federal programs in support of STEM education. The committee, known as CoSTEM, was tasked with reviewing STEM education activities, developing a five-year strategic plan, and overseeing federally sponsored STEM programs. The OSTP Director is responsible for ensuring the plan is executed and objectives are met. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 directed the OSTP to establish CoSTEM to coordinate federal STEM education programs. CoSTEM published reports on federal STEM education investments, including program descriptions, funding levels, and coordination efforts. In April 2012, CoSTEM published the 2010 Federal STEM Education Inventory Data Set. In March 2014, OSTP provided an update on federal STEM education coordination efforts. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act required OSTP to create a federal STEM education strategic plan by May 2013. The Administration proposed a reorganization of federal STEM education in its FY2014 budget request, aiming to streamline efforts and increase funding by 6%. Lead agencies for K-12, postsecondary, and informal STEM education would be designated. In May 2013, the NSTC released the federal STEM education strategic plan, proposing a reorganization of federal STEM education. The House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Appropriations did not support the reorganization, with the House committee identifying flaws in the proposed federal STEM strategic plan. The House committee report directed OSTP to report on the resources and authorities needed within 180 days. The Senate committee sought to defer action on consolidating federal STEM education findings into a \"one stop\" website until OSTP finalizes program assessments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 criticized the proposed reorganization for lacking detail and community buy-in. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget proposed a government-wide reorganization of federal STEM education programs, aiming to consolidate or terminate 31 programs at nine agencies. Funding would have remained at each program unless explicitly noted otherwise. The agreement did not adopt the reorganization, directing OSTP to reexamine other possible reorganizations after engaging in an inclusive development process. President Obama proposed consolidating or terminating 31 STEM education programs at nine agencies in the FY2015 budget. Some of these proposals were approved by Congress, but with limitations. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on program assessment and existing networks connecting educational activities to scientific programs. The FY2016 budget also includes additional STEM education consolidations and eliminations within agencies. Advocates for the Administration's reorganization proposals argue that consolidating STEM education programs across federal agencies would improve coordination, efficiency, and program evaluation. They believe reallocating resources to high-priority programs would increase effectiveness. The 114th Congress is considering bills that could impact the operations of OSTP and NSTC. The STEM Opportunities Act of 2015 (H.R. 467) aims to address issues related to STEM workforce and education by requiring federal science agencies and institutions to fully engage their talent pool, establish policies for primary investigators with caregiving responsibilities, collect data on grant applications, provide guidance to minimize bias, and implement best practices.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 810) requires the OSTP Director to consult with stakeholders, develop a strategic plan for conducting research on the International Space Station, and analyze requirements for radioisotope power system material for robotic missions. H.R. 810 would require the OSTP Director and NASA Administrator to submit a report on a near-Earth object survey program, including recommendations and budget. It also mandates analysis of options to divert objects on a collision course with Earth, coordination with other countries, and a review of orbital debris mitigation strategy. Additionally, the bill calls for a report on protecting Apollo Program lunar landing sites. The Research and Development Efficiency Act (H.R. 1119) aims to streamline federal regulations affecting research and research universities. It requires the OSTP Director to establish a working group to harmonize, streamline, and eliminate duplicative regulations while maintaining accountability. The group will focus on performance-based goals and submit results to relevant committees within a year of enactment. The International Science and Technology Cooperation Act of 2015 (H.R. 1156) aims to enhance international science and technology cooperation. It requires the OSTP Director to establish a body within the NSTC for this purpose and submit a report every two years to relevant committees. The report required by the International Science and Technology Cooperation Act of 2015 would describe federal priorities and policies for aligning international science and technology activities with U.S. foreign policy goals. The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2015 would establish an Interagency Committee for Advancing Weather Services to improve coordination of weather research and forecast innovation activities across the federal government. The United States Chief Technology Officer Act (H.R. 1764) would require key federal agencies to participate in a committee to prioritize weather forecast needs and coordinate them with agency budgets. The act would also establish the position of United States CTO to advise on federal information systems, technology, data, and innovation policies. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 1806) aims to address science and technology policy issues by authorizing appropriations for the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and establishing a working group to review federal regulations affecting research universities. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 1806) establishes a working group to review federal regulations on U.S. institutions of higher learning and focuses on performance-based goals. It also requires the OSTP Director to coordinate international science and technology cooperation and provide regular reports to relevant congressional committees. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 1806) establishes a working group to review federal regulations on U.S. institutions of higher learning and focuses on performance-based goals. It also requires the OSTP Director to coordinate international science and technology cooperation and provide regular reports to relevant congressional committees, including detailing foreign travel by OSTP staff. H.R. 1806 would require OSTP to develop an agreement for judges of prize competitions, report to Congress on pilot programs, and create the position of United States CTO within OSTP. The CTO would advise on federal information systems, technology, data, and innovation policies. The America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 1898) aims to promote innovative technological approaches, transparency, and accountability in federal government information systems. It requires the OSTP Director to create a working group to review and streamline federal regulatory and reporting requirements affecting research. The America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 1898) requires the OSTP Director to establish a working group to harmonize, streamline, and update research-related regulations and reporting requirements. The group will consider input from non-federal stakeholders and report to Congress annually. Additionally, the Director must create a body within the NSTC for coordinating international science and technology cooperation, with a report updated every two years for relevant congressional committees. The America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 1898) requires the OSTP Director to establish a working group to harmonize, streamline, and update research-related regulations and reporting requirements. It also mandates the designation of a Coordinator for Environmental, Health, and Safety Research to oversee coordination, planning, and budget prioritization of activities related to nanotechnology. The Coordinator for Environmental, Health, and Safety Research related to nanotechnology would develop and implement a research plan, updated every three years and transmitted to relevant committees. H.R. 1898 also mandates the establishment of a Coordinator for STEM Education to work with senior officials from other agencies to increase opportunities and training for federal scientists. H.R. 1898 aims to increase STEM engagement for federal scientists and engineers, ensuring agencies and institutions promote diversity and minimize bias in research grant reviews. The bill requires the OSTP Director to implement programs for full talent engagement and establish policies for caregiving responsibilities and data collection on grant applications. The OSTP Director is required to implement programs to promote diversity and minimize bias in research grant reviews based on gender, race, or ethnicity. This includes conducting culture surveys and providing educational opportunities for STEM research personnel. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act for 2016 and 2017 authorizes NASA programs and appropriations for FY2016 and FY2017, with provisions for the OSTP Director to consult with stakeholders and develop a strategic plan. H.R. 2039 would require the OSTP Director to develop a strategic plan for research on the International Space Station, including criteria for research, necessary capabilities, and an acquisition strategy. It also mandates an analysis of radioisotope power system material for robotic missions and the risks associated with a lack of material. H.R. 2039 would require the OSTP Director to submit an analysis to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. It also mandates reports on a near-Earth object survey program, orbital debris mitigation strategy, and issues related to protecting and preserving. The Director is tasked with reviewing and assessing the protection of Apollo Program lunar landing sites and artifacts on the lunar surface. Results will be submitted to relevant congressional committees within a year. Presidential science advisors have historically played a key role in informing S&T policy. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) plays a central role in U.S. S&T policy by advising the President, coordinating federal S&T activities, and acquiring scientific advice. Congress oversees OSTP's statutory authorities and may explore legislative options related to its structure and relationships with other S&T entities."
