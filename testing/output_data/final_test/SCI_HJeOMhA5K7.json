Knowledge-augmented Column Networks leverage human advice for better learning. Deep Learning has found successful applications in real-world domains like image, audio, and video processing. Deep Learning has been applied to structured domains using richer symbolic or graph features to capture relational structures. Recent work in relational deep learning addresses the combinatorial complexity of reasoning over multiple relations and objects. Column Networks are a framework that focuses on capturing domain structure but struggles with sparse and noisy samples. Knowledge-augmented Column Networks leverage human advice for better learning. Column Networks (CLNs) are composed of mini-columns representing entities in the domain, with edges modeling relationships between entities. The depth of interactions in CLNs allows for natural modeling of long-range interactions, making them attractive for relational learning. CLNs share parameters in hidden layers, enabling deeper networks without introducing more parameters. Learning and inference in CLNs are linear in network size and number of relations. CLNs are efficient due to linear learning and inference in network size and relations. However, they lack domain knowledge, hindering generalization in relational domains. Biasing learners towards simplicity and generality is crucial for true generalization. Deep learning incorporates biases like domain knowledge, but there is a need for richer forms of domain knowledge in deep relational models. Human-guided machine learning can provide rules over training examples and features to guide learning. Domain knowledge can be integrated into support vector machines as rules over input features. Our approach aims to allow humans to guide deep learning by incorporating rules and constraints that define the domain and its aspects, inspired by successful methods in inverse reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and planning. This incorporation of domain knowledge leads to better generalization with fewer training examples in various machine learning formalisms. Our framework allows humans to provide guidance during deep learning by incorporating domain knowledge naturally provided by domain experts. We introduce Knowledge-augmented Column Networks to capture and incorporate rules into relational deep learning models. The study introduces Knowledge-augmented Column Networks (CLNs) to incorporate domain knowledge into deep learning models. Results demonstrate superior performance with small data amounts across various domains. This is the first work on human-guided CLNs, building on previous models like KBANN and deep architectures proposed by others. The knowledge-based neural network framework has been successfully applied to various real-world problems such as gene recognition in DNA sequences, microwave design, robotic control, and personalized learning systems. Combining relational and deep learning methods has gained significant research attention due to the need for faithful and explainable modeling of implicit domain structures. Column networks transform relational structures into a deep architecture for collective classification tasks. The architecture is adaptable to the advice framework and shares similarities with GraphSAGE and graph convolutional networks. Incorporating constraints as a regularization term in neural models is also discussed. The curr_chunk discusses order logic statements with fuzzy semantics in a neural model for collective classification problems. It introduces Column Networks BID31 as a method to encode interactions between entities and their attributes without explicit relational feature construction. This approach transforms multi-relational knowledge graphs into robust relational deep models. The curr_chunk discusses the transformation of multi-relational knowledge graphs into relational deep models using Column Networks. It involves encoding interactions between entities and their attributes without explicit relational feature construction. The context between consecutive layers captures the dependency of the immediate neighborhood based on arcs/edges/inter-column connectors. The curr_chunk discusses the activation of hidden nodes in a knowledge graph model, with weighted contexts and bias parameters. It also mentions the use of a softmax output layer for label prediction in relation-sensitive predictive modeling tasks. The approach is formulated within the context of collective classification tasks. The curr_chunk discusses challenges in relation-sensitive predictive modeling, focusing on sparse structured data and the impact of sparse samples on learning. An example is given of classifying articles in a citation network. The curr_chunk discusses addressing challenges in predictive modeling with sparse structured data by incorporating human knowledge into Column Networks for more effective and efficient collective classification. The curr_chunk introduces Knowledge-augmented CoLumn Networks (K-CLN) that incorporate human knowledge for more effective learning from relational data. The model uses preference rules to capture human knowledge in a principled and intuitive way, improving collective classification in relational data. The curr_chunk discusses preference rules in the context of Knowledge-augmented CoLumn Networks (K-CLN), where rules are used to capture human knowledge for improved collective classification in relational data. The rules specify conditions for labeling entities, allowing for partial instantiation with constants. An example rule is provided for predicting relevance in a clinical work context. The curr_chunk discusses the use of preference rules in Knowledge-augmented CoLumn Networks (K-CLN) for improved collective classification in relational data. These rules provide partially-instantiated preference rules P, where more than one entity can satisfy a rule and more than one rule can apply to an entity. The model considers both the data gradient and the advice gradient to adjust weight parameters towards the direction of the advice. Only parameters related to entities and relations that satisfy the preference rules P are affected. The curr_chunk discusses modifying the expression for hidden nodes in Knowledge-augmented CoLumn Networks using advice-based soft gates. These gates adjust the contribution of edges aligned with the \"advice gradient\" to enhance or decrease their impact. The gating function chosen is multiplicative, with positive gradients increasing contribution and negative gradients decreasing it. The \"advice gradient\" is presented as the gradient with respect to preferred labels. The curr_chunk discusses the log-likelihood loss function for advice/preferred labels in entity classification. It explains how to handle conflicting advice by prioritizing the label given by most advice rules. The regularization term in advice-based learning methods is also considered. The curr_chunk discusses a regularization term based on the advice loss in entity classification. It explains how advice gradients are computed and used to augment hidden units in the K-CLN architecture. The key steps involved in the process are outlined in Algorithm 1. The experiments investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of K-CLNs with noisy sparse samples compared to Column Networks architecture with no advice. The curr_chunk introduces the K-CLN algorithm, which utilizes knowledge graphs and advice to improve predictive performance in collective classification using Column Networks. The algorithm involves creating masks, computing gradients, training gates, and storing gradients for better model learning. The intention is to demonstrate how advice/knowledge can enhance model efficiency and performance. The K-CLN algorithm extends the original CLN architecture by incorporating advice gradient feedback, modified hidden layer computations, and a pre-processing wrapper. This wrapper acts as an interface between symbolic advice encoded in horn clauses and tensor-based computations. The approach is evaluated on 4 domains including Pubmed Diabetes and Corporate Messages for multi-class classification, and Internet Social Debates and Social Network Disaster Relevance for binary classification. The Pubmed Diabetes data set is for predicting articles about Diabetes Type 1, Type 2, or none using textual features and citation relationships. It includes 19717 articles with 500 bag-of-words features and 44,338 citation relationships. Internet Social Debates data set predicts stance on debate topics from online posts, with 6662 posts and around 25000 relations. Corporate Messages data set predicts intentions from 3119 flier messages sent by finance groups. The Corporate Messages data set aims to predict the intention of messages from finance groups using word vectors and a network of sameSourceGroup relations. Additionally, the Social Network Disaster Relevance data set consists of 8000 Twitter posts annotated for relevance to actual disaster incidents, with metrics including macro-F1 and micro-F1 scores for multi-class problems and F1 scores and AUC-PR for binary ones. The study evaluates the efficiency and effectiveness of K-CLNs with a smaller set of training examples. They use 10 hidden layers with 40 hidden units per column in each layer, averaging results over 5 runs. The data sets are split into a training set and a hold-out test set with a 60%-40% ratio. The model is compared against Vanilla CLN using varying sample sizes and epochs, showing performance in micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores. The study evaluates the effectiveness of K-CLN with varying sample sizes in training sets. K-CLN outperforms Vanilla CLN across all sample sizes for pubMed diabetes and social network disaster relevance datasets. It shows better performance with a small number of samples for corporate messages. The study evaluates the effectiveness of K-CLN with varying sample sizes in training sets. K-CLN outperforms Vanilla CLN across all sample sizes for pubMed diabetes and social network disaster relevance datasets. It shows better performance with a small number of samples for corporate messages. In multi-class classification, K-CLN performs better with very small samples, while macro-F1 shows similar performance for both models. For internet social debate stance prediction, K-CLN outperforms Vanilla CLN on F1 score and AUC-PR metrics, indicating effective learning with noisy sparse samples. Based on the study's findings, the approach developed focuses on preferences to guide domain experts effectively. The experimental results show the approach's efficiency in knowledge-rich, data-scarce problems. Future directions include exploring different types of advice and scaling the approach to web-scale data. Extending the idea to other deep models is also a potential area for future research."
