The study explores how adversarial training can be enhanced by using fake images generated by GANs for data augmentation. The improved robustness of the classifier leads to a better generator, showcasing an intriguing phenomenon that is intuitively explained. The proposed system combines generator, discriminator, and adversarial attacker in a single network to improve classifier robustness and generator quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms for classifiers and achieves competitive performance with SN-GAN for generators. Deep neural networks have been successful in modeling various data types, but their vulnerabilities to malicious attacks remain a challenge. This study explores the connection between adversarial attacks, defense, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The study explores the connection between adversarial attacks, defense, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It shows that adversarial attacks and GANs are closely related and can strengthen each other. The proposed system combines generator, discriminator, and adversarial attacker in a single network to improve classifier robustness and generator quality. AdvGAN system combines generator, discriminator, and adversarial attacker in one network to enhance image quality and classifier accuracy under strong attacks. Results show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art techniques, with generator achieving high inception scores on medium datasets with fewer iterations. Loss modification in AC-GAN further confirms system's superiority. In this paper, the (image, label) pair is denoted as (x i , y i ), with the classifier function f (x; w) including the final Softmax layer. The discriminator and generator networks are represented as D(x) and G(z) respectively. Adversarial examples x adv are created by perturbing the original input x, with the training set P real defined as the empirical distribution. The empirical loss function for the Generative Adversarial Network is also discussed. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithms that learn to model distribution with or without supervision, particularly for high dimensional data like images, texts, and audios. GANs are able to generate high quality images directly from certain distributions, unlike other methods which may be slow or produce blurry images. GANs consist of two competing networks, the generator G(z) and the discriminator D(x), which evolve in a minimax game during training. In the training phase of generative adversarial networks (GANs), the generator G(z) and discriminator D(x) play a minimax game to optimize a unified loss function. Recent literature focuses on the challenges of optimizing this loss. Guidelines for G and D architectures are outlined, along with techniques like feature matching and mini-batch discrimination to enhance network stability and quality. For high-resolution image generation, a common approach is to first generate low-resolution images and then progressively refine them for better stability. Alternative loss metrics are also used to efficiently reach equilibrium in GAN training. The use of alternative loss metrics such as BID0, BID4, BID13, and BID38 has been proven effective in reaching equilibrium efficiently in GAN training. BID0 explains the instability in training DCGAN due to the concentration of the image manifold towards a low dimensional space. Wasserstein-1 distance is proposed to measure the distance between real and fake data distributions, leading to the development of the stable Wasserstein-GAN network. Additionally, spectral normalization, inspired by WGAN/WGAN-GP, aims to improve network stability by estimating the operator norm. Spectral normalization in WGAN/WGAN-GP estimates the operator norm of weights inside layers and normalizes them to have a 1-operator norm. This ensures the network is 1-Lipschitz, allowing for the application of Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality to estimate Wasserstein distance. However, the robustness of the discrimination network D(x) is often overlooked, especially for high resolution images and large networks, which is a central focus of this paper. The method discussed in this paper utilizes adversarial examples, generated using the PGD-attack algorithm, to fool machine learning models. By finding adversarial perturbations that maximize the loss function, these examples are designed to be misclassified by the model. Adversarial attacks aim to maximize the loss function to create adversarial examples, with techniques like PGD attack. In contrast, adversarial defenses aim to make models resistant to such examples, with adversarial training being a key defense algorithm. Many defense methods rely on gradient masking or obfuscation, but the most effective defense is adversarial training. The proposed approach discusses the limitations of adversarial training, particularly the high overhead in finding adversarial examples. This method has only been tested on small datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10, raising questions about its scalability to larger datasets like ImageNet. The proposed approach discusses the limitations of adversarial training, particularly the high overhead in finding adversarial examples. Setting \u03b4 max = 0.03125 in (3), the attack strength \u03b4 is equivalent to \u03b4 max in (2). The local Lipschitz value (LLV) measured by gradient norm \u2202 \u2202xi f (x i ; w), y i 2, shows increasing accuracy gap when \u03b4 < 0.03125. LLV on the training set stabilizes at a low level, while LLV on the test set keeps growing. Restricting LLV can be formulated as a composite loss minimization problem. DisplayFORM0 can be regarded as the \"one-step approximation\" of (3), where empirical distribution of finite data is used. The training set's local Lipschitz value (LLV) stabilizes at a low level, but the LLV on the test set keeps growing, leading to an accuracy gap. Adversarial training controls LLV effectively in the training set but does not generalize to the test set, as shown by a significant LLV gap. This finding does not contradict the certified robustness of adversarial training in weak attack situations. The text discusses using GANs to learn the real distribution P and improve robustness in adversarial training. It mentions challenges in training GANs, such as gradient vanishing and mode collapse, and proposes using 1-Wasserstein distance to address the gradient vanishing problem. The central idea of WGAN and improved WGAN is to require discriminators to be 1-Lipschitz functions. Recently, a new regularization technique called \"spectral normalization\" has been proposed to enforce 1-Lipschitz discriminator in GANs. This allows for high-quality image generation from full ImageNet data with only one generator-discriminator pair. Additionally, a connection between the robustness of the discriminator and the learning efficiency of the generator has been discovered. Instead of strict 1-Lipschitz functions, a small local Lipschitz value on the image manifold is required for improved performance. The learning efficiency of the generator is influenced by the robustness of the discriminator. A robust discriminator requires a larger distortion to classify a fake image as real, compared to a non-robust discriminator. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 2, where a small Lipschitz value on the image manifold is crucial for improved performance. The attacker in this scenario is a generator parameterized by w, rather than the gradient ascent algorithm. The generator must be updated to make a fake image appear more like a real image. The generator must be updated to make a fake image appear more like a real image, by assuming Lipschitz continuity and robust discriminator. Adversarial training speeds up convergence and improves the generator, with future analysis left for further research. A system combining generator, discriminator, and adversarial attacker into a single network is proposed, with two stages including end-to-end GAN training. The discriminator in the proposed system has a standard architecture like AC-GAN and discriminates between real and fake images. It also predicts classes when ground truth labels are available. The network structure is illustrated in Fig. 3, and the system includes two stages: end-to-end GAN training and refinement of the discriminator by combining fake and real images. The AC-GAN is chosen over SN-GAN despite the latter performing better in the paper. The training process involves co-training and fine-tuning, with the discriminator trained with adversarial examples. AC-GAN's performance matches or surpasses SN-GAN after inserting the adversarial training module. The performance of AC-GAN surpasses SN-GAN due to changes in the loss objective, optimizing discriminator and generator to increase classification likelihood. Splitting the loss function ensures informative direction for the discriminator. The new objective functions in C1 and generator maximize L C2 \u2212 L S to ensure the discriminator focuses on classifying real images. The generator is updated regularly to mimic the distribution of real data, improving the robustness of discriminators. Data augmentation is used to address vulnerabilities in adversarial training, with a focus on expanding the support of the probability density function. Our system uses images sampled from the generator to create a continuously supported probability density function for adversarial training. Fine-tuning the classifier aims to improve classification accuracy by focusing on the robust classification task. The classifier in the pretrained discriminator is crucial for this step. During fine-tuning, the discriminator focuses on classification rather than discrimination, boosting accuracy significantly. Experimentation is done on CIFAR10 and a subset of ImageNet data, selecting classes from 151 to 294. This choice allows for fair comparison with existing GAN and adversarial training methods. Fine-tuning the discriminator improves test set accuracy by applying an auxiliary classifier instead of a feature projection layer. Results show that fine-tuning is beneficial for prediction accuracy, as demonstrated in FIG4. In this experiment, the robustness of discriminator networks with or without data augmentation is compared for prediction accuracy under adversarial attack. The perturbation is set to a specific range, and images are scaled to [-1, 1] due to the tanh() output layer in generators. The experiment compares the robustness of discriminator networks with or without data augmentation for prediction accuracy under adversarial attack. The perturbation is set within a specific range, and images are scaled to [-1, 1] due to the tanh() output layer in generators. The results show that the method can improve the robustness of state-of-the-art defensive algorithms. The effect of split classification loss is also demonstrated, highlighting the difference between models trained with different loss functions. Additionally, the quality of generators trained on three datasets is compared, showing variations in convergence speed and image quality. Our study compares the performance of our generator model with SN-GAN on three datasets: CIFAR10, ImageNet subset (64px), and ImageNet subset (128px). We demonstrate that adversarial training accelerates convergence speed and improves GAN performance, with our generator achieving a higher inception score than SN-GAN. Additionally, our new loss function proposed in FORMULA10 shows promising results in comparison to SN-GAN. Our method outperforms SN-GAN in inception scores with high-quality generator learning in a short time. Adversarial training accelerates convergence, reduces generalization gap, and improves testing accuracy under PGD-attack. The study connects adversarial training and generative adversarial network. Our goal is to enhance the generalization ability of adversarial training by using data augmentation with fake images. This approach also improves robustness and convergence speed in GAN training. Additionally, we introduce an improved loss function for AC-GAN, resulting in better image quality."
