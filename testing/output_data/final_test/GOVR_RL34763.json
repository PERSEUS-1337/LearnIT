    "content": "The instability in western Pakistan poses significant implications for international terrorism, Pakistani stability, and U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2007 highlighted concerns about the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) being used as a safe haven for Al Qaeda terrorists and Afghan insurgents. Extremists, including Baitullah Mehsud, have strengthened their presence in South Waziristan and settled areas bordering the FATA. The report also noted a rise in suicide bombings in Pakistan, with rates increasing in 2008. CIA Director Hayden warned in 2008 about the dangerous situation on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, stating it poses a threat to Afghanistan, Pakistan, the West, and the United States. Al Qaeda, particularly Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri, are seen as the greatest terrorist threat, with concerns that future attacks on the U.S. could originate from that region. Al Qaeda leaders in the region include Tahir Yuldashev of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and Chechen Islamist radicals. US commanders captured some militants in 2008. Strikes in Pakistan targeted Al Qaeda figures, with one missing Ayman al-Zawahri in 2006. Abu Laith al-Libi was killed in a 2008 strike near Damadola. In February 2007, Vice President Cheney visited Pakistan. In August 2008, an airstrike killed Al Qaeda chemical weapons expert Abu Khabab al-Masri. The US had praised President Pervez Musharraf for arresting over 700 Al Qaeda figures before 2007. However, a New York Times report in February 2007 revealed the re-establishment of Al Qaeda training camps in Pakistan, leading to a shift in the US's stance. Al Qaeda terrorist training camps in Pakistan's FATA near the Afghan border pose a significant security challenge for Afghanistan. Militant sanctuaries in Pakistan contribute to insurgent recruitment and attacks in Afghanistan, with a 30% increase in militant attacks in eastern Afghanistan attributed to infiltration from Pakistan. U.S. military officials estimate that one-third of attacks on coalition troops in Afghanistan originate from Pakistan. As long as Taliban forces have sanctuary in Pakistan, the Afghan insurgency is likely to persist. U.S. leaders are calling for a more comprehensive strategy to combat the war. The Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, advocates for a comprehensive strategy to combat the war in Afghanistan, including Pakistan's tribal regions. Major Afghan militant organizations, including the Taliban leadership of Mullah Mohammad Omar, operate from Quetta, Baluchistan. Their fighters are active in southern Afghan provinces. The Afghan Taliban leaders are active in southern provinces like Qandahar, Helmand, and Uruzgan. Pakistan's intelligence services are believed to know their whereabouts but do not arrest them. Another insurgent faction is Hizb-e-Islami led by Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, operating in Kunar and Nuristan provinces. Hikmatyar was designated as a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\" by the U.S. government in 2003. Hikmatyar expressed willingness to discuss a cease-fire with the Karzai government in 2007 and 2008 but later indicated he would continue fighting. Jalaludin Haqqani and his son lead another militant faction active in Khost Province, with ties to Al Qaeda. Haqqani's property in Pakistan was targeted by U.S. strikes in 2008. Pakistani officials blame Kabul's government for security deterioration. The deterioration in Afghanistan is attributed to the Kabul government's inability to extend its authority, corruption, and lack of military forces to defeat the Taliban. Pakistani leaders emphasize the importance of Afghan stability and call for increased efforts to control the border region. Islamabad promotes the use of advanced technologies like biometric scanners to curb militant infiltration, but analysts are skeptical of their effectiveness. Militants in Pakistan aim to undermine the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan. Militants in Pakistan target U.S. supply lines to Afghanistan, with only 1% of cargo lost despite attacks. Pakistani officials briefly closed a crucial highway in response to a U.S. raid, highlighting the importance of Pakistan's cooperation in supporting military efforts in the region. Pakistan's cooperation in sustaining multilateral military efforts to the west is crucial. Pentagon officials are exploring alternative routes due to potential instability in Pakistan disrupting supply lines. Russia allows non-lethal NATO supplies to pass through its territory but refuses troop passage. Uzbekistan is willing to assist with U.S. supply flow in exchange for improved relations. The U.S. military is testing alternative supply routes as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan emerges as a prominent anti-government militant group. The \"Pakistani Taliban\" aims to unite pro-Taliban groups, assist Afghan Taliban, and establish a Taliban-style state in Pakistan. The group faces factionalism due to tribal differences. The TTP leader, Mehsud, commands around 5,000 militants. The Islamabad government banned the TTP in 2008 for alleged involvement in domestic suicide attacks. The TTP leader Mehsud oversees an annual budget of up to $45 million raised through narcotics trafficking and demanding fees from businesses. His growing power and influence have caused alarm in Washington. Other Islamist militant groups, including TNSM, are also active in the region. The Pakistan army is facing challenges from various militant groups in western Pakistan, including cleric Maulana Fazlullah and his followers seeking to impose Sharia law, Mehsud rival Maulvi Nazir's militia supported by the government, and Mangal Bagh's Khyber agency militia. The army has deployed over 100,000 troops to combat the militants who are using heavy weapons and aggressive tactics, causing setbacks such as suicide bomb attacks and soldier kidnappings. These challenges have raised concerns about the army's morale and capabilities. The Pakistan army is facing challenges from various militant groups in western Pakistan, including battles in the Swat valley, Bajaur, and South Waziristan tribal agencies. Heavy fighting between government security forces and religious militants has been ongoing, with the deployment of elite Special Services Group commandos to the tribal areas. Pakistan has sent major regular army units to replace Frontier Corps soldiers near the Afghan border. The ongoing battle in the Bajaur agency involves Pakistani ground troops fighting against militants, with nearly half of the residents displaced. The Pakistani military, backed by helicopter gunships and jets, is facing an estimated 2,000 militant forces, including foreigners. The battles include engagements at the strategic Kohat tunnel, a key link in the U.S. military supply chain to Afghanistan. The fighting in the Bajaur agency involves Pakistani ground troops battling militants, with insurgents using sophisticated tactics and tunnels to resist. Over 1,500 militants have been killed, and the army general leading the campaign believes that winning in Bajaur could significantly reduce militancy in Pakistan. The military effort includes airstrikes on areas occupied by suspected militants. Subsequent terrorist attacks in western Pakistan have been linked to the Bajaur fighting. The conflict in Bajaur involves Pakistani ground troops fighting militants using sophisticated tactics and tunnels. Over 1,500 militants have been killed, with airstrikes targeting residential areas occupied by suspected militants. The use of fixed-wing aircraft has caused civilian casualties, leading to a humanitarian crisis. The U.S. provided emergency aid to displaced families, while the UN estimates hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled, with some moving into Afghanistan. International human rights groups have called for assistance for affected Pakistani and Afghan civilians. Concerns persist about the Pakistani military's loyalty and its tolerance of Taliban elements. Reports suggest that Pakistan's intelligence agency and military forces may aid the Taliban. Reports suggest elements of Pakistan's major intelligence agency and military forces support the Taliban and other extremist groups, providing training and fire support for Taliban offensives. US military personnel distrust the Pakistani military for battlefield support and question the wisdom of providing aid to a group that may be aiding terrorists. In Autumn 2008, tribal militias known as lashkars were formed in the FATA region, potentially representing a popular resistance to Islamist militancy similar to Iraq's \"Sunni Awakening.\" A potential effort to bolster tribal leaders near the Afghan border, similar to the \"Sunni Awakening\" in Iraq, aims to target Al Qaeda elements in the region. Despite challenges in Pakistan where the Pakistani Taliban shares ethnolinguistic ties with the tribes, pro-government tribals are increasingly alienated by violence and may cooperate with the Pakistan military. The Pakistan army supports anti-Taliban tribal militias, with plans to provide small arms to around 14,000 men in Bajaur and 11,000 more in other regions. The tribal militias in Bajaur, Orakzai, and Dir, numbering around 14,000 and 11,000 men respectively, are facing challenges against the Taliban. Islamabad's support for these militias is inconsistent, raising concerns of sparking a full-scale war in the region. The historical rivalry between Pakistan and India, fueled by the partition in 1947 and the Kashmir issue, adds complexity to the situation. The unresolved issue of Kashmiri sovereignty has been a major source of tension between India and Pakistan since 1947. Both countries have invested heavily in defense establishments, impacting economic and social development. Pakistani leaders have pursued a policy of seeking access to Central Asia and \"strategic depth\" with regards to India through friendly relations with Afghanistan. Islamabad's support for Afghan mujahideen and later the Taliban regime has been influenced by these strategic goals. The porous Durand Line, dividing Pashtun tribes, is a point of contention between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The porous 1,600-mile Durand Line border is disputed by Afghan leaders, fueling Pashtun nationalism. Pakistan is concerned about India's strategic encirclement, citing past support for Afghan militias and the opening of Indian consulates in Afghanistan. Pakistan's geopolitical perspective sees India as the primary threat, limiting cooperation in the war on terrorism. The tribes of western Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan resist foreign interference, including from the British, Soviets, and Westerners. Anti-American sentiments are prevalent in Pakistan, with many viewing U.S. support for President Musharraf as hindering democratization. There is a perception that the U.S. is fighting a war against Islam, leading to support for negotiated resolutions by the Islamabad government. The Islamabad government emphasizes negotiated resolutions to militancy, with little support for unilateral U.S. military action in Pakistan. Islamist parties express anti-American sentiment, linking poor education to xenophobia and extremism. Anti-American feelings extend beyond Islamic groups, with widespread anger at U.S. foreign policy perceived as unfriendly to the Muslim world. Pakistan's FATA region, home to Pashtun tribes, is rugged and mountainous. The FATA region in Pakistan is rugged and mountainous, home to 3.5 million Pashtun tribal people. The region has a history of autonomy under tribal leaders, with the current governor reporting to the President. However, political authority has been eroded by military and Islamist influences in recent years. The FATA region in Pakistan has seen a decline in political authority due to increased military and Islamist influence. The area is governed under the 1901 Frontier Crimes Regulation laws, with judgments made by tribal councils. The FATA is represented in the National Assembly and Senate but remains under the direct authority of the President. Laws passed by the National Assembly do not automatically apply to the FATA unless ordered by the President. Efforts are being made to reform the FCR and bring the FATA under the state's control. The U.S. government supports integrating the FATA into Pakistan's political and economic system. Analysts believe this is crucial to resolving militancy in the region. U.S. policy combines military efforts to neutralize threats with long-term economic development initiatives. Congressional analysts have criticized the Bush Administration's FATA policy. Analysts have identified serious shortcomings in the Bush Administration's FATA policy, as the United States has not met its national security goals in Pakistan's FATA. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Representative Howard Berman called the conclusions \"appalling.\" U.S. officials have indicated greater Pakistani cooperation, but Pakistan stopped attending meetings of the Tripartite Commission in February 2008. The Tripartite Commission, consisting of U.S., Pakistani, and Afghan forces, resumed meetings in June 2008 to improve border coordination. They agreed to set up five border coordination centers with radar nodes for intelligence sharing on extremists' movements. Only one center has been established at the Torkham border crossing. U.S. and Pakistani commanders now meet weekly, with cooperation improving according to U.S. Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey in November 2008. The U.S. and Pakistani commanders meet weekly to coordinate efforts against militants. U.S. commanders praised Pakistani military actions in October 2008. Afghanistan-Pakistan relations have improved since Musharraf's resignation in August 2008. The \"peace jirga\" process, agreed upon in 2006, has resumed with meetings of tribal elders from both countries. In October 2008, there was a declaration to engage militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan politically and discourage violence. U.S.-Pakistan military cooperation was improving, but U.S. officials were exploring new tactics to combat militants in Pakistan without violating Pakistan's restrictions on U.S. ground operations. Pakistani leaders opposed any U.S. combat forces in Pakistan, and a plan to send small numbers of troops to the border areas was put on hold due to potential backlash. Discussions between Joint Chiefs Chairman Mullen and Kayani addressed this issue. Discussions between Joint Chiefs Chairman Mullen and Kayani aboard the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Lincoln on August 26, 2008, led to increased U.S. military actions against militants in Pakistan, including missile strikes and \"hot pursuit\" operations across the border. Despite criticism from Pakistan, there was no consideration of long-term U.S. ground presence in Pakistan. Missile strikes by American Predator aircraft against militants in Pakistan have been controversial but effective. Reports suggest drones violate Pakistani airspace daily, with a possible understanding between U.S. officials and Pakistani leaders for increased drone strikes. There is speculation of a secret accord for better coordination on targets, although neither Washington nor Islamabad confirms Predator strikes on Pakistani territory. Conflicting reports exist on the Pakistani government's alleged permission for such operations. The Pakistani government is suspected of allowing Predator drone attacks on its territory without official permission. Pentagon officials push for more drone strikes in Pakistan, but State Department diplomats are concerned about the negative impact on U.S. interests due to civilian casualties and sovereignty violations. There has been a significant increase in suspected Predator attacks in Pakistan in 2008 compared to previous years. In 2008, there has been a significant increase in Predator drone strikes in western Pakistan, resulting in over 100 deaths, including top extremist leaders. The U.S. Central Command views these attacks as crucial, but Pakistan's Foreign Ministry condemns them as destabilizing and undermining counterterrorism efforts. Gen. David Petraeus, the new Centcom chief, faced strong protests during his visit to Pakistan over the cross-border military actions. In 2008, Pakistani officials strongly opposed U.S. military strikes in the FATA region, citing them as counterproductive and causing anti-American sentiment among the population. Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani called for a halt to Predator strikes, while President Zardari urged President-elect Obama to review the policy. Reports suggest that U.S. military aid to Pakistan has not effectively supported paramilitary forces fighting militants in the area. \"Train and Equip\" funding from the United States has significantly improved the counterinsurgency capabilities of Pakistani special operations forces. Since 2001, the US has provided Pakistan with nearly $1.6 billion in Foreign Military Financing for purchasing military equipment, including items for counterterrorism operations and conventional warfare. This funding has included military radio sets, transport aircraft, attack helicopters, and other defense supplies. The Defense Department has provided Pakistan with military equipment such as radio sets, transport aircraft, attack helicopters, night-vision gear, and protective vests. The State Department claims that funds have been used for counterterrorism efforts since 2005. Other U.S. assistance programs aim to bolster Pakistan's police and border security, including road-building projects in the NWFP and FATA. The Bush Administration has initiated efforts to strengthen Pakistan's Frontier Corps. The Frontier Corps (FC) is an 80,000-man paramilitary force overseen by the Pakistani Interior Ministry, responsible for border security in NWFP and Baluchistan provinces. $400 million in U.S. aid is allocated for training and equipping FC troops by mid-2010, with U.S. Special Operations Command assisting in counterterrorism efforts. U.S. trainers began work in October 2008 to train Pakistan's elite Special Service Group commandos and increase their size to 5,000. Congress has expressed concerns about the loyalty of locally-recruited Pashtun FC troops with possible pro-Taliban sympathies. Since 2001, the US has provided over $9 billion in coalition support funds to Pakistan, with roughly 80% going to Islamabad. These funds have been used to support Pakistani army operations, maintain troops in northwest Pakistan, and cover military expenditures. The US has provided over $9 billion in coalition support funds to Pakistan for food, clothing, and housing, as well as for ongoing coalition usage of Pakistani airfields and seaports. Concerns have been raised about the lack of oversight and potential waste of funds. Senior Pentagon officials are working to improve the process of providing military aid to Pakistan. In FY2008, P.L. 110-181 mandated detailed reporting of coalition support reimbursements to Pakistan. The GAO found increased scrutiny over rejected reimbursement requests, signaling a need for greater oversight and accountability. Since 2001, the US provided $12 billion in funds to Pakistan for counterterrorism efforts, with the majority in coalition support reimbursements. Additional funds were allocated for economic and security programs. US assistance aims to maintain Pakistan's support for counterterrorism. Development initiatives in the tribal areas focus on improving education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. The USAID has allocated 6% of U.S. economic aid to Pakistan for projects in the FATA region. The Bush Administration is urging Congress to fund a $750 million aid plan for the FATA, supporting Islamabad's $2 billion Sustainable Development effort. Skepticism exists due to endemic corruption, poor security, and high administrative costs. Islamabad insists on Pakistani implementation. The establishment of Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZs) in the FATA region, proposed by President Bush in 2006, faces political obstacles in Congress. The program aims to provide duty-free access to the U.S. market for goods produced in approved areas, but questions arise about the export value of products from the FATA. Critics argue that capital and infrastructure improvements are more crucial than tariff reductions. The establishment of Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZs) in the FATA region, proposed by President Bush in 2006, faces political obstacles in Congress. Critics argue that capital and infrastructure improvements are more crucial than tariff reductions. In March 2008, bills were introduced in the Senate and House for duty-free treatment of goods from designated ROZs in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but neither has progressed from committee."
