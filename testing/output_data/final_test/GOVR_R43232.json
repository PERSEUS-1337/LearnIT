    "content": "President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in January 2003, a government initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to fight a single disease. Congress passed the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, authorizing $15 billion for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2004 to FY2008. The Act outlined how the funds should be used, set goals and targets, and mandated the establishment of the Global AIDS Coordinator at the Department of State. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) administers most of the funds. The Lantos-Hyde Act of 2008 authorized $48 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts from FY2009 to FY2013. It established the Malaria Coordinator at USAID to oversee related efforts by USAID and CDC. The PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act, introduced in the 113th Congress, aims to reauthorize key provisions related to global HIV/AIDS funding, including authorizing appropriations for the Global Fund, expanding reporting requirements, and allocating funds for orphans and vulnerable children. The Leadership Act and Lantos-Hyde Act amend global HIV/AIDS funding, including provisions for orphans and vulnerable children, treatment, and care. The Acts aim to facilitate oversight of U.S. programs and meet congressional priorities. Reporting requirements are outlined in the Acts, with some authorities set to expire while others are permanent. Congressional interest in combating HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria remains strong. The Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts have been crucial in influencing projects to combat HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The 108th and 110th Congresses successfully enacted these Acts despite political differences. The PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act focuses on strengthening oversight and extending funding for key priorities related to Global Fund, orphans, and HIV/AIDS treatments. Key authorities set to expire include establishing performance targets, overseeing program implementation, advancing research on curative tools, and directing fund utilization. Enduring legislation authorizes the establishment of HIV/AIDS and malaria coordinators, regular reporting on program evaluation, research for improved tools, mechanisms for country ownership, integration of nutritional support, and exemption from certain prevention activities. Public statements by the Obama Administration are also mentioned. The Obama Administration and Congress show strong support for maintaining global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. Funding levels are likely to be maintained in the coming years, with some provisions in the Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts set to expire at the end of FY2013. These provisions include performance targets and interagency strategies for addressing the diseases. Other expiring authorities enhance congressional oversight capacity. The Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts set to expire at the end of FY2013 include performance targets and strategies for addressing HIV/AIDS worldwide. Congress shaped the scope and breadth of PEPFAR through authorizing language in these Acts, mandating the development of five-year strategies to combat HIV/AIDS. The Acts require the President to reach new targets by the end of FY2013, such as preventing 12 million new HIV infections and providing care for 12 million people. The Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts set targets for combatting HIV/AIDS and TB worldwide by the end of FY2013. These targets include preventing new infections, providing care for affected individuals, treating more people, ensuring access to counseling and testing, and training healthcare professionals. Congress used these Acts to shape the scope of PEPFAR and mandate the development of strategies to achieve these targets. The discussion revolves around the effectiveness of setting treatment and numeric targets for TB programs. While targets can demonstrate intent and prompt a swift response, other indicators like disease prevalence or survival rates may be better measures of program effectiveness. It is challenging to attribute outcomes to specific activities due to the collaboration of various actors in addressing TB. The Global Fund and the United States often provide support to the same population, complicating result attribution. The Global Fund and PEPFAR provide support for HIV/AIDS treatment, with the latter focusing on health system strengthening. PEPFAR's initial focus on numerical targets has shifted towards addressing health system challenges in recipient countries. Health system strengthening is a critical strategy for advancing country ownership in PEPFAR. Some groups are calling for more qualitative studies to measure impact, such as declines in transmission rates. Section 204 of the Leadership Act requires the strengthening of health policies and systems, with assistance provided for public finance management systems in recipient countries. The Administration's future focus on this remains to be seen. The Administration's focus on strengthening health systems and policies worldwide, including the creation of the Office of Health Systems at USAID in 2012, is a priority. The $15 billion authorization in the Leadership Act for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs was the largest until that date, with reporting requirements amended through the Lantos-Hyde Act. The Lantos-Hyde Act amended reporting requirements for global AIDS strategy, authorizing evaluations by the Institute of Medicine and Comptroller General, and allocating funds for oversight activities. The Lantos-Hyde Act amended reporting requirements for global AIDS strategy, authorizing evaluations by the Institute of Medicine and Comptroller General, and allocating funds for oversight activities. An authorization of up to $15 million was provided for the Inspectors General of USAID, the Department of State and Broadcasting Board of Governors, and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to jointly develop five coordinated annual plans for oversight activity through FY2013. The IOM and Obama Administration have largely adhered to these reporting requirements. Language in the PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Acts extended and expanded reporting requirements, focusing on extending authorities for oversight/audit plans and annual reports detailing per-patient costs for PEPFAR-supported treatment and care programs. The Leadership Act authorized $15 billion for the U.S. fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria from FY2004 through FY2008, while the Lantos-Hyde Act amended it to authorize $48 billion from FY2009 through FY2013 for combating the three diseases. Sections in the Lantos-Hyde Act specified how funds were to be allocated for each disease, including contributions to the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation and GAVI Fund. The Leadership Act authorized $48 billion from FY2009 through FY2013 for global health efforts, including contributions to the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation and GAVI Fund. Various sections of the Act allocated funds for specific purposes and activities. The Leadership Act authorized $48 billion from FY2009 through FY2013 for global health efforts, including contributions to the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation and GAVI Fund. Section 403 of the Act requires a portion of funds to be spent on children affected by or vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, with specific allocations for HIV/AIDS treatments, monitoring, care for opportunistic infections, nutrition support, and other medical care. Annual appropriations can sustain global efforts for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs regardless of reauthorization decisions. The PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Acts do not set funding levels. The PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Acts authorize support for the Global Fund, orphans, and vulnerable children, as well as HIV/AIDS treatment and care efforts. Funding allocations include limiting U.S. Global Fund contributions, allocating funds to children and care programs, and requiring NIH to address HIV/AIDS. Without treatment, people will continue to die from HIV/AIDS. The Public Health Service Act requires the development of a federal strategic plan for researching tools to cure or prevent HIV/AIDS. Funding is authorized for research on microbicides for HIV prevention and for facilitating availability of microbicides. The Lantos-Hyde Act mandates negotiations for U.S. participation in advanced market commitments for vaccine development. Research and development for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria is primarily funded by donor governments and philanthropic organizations. Language supporting research and development efforts is set to expire, but other parts of the Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts encourage ongoing research. The PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Acts do not include provisions for extending support for research and development. The Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts do not include language extending support for research and development efforts for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. Congress plays a key role in funding and shaping the implementation of global health programs. Section 102 of the Lantos-Hyde Act established an interagency working group on HIV/AIDS, while the Leadership Act directs groups to evaluate the PEPFAR initiative. The Lantos-Hyde Act mandates OGAC to publish annual reports on best practices, per-patient HIV/AIDS treatment costs, and the U.S. global HIV sexual transmission prevention strategy. It also expands U.S. engagement in research for improved tools to control and cure diseases. The Public Health Service Act mandates NIH to research safe methods to prevent HIV transmission in women. It also allows HHS to collaborate with other countries for biomedical research and provide financial assistance for related facilities. The Lantos-Hyde Act requires USAID to coordinate with development agencies for new vaccines, including HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria vaccines. States are urged to participate in negotiations for advance market commitments for future vaccines, including those for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The President must produce a report outlining a strategy to accelerate vaccine development for infectious diseases. The Lantos-Hyde Act requires the development of compacts at the country level to promote host government commitment, integrate HIV/AIDS services into health systems, strengthen health systems, and enhance sustainability. During the first phase of PEPFAR, research showed the importance of nutritional support in HIV/AIDS treatment. Congress amended the FAA to require adherence to WHO standards for food and nutrition services in HIV/AIDS programs. Debate on preventing sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS led to the addition of the \"conscience clause\" exempting certain organizations. The FAA was amended to include the \"conscience clause,\" allowing faith-based groups to opt out of activities they find morally objectionable. Congress also amended the Leadership Act to prioritize abstinence and monogamy in HIV/AIDS prevention strategies. The Act governs the allocation of funds for HIV sexual transmission prevention, requiring countries to spend at least 50% on activities promoting abstinence, monogamy, and fidelity. OGAC must report to Congress if this requirement is not met. The Act also authorizes support for global TB and malaria programs. The Act and Lantos-Hyde Act set program targets for TB and malaria programs, prioritize U.S. efforts globally, and establish a coordinator for U.S. global malaria programs. Specific goals include reducing TB death and disease burden, increasing detection rates, and successful treatment in countries with USAID programs. Annual reports to Congress on the impact of U.S. foreign assistance on TB control are required. Section 303 of the Leadership Act prioritizes the eradication of malaria as a U.S. objective. Section 304 establishes a Malaria Coordinator at USAID to oversee resources for combating malaria globally. The Lantos-Hyde Act amended immigration laws to remove HIV/AIDS as a barrier for entry into the United States. The United States hosted the International AIDS Conference in July 2012 after amending immigration laws to remove HIV/AIDS as a barrier for entry. The Leadership Act and Lantos-Hyde Act include reporting requirements related to foreign assistance. The PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act (H.R. 3177 and S. 1545) extends funding authorities and strengthens program oversight for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria assistance. The bills do not authorize multi-year funding levels but support the Global Fund. Permanent authorities are not detailed in the review of compliance."
