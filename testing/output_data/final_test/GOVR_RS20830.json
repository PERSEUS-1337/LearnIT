    "content": "The seven paragraphs of subsection 1030(a) outline various offenses related to computer trespassing, damaging government or bank computers, committing fraud through unauthorized access, threatening computer damage, trafficking in passwords, and accessing a computer for espionage. Subsection 1030 of the law outlines offenses related to computer trespassing, espionage, and fraud. Penalties range from imprisonment for up to a year to 20 years for espionage-related convictions. The Secret Service retains investigative authority, definitions are provided, and there is a civil cause of action for victims. Annual reports on investigations are required, and property generated by these crimes can be confiscated. Paragraphs 1030(i) and (j) authorize the confiscation of property related to offenses under subsection 1030(a) or (b), specifically unauthorized intrusion into federal government computers. Consequences include imprisonment for up to one year (up to 10 years for repeat offenders) and/or fines under Title 18. $100,000 for misdemeanors/$250,000 for felonies or twice the amount of the loss or gain associated with the offense, 18 U.S.C. 3571. Federal offenses committed by juveniles are usually tried in state court. Violations of subsection 1030(a) may trigger forfeiture, restitution, money laundering, civil liability, and racketeering provisions. Attempt, conspiracy, and complicity to violate federal laws are separate crimes. Simply hacking into government computers may breach laws and state computer crime statutes. The prohibition against acquiring protected information by unauthorized access covers federal government, financial, and computer data. To convict under 1030(a)(2), the defendant must intentionally access a protected computer without authorization and obtain information. Penalties range from one to ten years in prison and fines. Offenders may also face civil liability. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) of Title 18 U.S.C. 1030(c) does not require larcenous intent unlike other federal conversion statutes. It prohibits unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information, with penalties including prison time and fines. Offenders may also face civil liability. Additionally, paragraph 1030(a)(5) prohibits causing computer damage through unauthorized actions, making it a federal crime. Loss by intentionally accessing a protected computer is a federal crime under paragraph 1030(a)(5) if it involves a protected computer. There are five types of protected computers, including those used exclusively for the United States Government, banks, or in interstate commerce. Penalties for recidivism and causing serious damage are more severe. Offenders who intentionally or recklessly cause damage that is not serious can face imprisonment for up to 20 years, with harsher penalties for repeat offenders. Intentionally causing serious damage to a protected computer can result in up to 10 years in prison, increasing to 20 years for subsequent offenses. Recklessly causing serious damage carries a penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment, escalating to 20 years for repeat offenses. An offender who knowingly or recklessly causes serious bodily injury or death by damaging a protected computer can be imprisoned for up to 20 years. Serious damage includes causing a loss exceeding $5,000, modifying medical services, causing physical injury, threatening public health or safety, affecting national defense, or impacting 10 or more protected computers in a year. Other federal statutes may also apply for related crimes. Several federal statutes may be implicated by damage or destruction of federal property, financial institutions, or property used in interstate or foreign commerce. Some statutes include destruction of federal property by arson or explosion, destruction of government records, destruction of federal communications property, and causing a train wreck. Additionally, Paragraph 1030(a)(4) outlaws fraud by computer intrusion. The Paragraph 1030(a)(4) outlaws fraud by computer intrusion, involving accessing a protected computer without authorization to further a fraud and obtain anything of value. Penalties include up to five years in prison and/or a fine. Victims can seek compensatory damages. Other federal laws that may apply include wire fraud, theft of trade secrets, and fraud involving credit cards. The paragraph lists various federal laws related to fraud and theft, including theft of federal property, false statements on loan applications, bank fraud, money laundering, racketeering, and copyright infringement. The paragraph discusses the transmission of threats in interstate or foreign commerce to a protected computer with the intent to extort money or value, outlining specific actions that constitute a threat. Penalties include up to five years imprisonment and/or fines under Title 18, 18 U.S.C. 1030(c). The paragraph discusses various offenses related to computer crimes, including extortion, threats transmitted in interstate commerce, and receipt of extortion proceeds. Violations may also involve other statutes such as 18 U.S.C. 1951, 875, 876, 877, and 880. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) covers misconduct related to access devices and government computer passwords more clearly than Section 1029. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) covers trafficking in computer passwords or keys, providing a lesser offense to Section 1029 and allowing for plea bargaining. It helps prevent unauthorized access to computer systems and enables private enforcement through civil liability provisions. The crime involves knowingly transferring or obtaining control of computer passwords affecting interstate or foreign commerce. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) prohibits trafficking in computer passwords or keys, with penalties including up to 10 years in prison for repeat offenders. Offenders can also face civil liability to their victims. This offense has few counterparts in federal law but could lead to RICO or money laundering prosecution if it overlaps with other fraud prohibitions. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) merges elements of espionage and computer abuse by prohibiting the willful disclosure, attempt to disclose, or failure to return classified information concerning national defense, foreign relations, or atomic energy. This includes information acquired through unauthorized computer access that could harm the United States or benefit a foreign nation. Unauthorized computer access to classified information that could benefit a foreign nation carries penalties of up to 10 years in prison (20 years for repeat offenders) and/or a fine under Title 18, 18 U.S.C. 1030(c)(1). Espionage prosecutions are rare, but other crimes such as attempt, conspiracy, and complicity can still apply. Additionally, RICO (18 U.S.C. 1962) and money laundering (18 U.S.C. 1956, 1957) laws may be implicated through the application of Sections 793, 794, or 798."
