    "content": "Since 9/11, the U.S. Armed Forces have conducted military operations like Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq, Operation New Dawn, and Operation Noble Eagle for homeland security. The U.S. military has ongoing operations in response to 9/11, including Operation Inherent Resolve to combat the Islamic State. Troop levels in Afghanistan are decreasing, with plans for a limited embassy presence after 2016. The Administration amended its war request for the Department of Defense to $58.6 billion, bringing the total FY2015 war request to $79.0 billion. The Continuing Resolution sets war spending levels at $95.5 billion for the fiscal year, exceeding the amended request due to DOD's lower request compared to FY2014 levels. Congress is expected to pass another CR or an Omnibus Appropriations act to finalize FY2015 spending levels before the CR expires on December 11, 2014. The Congress may consider war budget issues for FY2015, including the Department of Defense's war cost request, the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund proposal, using OCO-designated funding for all DOD expenses, and the new funding request for Operation Inherent Resolve. The FY2015 Continuing Resolution allocated $95.5 billion for OCO-designated funding, with $85.8 billion for DOD. Congress may adjust these levels after the CR expires on December 11, 2014. The status of the FY2015 request and war funding levels for FY2001-FY2015 are discussed, along with potential restrictions on the use of U.S. ground forces. The House-passed version of H.R. 4435 included $79.4 billion for DOD war funding, matching the OCO placeholder request in the Administration's FY2015 budget. The Senate Armed Services Committee version of the FY2015 NDAA did not address the OCO request or the amended request. The House passed a conference version of the NDAA, H.R. 3979, and the Senate is expected to consider it before the adjournment of the 113th Congress. The conference bill, H.R. 3779, made minor adjustments to DOD's OCO-designated request, reducing it from $4.0 billion to $1.3 billion. The final NDAA will set a cap on funding levels and approve $1.618 billion for a new Iraq Train and Equip account with revisions. The bill endorses a cost-sharing provision where U.S. obligations are capped at 60% until Iraqi, Kurdish, and tribal security forces contribute 40% of the total. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State must submit a detailed plan to Congress outlining the assistance and rebuilding efforts for designated forces. The plan should include goals, timelines, training, and other relevant details. Quarterly reports must be submitted every 90 days, with any changes reported every 30 days thereafter. H.R. 3979 allows limited waiver authority for the Secretary of Defense for acquisition and arms sales provisions, with a general waiver for the President if deemed vital to national security. H.R. 3979 allows limited waiver authority for the Secretary of Defense for acquisition and arms sales provisions. The bill also includes additional reporting requirements for the Iraq and Syria Train and Equip programs. The House passed the FY2015 DOD Appropriations Act, providing OCO-designated funding of $79.4 billion. The Senate version of the bill provided $58.3 billion for DOD, close to the amended request of $58.6 billion. The $4.0 billion requested for the Counterterrorism Response Program was halved, impacting Operation and Maintenance and procurement accounts. Cumulative war funding by operation and agency is analyzed, excluding the $5.5 billion budget amendment for combating the Islamic State. A total of $1.6 trillion has been provided for war and diplomatic operations since 9/11. Since 9/11, a total of $1.6 trillion has been allocated by the Department of Veterans Administration for war operations, diplomatic operations, foreign aid, and medical care for Iraq and Afghan war veterans. The breakdown includes $686 billion for Afghanistan, $815 billion for Iraq, $27 billion for enhanced security, and $81 billion for other war-related spending. 43% was for the Afghan war, 51% for the Iraq war, 2% for enhanced security, and 5% for other war spending. The FY2015 request includes $58.1 billion for Afghanistan and $5.0 billion for Iraq. The FY2015 war funding request includes $58.1 billion for Afghanistan and $5.0 billion for Iraq. If approved, cumulative funding over the past 15 years would rise to $1.69 trillion, with $744 billion for Afghanistan, $820 billion for Iraq, $28 billion for enhanced security, and $92 billion for other war-related costs. The FY2015 war funding request includes $58.6 billion for the Department of Defense, $9.4 billion for State Department/U.S.AID, and $5.2 billion for VA Medical. In total, $1.6 trillion has been appropriated, with 92% going to the Department of Defense, 6% to State/USAID, and 1% to VA Medical for OEF/OIF/OND veterans. In the FY2015 war funding request, $58.6 billion is allocated for the Department of Defense, $9.4 billion for State Department/U.S.AID, and $5.2 billion for VA Medical. DOD funds are used for military operations, equipment reset, and training Afghan and Iraq security forces. State Department funding is for diplomatic operations and foreign assistance programs, while VA medical funding provides for the medical care of OEF/OIF/OND veterans. The main cost factor is the number of U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. Between 2001 and 2014, troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan changed dramatically due to various military operations and policy decisions. The troop levels reflected the gradual buildup in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, the Iraq invasion in 2003, the Iraq surge from 2007-2008, and the troop surge in Afghanistan initiated by President Bush in 2008 and continued by President Obama in 2009. The surge peaked in May 2011 and was followed by a phased withdrawal. In 2009, U.S. troop levels in Iraq peaked at 165,000 during the surge initiated by President Bush in response to growing violence. Troop levels declined to 147,000 by July 2008 as violence decreased. President Obama shifted U.S. forces in Iraq from combat to advisory roles after taking office in January 2009. In 2009, President Obama shifted U.S. forces in Iraq from combat to advisory roles and reduced troop levels from 141,000 to about 50,000 by September 2010. The bilateral security agreement required all U.S. troops to be withdrawn by December 31, 2011. Despite efforts to revise the agreement, all U.S. troops were withdrawn by that date. Currently, there are 100 to 200 U.S. military personnel in Iraq managing arms sales. Troop strength in Afghanistan grew slowly but is now falling rapidly. In response to security concerns, President Bush increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reaching 98,000 by September 2010. President Obama continued the surge, adding 30,000 troops. Obama committed to reevaluate the strategy in December 2010 for a gradual withdrawal of forces. President Obama announced a strategy in Afghanistan in December 2010 to begin the transfer of forces out by July 2011. The surge peaked at 100,000 in May 2011. By 2014, the U.S. role transitioned to a train and assist role as Afghan troops took the lead. U.S. troop levels decreased from 100,000 in May 2011 to 33,000 by February 2013, with plans for a complete drawdown by the end of the following year. After announcing the end of the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan by December 31, 2014, President Obama revealed a plan for 9,800 troops to remain for training and counter-terror operations. This number would decrease to about 4,900 by January 2016 and eventually transition to \"an embassy presence\" by January 2017, contingent on the Afghan government signing a new bilateral security agreement. President Ashraf Ghani signed the agreement on September 30, 2014, allowing for continued U.S. troop presence without specifying troop levels. The new Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) signed in 2014 does not specify U.S. troop levels or require a permanent U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Alongside U.S. troops, 28 NATO allies have also deployed troops as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The number and location of U.S. military personnel serving in Afghanistan are shown in Figure 2 based on DOD documents, with comparisons to pre-9/11 deployments and peak troop levels during the Iraq and Afghan surges. The number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq, including those providing in-theater support and on ships afloat, varied over the years. During the Iraq surge in April 2008, personnel reached over 300,000, with a peak of 278,000 during the Afghan surge in May 2011. Total war costs for Iraq, Afghanistan, and other operations rose steeply from $36 billion in FY2001/FY2002 to a peak of $195 billion in FY2008. By March 2014, U.S. military personnel assigned to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) had dropped to 138,000, reflecting the drawdown in Afghanistan. War funding fell to $157 billion in FY2009, following troop withdrawals after the Iraq surge. The decline in total war costs since FY2008 due to the Iraq withdrawal was offset by the rise in Afghan war costs. The Iraq withdrawal led to a decrease in war costs, but this was offset by the increase in Afghan war costs due to the troop surge. War funding for Iraq peaked at $144 billion in FY2008, then declined to $65 billion in FY2010 as the combat mission shifted to an \"advise and assist\" role. The U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan transitioned to an \"advise and assist\" role, leading to a decrease in costs to $47 billion in FY2011 and $20 billion in FY2012. Costs fluctuated over the years, reaching a peak of $107 billion in FY2011 during the troop surge. With declining U.S. troop levels and Afghan forces taking the lead, costs dropped to $77 billion in FY2014. The current FY2015 request is $58 billion for Afghanistan expenses. Costs for Enhanced Security (Operation Noble Eagle) peaked at $13 billion in the first year after the 9/11 attacks, primarily for one-time costs like Pentagon reconstruction, security upgrades, combat air patrol, and activating reservists to guard bases. These costs fell to $4 billion in 2003, $2 billion in FY2004, and under $1 billion in FY2006. DOD funded this operation in its baseline budget starting in FY2005, with costs decreasing to about $100 million per year in FY2008 and after. The Department of Defense accounts for $1.5 trillion or 92% of the $1.6 trillion total enacted war funding. The Department of Defense accounts for $1.5 trillion or 92% of the total enacted war funding, primarily for deploying and supporting U.S. troops, military operations, equipment maintenance, and intelligence activities. Diplomatic operations and foreign aid programs account for $93 billion, while medical care for veterans receives $18 billion. The Department of Defense accounts for $1.5 trillion or 92% of the total enacted war funding, primarily for deploying and supporting U.S. troops, military operations, equipment maintenance, and intelligence activities. DOD war funding also finances training for Afghan and Iraqi security forces, reconstruction activities, and higher support costs. Additionally, $93 billion in war appropriations for the State Department/USAID funds diplomatic operations, foreign aid programs, and various activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. The State Department, like DOD, designates certain funds as OCO for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, focusing on temporary costs related to national security policy. War-related foreign aid funding remained around $4-5 billion annually until FY2011, with exceptions. The State Department began designating spending as OCO in FY2011, leading to funding increases to $11 billion in FY2012 and $9 billion in FY2013. Funding fell to $6 billion in FY2014 but rose to $14 billion in FY2015. The VA tracks the dollar value of medical services for OEF/OIF veterans, with costs increasing due to growing eligibility and criteria changes. Since 9/11, VA services for combat veterans have expanded, with eligibility criteria broadening. Combat veterans can receive five years of VA health care regardless of other eligibility factors. OEF/OIF veterans' medical expenses are mostly covered by regular appropriations, and disability benefits are provided without disclosed amounts. See Table 5 for detailed cost breakdown of Afghan and Iraq wars. The cost of the Afghan and Iraq wars has been criticized for being funded off-budget or through emergency supplemental acts like Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel acknowledged the ambiguity surrounding this funding, with debates on whether it's a \"slush fund.\" Designating funding for activities loosely related to OCO or war has increased with the threat of sequestration under the Budget Control Act. If appropriations breach budget caps, across-the-board sequestration must be implemented. Under the Budget Control Act, if appropriations exceed budget caps, across-the-board sequestration must be implemented. Some suggest using the \"OCO\" designation as a \"safety valve\" to preserve base budget programs. DOD spending has been limited to $496 billion in FY2013-FY2015, with a $3 billion increase in FY2016. DOD faces significant cuts to readiness and modernization due to BCA sequester caps. The Future Years Defense plan exceeds BCA limits by $176 billion. Congressional reluctance on compensation reforms and weapon cancellations could create a $70 billion gap. Administration proposes raising BCA limits for defense and nondefense with savings from tax and entitlement reform. OCO designation can be applied to appropriation accounts. War funding can be designated for specific accounts within an appropriation act, with no single account for it in any agency. The Department of Defense (DOD) receives war funding in individual accounts in emergency supplemental, omnibus, or DOD Appropriation Acts to cover expenses related to military operations. With spending limits in place until FY2021, the definition of war funding may be broadly applied. For example, the House version of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act included $635 million in Title XV for OCO funding to address concerns about ending funding for A-10 ground attack aircraft. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act allocated $635 million in Title XV for OCO funding to support A-10 aircraft. The State Department has also requested emergency or OCO designations for diplomatic operations and USAID programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress has created new accounts to fund activities not covered by regular accounts, with some members expressing concerns about the broad application of OCO designation. The FY2015 House Budget Resolution report raises concerns about the OCO designation for war costs potentially being used to bypass spending limits. Members of the House Budget Committee have expressed worries about the broadening definitions of war costs during a hearing on the FY2015 OCO request. Members of the House Budget Committee, including Congressman Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Bill Pascrell, expressed concerns about the broadening definitions of war costs and the misuse of the OCO budget to bypass spending limits. They emphasized the need for clear and transparent budgeting to ensure that emergency spending is used for actual emergencies and not as an accounting gimmick. Members of the House Budget Committee, such as Congressman Adam Smith, criticized the OCO budget for being used as an accounting gimmick to bypass spending limits. Deputy Secretary Robert Work acknowledged that a significant portion of the OCO request is not directly related to the war in Afghanistan. Chairman Bud McKeon called for a broader definition of war costs to address readiness shortfalls developed over a decade of war. Deputy Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Winnefeld, emphasized the need to redefine the concept of overseas contingency operations to align with its original purpose. As U.S. troop levels decrease and budget caps remain in place, Congress will continue to debate what qualifies as emergency or OCO funding. Key questions include determining what constitutes an emergency and how war costs are defined by the Administration, DOD, and the State Department. The current budgetary law exempts \"emergency\" or \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" funding from budget caps, as designated by Congress and the President. This funding is considered \"unanticipated\" and requires the Chairs of budget committees to raise budget limits. A point-of-order challenge can be raised in the Senate, but would need to be sustained by 60 votes. The OCO designation was added in the Budget Control Act to provide an alternate way to designate war funding. DOD first received OCO funding in FY2012, exempt from budget limits. The OCO designation for DOD monies was first introduced in FY2012 to provide flexibility in funding war-related activities. There have been shifts in DOD definitions of war-related expenses over the years, leading to questions about limitations on what can be counted as war funding. The only requirement is that Congress and the Administration agree on the designation of funds as \"emergency\" or \"OCO.\" DOD's financial management regulations define war costs as expenses necessary to cover incremental costs incurred due to contingency operations. Only costs in addition to normal peacetime activities, such as those incurred because troops are deployed for war, are considered OCO. The guidance requires services to show how additional wartime deployments affect peacetime assumptions about troop levels. Investment costs were only to be included if necessary to support a contingency operation. Types of war costs included special pay for deployed personnel, activation of reservists, transportation of troops and equipment, military operations, in-country support, medical services, equipment repair, procurement of new weapons systems, RDT&E for combatting war threats, and Working Capital Funds. The Administration initiated programs and accounts to fund war-related activities such as improvised explosive devices, military construction, and intelligence gathering. Specific funds were allocated for training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi security forces, coalition support for regional allies, and emergency commanders' expenses. The curr_chunk discusses various funds allocated for war-related activities, including the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP), Afghan Infrastructure Fund (AIF), Task Force for Business Stability Operations (TFBSO), Joint Improvised Explosive Device (IEDs) Defeat Fund, and funds for purchasing critical war equipment quickly. These funds support U.S. efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, reconstruction projects, counter-insurgency efforts, and improving force protection against roadside bombs. Congress added funds for unanticipated expenses in the Department of Defense (DOD), such as basic housing allowances, fuel prices, and base support expenses. These funds were used for urgent mental health programs, aircraft production, National Guard and Reserve equipment, and transferring funds to war-designated funding accounts. In FY2014, $9.2 billion was moved from Operation and Maintenance funds to support various military operations. In FY2014, Congress shifted $9.2 billion from DOD's base budget to war funding, easing spending caps. DOD guidance emphasized that war funding must adhere to financial regulations, excluding non-war related expenses like Army's modularity funds. Services had to prove investments were directly linked to GWOT operations and executable in FY2007. In FY2007, plans for war operations funding were changed to reflect the \"longer war on terror\" criteria, with no clear definition of covered expenses. This shift in guidance from Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England aimed to align requests with the broader national strategy, potentially impacting DOD's regular base budget. Services expanded programs in response to the new criteria. The services expanded war-related programs and activities in response to new guidance on defense needs. This led to a significant increase in war-funded procurement, reaching a peak of $65.9 billion in FY2009. The policy change also resulted in nearly $300 billion in war-designated procurement between FY2001 and FY2014. Between FY2001 and FY2014, $300 billion, or 25% of the $1.2 trillion in procurement funds, was allocated to war-related needs. This funding was used for various purposes such as upgrading equipment, converting Army brigades to modular units, and accelerating modernization efforts. The Department of Defense (DOD) used war funding to accelerate modernization of its ground combat vehicles and increase stocks of small arms and support vehicles. In 2009, new guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) outlined criteria for war funding, which was modified in 2010 to include a broad geographic span for war-related activities. The Department of Defense used war funding to accelerate modernization of ground combat vehicles and increase stocks of small arms and support vehicles. New guidance in 2009 outlined criteria for war funding, which was expanded in 2010 to include a broad geographic span for war-related activities. The criteria allowed for the use of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds for various countries, with limited procurement and operational requirements. Costs are evaluated case-by-case, with fuel costs and \"sufficient cash\" for combat operations. War-related military construction is designed minimally for operational needs, temporary at non-enduring locations, with exceptions for enduring locations tied to surge operations. Some items are funded in the base budget instead of OCO, such as training equipment, upgrade programs, base closures, family support, childcare, spouse support, recruiting bonuses, and basic pay. Secretary of Defense Gates aimed to shift long-term war costs to the base budget. Robert Gates advocated for moving war costs to the base budget to address long-term needs for counter-terrorism operations, including expanding special operations forces and increasing funding for mental health. Approximately $8 billion was shifted from the war budget to the base budget in FY2010, with smaller amounts in FY2011. The Department of Defense also allocated funds in its base budget for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF) to combat IEDs, anticipating the threat to persist beyond the Afghan and Iraq wars. However, Congress decided to move this funding to the war-related Title IX of the DOD Appropriations Act. As a result, war procurement levels decreased from $65.9 billion in FY2008 to $29.8 billion in FY2011, alongside the end of U.S. combat operations and withdrawals from the region. In FY2011, war procurement fell to $16 billion, decreasing to $6 billion in the FY2015 request. Changes in force structure led to shifting definitions of war funding. The Army's modularity initiative aimed to extend dwell time between deployments, but studies questioned its effectiveness. The Army's modularity initiative aimed to extend dwell time between deployments, but studies questioned its effectiveness. Congress included funds in FY2005 and FY2006 war appropriations acts, with $25 billion set aside for future years. The 2006 England guidance reversed this decision, and FY2007 Supplemental included $3.6 billion for Army brigade teams and Marine Corps regimental combat team conversion. FY2008 war request included $1.6 billion for more modular brigades and equipment. In response to the need for long-term ground forces, the Department of Defense increased Army and Marine Corps personnel by 92,000 from pre-war levels. This initiative, known as \"Grow the Army,\" aimed to deploy substantial troops for stability operations. The Army's pre-war level would increase by 65,000, while the Marine Corps would grow by 27,000 active-duty forces. The FY2007 Supplemental budget included funds for additional military personnel and equipment. President Obama reversed the plan to size ground forces for long-term stability operations, emphasizing non-military means and military-to-military cooperation to address instability. U.S. forces will no longer be sized for large-scale, prolonged stability operations. In 2013, the President announced Army size reductions to meet budget control reductions. The President announced reductions in the size of the Army and Marine Corps to pre-war levels. The Department of Defense included funding in its war request to cover the excess personnel due to the strategic guidance change. Some argue that these transition costs should be funded in the base budget. The changing definitions of war funding include reset or reconstitution, which involves restoring equipment to pre-war levels. Reset funds cover depot maintenance costs and replacement when necessary. Between FY2004 and FY2008, reset costs saw the largest increase due to wear and tear on equipment from ongoing operations and a broadened definition of war-related costs. Estimates of reset costs have varied, with annual repair and replacement costs initially estimated at $8 billion in 2005. According to 2007 testimony, Army reset was estimated to be $12-13 billion annually for at least two to three years beyond the current conflict level. DOD front-loaded its reset needs in 2007, acknowledged by then-OMB Director Robert Portman. Congress has funded Army and Marine Corps reset requests, with some questioning the accuracy of DOD's requirements. Slow procurement obligations rates indicate frontloading reset, resulting in large carryovers of war-related investment from earlier appropriations. As of FY2008, DOD had $45 billion in unobligated war-related carryover. By April 2010, 40% of FY2009 war procurement funds were still unobligated. Reset funding was predicted to be needed 2-3 years after troops leave, leading to frontloading practices. In Iraq, reset funding decreased from $16.5 billion in FY2009 to $8.5 billion in FY2010, while troop strength dropped one-third. In FY2011, reset funding for Iraq remained at $8.9 billion as troop levels decreased by one-third. By FY2013, with troop levels at zero, Iraq reset funding dropped to $1.3 billion. In contrast, Afghan reset funding decreased from $12.7 billion in FY2011 to $8.4 billion in FY2014 despite troop reductions. The war funding increased to $9.2 billion with troop strength at 11,660, potentially frontloading reset requests. This funding helped with DOD's modernization and depot maintenance needs. Concerns were raised about extensive military construction indicating intentions for permanent bases in Iraq and Afghanistan, leading to provisions prohibiting such bases in defense acts. DOD infrastructure in Iraq and Afghanistan expanded significantly during the past decade of war, with military construction funding peaking at $4.2 billion in FY2008. Bases in these countries have either been returned or demolished following U.S. withdrawals. DOD tracks \"non-war\" costs, including bills, modularity, and congressional additions. \"Excess over strength\" is not considered a non-war cost by DOD. Between FY2001 and FY2014, \"non-war\" costs totaled $70.9 billion according to DOD's definition. The costs peaked at $12.1 billion in FY2008, dropped to $7 billion from FY2009 to FY2013, and then rose to $10 billion in FY2014. DOD's initial FY2015 war request was a \"placeholder\" figure, but a specific request of $58.6 billion was later submitted for the Afghan war and post-war Iraq activities. President Obama announced plans to decrease U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 33,000 by February 2014. President Obama announced plans to decrease U.S. troops in Afghanistan, with numbers decreasing to 9,800 by January 1, 2015, and further reductions to about 4,900 by January 1, 2016. The final goal is to have an \"embassy presence\" of about 1,000 troops by January 1, 2017. Reports suggest a possible delay in the reduction to 9,800 troops until at least the spring of 2015. The reduction of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, initially planned for January 1, 2015, may be delayed until the spring of 2015. President Obama's decision to provide more support for Afghan operations could lead to a need for retaining more U.S. troops. The Department of Defense's FY2015 war request is $26.6 billion, 31% lower than FY2014, with troop strength in Afghanistan decreasing by 69%. The size of a U.S. \"enduring presence\" in the region post-withdrawal remains a significant policy question with cost implications. The Department of Defense's FY2015 war request of $26.6 billion is 31% lower than FY2014, with troop strength in Afghanistan decreasing by 69%. DOD justifies the decrease in spending by citing the conclusion of the combat mission in Afghanistan after 13 years of war, but also mentions the costs of returning, repairing, and replacing equipment, as well as maintaining troops in the Middle East. War expenses are not expected to fall proportionately with troop levels due to the costs of closing bases, equipment maintenance, and troop presence in the region. The FY2015 DOD OCO request includes funding for Afghan national security forces, coalition partners, retrograde equipment, and personnel reset. It also allocates $4 billion for the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund and $925 million for the European Reassurance Fund. The FY2015 DOD OCO request includes funding for Afghan national security forces, coalition partners, retrograde equipment, and personnel reset. It also allocates $4 billion for the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund and $925 million for the European Reassurance Fund. Congress may evaluate DOD's request by reviewing past war funding appropriations, comparing costs of Iraq drawdown with proposed Afghanistan drawdown costs, and assessing the expansion of funding for counterterrorism training programs. In June 2014, the House-passed version of the DOD Appropriations bill, H.R. 4870, reflected the Administration's initial OCO placeholder request. The Senate-reported version of H.R. 4870 marked up DOD's amended request. Neither version included the additional $5.5 billion requested for DOD in November 2014 for combatting the Islamic State through air strikes in Syria and Iraq and training Iraqi security forces. The request is discussed separately due to being a new military operation. Evaluating the budget authority appropriated involves examining an agency's previous obligations history. Funds for day-to-day expenses like military personnel and Operation and Maintenance are available for one year, while procurement funds for weapon systems are available for three years. War funds are separately tracked and reported to Congress, with flexibility for DOD to move funds between accounts. Between FY2008 and FY2013, $17.2 billion in war funds lapsed, making up 2.3% of the total available. DOD transferred $9.8 billion from its base budget to meet war needs, ranging from $1.2 billion in FY2009 to $5.8 billion in FY2010. Between FY2008 and FY2013, $17.2 billion in war funds lapsed, making up 2.3% of the total available. The largest dollar amount of lapsed funds came from one-year monies for military personnel and O&M, while the highest shares of lapsed funding came from three-five year funds primarily for procurement. War obligations in FY2014 may exceed needs, with some obligations slower than the past five years. If obligations in the last quarter of FY2014 followed past patterns, O&M, Army obligations would total $22.7 billion out of $29.7 billion available, leaving $6.7 billion that could lapse unless funds were transferred for other uses. In August and September 2014, DOD requested to transfer $2.66 billion in FY2014 O&M, Army war funds for various purposes including airstrikes against IS, humanitarian aid for Ebola crisis, and buying Joint Strike Fighters and AH-64 helicopters. The funds were to be used for urgent war needs and other OCO requirements. Congressional approval was received to transfer funds for Navy's aviation fuel and maintenance for airstrikes in Iraq. DOD requested to transfer $2.66 billion in FY2014 O&M, Army war funds for airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, humanitarian aid for Ebola crisis, and purchasing Joint Strike Fighters and AH-64 helicopters. Congress approved funds for Navy's aviation fuel and maintenance for airstrikes in Iraq. Additionally, DOD tapped O&M, Army funds not needed for supporting Afghanistan to finance unanticipated expenses and requested to transfer $1.5 billion for purchasing helicopters and fighter jets to replace lost aircraft. Congress denied the request. In 2012, 6 AV-8Bs and 2 JSFs were lost. Congress denied requests for replacement purchases as they were already in DOD's future budget plans, violating OMB criteria for war funding. DOD implemented the FY2013 sequester on all accounts, both base and war, to protect wartime operations and investments funded in Overseas Contingency Operations. Hagel warned of utilizing funds originally budgeted for other purposes to provide resources for troops at war. DOD allocated $5.3 billion of its $37.2 billion sequester cut to war funding, with both base and OCO funds cut by 6%. OCO-designated O&M accounts were cut by 6% and OCO-designated procurement funds by 10%. DOD believed OCO funds could absorb the cuts without impacting war operations. The cost per troop over time in Iraq and Afghanistan has not decreased with higher troop levels as expected due to support costs and one-time expenses during withdrawals. Per-troop costs increased during withdrawals, especially in Afghanistan, but could be offset by lower costs for supporting fewer troops. The cost per deployed troop in Iraq and Afghanistan rose from $490,000 in FY2005 to $800,000 in FY2008 in Iraq, a 63% increase, and from $580,000 to $820,000 in Afghanistan, a 41% increase. Factors contributing to the rise in per-troop costs include the rising intensity of operating tempo and the unanticipated need for more force protection. The per-troop costs in Iraq and Afghanistan increased due to factors like rising operating tempo, need for more force protection, growth in base support facilities, higher command support, expanded war-related benefits, equipment usage effects, DOD policy decisions, and deficient wartime contracting practices. Per-troop costs doubled in Iraq from $800,000 in FY2008 to $1.6 million in FY2012, and fluctuated between $820,000 and $910,000 in Afghanistan between FY2008 and FY2011. Per-troop costs in Afghanistan are expected to increase by 345% based on the FY2015 request. The per-troop costs in Afghanistan are set to increase by 345% from $870,000 in FY2011 to $3.9 million in FY2015, surpassing the growth in Iraq. Congress has previously reduced DOD's request for similar trends in per-troop costs, transferring funds to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund and cutting Army Operation and Maintenance. The FY2015 war funding request shows a significant increase in operational expenses in Afghanistan compared to Iraq. The trends suggest that DOD's FY2015 request for operational expenses in Afghanistan may be higher than expected based on the Iraq withdrawal experience. Troop strength in Afghanistan more than doubled from 18,000 to 43,800 between FY2005 and FY2009, with a peak strength of 100,000 during the troop surge. The pace of troop withdrawal in Afghanistan is similar to Iraq, with troop levels dropping gradually after the peak. Troop levels in Afghanistan decreased gradually after the peak strength of 100,000 during the surge, reaching 12,000 in FY2015. Operational costs in Afghanistan closely followed changes in troop strength, unlike in Iraq where costs rose steadily while troop levels remained stable. Both wars saw significant declines in troop strength from peak levels. Investment costs in Iraq and Afghanistan changed in parallel with troop strength since FY2005. In Iraq, investment grew sharply despite stable troop levels, reflecting new guidance on war costs. Afghanistan's investment costs also followed troop strength, with high costs attributed to transportation and logistical challenges. The Administration's proposal for the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF) is a $4 billion OCO-designated transfer account aimed at responding to evolving terrorist threats. The fund allows for flexibility in spending across different accounts and geographical locations for various purposes. The Administration is requesting $4 billion for the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF) to address evolving terrorist threats. The fund allows for flexible spending and includes allocations for training Syrian opposition groups and a new European reassurance initiative to counter Russian actions in Ukraine. Congress can only object to fund transfers after receiving notifications 15 days in advance. The Administration is requesting $4 billion for the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF) to address evolving terrorist threats, including training Syrian opposition groups and a European reassurance initiative. Congress is debating the amount of flexibility to give DOD for fund transfers, balancing between flexibility and oversight. Flexible funding allows agencies to move money to different accounts based on evolving needs. CRS compared the CTPF proposal with other flexible war funds approved by Congress since 9/11. Congress established new accounts and spending caps to provide DOD flexibility for war-related activities. Funds can be provided in a lump sum or drawn from other accounts up to a cap, with some available for more than one year. Congress defines purposes, criteria, eligible countries, types of security assistance, and notification requirements for fund use. Administration requests are typically revised by Congress to reduce funding amounts. The Administration's FY2015 proposals for the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF) and the European Reassurance Initiative (ER) may be modified by Congress, as they have historically revised funding requests. Flexible war funding has fluctuated between 15% and 23% of total DOD war funding between FY2005 and FY2014, but the FY2015 DOD request increases this to 26%. Congress has approved lump-sum flexible funds in the past 13 years to provide DOD with flexibility for war-related activities. Congress has approved lump-sum flexible funds in the past 13 years to provide DOD with flexibility for war-related activities, including responding to uncertainties in wartime operations, expanding Train and Equip authorities, meeting urgent wartime requirements, and moving funds between accounts. Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Congress appropriated $40 billion to the Emergency Response Fund for the entire government. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress appropriated $40 billion to the Emergency Response Fund for the entire government. $10 billion was available immediately, another $10 billion within 15 days, and the remaining $20 billion as specified in a subsequent appropriations act. DOD's funds for operations in Afghanistan and response to the attacks were transferred to the Defense Emergency Response Fund. The Administration reported allocations of defense funds for wartime needs in new categories, which were later replaced by traditional appropriation accounts in the FY2002 Supplemental. At the start of the Iraq invasion, $75 billion was requested to be appropriated to the DERF. During the Iraq invasion, $75 billion was requested for the Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) to provide flexibility. Congress allocated $15.6 billion to the Iraq Freedom Fund (IFF) and $59.3 billion in traditional accounts. DOD had flexibility in the IFF account but Congress preferred traditional accounts for war funding. The Administration argues for broad flexibility in the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF) to respond quickly to crises worldwide. The Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF) aims to provide CT support to partner nations, address the conflict in Syria, support Iraqi security forces against the Islamic State, enhance U.S. capabilities for ISR and crisis response, with illustrative funding of $2.5 billion for CT operations, $1.0 billion for Syria, and unspecified amounts for other capabilities. Members of Congress raised concerns about a proposed crisis response fund of $500 million, fearing it could be a \"slush fund\" with little oversight. The fund lacked details, had broad scope, and allowed spending in any country without restrictions. Some suggested expanding existing authorities for logistical support instead. DOD officials defended the fund, stating it was meant to increase flexibility. James Winnefeld defended proposals to increase flexibility in responding to fast-moving situations or unexpected problems. Proposed spending would undergo rigorous interagency review, with Congress able to participate through 15-day advance notifications. In the FY2015 Continuing Resolution, limited authority was granted for the Syria Train-and-Equip program, allowing DOD to train vetted insurgent groups fighting the Islamic State under certain conditions. Reprogramming of funds from existing DOD sources would be required, with approval needed from the four congressional defense committees. The debate has focused on the Train-and-Equip provision for Syria, with concerns about the complex dynamics among Syrian groups. CTPF funds could be used for counterterrorism partners in various countries. The $500 million request for a Crisis Response Fund could allow military operations without seeking appropriations, raising concerns about oversight. The Administration requested $5.0 billion for DOD in an FY2015 supplemental to combat the Islamic State, including additional authority to Train and Equip Iraqi forces. Congress may revise this authority in the National Defense Authorization Act. The draft version of the NDAA extended the language in the CR, relying on reprogramming to fund Syria Train-and-Equip activities. The DOD CTPF request was reduced from $4.0 billion to $1.3 billion for a two-year program. The DOD CTPF request was reduced from $4.0 billion to $1.3 billion for a two-year program to build partnership capacity in the Middle East and Africa. The conference bill added congressional oversight and reporting requirements, with the proposed statutory language being broader than other flexible funds approved by Congress. The CTPF request resembles funds set up at the beginning of the Afghan and Iraq war, as well as other flexible funds created after the 9/11 attacks. The \"coalition support\" program, established in FY2003, allows DOD to reimburse other nations for logistical and military support for U.S. counterterror operations. Funds were appropriated in FY2009 and FY2011 for the Pakistan Counter-Insurgency Fund. Section 1203 authority permits DOD to use O&M monies to enhance counterterror capabilities in Yemen, Djibouti, and Somalia. Section 1206 authority allows DOD to train and equip foreign military forces for counterterror operations, with an annual funding cap of $200-300 million. Another authority supports Ugandan-led operations against the Lord's Resistance Army with $50 million annually. Section 1207 permits DOD to provide security assistance for stability operations, with an annual spending cap of about $100 million. The Global Security Contingency Fund was authorized in FY2012 with a spending cap of $350 million to enhance other countries' military capabilities for border security, counterterrorism, and internal defense. Congress restricted the Administration's requests for broad authorities and reduced spending limits in various cases. The Train-and-Equip authorities set funding levels for partnership-building activities, with some funded within other accounts up to statutory caps. Setting caps provides less flexibility than dedicated funding in a separate appropriation account. Funding levels for partnership-building activities are below the CTPF request, ranging from $25 million a year for Sec. 1207 activities to support for Pakistan's counterterror operations. The Administration's FY2015 DOD request includes $350 million for Sec. 1206 Global Train-and-Equip activities to aid counterterrorism efforts of other countries. An additional $1.0 billion is requested for the State Department for broadly defined goals. The effectiveness of earlier similar programs is still debated despite extensive studies. Despite extensive studies, there is no consensus on the overall success of security cooperation programs. The RAND Corporation's 2013 study identified 165 programs that create a complex \"patchwork\" of ways to build partner capacity. This patchwork is described as a tangled web with funding sources and programs supporting individual events, highlighting the need for multi-year, flexible authorities and a regional focus. The study highlights challenges in evaluating the effectiveness of security cooperation programs due to data limitations and lack of assessments. It also notes the difficulty in demonstrating the relationship between upgrading indigenous forces and reducing the need for U.S. combat forces to intervene. Additionally, concerns are raised about bias in assessments conducted by the same organizations that execute the activities. The effectiveness of security cooperation programs is difficult to evaluate due to data limitations and lack of assessments. Concerns about bias in assessments conducted by organizations that execute the activities exist. DOD conducted assessments of Sec. 1206 programs, finding improvements in recipients' ability for counterterrorism or stability operations, but limitations in absorptive capacity and sustainability. RAND's evaluation of partner nations post-World War II identified key success factors. The 2014 RAND study emphasizes the challenges in ensuring compatibility between the goals of the United States and partner nations, especially when working with insurgency groups or non-state actors. Difficulties also arise in obtaining consistent, long-term support from the government branches and dealing with unforeseen consequences. The 2014 RAND study highlights challenges in ensuring compatibility between U.S. and partner nations when working with insurgency groups. President Obama acknowledged uncertainties in the effectiveness of Train-and-Equip programs. ASFF and ISFF funding aims to create capable, independent forces. U.S. funding for ASFF and ISFF aims to create capable, independent forces to enable U.S. forces to leave. ASFF funding peaked at $11.6 billion in FY2010, then declined to $4 billion-$5 billion annually. ISFF funding fluctuated between $3.0 billion and $5.7 billion from FY2004 to FY2008, but dropped to zero in FY2012 as Iraqis took over funding and operational responsibility. In FY2008, Congress imposed restrictions on funding for infrastructure projects in Iraq, including rebuilding security forces. Concerns have been raised about the performance of contractors, coordination between different agencies, shortages in trainers, government corruption, absenteeism, illiteracy, and high attrition rates among local forces. Other concerns focus on the capabilities of indigenous forces to carry out operations. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR) raised oversight concerns as the US withdraws forces. Congress has provided funds for training and development of Iraqi security forces, with reports of \"ghost\" soldiers receiving salaries. The security environment in Iraq was stable but fragile, with declining violence levels despite activities by insurgent groups. Iraqi security forces were praised for their role in providing security during elections. Challenges remained, with extremist networks still capable of carrying out attacks. Iraq was deemed fragile due to unresolved political instability issues. The security environment in Iraq remains fragile as underlying sources of political instability persist. Despite the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 2011, Iraqi security forces were confident in their abilities, but Iraqi officials and public opinion were skeptical. The country was deemed fragile due to unresolved political instability issues. The RAND report commissioned by DOD highlighted weaknesses in the Iraqi security forces, particularly in the military capabilities and political instability issues. General Robert Caslen expressed confidence in the Iraqi Navy, Air Force, and Counter-Terrorism Service, but concerns remained about the Iraqi Army units competing with provincial governments and police. Observers noted a deterioration in Iraqi military capabilities in 2013, exacerbated by President Maliki's efforts to marginalize Sunnis. President Maliki's push to install loyalists, marginalize Sunnis, and corruption in armed forces and police led to a request for more U.S. military help. Senators criticized Maliki's mismanagement, calling for a comprehensive strategy. Despite increased arms sales, Iraqi military weaknesses were exposed in failed attempts to recapture Fallujah and Ramadi from Islamic State forces. The Iraqi Army struggled to recapture Fallujah and Ramadi from Islamic State forces despite deploying 42,000 troops. The collapse of Iraqi security forces was attributed to corruption, sectarianism, and limitations of the Train-and-Equip program. Congress also required a detailed assessment of Afghan security forces in the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act. The latest report on Afghan security forces (P.L. 110-181) acknowledges progress in taking over security responsibilities from U.S. troops but highlights serious issues with corruption, personnel attrition, and weaknesses in logistics, sustainment, officer quality, and contract administration. Afghan security forces face challenges with attrition, with about 30% of personnel needing to be replaced each year. Despite facing Taliban attacks, concerns remain about their capabilities. Some observers are worried that Afghan security forces may struggle without U.S. support during the planned troop withdrawal due to weaknesses in logistical, contracting, intelligence, and communication capabilities. Concerns have been raised about their ability to handle an increased Taliban threat in the coming years. SIGAR reported slower execution of plans and changes in the size of Afghan security forces, prompting reductions by Congress. Maintaining oversight of U.S. funding for ASFF is also a concern. The U.S. faces challenges in overseeing funding for ASFF and other reconstruction efforts as its presence in Afghanistan decreases. Congress has allocated significant sums for special accounts like the MRAP program and JIEDDF to address wartime needs quickly. The Joint Urgent Operational Needs account, successor to the Rapid Acquisition Fund, allows quick allocation of funds for unanticipated war needs. Congress also established the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) in 2003 to fund local reconstruction needs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Funding for CERP peaked at $1.2 billion in FY2007 and has decreased as troops were withdrawn. Funding for the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) has decreased as U.S. troops were withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan. Concerns about project selection, corruption, and effectiveness led to expanded reporting requirements and the establishment of the Afghan Infrastructure Fund (AIF) in FY2011. The Task Force for Business and Stability Operations was created in FY2011 to promote private sector growth in Afghanistan through foreign investment. Congress has imposed annual caps on transfers between DOD accounts for non-war funds and emergency funds. DOD can transfer funds between accounts for higher priority activities with approval from congressional defense committees. Transfer caps for base budget funds are generally $3-4 billion, while war funds have a cap of about $4 billion. In FY2015, a budget amendment of $5.5 billion in OCO funds was submitted to combat the Islamic State. The November budget amendment would increase DOD's OCO request from $58.6 billion to $63.6 billion to combat the Islamic State. Questions arise about the additional $5.0 billion request and the Train-and-Equip authority for Iraq. DOD estimated $855 million had been spent on IS operations as of November 20, 2014. As of November 20, 2014, DOD estimated that $855 million had been spent on the IS campaign in Syria, with an average daily cost of $8.1 million. DOD used OCO funds from FY2014 and FY2015 CR to finance airstrikes and military personnel deployment in Iraq and Syria. The incremental costs of Operation Inherent Resolve are being covered by funds appropriated in the FY2015 Continuing Resolution. DOD submitted an amendment to its FY2015 OCO request for an additional $5.0 billion for various military expenses related to Operation Inherent Resolve, including personnel expenses, fuel, supplies, repair costs, munitions replacement, and capacity building for Iraqi security forces and Kurdish tribal forces. The DOD requested $5.0 billion for military expenses related to Operation Inherent Resolve, including capacity building for Iraqi security forces, Kurdish and tribal forces, and humanitarian relief. The request also includes authority for the Secretary of Defense to waive certain provisions of law to facilitate the expenditure of funds. The proposal for the FY2015 NDAA requires Iraqi, Kurdish, and tribal security forces to contribute 40% of the $1.6 billion DOD request, with at least half from the government of Iraq. DOD obligations are capped at 60% until the contribution is received. The draft agreement deletes the exclusion of arms sales, allowing them to count as part of the contribution. The Secretary of Defense will monitor the contribution level and the Administration seeks to expand coalition support authorities to reimburse Iraq for logistical support of U.S. forces. The new Iraqi Train-and-Equip authority, similar to the Syria Train-and-Equip authority, would provide $15 million for emergencies and confidential military purposes. It aims to train and equip Iraqi, Kurdish, and tribal groups, but may face challenges similar to past programs. The additional request would increase U.S. troop strength in Iraq and Afghanistan by 4,000 in FY2015. The FY2015 OCO request includes increasing U.S. troop strength in and around Iraq and Afghanistan by 4,000, bringing the total to 79,047 troops. Predicting costs for countering the Islamic State is challenging due to the nature of the air campaign and uncertainties about mission expansion. Compared to previous air campaigns, counter-ISIL operations are more episodic and reactive. During Operation Allied Force in Serbia and Kosovo (1999), air operations targeted infrastructure and military bases. In contrast, ISIL attacks focus on \"targets of opportunity\" like units and equipment. Estimating costs and effects of attacks is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of ISIL activities. The President's Afghanistan withdrawal plan includes 9,800 U.S. troops. The President's Afghanistan withdrawal plan involves reducing U.S. troops to 4,900 by January 1, 2015, with an additional 1,000 for embassy presence and counterterrorism forces. There is consideration to keep more troops in Afghanistan due to training capacity shortages and expanded mission to provide air support in Iraq. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) reaffirmed their commitment to Operation Resolute Support, a non-combat mission in Afghanistan beyond 2014. No specific funding commitments were made beyond 2015, but ISAF agreed to support the Afghan National Security Force if a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) was signed. The BSA was signed on September 30, 2014, after President Ghani succeeded President Karzai. With over 60,000 U.S. troops in the region, Congress may need to consider future Department of Defense funding for the mission. In August 2014, DOD was considering future funding needs for post-withdrawal expenses in Afghanistan, including support for Afghan security forces, Train-and-Equip programs, equipment reset, and ISR programs. Press reports indicated that DOD would issue guidance for the FY2016 budget. DOD is considering retaining OCO funding for global counterterrorism amid BCA spending limits. Some argue for continued OCO funding due to threats like IS and Russian actions. Congress may lift sequester caps in later years. DOD may need to reduce funding by $176 billion over FY2012-FY2021 to meet BCA caps. Funding would essentially freeze at $499 billion in FY2016 and increase by $12 billion annually until FY2021. Questions arise about future war costs and whether Afghan security forces can maintain security as U.S. troops withdraw. The $5.0 billion requested for the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF) and the European Reassurance Fund request of $925 million in FY2015 are examples of potential OCO costs. There are uncertainties regarding residual war costs and the capability of Afghan security forces against the Taliban. The key issue is whether Afghan security forces can maintain gains against the Taliban post-withdrawal of U.S. and ISAF troops. Supporters of the drawdown point to a recent DOD report showing ANSF's ability to conduct independent operations, disrupt the insurgency, and protect the populace. However, critics argue that escalating violence and insurgent attacks may hinder Afghanistan's security once ISAF troops depart. The key issue post-withdrawal of U.S. and ISAF troops is whether Afghan security forces can maintain gains against the Taliban. Projections of long-term war costs vary, with estimates ranging from $20 billion to $98 billion by FY2021. The Administration projects war funding to decrease from $85 billion in FY2015 to $15 billion a year from FY2019-FY2024, with uncertainties in troop levels preventing estimates beyond the request year. A proposed $450 billion cap on war funding over the next 10 years has not gained legislative support. The Administration's FY2015 Mid-Session July 2014 update reflects a specific $58.6 billion DOD war request submitted in June 2014, increasing the annual placeholder figure to $33 billion. CBO projects war costs to rise from $87 billion in FY2015 to $98 billion in FY2021, totaling $646 billion over the next ten years. There are no statutory controls on future war funding, so CBO's projection extrapolates from the latest enacted level. The CBO projects an increase in war costs from $87 billion in FY2015 to $98 billion in FY2021, totaling $646 billion over the next ten years. Proposals to use savings from war funding for other purposes are criticized as budget gimmickry, as war spending reflects policy decisions about troop levels. CBO has produced alternative policy projections based on specific assumptions about future troop levels. The CBO projects a decline in war funding from $58 billion in FY2015 to $30 billion in FY2017, assuming troop levels will decrease over the years. This alternative scenario estimates a total of $340 billion in budget authority over 10 years, about half of the baseline estimate. The CBO does not provide detailed information on the basis for its cost estimate, which averages about $1 million per troop. The cost of Iraq withdrawal is influenced by factors such as the number and cost of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, the decline in regional troop levels, reset expenses post-withdrawal, and U.S. support for Afghan security forces. If U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan decrease as announced, costs could drop from $11 billion in FY2015 to about $1 billion in FY2017. Additionally, a 25% decrease in troops could lead to a cost reduction from $18 billion to $11 billion by FY2019. Reset expenses may occur for two to three years after troops leave, with costs potentially decreasing over time. Based on historical experience and commitments to Afghan security forces, U.S. war costs are projected to decrease from $58 billion in FY2015 to around $25 billion in FY2016, gradually declining to $15 billion for the rest of the decade. In response to concerns about expanding military operations, Congress has voted on amendments to limit military actions, drawing on past experiences in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Iraq. The President's decision to broaden the military's mission in Afghanistan has raised some questions, with Congress considering both funding and non-funding options. Congress has considered funding and non-funding options, with restrictions tied to appropriations being more effective. Restrictive funding options prohibit the use of appropriated funds for certain purposes, such as military activities. Past attempts to restrict funding have included cutting off funds for specific activities or setting conditions for fund usage. The president has leeway to set the date for military operations, with conditions like new authorization or events like the release of U.S. prisoners of war. Non-funding approaches to restrict military operations include troop withdrawal by a specified date or withdrawn funds without a declaration of war. Congressional resolutions can also limit military operations or forces withdrawn, influencing the course of events. The Cooper-Church provision prohibited U.S. ground troops in Cambodia after they were withdrawn. Congress passed provisions in 1973 to stop funding for combat in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Negotiations between the Administration and Congress led to the provision taking effect on August 15, 1973, which resulted in the bombing stopping on that day. The Vietnam-era jockeying between the Administration and Congress included several proposals, such as the McGovern-Hatfield amendments and the Cooper-Church amendment. These proposals aimed to restrict funding for U.S. troops in Indochina and Cambodia, with the enacted provision stopping funding for combat on August 15, 1973. During the current Congress, the House voted on resolutions and amendments to limit military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Syria. H.Con.Res. 105 prohibits the President from deploying U.S. armed forces in sustained combat in Iraq without specific authorization. H.Amdt. 928 to H.R. 4870 aimed to restrict funds for combat operations in Afghanistan after December 31, 2014. H.Amdt. 914 to H.R. 4870 stated that no funds in the Act may be used for combat operations. In the 112th Congress, amendments were considered to limit funds for withdrawal costs from Afghanistan: H.Amdt. 1103 to H.R. 4310 limited war funding to the safe withdrawal of troops (failed 113-303, May 17, 2012); H.Amdt. 330 to H.R. 1540 required a phased withdrawal of ground troops (defeated 123-294, May 25, 2011). During the House debate over the FY2010 Supplemental (H.R. 4899), three amendments were voted on to restrict funding or troop levels for the Afghan war: H.Amdt. 3 would have deleted all military funding for the Afghan war (defeated 25-376); H.Amdt. 4 would have limited the obligation and expenditure of funds to the protection and \"safe and orderly withdrawal from Afghanistan of all members of the Armed Forces and Department of Defense contractor personnel who are in Afghanistan\" (defeated 100-321); and H.Amdt. 5 would have required the President to submit a plan for a \"safe, orderly, and expeditious redeployment of the Armed Forces from Afghanistan,\" along with a \"timetable for the completion of that redeployment and information regarding variables that could alter that timetable,\" as well as require that none of the funds in the act be obligated or expended. The House debated over the FY2010 Supplemental (H.R. 4899) with three amendments voted on to restrict funding or troop levels for the Afghan war. H.Amdt. 5 required the President to submit a plan for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and prohibited funds from being used inconsistently with the withdrawal policy announced in 2009. U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2001-2015 are detailed in the appendix. In February 2009, OMB issued new budget guidance to DOD for war funding criteria. Revised in September 2010, the criteria successfully distinguish between base budget and overseas contingency operations. Enacted appropriations by act from FY2001-FY2014 are shown in the table. Since FY2009, DOD has provided a breakdown of war costs by function, aiding in comparing troop levels and costs. Table D-1 categorizes war costs into Operational, Investment, Programmatic support, and Other costs. Operational costs are linked to troop levels, while Investment covers equipment repair. Programmatic support includes training Afghan and Iraq security forces. Other costs are unrelated to war operations. Operational costs are expected to change with troop levels. In Iraq, overall and operational costs decreased by about 90% as troop strength dropped from 140,000 in FY2009 to 9,180 in FY2012. Funding fell from $89.1 billion to $9.6 billion. In Afghanistan, costs have not fallen proportionately despite a decrease in troop strength. Operational costs are high due to base dismantling and equipment disposal. The cost of support troops in Afghanistan and Iraq is a significant concern, with projections showing an increase in troop levels to 63,000 in FY2015. Reset costs in Afghanistan are expected to remain high during the withdrawal, unlike the rapid decrease seen in Iraq. The question of whether these costs should transition into DOD's base budget is raised. The high levels of funding for equipment reset in Afghanistan over the past 13 years may reflect \"forward financing,\" with estimated carryover orders of $3.5 billion in FY2014 and $2.9 billion in FY2015. Congress has historically reduced funding when carryover levels are high, questioning execution plans. Operational costs make up the bulk of war expenses in Afghanistan and Iraq, with reset costs in Iraq increasing due to heavy equipment use before decreasing. The FY2015 request for Afghanistan does not follow the historical pattern of war expenses. Programmatic costs cover various tools supporting troop operations indirectly, including training Afghan and Iraq security forces. Coalition support reimburses Pakistan for logistical costs of counterterror operations. The Commanders' Emergency Response Fund (CERP) is a local tool intended to provide assistance. The Commanders' Emergency Response Fund (CERP) provides funds for local development projects to win support of local populations. Funds for new systems to defeat Improvised Explosive Devices grew due to insurgent threats."
