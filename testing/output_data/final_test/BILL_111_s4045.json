    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Armed Career Criminal Sentencing Act of 2010\". Congress acknowledges that armed career criminals are individuals with prior criminal convictions and possession of a firearm, deemed particularly dangerous. The purpose of section 924(e) of title 18, United States Code, is to provide severe punishment for these offenders and protect the public from the risks they pose. The Supreme Court requires district courts to use a \"categorical approach\" to determine if prior convictions warrant an enhanced sentence. The Supreme Court's \"categorical approach\" under section 924(e) limits judges to reviewing the language of prior convictions, leading to inconsistent sentencing and burdening the judicial system. The Court's concern about right-to-jury-trial issues restricts a more thorough inquiry into prior convictions. The statutory maximum sentence under section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code, has been increased to life imprisonment. Despite efforts by Federal prosecutors, there have been instances where armed career criminals were not sentenced as intended due to limitations imposed by the Supreme Court's \"categorical approach\" under section 924(e). The determination of whether State and local offenses qualify as crimes of violence or serious drug trafficking offenses has led to costly and time-consuming litigation due to disparities in State criminal laws. Congress believes in the need for more uniform sentencing provisions under section 924(e) to ensure equality, fair treatment, and public safety. Federal judges should have the authority to determine if a conviction warrants enhancement, allowing them to fulfill their traditional sentencing roles. This Act aims to lower the maximum sentence to empower judges in making sentencing judgments as per the Constitution of the United States. This Act aims to lower the maximum sentence under section 924(e) to 25 years and increase the maximum sentence under section 922(g) to 25 years, allowing judges to exercise sentencing discretion without implicating Apprendi principles. Congress anticipates minimal changes in sentences for non-armed career criminals under section 922(g). The Act aims to lower the maximum sentence under section 924(e) to 25 years and increase the maximum sentence under section 922(g) to 25 years. Prosecutors have discretion to decide whether to use prior convictions to enhance penalties.

The court can consider previous convictions by reviewing judicial records, presentence reports, or other evidence to determine if the person has prior convictions. The determination must be made by a preponderance of the evidence. SEC. 5. DIRECTIVE TO UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION. The United States Sentencing Commission is directed to review and revise the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and policy statements related to offenses under section 924(e)(1) of title 18, United States Code, in response to an amendment to section 924(e)(2)(B) of title 18, United States Code. This includes revising the definition of \"crime of violence\" and sections 4B1.1 and 4B1.4 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The sentencing court can use all reliable evidence to determine if a prior conviction qualifies as an offense under section 924(e)(2)(B) of title 18, United States Code."
