The Comptroller General must submit a legislative proposal to Congress and the President to reorganize executive branch agencies, aiming to decrease the number of agencies promoting American competitiveness and achieve cost savings in support for American businesses within one year of the Act's enactment. The term \"agency\" is defined as provided in title 5, United States Code. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF GAO LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. The term \"bill\" in this section refers to a bill that implements a legislative proposal submitted to Congress within a 90-day period. Bills introduced in the House or Senate must be referred to the appropriate committee. Amendments to the bill are not allowed in the committee. If the committee has not reported the bill within a 20-day period, it may be discharged. The bill must be discharged from committee if not reported within a 20-day period. After discharge, any member can move to proceed with the bill's consideration. The motion to proceed with the consideration of a bill is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and privileged in the Senate. It is not debatable, amendable, or subject to postponement. If agreed to, the respective House must immediately proceed with the bill without interruption, and it remains the unfinished business until disposed of. Debate on the bill and all debatable motions limited to 2 hours, divided equally. Amendments not allowed. Motion to limit debate allowed. Postponement, consideration of other business, or recommitment motions not allowed. Vote on final passage occurs after debate. Appeals from Chair's decisions allowed.

If one House receives a bill from the other House, it cannot be referred to a committee and can only be considered for final passage. The receiving House's procedure for its own bill remains unchanged. Upon receiving a bill from the other House, it can only be considered for final passage without referral to a committee. Once the bill from the other House is dealt with, the original bill from the receiving House cannot be considered. The computation of time excludes days when either House is adjourned for more than three days. This section is enacted by Congress as part of the rules of each House for bill procedures. The rules for bill procedures in each House allow for the consideration of a bill without referral to a committee when received from the other House. These rules also specify that the original bill from the receiving House cannot be considered once the bill from the other House is dealt with. Additionally, the rules acknowledge the constitutional right of each House to change its rules regarding procedures at any time."
