    "content": "In the years following Gregg, Justice Stevens focused on the importance of \"fundamental fairness\" in death penalty cases. He believed that the ultimate punishment of death required a higher level of reliability in its application. Stevens consistently voted to narrow the scope of the death penalty by limiting who was eligible for it and increasing protections for capital defendants. He also opposed judges overriding jury decisions on the death penalty, restricted emotional victim impact statements, and advocated for better legal representation for those facing capital punishment. Justice Stevens focused on narrowing the application of the death penalty by limiting eligibility, increasing protections for defendants, opposing judicial overrides of jury decisions, restricting victim impact statements, and advocating for better legal representation. One landmark case that exemplifies his efforts is Atkins v. Virginia, where he successfully drew five other justices to his position. Atkins v. Virginia showcases Justice Stevens's approach to the death penalty, focusing on state trends and skepticism towards capital punishment justifications. The case involved a mentally retarded defendant sentenced to death, which Stevens overturned as disproportionate and violating the Eighth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive punishment demands that penalties be proportioned to the offense, judged by evolving societal standards. The Court looks to state legislatures as indicators of contemporary values, especially regarding the death penalty for the mentally retarded. Justice Stevens noted a clear trend towards prohibiting the death penalty for the mentally retarded, emphasizing the consistency of this change among states. He concluded that a national consensus had developed against this practice, highlighting the shift in societal values. Stevens prioritized current trends over majority state legislatures' positions and found that the social purposes of retribution and deterrence were not sufficient justifications for executing the mentally retarded. Justice Stevens argued that retribution and deterrence were not adequate justifications for executing mentally retarded individuals. He emphasized that the lesser culpability of mentally retarded defendants did not warrant retribution through the death penalty. Additionally, he pointed out that their diminished ability to engage in logical reasoning and control impulses made deterrence ineffective. In 2008, Justice Stevens abandoned his three-decade endeavor of attaining a narrowed, fair, and non-discriminatory capital punishment system. He cited back to the Court's decision in Furman, asserting that capital punishment was \"patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment\" in Baze v. Rees. In a challenge to Kentucky's lethal injection procedure, Justice Stevens questioned the rationales behind the death penalty, arguing against deterrence and retribution. He highlighted the lack of evidence for deterrence and how painless executions undermine the retribution rationale. Justice Stevens criticized the Court's death penalty jurisprudence, pointing out failures in jury selection and the emotional impact of capital offenses leading to a higher risk of error in capital cases. Justice Stevens criticized the Court's death penalty jurisprudence, highlighting the risk of error in capital cases due to emotional impact and discriminatory application, ultimately concluding that the death penalty is excessive and serves little social purpose. Justice Stevens criticized the Court's death penalty jurisprudence, pointing out the risk of error in capital cases and discriminatory application, concluding that the death penalty is excessive and serves little social purpose. Despite his belief that the death penalty is unconstitutional, Stevens voted to uphold the Kentucky lethal injection statute, citing respect for existing precedents. His position on capital punishment has evolved over time, from supporting the death penalty to questioning its constitutionality. Justice Stevens' jurisprudence has been consistently guided by his belief in \"fundamental fairness\" and the recognition that \"death is different.\" After more than 30 years of experience with death penalty cases, he questions whether sentencing a defendant to death can ever be consistent with the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment. With his retirement imminent, the Court faces the loss of its most vocal death penalty opponent."
