    "content": "The \"Predisaster Hazard Mitigation Act of 2010\" has been successful in reducing loss of life, injuries, property damage, and community disruption from disasters. The program has saved taxpayers money by investing in mitigation techniques, with a Congressional Budget Office report showing a $3 reduction in losses for each dollar invested. The Congressional Budget Office found that projects funded under the predisaster hazard mitigation program could lower the need for post-disaster assistance from the Federal Government, saving taxpayer funds. A 2005 report by the Multihazard Mitigation Council showed that on average, $1 invested in hazard mitigation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency provided the Nation with roughly $4 in benefits. The report projected that mitigation grants awarded between 1993 and 2003 would save lives and prevent injuries over 50 years. Increasing funds for the predisaster hazard mitigation program would be a wise investment. The President shall award financial assistance on a competitive basis. The President shall provide financial assistance to States based on specific criteria, ensuring a minimum of $575,000 or 1% of total funds appropriated, and a maximum of 15% of total funds. Authorization of appropriations under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended accordingly. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to authorize appropriations of $180,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2013. Technical corrections are made to references in the Act, replacing \"Director\" with \"Administrator\" in most instances. Section 203 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include a prohibition on earmarks, defining \"congressionally directed spending\" as specific discretionary budget authority requested by a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives. The amendment to Section 203 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act prohibits earmarks and directs that funds must be awarded through a competitive process, with certification required by the Administrator of FEMA to Congress. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
