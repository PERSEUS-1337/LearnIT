This section, labeled as SEC. 32, outlines the process for providing payments to these states. The Gulf Coast Protection Act of 2006, also known as the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, defines key terms related to coastal political subdivisions, coastal states, and coastal producing states. The Gulf Coast Protection Act of 2006, also known as the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, defines key terms related to coastal political subdivisions, coastal states, and coastal producing states. The Act specifies that a 'State' is a coastal State with a boundary within 200 nautical miles of a leased tract on the outer Continental Shelf. It excludes States with a majority of coastline under leasing moratoria as of January 1, 2006. A 'leased tract' is a tract maintained or leased under specific sections of the Act. 'Qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues' refer to amounts received by the United States from each leased tract or portion. The term 'qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues' includes bonus bids, rents, royalties, net profit share payments, and related late-payment interest from natural gas and oil leases issued under this Act. The Act excludes revenues from leased tracts in areas under leasing moratorium as of January 1, 2006, unless the lease was in production on that date. The Secretary of the Treasury disburses 50% of qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues to coastal producing States annually. The Act allocates amounts to coastal producing States based on qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues generated off their coastlines, with an exception for multiple coastal producing states within 200 nautical miles of a leased tract. The Act allocates amounts to coastal producing States based on qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues generated off their coastlines. For any portion of a leased tract, the allocation to each State is inversely proportional to the distance between the nearest coastline point and the geographic center of the tract. 35 percent of the State's share is allocated to coastal political subdivisions based on a specific formula. The Act allocates amounts to coastal producing States based on qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues generated off their coastlines. Allocation to coastal political subdivisions is based on respective distances to the geographic center of each leased tract, coastline length ratios, and coastal population ratios. The Act allocates funds to coastal producing States and political subdivisions based on population ratios. Funds must be used for conservation, protection of coastal areas, mitigation of natural resource damage, and outer Continental Shelf impact. The Act allocates funds to coastal producing States and political subdivisions based on population ratios for various purposes such as hurricane protection, flood control, levee construction, erosion prevention, wetlands conservation, and infrastructure development for trade and public safety. Coastal producing States can also use funds for additional eligible payments. The Act allocates funds to coastal producing States and political subdivisions based on population ratios for purposes like hurricane protection, flood control, levee construction, erosion prevention, wetlands conservation, and infrastructure development. Coastal producing States can also use funds for eligible payments under section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act."
