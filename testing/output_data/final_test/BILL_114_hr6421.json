    "content": "The \"Anti-Semitism Awareness Act of 2016\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including against Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, and other religious groups based on shared ancestry, ethnic characteristics, citizenship, or residence in a country with a dominant religion. The Department of Education issues Dear Colleague letters to help schools comply with Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics among religious groups like Jews, Muslims, and Sikhs. The Department of Education issued Dear Colleague letters in 2004 and 2010 regarding schools' obligations under Title VI to address incidents of religious discrimination, particularly against Arab Muslim, Sikh, and Jewish students. Title VI does not cover discrimination based solely on religion, but groups facing discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics are protected. \"Title VI protects students from discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, including Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh students. Anti-Semitism is a persistent issue in schools and campuses, with Jewish students facing threats and harassment that create a hostile environment.\" The 2010 Dear Colleague letter emphasized the need for schools to address anti-Semitic conduct that may be disguised as anti-Israel or anti-Zionist behavior. The definition and examples provided in the letter have been helpful in identifying discriminatory actions that cross the line into anti-Semitism. Awareness of the definition of anti-Semitism provided in the 2010 Dear Colleague letter will help identify discriminatory actions that cross the line into anti-Semitism, assisting the Department of Education in determining if an investigation under title VI is necessary. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines anti-Semitism based on the Special Envoy's definition and examples from the Fact Sheet. In reviewing violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 based on race, color, or national origin, the Department of Education will consider anti-Semitism as part of the assessment for alleged practices motivated by anti-Semitic intent. This Act does not infringe upon First Amendment rights."
