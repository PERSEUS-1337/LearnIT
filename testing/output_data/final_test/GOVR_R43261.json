    "content": "The executive branch of the U.S. federal government requires developers of border crossing energy facilities to obtain a Presidential Permit. The controversy over the Keystone XL oil pipeline has brought attention to federal permitting of energy infrastructure border crossings. Projects crossing the U.S.-Mexico or U.S.-Canada border must be authorized through a Presidential Permit in accordance with executive orders. This report discusses the source of executive branch authority, standards, and approved projects. The report discusses the Presidential Permitting framework for energy infrastructure projects, including the authority vested in the U.S. State Department since Executive Order 11423 in 1968. Executive Order 13337 amended the procedures but did not substantially alter the authority or its delegation to the Secretary of State. Proposed changes in the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act (H.R. 2883) passed in the House on July 19, 2017. The Secretary of State is designated to receive applications for permits for various cross-border facilities, excluding electric energy facilities. This includes pipelines, conveyor belts, water/sewage facilities, transportation facilities, and bridges, where congressional authorization is not required. Executive Order 13337 empowers the Secretary of State to handle Presidential Permit applications. The Secretary of State is responsible for receiving applications for Presidential Permits for cross-border facilities related to the exportation or importation of petroleum, petroleum products, coal, or other fuels. If issuance of a permit is deemed to serve the national interest, the Secretary will prepare and authorize the permit accordingly. The Secretary of State receives applications for Presidential Permits for cross-border facilities related to fuel transportation. The determination of national interest considers factors like energy security, environmental impacts, and compliance with regulations. An example is the Enbridge Energy's Alberta Clipper crude oil pipeline, which received a Presidential Permit in 2009 for transporting oil from Canada to the US Midwest. The State Department approved a crude oil pipeline project between Canada and the United States, citing strategic interests such as diversifying oil sources, shortening transportation pathways, and increasing supplies from a non-OPEC producer. This decision signals economic stability and reliability for the future. The State Department approved a crude oil pipeline project between Canada and the United States, citing strategic interests such as diversifying oil sources, shortening transportation pathways, and increasing supplies from a non-OPEC producer. This decision signals economic stability and reliability for the future. The project will also provide construction jobs in the United States in the immediate term. The State Department considered greenhouse gas emissions associated with the project, stating that reductions are best addressed through domestic policies and international agreements. Each project is evaluated on a case-by-case basis due to various factors like technology, environmental conditions, and energy market conditions. The permitting process for cross-border natural gas pipelines and electric energy facilities is addressed in the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, and Executive Order 10485. Executive Order 10485 designates the now-defunct Federal Power Commission to receive and evaluate permit applications for these facilities at the borders of the United States. The Secretary of Energy has the authority to issue permits for the construction, operation, maintenance, or connection of natural gas pipelines to or from foreign countries. This authority is similar to that granted to the State Department in Executive Orders 11423 and 13337, with judicial opinions confirming it as a legitimate exercise of the President's constitutional authority in foreign affairs. Executive Order 10485 empowered the Federal Power Commission to issue Presidential Permits for cross-border electric facilities, citing federal statutes for permitting authority. The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 eliminated the need for Presidential Permits for natural gas pipelines to or from foreign countries. The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 transferred the Federal Power Commission's functions to the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). DOE retained import/export permitting authority for border crossing facilities, issuing Presidential Permits under Executive Order 10485. FERC took over natural gas pipeline border crossing permitting in 2006. Presidential Permits are required for new facilities or significant upgrades to existing ones. The need for a new Presidential Permit or an amended Permit arises when there are significant changes to border crossing facilities. The determination of whether a permit amendment is required depends on the specific modifications proposed for each facility. The 2013 Presidential Permit for the NOVA Chemicals pipeline specifies that substantial changes must be approved by the Secretary of State or delegate. The need for a new Presidential Permit or an amended Permit arises when there are significant changes to border crossing facilities. The determination of whether a permit amendment is required depends on the specific modifications proposed for each facility. FERC regulations govern the authorization of facilities to construct, operate, or modify natural gas import/export facilities, with guidance provided by relevant agencies. The State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs has outlined the application process for FERC authorizations, including the requirement to apply for a permit when amending existing authorized facilities. The State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs published Interpretive Guidance on Non-Pipeline Elements of E.O. 13337, specifying that \"substantial modifications\" to existing border crossings require a new or amended Presidential Permit. This guidance may also apply to other agencies overseeing facility permits. The Interpretive Guidance on Non-Pipeline Elements of E.O. 13337 specifies that significant modifications to existing border crossings necessitate a new or amended Presidential Permit. This applies to changes such as new construction, ownership transfers, conveyance alterations, and any modifications that would impact the definition of covered U.S. facilities in a permit. The Interpretive Guidance on Non-Pipeline Elements of E.O. 13337 categorizes modifications into Red (notification and new permit required), Yellow (notification and possible new permit), and Green (no notification or permit needed). Red category aligns with substantial modification definition. Yellow includes capacity changes, temporary changes, and ownership shifts. Green covers regular maintenance, exterior changes, system changes, and State Department-directed modifications. DOE regulations offer limited guidance on when an electric transmission facility modification requires a new or amended permit. The DOE regulations require a new or amended Presidential Permit for significant facility modifications, such as changes in ownership or modifications beyond regular maintenance that may impact reliability. Recent permitting decisions indicate that any modification with reliability impacts would likely necessitate a new permit. Examples include a new permit for Energia Sierra Juarez in 2012, which stated that subsequent phases of a wind project requiring changes to the facility would need an amended permit, and a new permit for ITC Transmission for transformer upgrades. The executive branch's permitting authorities in Executive Orders are authorized by legislation or inherent presidential powers based in the Constitution. Executive Order 11423 does not specify its authority source, while Executive Order 13337 references the Constitution and laws of the United States. Executive Order 13337 allows the President to delegate authority to the head of any department or agency in the executive branch. Executive Order 10485 delegates authority to permit cross-border electricity transmission facilities and natural gas pipelines to the head of any department or agency in the executive branch. It emphasizes the need for executive permission for the construction and maintenance of such facilities at the borders of the United States. Federal courts have addressed the legitimacy of cross-border permitting authority not explicitly granted by statute, as seen in Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate v. U.S. Department of State. The U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota ruled that the President's authority to issue or revoke a presidential permit for the TransCanada Keystone Pipeline is within his inherent constitutional authority to conduct foreign policy, not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court stated that the regulation of cross-border pipelines falls under the jurisdiction of Congress or the President. The court ruled that the President has the sole authority to allow oil pipeline border crossings under his constitutional authority over foreign affairs. In Sierra Club v. Clinton, the plaintiff challenged the Secretary of State's decision to issue a permit for the Alberta Clipper, claiming it was unconstitutional. The defendant argued that the President's authority to issue permits for border crossing facilities comes from his constitutional authority over foreign affairs and as Commander in Chief. The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota agreed with the defendant's argument that the President has constitutional authority over foreign affairs and as Commander in Chief to issue permits for border crossing facilities. The court noted historical recognition of the President's authority in issuing such permits and Congress's implied approval through inaction, making the permit requirement for border facilities constitutional. The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota upheld the President's constitutional authority to issue permits for border crossing facilities, citing historical recognition and Congress's implied approval through inaction. The court stated that legislative authorization is not required for the President's exercise of cross-border infrastructure permitting authority. Congress has considered bills to amend the permitting process, but the Executive Memorandum issued by President Trump in 2017 and the subsequent permitting of the Keystone XL pipeline border crossing facility have potentially eliminated the need for legislative action in this case. Many in Congress still aim to reform the process. The House passed the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act (H.R. 2883) to eliminate the Presidential Permit requirement for cross-border energy infrastructure. Developers would now need \"certificates of crossing\" from FERC or DOE for different types of infrastructure, but the State Department would still oversee hazardous liquids pipelines like natural gas liquids."
