    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"At-Home Infant Care Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to infant care. Congress finds that the quality and nature of care-taking in the first months and years of life are critical to a newborn's subsequent development, but there is an extreme shortage of quality, affordable child care for infants. The shortage of quality, affordable infant care is a significant issue, especially in rural areas with a high percentage of low-wage residents. Only 18 percent of the potential need for licensed infant slots is currently being met. Working parents should be able to provide this care themselves without compromising family economic stability.
