    "content": "Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) prohibits corporate or labor union funds from being used for \"electioneering communications,\" defined as broadcast transmissions targeting federal candidates within specific timeframes. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld this provision in McConnell v. FEC, despite regulating both campaign speech and issue advocacy. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which prohibits corporate funds from being used for \"electioneering communications.\" Wisconsin Right to Life challenged this provision when they planned to run ads urging viewers to contact Senators Feingold and Kohl. They believed they had a First Amendment right to broadcast the ads, leading to a lawsuit against the FEC. The FEC denied a preliminary injunction to Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL) challenging Section 203 of the BCRA. The Supreme Court vacated the lower court judgment, allowing for future as-applied challenges. After intervention by Members of Congress, the district court granted WRTL summary judgment, declaring Section 203 unconstitutional as applied. The Supreme Court granted Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL) summary judgment, ruling that Section 203 of BCRA was unconstitutional as applied to WRTL's ads. The Court found that the ads were genuine issue ads, not express advocacy, and therefore should have been permissible to broadcast. The decision was made in a 5 to 4 ruling in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL II), with Chief Justice Roberts writing the plurality opinion. The Court ruled that ads by Wisconsin Right to Life were not the functional equivalent of express advocacy, falling outside McConnell's scope. The Court recognized the blurred line between campaign and issue advocacy but emphasized the need to protect political speech. The FEC appealed the ruling in WRTL II, arguing McConnell had already addressed the issue. The Court ruled that the FEC, not Wisconsin Right to Life, had the burden of proving that Section 203 of BCRA was constitutional as applied to its ads. The FEC needed to show that the ads fell within the category of express advocacy or its equivalent. The Court ruled that the FEC must prove that banning ads during blackout periods is narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest if the speech is not express advocacy or its equivalent. The Court disagreed with using McConnell's test for determining the functional equivalent of express advocacy, stating that no standard had been adopted for future challenges. The analysis in McConnell was based on the evidentiary record, showing that BCRA's definition of Electioneering Communications accurately captures ads intended to influence elections. The McConnell Court did not adopt a specific test for determining the \"functional equivalent\" of express advocacy in assessing Section 203 of BCRA. Instead, it emphasized the need for an objective standard focusing on the substance of the communication in an as-applied challenge. The Court emphasized the need for an objective standard in assessing Section 203 of BCRA, focusing on the substance of the communication rather than intent or effect. The standard should allow for quick dispute resolution without chilling speech and give the benefit of the doubt to protecting speech. The Court held that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if it can only be reasonably interpreted as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate, which WRTL's three ads did not meet. The Court found that ads must meet the functional equivalent of express advocacy standard, focusing on legislative issues and not mentioning elections or candidates. Contextual factors should not excuse discovery in determining ad content. The Court applied the standard for as-applied challenges to ads sought to be broadcast by WRTL, finding that the FEC failed to show they were the functional equivalent of express advocacy. The government's interest in preventing corruption has been used to justify contribution and spending limits on electioneering expenditures. The Court ruled that the WRTL ads are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy and cannot be regulated based on the government's interest in preventing corruption. The First Amendment protects political speech, and the tie goes to the speaker, not the censor. Justice Souter dissented, arguing that WRTL II overruled a portion of McConnell v. FEC. The dissent in the case of BCRA argued that Section 203 was less restrictive than the Court's ruling suggested, as it did not completely ban corporate and labor union funds from being used for electioneering communications. Nonprofit corporations could still criticize or support a candidate close to an election through various means, including newspaper ads or websites, using general treasury funds as long as they did not directly finance such ads. The dissent in the WRTL II case warned that the Supreme Court's ruling could allow even ads with express advocacy to avoid regulation under Section 203, limiting the application of federal law on corporate and labor union funds for ads close to elections. The Court's decision did not explicitly overturn McConnell v. FEC but indicated a narrowing of restrictions on electioneering communications. The Supreme Court's ruling in WRTL II upheld a portion of the BCRA but indicated limitations on the FEC's ability to regulate electioneering communication. The constitutionality of this provision is being reconsidered in the Citizens United v. FEC case, with a decision expected in early 2010."
