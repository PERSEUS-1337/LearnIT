    "title": "AB 1176",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that theft of firearms and receipt of stolen firearms pose unique dangers to public safety, regardless of their monetary value. Therefore, restoring penalties for stolen firearms is necessary to address this specific threat. The Legislature aims to give voters the choice to decide on penalties for firearm thefts and receipt of stolen firearms, without undermining previous decisions on penalties for low-level theft. Section 490.2 of the Penal Code is amended accordingly. Section 490.2 of the Penal Code is amended to state that theft of property under $950 is considered petty theft and punishable as a misdemeanor, with exceptions for prior convictions. This does not apply to thefts that can be charged as an infraction under other laws. The theft of a firearm is considered grand theft and is punishable under Section 489 of the Penal Code. Section 496 is amended to address this issue. Section 496 of the Penal Code addresses the buying, receiving, or concealing of stolen property, with penalties ranging from misdemeanor to felony based on the value of the property and the individual's criminal history. A principal involved in the theft of property can be convicted under this section, but cannot be convicted of both this offense and the theft of the same property. Every swap meet vendor, person dealing in merchandise, or their representatives who buy stolen property over $950 without making reasonable inquiries can be imprisoned for up to one year. Every swap meet vendor, person dealing in merchandise, or their representatives who buy stolen property under $950 without making reasonable inquiries can be guilty of a misdemeanor. Injured parties can seek three times the amount of actual damages, costs of suit, and attorney's fees. Section 29805 of the Penal Code is amended to include penalties for buying or receiving stolen firearms, or aiding in concealing them, punishable by up to one year in county jail or imprisonment under Section 1170. Any person convicted of specific misdemeanor offenses involving firearms or related offenses listed in the Penal Code may face penalties as outlined in Section 29805. Any person convicted of a firearm-related offense may face imprisonment or a fine. The court must notify the Department of Justice of individuals subject to this law, but the prohibition may be modified as provided in other sections. The text discusses the financial implications of the act and its amendments to the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, Proposition 47. The act will only incur costs for local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. The amendments will only take effect upon approval by voters in a statewide election. A special election is called on November 8, 2016, for voter approval of Sections 2 and 3 of the act, to be consolidated with the statewide general election. The Secretary of State will submit the sections for approval, and the act will go into immediate effect."
