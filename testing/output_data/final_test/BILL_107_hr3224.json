    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Drinking Water Assistance Act.\" It includes findings related to drinking water assistance. Congress finds that drinking water standards proposed and in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act will place a large financial burden on many public water systems, especially those in rural communities serving small populations. Limited resources in small communities complicate regulatory implementation, making it difficult for them to afford upgrading public water systems and training personnel. Small communities lack a tax base to cover the costs of improving drinking water quality, leading to high per capita expenses. Small communities lack resources to improve drinking water quality and face financial burdens due to proposed standards. A grant program is needed to fund water quality projects for rural areas, as there is currently no federal program meeting their needs. Implementation of new arsenic drinking water standards should not be delayed. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to provide assistance for small public water systems, including defining Indian tribes and establishing a program for small public water systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to define eligible activities for small public water systems, including obtaining technical assistance and training operators to comply with drinking water standards. The term 'eligible activity' excludes projects to increase the population served by a small public water system, unless deemed necessary by the Administrator. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to define eligible activities for small public water systems, including compliance with regulations and providing water supply to unserved populations. Eligible entities are small public water systems in states or areas governed by Indian Tribes, serving disadvantaged communities. The term 'Program' refers to the small public water systems serving disadvantaged communities or communities expected to become disadvantaged as a result of eligible activities in areas governed by Indian Tribes. The term 'Program' refers to the small public water assistance program established under section 1472(a). The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Indian Health Service. A 'small public water system' serves a community with a population of not more than 200,000 or the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The small public water system assistance program, established under section 1472(a), serves communities with a population of not more than 200,000 or the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Administrator will establish a grant program for eligible entities to comply with drinking water standards based on financial need and per capita cost. Eligible entities can apply for the program. An eligible entity seeking a grant under the Program must submit a 3-page application to the Administrator, including a description of needed activities, efforts to comply with drinking water standards, and any other required information. Upon receipt, the Administrator will review and approve applications. The Administrator forwards applications to the Council for review. Within 90 days of receiving Council recommendations, the Administrator approves or disapproves the application. If disapproved, the Administrator informs the applicant in writing with reasons for the decision. The Administrator forwards applications to the Council for review and approves or disapproves within 90 days. If disapproved, the applicant is given a deadline for revision. The Federal share of costs for eligible activities under the Program is limited to 90%, with a waiver option for financial hardship. Enforcement and implementation of standards are also outlined. The Administrator shall not enforce drinking water standards against an eligible entity during the grant application process, with specific timelines based on approval or disapproval. The Administrator will not enforce drinking water standards on eligible entities during the grant application process, with specific timelines based on approval or disapproval. The implementation of drinking water standards under this Act in any State is postponed until January 1, 2006, or until the Administrator certifies to Congress that the Program has been implemented in the State and substantial progress has been made in complying with the standards. The Council will review grant applications and make recommendations to the Administrator.
