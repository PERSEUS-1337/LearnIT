    "content": "Each Congress introduces numerous measures to recognize individuals, groups, and events with national days, weeks, or months of recognition. This legislation, categorized into federal holidays, patriotic observances, and specific commemorations, helps Members of Congress connect with constituents. Federal holidays, or \"national holidays,\" are legally applicable only to the federal government and the District of Columbia. Most federal government offices are closed for national holidays, which are recognized by many states. There are 44 patriotic or national observances, including days for individuals, groups, events, and other recognitions. New statutory observances can only be created by enacting a law. This report discusses commemorative legislation recognizing specific time periods, including federal holidays, patriotic observances, and commemorative days. It outlines current rules in Congress and options for introducing legislation or requesting presidential proclamations for permanent commemorations. The United States has 11 permanent federal holidays, including New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, and Independence Day. States can decide their own legal holidays, and creating a new federal holiday requires a law. Legislation has been introduced for holidays like \"Cesar E. Chavez Day.\" Since 1914, Congress has authorized 44 patriotic and national observances codified in Title 36, United States Code. New observances can only be created through legislation. Recent proposals include designating March 29 as Vietnam Veterans Day. For a complete list of observances, refer to the Appendix. In the 114th Congress, legislation was considered to recognize certain days, weeks, and months, such as 'National Police Week' in May 2015. Commemorative measures provide recognition without creating new federal holidays. House rules prohibit date-specific commemorative legislation, while the Senate has no specific rules. The House adopted a rule in the 104th Congress to reduce the number of commemorative bills introduced. House Rule XII, clause 5, and Republican Conference Rule 28 prohibit the introduction and consideration of date-specific commemorative legislation in the House. The rule defines a commemoration as any remembrance, celebration, or recognition for any purpose through the designation of a specified period of time. The House Rules Committee's analysis of the House Rules resolution in the 104th Congress explained the ban on date-specific commemorative measures, including measures incidental to the overall purpose, which would be returned to the sponsor. The prohibition also extends to Senate measures with date-specific commemoratives, which would not be referred to the House committee or considered, but held at the desk without action. The House Rules Committee prohibits date-specific commemorative measures from being included in conference reports or Senate amendments to House bills. Such measures should not become a new outlet for consideration, and exceptions should be limited to rare situations. The House Rules Committee prohibits date-specific commemorative measures in conference reports or Senate amendments to House bills, limiting exceptions to rare situations. House Republican Conference rules also restrict scheduling bills expressing appreciation, recognition, or celebration under suspension of the Rules. In the 115th Congress, the House Rules Committee and House Republican Conference rules restrict the scheduling of bills expressing appreciation, recognition, or celebration under suspension of the Rules. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform also adopted a new rule prohibiting resolutions that commend, celebrate, or recognize entities, events, individuals, or governments. The House Rules Committee and House Republican Conference rules restrict scheduling bills expressing appreciation, recognition, or celebration. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform prohibits resolutions that commend, celebrate, or recognize entities, events, individuals, or governments. House Rule XII, clause 5, was waived once to consider legislation establishing Patriot Day as a day of remembrance for September 11, 2001. Unlike the House, the Senate has no rules prohibiting commemorative measures. The Senate Judiciary Committee has guidelines on commemorative legislation, including restrictions on specific categories and bipartisan cosponsors. The House prohibits date-specific commemorative legislation but allows resolutions with no specific time period. Data on commemorative measures in the 113th and 114th Congresses show 915 proposals. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, a total of 915 commemorative measures were identified, with the majority being introduced as simple resolutions. These resolutions do not carry the force of law and can only be agreed upon by either the House or Senate. Approximately 40% of commemorative measures introduced in the 113th and 114th Congresses would recognize a commemorative day, compared to 25% for a week and 30% for a month. A small percentage (3%) would designate two time periods, such as supporting National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month. In total, 915 commemorative measures were introduced, with 433 in the House and 482 in the Senate. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, a total of 915 commemorative measures were introduced, with 433 in the House and 482 in the Senate. The Senate agreed to 85% of its measures, while the House only agreed to one measure. In the 114th Congress, differences in rules between the House and Senate regarding commemorative legislation were evident. The Senate allows date-specific measures, while the House prohibits them. The House majority leader's scheduling practices will determine the consideration of non-date-specific measures in the future. In the legislative process, Members of Congress introduce legislation for various purposes, such as framing policy debates or being involved in future discussions. They aim to achieve their goals through the introduction, consideration, or passage of a measure. Options exist within House or Senate rules to commemorate specific time periods. In the legislative process, Members of Congress introduce legislation to achieve their goals within House or Senate rules. Despite restrictions on date-specific commemorative legislation, many resolutions honoring a day, week, or month are introduced each Congress. These resolutions lack a specific date or time period after the resolving clause, allowing for the introduction of commemorative resolutions supporting the recognition of specific time periods. In the legislative process, Members of Congress introduce resolutions honoring specific time periods without specific dates. House resolutions may mention dates in the \"whereas\" clauses, while Senate resolutions can include dates after the resolving clause. Senate does not have restrictions on date-specific commemorative legislation. In the legislative process, Members of Congress introduce resolutions honoring specific time periods without specific dates. Legislation recognizing certain days, weeks, and months is introduced each Congress. In the 113th Congress, 437 measures were introduced, with 83% approved by the Senate. In the 114th Congress, 478 measures were introduced, showing the value Members see in introducing commemorative legislation. House Members draft resolutions to recognize commemorative days, weeks, and months, despite potential limitations due to prohibitions in the Republican Conference Rules."
