    "content": "The \"Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act\" establishes Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act allows individuals in eligible farming businesses to deduct cash payments to a FARRM Account. The deduction is limited to 20% of taxable income attributable to the farming business. An eligible farming business is defined as a non-passive farming business. A FARRM Account is a trust created for the taxpayer's exclusive benefit, with specific requirements for contributions, trustee qualifications, and asset composition. The FARRM Account trust must consist of cash or interest-bearing obligations, distribute all income to the grantor, and keep assets separate except in a common fund. The grantor is taxed as the owner of the account. Amounts distributed from a FARRM Account are included in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year, with exceptions for certain circumstances outlined in the subsections. Exceptions to the distribution rules for FARRM Accounts include distributions attributable to income of the Account and distributions exceeding contribution limitations. Amounts included in gross income are not subject to self-employment tax. Special rules apply. If there is a nonqualified balance in a FARRM Account at the end of a taxable year, an amount equal to the balance will be deemed distributed, and the taxpayer's tax for that year will be increased by 10 percent of the deemed distribution. This rule does not apply if the nonqualified balance is distributed to the taxpayer before the due date. The FARRM Account must be distributed to the taxpayer before the due date to avoid a 10 percent tax increase on any nonqualified balance remaining in the account at the end of the taxable year. Nonqualified balance refers to amounts deposited in the account before the 4th preceding taxable year. Distributions are made in the order of deposit. \"Deposits in the FARRM Account are treated as made on the date of receipt. If a taxpayer ceases an eligible farming business, the balance in the FARRM Account is deemed distributed at the end of the disqualification period. A disqualification period is 2 consecutive taxable years without engaging in farming. Similar rules apply to this section.\" For this section, specific rules apply regarding the loss of exemption for engaging in prohibited transactions, pledging the account as security, community property laws, and custodial accounts. Payments to a FARRM Account are considered made on the last day of the taxable year if made within 3 1/2 months after the close of the year. The term \"Individual\" is defined for this section. The trustee of a FARRM Account must report to the Secretary and the account beneficiary on contributions, distributions, and other matters as required. A deduction for contributions to farm and ranch risk management accounts is allowed in computing adjusted gross income. The FARRM Account allows deductions for contributions in computing adjusted gross income. Excess contributions to FARRM Accounts are subject to tax under section 4973 of the Code. The FARRM Account allows deductions for contributions in computing adjusted gross income. Excess contributions to FARRM Accounts are subject to tax under section 4973 of the Code, where any distribution out of the FARRM Account under section 468C(e)(2)(B) is treated as an amount not contributed. Section 4973 of the Code addresses excess contributions to certain accounts and annuities. The table of sections for chapter 43 is amended to reflect this change. Section 4973 of the Code deals with excess contributions to certain accounts and annuities. Subsection (c) of section 4975 is amended to include a special rule for FARRM accounts, exempting certain transactions from tax if the account ceases to be a FARRM Account. The text discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to FARRM accounts, specifically in sections 4975 and 6693. These changes include the redesignation of subparagraphs and the addition of new subparagraphs to address failure to provide reports on FARRM accounts. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart C.
