    "content": "On November 20, 2004, both houses agreed to the conference report on a consolidated appropriations bill (H.R. 4818), which was signed by the President on December 8, 2004 (P.L. 108-447, 118 Stat. 2809; 658 pages). The bill contained the FY2005 legislative branch appropriations bill and eight other annual appropriations bills. The legislative branch appropriations bill includes appropriations for legislative branch agencies in Title I and general administrative provisions in Title II. The structure of the bill was changed in FY2003 to include appropriations for legislative branch entities. In FY2003, the legislative branch appropriations bill was divided into two titles. Title I, Congressional Operations, included budgets for activities directly serving Congress such as the House, Senate, CBO, AOC, CRS, and GPO printing activities. Title II, Related Agencies, contained budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress like the Botanic Garden and Library of Congress buildings and grounds. The legislative branch appropriations bill funds various entities including the Library buildings, Government Printing Office, and Government Accountability Office. It also includes permanent budget authority for federal funds and trust funds. Trust funds are earmarked for specific purposes and do not require annual action. Trust funds are not included in the annual legislative bill as they are not budget authority. They are part of the U.S. Budget and can be budget receipts or offsetting collections. Non-legislative entities within the legislative branch budget are funded in other appropriation bills but are counted as legislative branch funds for bookkeeping purposes. To get an accurate picture of the legislative branch budget, non-legislative funds and permanent federal and trust funds must be subtracted from the total appropriation figure. The FY2005 U.S. Budget has a legislative budget authority request of $4.4 billion. The total request for entities funded in the regular annual appropriation bill is $3.97 billion, after subtracting non-legislative entities, permanent federal funds, and permanent trust funds. The figures represent current dollars and exclude permanent budget authorities. The FY2000 regular annual Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-57) included budget authority, with additional supplementals and rescissions in subsequent legislation. The FY2001 appropriations included regular annual appropriations, supplemental appropriations, and rescissions, with some bills being vetoed and others incorporated into the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-554). Terrorism supplementals funds are not reflected in these figures. The figures in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Acts from P.L. 106-554 to P.L. 108-447 include regular annual appropriations, supplementals, and transfers from emergency response funds. The FY2005 Branch Appropriations bill (P.L. 108-447) was marked up by the House Subcommittee on Legislative Branch in June 2004. The Senate Subcommittee did not hold a formal markup. The budget request included a 12.5% increase to cover mandatory expenses like salary adjustments and inflation-related costs. Budget amendments submitted in May 2004 included an additional $2.7 million in discretionary resources for legislative branch entities. The budget amendments added $2.7 million in discretionary funds for various legislative branch entities, including the Senate, Joint Economic Committee, Capitol Guide Service, Library of Congress Copyright Office, and Congressional Research Service. One amendment removed a provision related to appropriations for the Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China. Additionally, a House hearing on the FY2005 budget request was canceled due to significant increases in agency requests. Representative Kingston expressed concerns about significant agency requests for a 40-percent spending increase, citing tight budget constraints due to record deficits, the war on terrorism, and military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The chairman requested legislative entities to resubmit reduced budgets, with some agencies seeking increases of 32-45%, including the Capitol Police and the Architect of the Capitol. The Office of Compliance also requested a 31.6% increase. The House held hearings to consider budget requests for the House of Representatives and GAO. Hearings were held on budget requests for the Capitol Police, GPO, AOC, LOC, and Capitol Visitors' Center. Senate Subcommittee on Legislative Branch also held hearings on various budget submissions. Both houses agreed on a FY2005 budget authority cap of $3.575 billion for discretionary agencies under their jurisdiction. The House Subcommittee on Legislative Branch approved a FY2005 bill with $2.75 billion in funding, a 16.4% decrease from the requested amount. The funding level maintains current staff levels, provides for staff adjustments, funds a fitness facility for House staff, and directs resources towards ongoing projects like the Capitol Visitors' Center.

The House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 4755 on July 1, focusing on outsourcing opportunities, centralized distribution of printed material, and management principles. The House passed H.R. 4755 on July 12 after rejecting amendments related to GAO funding and establishing a Center for Science and Technology Assessment.

Congress approved $232.3 million in funding, with a $12.5 million (+5.7%) increase from the previous year. The agency's request was for a $71.9 million (+32.7%) increase to $291.6 million, with appropriations split between salaries and general expenses accounts.

The FY2005 bill authorized the transfer of $10.6 million to the Capitol Visitors' Center for maintenance and start-up operations. The House initially passed a version of the bill without funds for the CVC, but the Senate later amended it to include $7.6 million for maintenance, start-up operations, and new staff. The budget request for the CVC did not include construction money but allocated $14.2 million for start-up operations and maintenance. These funds were intended to cover an interim period while a decision was made on which legislative office would be responsible for the center's operation and maintenance. The requested funds supported 35 FTE positions for the Capitol Visitors' Center (CVC) operations and maintenance. The FY2005 request included $6.3 million for equipment, training, and infrastructure support in the Capitol Building appropriation, and $8.2 million for start-up costs in the CVC appropriation.
