    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Democracy Restoration Act of 2014\" and includes findings. The \"Democracy Restoration Act of 2014\" includes findings by Congress emphasizing the importance of the right to vote as a fundamental act of citizenship, the constitutional authority of Congress over Federal elections, and the requirement for equal voting opportunities without discrimination based on race, color, gender, or previous servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments empower Congress to protect voting rights in Federal elections, while the 8th Amendment prohibits excessive bail, fines, and cruel punishments. Discrepancies in State laws on criminal convictions lead to unfairness in Federal elections, including disparities in voting standards and restoration of voting rights. State disenfranchisement laws vary across the country, with some states allowing easy restoration of voting rights after a criminal conviction, while others permanently strip individuals of their right to vote. These laws disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities. Maine and Vermont do not disenfranchise individuals with criminal convictions, but 48 states and the District of Columbia deny voting rights to convicted individuals while they are in prison. Disenfranchisement in some states occurs due to laws restricting voting during supervision by the criminal justice system or after completing a sentence. Approximately 5.85 million US citizens, or 1 in 40 adults, cannot vote due to felony convictions. 75% of disenfranchised individuals are not in prison but in their communities on probation or parole. Around 2.6 million citizens who have completed their sentences remain disenfranchised. In 6 States, more than 7 percent of the population is disenfranchised post-sentence. Regaining the right to vote is often non-uniform and discriminatory. State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities. Approximately 8% of African-Americans, or 2 million individuals, are disenfranchised, with 1 in 3 African-American men expected to lose their voting rights at some point. Currently, 1 in 13 African-Americans cannot vote due to felony disenfranchisement, a rate 4 times higher than non African-Americans. In Florida, Kentucky, and Virginia, over 20% of African-Americans are unable to vote due to past convictions. Latino citizens also face disproportionate disenfranchisement. Latino citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised, with 17% of Latino men expected to be incarcerated during their lifetimes. In 6 out of 10 States studied, Latinos make up more than 10% of those disenfranchised by State felony laws, with rates exceeding 25% in California, New York, Texas, and Arizona. Disenfranchisement of citizens with felony convictions hinders rehabilitation and suppresses electoral participation. The US is the only Western democracy that permanently denies voting rights to such individuals. SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS: The right to vote in Federal elections shall not be denied to US citizens with criminal convictions, except those serving felony sentences in correctional facilities at the time of the election. The Attorney General can take legal action to address violations of the Act, while individuals affected by violations can notify the state election official and seek relief through a civil action if the violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe. If a violation of the Act occurs within 30 days before a Federal election, the aggrieved person can directly bring a civil action for relief without notifying the state election official. SEC. 5. NOTIFICATION OF RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS. Each State must notify individuals convicted of a criminal offense of their right to vote in Federal elections under the Democracy Restoration Act of 2014. Notification is required when the individual is sentenced to probation or released from custody. Individuals convicted of a criminal offense in a State must be notified of their right to vote in Federal elections under the Democracy Restoration Act of 2014. Notification for felony convictions is required when the individual is sentenced, and for misdemeanor convictions, it is given on the sentencing date. Federal law also requires notification to individuals convicted of a criminal offense, informing them of their right to vote in Federal elections and register to vote. Individuals convicted of a felony must be notified of their right to vote in Federal elections. Notification is given by the Assistant Director for the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, depending on the sentencing outcome. Individuals convicted of a misdemeanor must be notified of their right to vote in Federal elections by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons upon sentencing by a court established by an Act of Congress. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"correctional institution or facility\" refers to prisons, jails, or similar facilities for convicted individuals, excluding residential community treatment centers. The term \"election\" includes various types of elections and political party events for candidate nominations. The term \"election\" encompasses different types of elections, including primary elections for nominating candidates for Federal offices like President, Vice President, Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner. The term \"probation\" refers to court-imposed restrictions on an individual's freedom, payment of damages, reporting requirements, or supervision. SEC. 7. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. This Act does not prevent states from enacting less restrictive voting laws for federal elections. The rights and remedies provided by this Act do not override the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or the National Voter Registration Act. SEC. 8. FEDERAL PRISON FUNDS. No State, local government, or person can use Federal funds to build or improve a prison without a program to notify incarcerated U.S. citizens of their rights upon release. This Act applies to U.S. citizens voting in Federal elections after its enactment date."
