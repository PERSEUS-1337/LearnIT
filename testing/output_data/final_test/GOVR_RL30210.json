    "content": "The conference committee for military construction appropriations printed its conference report (H.Rept. 106-266) on July 27, 1999, agreeing to a total $8.4 billion military construction appropriation, $776 million less than current FY1999 funding. The House and Senate approved the conference report, with the bill becoming law (P.L. 106-52) on August 17, 1999. The Department of Defense manages a vast infrastructure worth over $500 billion, with the bill providing funding for construction projects and maintenance for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. The military construction appropriations bill funds construction projects, maintenance, and housing operations for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, as well as NATO contributions and base realignment and closure costs. It is one of several annual pieces of legislation that provide funding for national defense. The military construction appropriations bill funds construction projects for national defense, including maintenance, housing operations, and NATO contributions. It is part of the annual defense authorization bill, which also includes funding for atomic energy defense activities and civil projects by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The authorization bill covers major debates over defense policy and funding issues. The military construction appropriations bill, established in the late 1950s, funds defense construction projects. It is a separate bill from the annual defense authorization bill and provides funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies. The defense appropriations bill funds facility investments for the military services and defense agencies, including real property maintenance and construction of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation-related facilities. Most funds must be obligated in the fiscal year, except for military construction appropriations which are available for five years. The President's budget for military construction is delivered to Congress in February, with a request for $5.4 billion in FY2000 and an advance appropriation request of $3.1 billion for FY2001. Key legislative steps are necessary for the enactment of these funds. The FY2000 military construction appropriation process involved key legislative steps, with the conference committee agreeing to a $8.4 billion appropriation, $776 million less than FY1999 funding. The bill became law on August 17, 1999 (P.L. 106-52). The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up its version of the bill (S. 1205) on June 10, 1999. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up the FY2000 military construction bill, S. 1205 (S.Rept. 106-74), passing it with no amendments on June 16, 1999. The committee fully funded the President's budget request, rejected the advance appropriations proposal, directed DOD to fully fund future military construction projects, cut excess funding for construction contingencies, created a new Family Housing Revitalization Transfer Fund, and recommended $25 million for the Family Housing Improvement Fund. They also expressed concerns over the Pentagon's acquisition and planning for forward operating locations for drug interdiction and counter-drug activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee fully funded the President's budget request for the FY2000 military construction bill, rejecting the advance appropriations proposal. They also recommended $25 million for the Family Housing Improvement Fund and expressed concerns over the Pentagon's planning for forward operating locations for drug interdiction and counter-drug activities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended only $5.0 million of planning and design funds for military construction projects, instead of the $42.8 million requested by the Pentagon. The House passed the bill with no amendments on July 13, 1999, by a vote of 418-4. The House Appropriations Committee fully funded the President's budget request for the FY2000 military construction bill, rejecting the advance appropriations proposal. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved the entire $8.5 billion request and added $250 million, including high-priority projects and quality of life projects. The Senate approved its version of the FY2000 defense authorization bill by a vote of 92-3. The House Armed Services Committee added nearly $1.1 billion to the President's military housing request for military family housing, which they see as a priority. The House passed its version of the defense authorization bill on June 10, 1999, and had a hearing on economic development conveyances on July 1. The Pentagon's proposal for real property affected by the BRAC process includes giving no-cost conveyances to local authorities to spur job creation and facility reuse. However, this may result in the Pentagon recouping less money from the BRAC process, potentially requiring direct appropriations to transition the properties. The Senate included the Pentagon's proposal in the defense authorization bill, with the conference report completed on August 5, 1999. Additionally, the Defense Department's FY2000 military construction budget plan includes $8.5 billion worth of projects, but the Administration is requesting only $5.4 billion in appropriations, with the remaining $3.1 billion requested as advance appropriations for FY2001. The Defense Department's FY2000 military construction budget plan includes $8.5 billion worth of projects, but the Administration is requesting only $5.4 billion in appropriations, with the remaining $3.1 billion requested as advance appropriations for FY2001. This split funding approach is a one-time exercise to reduce requested budget authority in FY2000 due to budget rules, with the intent to restore the funding in FY2001 when the caps on discretionary funding may be adjusted upward. The Administration took an unusual step to help the DOD fund $12.6 billion in additions to the FY2000 budget, with $8.5 billion in added programs offset by various savings and proposals. Some observers believe that the House and Senate may seek alternatives to fully fund the FY2000 military construction program. Advance appropriations limit congressional discretion on future budget items. During the FY1999 military construction budget debate, the defense committees rejected an Army proposal for advance appropriations for large projects. Senator Burns warned that fiscal challenges will persist, potentially increasing costs for DOD construction projects. The DOD's advance procurement is seen as a temporary solution to budget issues, but there are concerns that partial funding may become a recurring problem in future military construction budgets. Congress has criticized the Pentagon for poor planning and inadequate funding, making it difficult to prioritize military construction projects. The Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) is used by the Department of Defense to create its budget for Congress. The Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) is utilized by the Department of Defense to create its budget for Congress, including the long-term financial plan known as the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). Congress has criticized the Pentagon for poor planning and insufficient funding in military construction projects, with concerns raised about the FY2000 budget request continuing a trend of inadequate planning and funding. Rep. Joel Hefley highlighted the mismatch between requested funds and budget assumptions in previous years. The Pentagon's military construction planning has been criticized for a mismatch between plans and funding, with concerns raised about the lack of long-term planning in the FY2000 budget request. Rep. Joel Hefley and Sen. Conrad Burns expressed doubts about the seriousness of Pentagon's future plans for military construction. Randall Yim highlighted the ongoing problem of military family housing, with two-thirds of DOD's family housing units needing extensive renovations. Approximately two-thirds of DOD's nearly 300,000 family housing units require extensive renovation or replacement. Congress passed the Military Housing Privatization Initiative in 1996 to address this issue, providing new authorities for obtaining private sector financing and expertise. The Department of Defense's Housing Revitalization Support Office is coordinating the implementation of these new authorities. The Defense's Housing Revitalization Support Office (HRSO) is coordinating the implementation of new authorities for each of the Services to leverage defense dollars for building three times the amount of housing units. New policies and procedures were needed to implement the privatization initiative, including forming a new mindset for working with commercial real estate practices. The Pentagon also had to develop loan concepts into documents trusted by the private financial community for investment. Progress with the privatization initiative has been slow, with concerns raised by Rep. Joel Hefley and the General Accounting Office about the pace and potential savings of privatized military housing compared to traditional housing. Concerns were also raised about the long-term time horizons of some privatization projects lasting 50 years or more. The General Accounting Office (GAO) highlighted weaknesses in Pentagon planning for military housing, including lack of integration with facility and community needs, underutilization of local housing, and poor communication between offices. GAO recommended comprehensive, integrated plans to maximize privatization while minimizing costs. Rep. Hefley raised concerns about the military departments relying too heavily on privatization for improving military family housing. The Congress has been adding significant amounts to the Administration's military construction budget requests in recent years, with a recurring pattern of supplementing inadequate budgets, especially for Guard and Reserve needs. For example, Congress added $479 million in FY1996, $850 million in FY1997, $800 million in FY1998, and $875 million in FY1999 to military construction accounts. This funding pattern complements privatization efforts to improve military family housing. Congressional additions to the military construction budget have been common and controversial throughout the 1990s. Three themes explain the pattern of recurring congressional additions: chronic underfunding, differing priorities between Congress and the Administration, and the belief that the Pentagon relies on Congress to add money to Guard and Reserve programs. In recent years, Congress has added significant amounts for National Guard and Reserve construction projects, with a peak amount of $401.8 million in FY1995. Debate over congressional additions to the military construction budget involves arguments about underfunding military facilities and the necessity of funding increases to make up for previous shortfalls. The FY1996 enacted amount for military construction peaked at $11.2 billion that year. The FY1996 enacted amount for military construction peaked at $11.2 billion. The House report on the FY1997 bill cited a DOD backlog of deferred maintenance and repair for family housing totaling over $4.5 billion. DOD facility managers have not met their goal to allocate 3% of the plant replacement value of DOD facilities for annual construction and maintenance. Actual DOD funding has typically run at 1 to 2% of plant replacement value, with the Air Force budgeting only 1% for real property maintenance. Congressional military construction subcommittees welcome any additions to address underfunding concerns. The congressional military construction subcommittees frequently disagree with the Administration's military construction priorities. They have reallocated funds from construction overseas to domestic projects and added funds for quality of life improvements. The Congress debates on how to prioritize additional projects added to the military construction budget over the last 10 years. The Senate debate in 1994 focused on prioritizing additional military construction projects. Senator McCain objected to funding projects not requested by the Administration, calling it \"pork barrel\" spending. He proposed criteria for added projects to be on critical military lists, but his amendment was not included in the final bill. Over $900 million was provided for unrequested construction in the conference agreement. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 incorporated Senator McCain's criteria for unrequested construction projects, requiring them to be essential to national security, consistent with the Base Realignment and Closure Act, in the services' Future Years Defense Plan, executable in the authorized year, and offset by reductions in other defense accounts. The House military construction committees have also adopted similar criteria for adding projects to the budget. The McCain criteria for military construction projects require them to be essential to the DOD mission, consistent with BRAC plans, in the Future Years Defense Plan, and executable in the coming fiscal year. Senator McCain raised concerns about Congress adding 148 domestic projects costing nearly $977 million in the FY1999 military construction appropriations conference report. The Administration proposed splitting funding for FY2000 military construction projects between FY2000 and FY2001 budgets, with a budget request of $5.4 billion for FY2000. The FY2000 military construction budget request is $5.4 billion, with an additional $3.1 billion in advance appropriations for FY2001. The total proposed value for FY2000 military construction program is $8.5 billion, continuing a downward trend from previous years. The FY2000 conference report recommends $8.4 billion in funding. Tables show funding levels since FY1996 and breakdowns of appropriations accounts. H.R. 2465 makes appropriations for military construction, family housing, and base realignment. The bill (P.L. 106-52) makes appropriations for military construction, family housing, and base realignment for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000. It was passed by the House and Senate in July and August 1999, respectively. The House and Senate passed a bill (P.L. 106-52) for military construction, family housing, and base realignment for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2000. The House passed a related bill (H.Rept. 106-162) on June 10, 1999, while the Senate passed S. 1059 on May 27, 1999, authorizing appropriations for military activities, construction, and defense activities for the same fiscal year.
