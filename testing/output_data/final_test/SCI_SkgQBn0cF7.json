    "content": "In model-based reinforcement learning, the agent alternates between learning a model and planning. The paper focuses on building a model that predicts the long-term future for efficient planning and exploration. By using a latent-variable autoregressive model, the planner's solution is constrained to valid regions in the latent space. Exploration is guided by searching for unlikely trajectories under the model, leading to faster reward attainment compared to baselines. Deep reinforcement learning methods have shown success in complex tasks like Atari games and Go. However, applying these methods in high-dimensional observation-action spaces with complex dynamics remains challenging. Most popular reinforcement learning algorithms are model-free, requiring large amounts of training data to learn value functions or policies directly. Model-based RL techniques offer an alternative approach by learning an explicit representation of the environment dynamics, using an estimated model for planning. However, learning accurate models for complex dynamics can be challenging. The most common techniques involve training models to predict the next observation given the current observation and action. Model-based RL techniques involve learning an explicit representation of environment dynamics to plan. One-step prediction errors may not reflect downstream performance accurately, leading to compounding errors in model behavior. Autoregressive models like recurrent neural networks factorize naturally but can suffer from accumulating errors during training. The key motivation is for a model to predict long-term transition dynamics, not just single step transitions, to reduce errors and improve performance. Using latent variables in recurrent networks can capture higher level structures in the data for better reasoning about long-term dynamics. However, it is challenging for latent variables to capture higher level representations in the presence of a strong autoregressive model. To improve long-term prediction accuracy, variational inference techniques are utilized, including the Z-forcing idea. Future information is injected into latent variables through a backward RNN and forcing latent variables to predict future summaries. This approach aims to ground predicted future observations in real data and enhance planning capabilities. In a stochastic environment, dynamics models can lead to unlikely trajectories due to error compounding. This work demonstrates the benefits of injecting future information for faster imitation learning and efficient planning using a latent plan in Model Predictive Control. The proposed method outperforms existing RL methods and helps in finding sub-goals in a partially observable 2D environment. The text discusses learning an accurate environment model for planning by predicting future observation-action sequences using a recurrent neural network with stochastic latent variables. This approach aims to address the challenge of unknown transition dynamics in high-dimensional raw pixel observations. The model uses variational inference with stochastic latent variables and an auxiliary task for regularization. It employs an LSTM architecture to couple observations and latent variables, with a predictive distribution factorizing based on the graphical model. The model utilizes variational inference with stochastic latent variables and an auxiliary task for regularization, incorporating an LSTM architecture to connect observations and latent variables. The action decoder distribution and prior over latent variables are conditioned on hidden states, computed by feedforward networks. The prior distribution of latent variables at each time step depends on preceding inputs via hidden states, enhancing the latent variable's representational power. The marginalization over sequences of latent variables results in a highly multimodal distribution. To address the challenge of posterior inference for latent variables given observation-action sequences, amortized variational inference is used. A recognition network approximates the true posterior of a latent variable by dropping dependencies on future actions and variables, sharing parameters with the generative model, and processing observations backward with an LSTM. The LSTM processes observation sequences backward, with a feed-forward network outputting the approximate posterior. Future actions' influence was tested but not found significant, so the dependence on actions was dropped to simplify the code. The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is derived using the approximate posterior. The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is derived by leveraging the temporal structure of generative and inference networks. In latent variable models, the challenge lies in learning meaningful latent variables that capture high-level abstractions in observed data. For tasks like learning to navigate a building from raw images, the goal is to have latent variables that encode essential aspects of the building's topology for navigation. The decoder encodes object locations and distances between rooms, focusing on high-frequency variations like texture. Training the model with maximum likelihood can lead to latent variables being unused or a stationary auto-encoder. To address these issues, latent variables are enforced to carry future observation information using the \"Z-forcing\" idea. The model is trained to encode future information in latent variables through log-likelihood maximization and a regularization term. The objective combines ELBO and reconstruction terms with a trade-off parameter. The reparameterization trick is used for unbiased gradient estimators, ensuring the approximate posterior is independent of the auxiliary task. In sequential RL tasks, a dynamics model can aid in training a learner through imitation learning or reinforcement learning. In imitation learning, the goal is to mimic an expert's actions using supervised learning from expert trajectories. This assumes i.i.d. training observation-action pairs. In contrast to traditional approaches that assume i.i.d. training data, we propose leveraging temporal coherence by training our dynamic model using full trajectories. This allows our model to capture the training distribution of sequences, making it more robust to compounding errors. Our method consists of model learning from observations and planning, showing how our dynamics model can aid in solving tasks in model-based RL approaches. Our dynamics model can assist in solving RL problems by performing planning and evaluating transitions based on a reward function. The planner aims to find the optimal action sequence for maximizing long-term return. However, optimizing directly on actions may lead to a distribution mismatch between training and testing, resulting in potential prediction errors and 'catastrophic failure'. To address potential 'catastrophic failure' due to distribution mismatch, planning is done over latent variables instead of actions using model predictive control (MPC). Sequences are generated, evaluated based on reward, and the best sequence's latent variables are used to execute actions in the real environment. Re-planning occurs based on the last observation of the segment. Our approach involves collecting data for model training by considering an exploration strategy to generate useful training trajectories. Random exploration is inefficient, so we focus on directed exploration by collecting trajectories that are unlikely under the model distribution. Our approach involves training a policy \u03c0 \u03c9 to maximize the negative regularized ELBO L. The optimization problem can be solved using policy gradient methods like PPO, with negative regularized ELBO as a reward. The algorithm involves performing MPC every k-steps to obtain high rewarding trajectories, then using the exploration policy to sample adjacent trajectories for training the model. Given a trained model M and reward function R, the algorithm involves generating observation sequences, evaluating rewards, saving latent variables, executing actions based on observations, updating the replay buffer and model, and training using a mixture of newly generated data and data in the replay buffer. The approach includes training a policy to maximize the negative regularized ELBO using PPO, performing Model Predictive Control (MPC) every k-steps, and using an exploration policy to sample adjacent trajectories for training the model. Sequence Models. Previous work combines recurrent neural networks with stochastic dynamics to propose a variant of RNNs with stochastic dynamics for model-based reinforcement learning. The models are trained with one-step ahead prediction loss or fixed k-step ahead prediction loss. Our work introduces stochastic RNNs conditioned on latent variables for long-term future incorporation, improving over existing models. The approximate posterior is conditioned on the state of the backward running RNN to escape local minima. The idea of using bidirectional posterior in RNNs for model-based reinforcement learning is novel. Prior methods focus on learning environment dynamics for planning and policy search. Improving representations in model-based RL has been explored for value prediction, dimensionality reduction, self-organizing maps, and incentivizing exploration. Imagination-Augmented Agent uses rollouts from a dynamics model as inputs to the policy function. State-space models have shown promise in learning good state representations. State-space models can learn good state representations for the Imagination-Augmented Agent. BID25 offers a computationally efficient way to estimate a variational lower bound for empowerment. BID16 and BID21 suggest incorporating long-term future for model-based RL. Auxiliary losses, such as inverse models, can improve representations and incentivize curiosity. Incorporating auxiliary loss for improving dynamics model in reinforcement learning, considering long-term future in stochastic dynamics models for better models. In the context of improving dynamics models in reinforcement learning, the current discussion focuses on the limitations of global models in complex domains and the proposed model's performance in imitation learning and model-based reinforcement learning. Key questions addressed include the impact of future access during training, the model's predictive capabilities, subgoal prediction, and the benefits of a better predictive model for planning and control in model-based RL. Our model is trained in the imitation learning setting using expert-generated training trajectories. It is evaluated on various tasks in different environments and compared to two baselines - a recurrent policy and a recurrent decoder. Results show that our method achieves higher rewards faster and is more stable than the baseline methods. Our model, trained on expert trajectories, outperforms recurrent policy and decoder baselines in tasks like Reacher, HalfCheetah, and Car Racing. It shows higher rewards and stability compared to the baselines. Our model outperforms recurrent policy and decoder baselines in the BabyAI PickUnlock task on the BabyAI platform. The task involves navigating through 2 rooms to find a key, unlock a door, and reach a target, with rewards for completing the task efficiently. Our model achieves higher rewards compared to recurrent policy baseline in the CarRacing environment. It outperforms the recurrent decoder with a negative log-likelihood of -526.0, while the recurrent decoder achieves -352.8. The model generates coherent images/videos in a 15-step rollout. Our method generates more coherent and complicated scenes compared to the recurrent decoder, which often produces incomplete and straight roads. We compare our approach with baseline methods like SeCTAr for BabyAI tasks and observe higher rewards. The BabyAI task involves natural subgoals such as locating the key and opening the door. The study evaluates a model on wheeled locomotion tasks with sparse rewards, outperforming the Sectar model and other baselines. The focus is on model learning in model-based RL. In model-based RL, a latent-variable model is trained from raw high-dimensional observations to account for long-term future information. This model is used for efficient planning and exploration, showing benefits in providing sensible long-term predictions and outperforming baseline methods on Mujoco tasks like Reacher and Half Cheetah. In model-based RL, a latent-variable model is trained from raw high-dimensional observations for efficient planning and exploration. The agent is awarded for the distance the robots move in the control task. The experts are trained using Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) for both tasks. Expert trajectories are generated for training the student model, with models trained for 50 epochs. Trajectories are chunked into 4 chunks of 250 timesteps for computation purposes. The Car Racing task involves the agent (car) being rewarded for visiting as many tiles as possible in the least amount of time. The expert is trained using specific methods, with trajectories chunked into 4 chunks of 250 steps. BabyAI environment is a POMDP 2D Minigrid environment with multiple tasks. The BabyAI environment is a POMDP 2D Minigrid environment with multiple tasks, including the PickupUnlock task. The agent must find a key in one room, unlock a door to access another room, and pick up an object. Difficulty increases with room size, and training involves curriculum learning with PPO. LSTM baseline and model are trained using imitation learning on room size 15. Training data consists of 10k trajectories. The model is evaluated every 100 iterations on the BabyAI environment with 10k trajectories. The robot in the Wheeled locomotion environment must reach multiple goals for rewards. MPC re-plans every 19 steps and samples latent variables from a sequential prior based on past events. Our model, evaluated every 100 iterations on the BabyAI environment, has an auxiliary cost for predicting the long term future. It performs better when there is more certainty about the future, especially in a POMDP environment with multiple subgoals. Tested in the 5.1 environment, the model trained using imitation learning shows behavior in real environments. In the BabyAI environment, our model trained using imitation learning shows behavior corresponding to changes in auxiliary cost. The auxiliary cost decreases as the agent moves closer to the goal, with sharp drops when subgoals align with the agent's path. For example, there is a significant drop in auxiliary cost when the agent's path aligns with the door at step 7."
