    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The Act may be cited as the \"LEO Fair Retirement Act of 2014\". Congress finds that federal law enforcement officers are always on call to protect public safety, unique among federal government occupations, and have no counterpart in the private sector. Federal law enforcement officers have a unique and demanding career, with distinct pay and benefit systems established by Congress. This includes Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP) or Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO) to compensate for their rigorous schedules. Federal law enforcement officers receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP) or Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO) to compensate for unscheduled duty based on agency needs. LEAP and AUO compensation are subject to pay caps to ensure total pay does not exceed established limits, especially important after a Federal pay freeze and in the face of ongoing security threats. Federal law enforcement officers receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP) or Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO) to compensate for unscheduled duty based on agency needs, subject to pay caps. To ensure recruitment and retention of high-caliber personnel, it is proposed to grant full retirement credit for overtime hours worked but not paid. The proposal aims to grant full retirement credit for overtime hours worked by federal law enforcement officers in excess of Law Enforcement Availability Pay and Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime limitations. The proposal seeks to provide full retirement credit for overtime hours worked by federal law enforcement officers, overcoming limitations on Law Enforcement Availability Pay and Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime. The proposal aims to grant full retirement credit for overtime hours worked by federal law enforcement officers, addressing limitations on Law Enforcement Availability Pay and Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime. Additionally, amendments are made to sections 8339(f) and 8415 of title 5, United States Code, to clarify annuity limits and include law enforcement availability pay in the average pay calculation for annuities. The amendments allow for including administratively uncontrollable overtime pay in the average pay calculation for annuities, applying to annuities calculated one year after the enactment of the Act."
