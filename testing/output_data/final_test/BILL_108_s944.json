The \"Renewable Energy Investment Act of 2003\" defines biomass as organic material from plants used for energy production, including forest-related resources like mill residue, thinnings, slash, and brush. The \"Renewable Energy Investment Act of 2003\" defines biomass as organic material from plants used for energy production, including orchard tree crops, vineyards, grains, legumes, sugar, crop byproducts, waste pallets, crates, and tree trimmings. The term \"biomass\" includes organic material from plants used for energy production, excluding incineration of municipal solid waste, recyclable postconsumer waste paper, painted or treated wood, wood contaminated with plastic or metal, and tires. Distributed generation refers to reduced electricity consumption. The term \"renewable energy\" refers to electricity generated from various sources such as hydropower, landfill gas, and renewable materials like biomass. Incremental hydropower specifically denotes additional generation achieved through increased efficiency at hydroelectric dams. The term \"renewable energy source\" includes wind, ocean waves, biomass, solar sources, landfill gas, incremental hydropower, and geothermal sources. A \"retail electric supplier\" is a person or entity that sells retail electricity to consumers and sold at least 500,000 megawatt-hours of electric energy for purposes other than resale in the previous calendar year. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 3. RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION STANDARDS. Retail electric suppliers must submit renewable energy credits equal to a required annual percentage of nonhydropower electricity sold, with the option to carry over unused credits for up to two years. The percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources must meet specified standards. Retail electric suppliers must submit renewable energy credits equal to a required annual percentage of nonhydropower electricity sold, with the option to carry over unused credits for up to two years. The percentage of renewable energy each year is as follows: 5% from 2006-2009, 10% from 2010-2014, 15% from 2015-2019, and 20% from 2020 onwards. Suppliers can meet requirements by submitting renewable energy credits issued, obtained by purchase or exchange, or purchased from the United States. The Secretary will establish a program to issue, monitor, and track renewable energy credits within a year of the Act's enactment. Entities generating electric energy from renewable resources can apply for these credits under the program. The Secretary will issue renewable energy credits to entities generating electric energy from renewable resources based on the type of resource used, the State of production, and any other relevant information determined by the Secretary. Each kilowatt-hour of renewable energy generated will receive one credit annually. To be eligible for a renewable energy credit, the unit of electricity generated through a renewable energy resource must be sold for retail consumption or used by the generator. The Secretary will issue 3 renewable energy credits for each kilowatt-hour of distributed generation, which will vest with the owner unless explicitly transferred. The Secretary issues renewable energy credits based on the proportion of renewable energy used, identified by type and date of generation. Retail electric suppliers selling energy generated from renewable resources are treated as generators under the Act. The Act allows for the sale or exchange of renewable energy credits, with no restrictions on the manner of sale. The Secretary is required to offer renewable energy credits for sale at a specified price or percentage of market value, with adjustments for inflation annually. On January 1 of each year after 2006, the Secretary adjusts the price of renewable energy credits for inflation. States can implement additional renewable energy programs as long as they do not conflict with the Act. Retail electric suppliers must charge rates reflecting the cost of renewable energy generation and cannot misrepresent product contents to customers. Retail electric suppliers must submit renewable energy credits to satisfy the renewable generation requirement. Failure to do so will result in a civil penalty based on the number of credits not submitted. The Secretary may collect information to verify annual electric energy generation and renewable resources. The Secretary may issue renewable energy credits to entities not subject to the Act if they meet the same terms and conditions. This includes verifying annual electric energy generation and renewable resources. The State Renewable Energy Grant Program is established under Section 4. The Secretary will distribute sales proceeds and other amounts to States for renewable energy purposes. A program will be established to promote State renewable energy production and use, with funds available for research, development, loan guarantees, and consumer rebate programs. The Secretary will allocate funds to promote renewable energy systems, with a preference for states lacking renewable energy capacity and programs that stimulate innovative technologies."
