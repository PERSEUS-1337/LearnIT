    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that governs special education for children from birth through age 21, ensuring their right to a free appropriate public education. Administered by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), IDEA provides funding to cover additional costs for educating children with disabilities. In the 2016-2017 school year, 6.8 million children ages 3 through 21 received special education services under IDEA, accounting for approximately 13.4% of all public school students in that age range. The Children Act, P.L. 94-142 was enacted due to the lack of appropriate educational services for children with disabilities, with 1 million being excluded from public schools. Factors leading to this law included judicial decisions, funding issues, and the long-term benefits of educating these children. IDEA consists of four parts, with Part A containing general provisions. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) consists of four parts, including provisions for school-aged children, preschool children, infants and toddlers with disabilities, and national activities to improve education. IDEA has undergone multiple reauthorizations since 1975, with the most recent in 2004. Funding for Part B is permanently authorized, while funding for Part C is also provided. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) consists of four parts, including provisions for school-aged children, preschool children, infants and toddlers with disabilities, and national activities to improve education. Funding for Part C and Part D was authorized through FY2011, with funding continuing through annual appropriations acts. IDEA aims to ensure that all children with disabilities have access to a free appropriate public education, protect the rights of children and parents, and assist in providing education for children with disabilities. The focus of this report will be on achieving these purposes under Part B of IDEA. Children with disabilities receive specially designed instruction and services to meet their unique needs under Part B of IDEA. This section outlines criteria for eligibility, evaluation procedures, and the development of individualized education plans. To qualify under IDEA, a child must have a disability and require special education services as a result. Children with disabilities must require special education services to benefit from public education under IDEA. If not covered under IDEA, they may be protected by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act, which provide broad nondiscrimination protection. Approximately 34% of students with disabilities have specific learning disabilities (SLD), including dyslexia and developmental aphasia. Children with disabilities aged 3-21 are entitled to free appropriate public education (FAPE) under IDEA. Children with disabilities aged 3-21 are entitled to free appropriate public education (FAPE) under IDEA, which includes providing education that meets state standards and individualized education programs. FAPE must be available to all qualifying children, including those who have been suspended or expelled. States must have policies in place to identify, locate, and evaluate children in need of special education services through \"child find.\" Children with disabilities must be identified, located, and evaluated through \"child find\" policies and procedures. This includes homeless, wards of the state, private school attendees, suspected of disabilities, and highly mobile children. A child with a disability must undergo evaluation by the local education agency (LEA) before receiving special education services. Parental consent is required for the initial evaluation, which must occur within 60 days of consent. The initial evaluation for children with disabilities must be conducted by the local education agency (LEA) within 60 days of parental consent. It should use various assessment tools to gather relevant information on the child's functional, developmental, and academic abilities. The assessments must be non-discriminatory, consider cognitive and behavioral factors, and be administered in a language that yields accurate results. The evaluation process for children with disabilities must be conducted within 60 days of parental consent by the local education agency. It involves using various assessment tools to gather information on the child's academic, developmental, and functional abilities. A team of professionals and the child's parent or guardian determine if the child is eligible for special education services. Lack of appropriate instruction or limited English proficiency should not be the sole factors in determining eligibility. Reevaluations are required if requested by the teacher, parent, or if the child's needs warrant it. A reevaluation may be necessary if a child's academic performance improves significantly, indicating they may no longer need special education services, or if they are not progressing towards their IEP goals. Parental consent is required for reevaluations, and changes in eligibility cannot be made without one, except in specific circumstances. Reevaluations cannot be done more than once a year unless agreed upon by both the parent and the LEA, and must be conducted at least once every three years. The reevaluation process under IDEA must be done at least once every three years, unless agreed otherwise. More than a third of children receiving special education services have specific learning disabilities (SLDs). Procedures for identifying a child with an SLD include using state criteria that do not require a severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement, allowing for interventions based on the child's response, and potentially using other research-based procedures. The group determining if a child has a Specific Learning Disability (SLD) must include parents, teachers, and qualified individuals. Criteria for identifying SLD include lack of achievement in specific areas despite appropriate instruction and lack of progress. The group determining if a child has a Specific Learning Disability (SLD) must include parents, teachers, and qualified individuals. Criteria for identifying SLD include lack of achievement in specific areas despite appropriate instruction and lack of progress. If a child is found to have an SLD, it is not primarily due to other disabilities or environmental factors. The evaluation must consider if the child received appropriate instruction in regular education settings before being referred for assessment. The evaluation process for determining if a child has a Specific Learning Disability (SLD) includes providing appropriate instruction in regular education settings and conducting repeated assessments of achievement. If a child does not make adequate progress after receiving instruction, parental consent is needed for further evaluation. Observations in the child's learning environment are also necessary to document academic performance and behavior. The Individualized Education Program (IEP) outlines how special education and related services will be provided to the child. The IEP is a program plan developed by a team for each child with a disability, considering strengths, concerns, evaluations, and needs. The team meets annually to review and make necessary changes. Special education services must be provided promptly after the IEP is developed, as required by IDEA. The IEP under IDEA mandates the inclusion of present academic levels, measurable annual goals, progress measurement, special education services, and program modifications to meet a child's disability-related needs. The IEP team must detail the personnel provided for the child to advance towards annual goals, participate in the general education curriculum, and engage in extracurricular activities. It should also outline any necessary accommodations for assessments and explain reasons for alternate assessments if needed. The IEP team must develop an appropriate plan for children with disabilities, including measurable postsecondary goals and transition services. The team composition includes parents, regular and special education teachers, and a representative from the LEA. The provision of special education and related services is a key component of FAPE, which means specially designed instruction to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability. This includes instruction in various settings and physical education, as outlined in the IEP. The IEP team, consisting of parents, teachers, and LEA representatives, must develop a plan with measurable postsecondary goals and transition services for children with disabilities. Specially designed instruction in the IEP ensures access to the general curriculum for children with disabilities. Parents may need to pay incidental fees, while related services like transportation support a child's benefit from special education. Regulations define and list related services for children with disabilities. Related services for children with disabilities include speech-language pathology, audiology, interpreting services, psychological services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, recreation, social work, school health services, counseling, orientation and mobility services, parent counseling and training, medical services for evaluation, and early identification of disabilities. LEAs may use up to 15% of their allocations for development purposes. LEAs can use up to 15% of their funds for early intervening services for students in kindergarten through grade 12 who need academic and behavioral support. This can benefit special education and other children by reducing problems in the general education environment. LEAs can use up to 15% of their funds for early intervening services for students in kindergarten through grade 12 who need academic and behavioral support. This can benefit special education and other children by reducing problems in the general education environment. CEIS funds can be used for professional development, evaluations, services, and supports for students, aligning with activities funded under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. States may require LEAs to address \"significant disproportionality\" in the identification and placement of children with disabilities. The funds allocated for early intervening services in education settings aim to address disciplinary actions and provide support to children at risk for poor learning outcomes. Coordinated early intervening services, such as Response to Intervention (RTI), focus on high-quality instruction, continuous monitoring of student performance, screening for academic and behavioral issues, and progressively intense levels of instruction. Response to Intervention (RTI) model includes three tiers of support: Tier one for all students with high-quality instruction, Tier two for at-risk students with small group instruction, and Tier three for students with intensive needs. EIS funds can be used to support Tier two activities. The IDEA requires special education teachers to have state certification, not have waivers for certification requirements, and hold at least a bachelor's degree. Related services personnel have similar certification requirements but do not need a bachelor's degree. Paraprofessionals and assistants assisting in special education do not need a bachelor's degree. Paraprofessionals and assistants in special education must be trained and supervised according to state laws to meet IDEA requirements. Children with disabilities should be educated in the least restrictive environment possible, with the use of supplementary aids and services when necessary. The LEA must provide accommodations such as extra time, slower-paced instruction, aides, tutors, and use of technology for children with disabilities. Placement decisions should involve parents and knowledgeable individuals, be reviewed annually, based on the IEP, and as close to home as possible. Parents must be notified in writing before any placement changes. Parents must be notified in writing before placement changes. If they disagree, they can use procedural safeguards like mediation and due process complaints. Data shows that children with disabilities are mostly educated in regular classrooms, with some in separate schools or other environments. Children with disabilities may be placed in private schools by the LEA or parents if deemed necessary for fulfilling FAPE requirements. Private school placement can be at no cost to parents, but \"parentally placed\" children are not entitled to FAPE. The LEA must allocate IDEA funds to provide services to parentally placed children in private schools based on the proportion of children with disabilities in the LEA. The LEA has the final say on services for these children after consulting with private school officials and parents. Procedural safeguards protect the rights of parents and children with disabilities regarding FAPE. The rights of parents and children with disabilities regarding FAPE include procedures such as inspecting educational records, participating in meetings, obtaining independent evaluations, receiving prior written notice, procedural safeguards, mediation, and due process complaint procedures. The procedural safeguards for resolving disputes between parents and the LEA include mediation, due process complaint procedures, and state complaint procedures under IDEA. Mediation is a voluntary process conducted by a qualified mediator to resolve complaints without a formal hearing. The mediation process, conducted by a qualified mediator, is a cost borne by the state to resolve disputes between schools and parents. If resolved, a legally binding agreement is signed and enforceable in court. Discussions are confidential and cannot be used in subsequent hearings. The due process complaint procedure involves filing a request for a hearing on matters related to a child's disability or education. The child typically remains in their current educational placement unless agreed otherwise. If SEA or LEA and the parent agree, the child must stay in their current educational placement during due process. Either party can file a complaint alleging a violation within two years. A resolution session must be held within 15 days of receiving the complaint, and if not resolved, a due process hearing may occur. If mediation fails, a resolution meeting is held. If a complaint is not resolved through mediation or a resolution meeting, a due process hearing can be requested. The hearing is conducted by an impartial officer, and the decision is final. Parties in certain states can appeal to the SEA for a review. If the SEA conducted the hearing, either party can file a civil lawsuit within 90 days of the decision. Each state must have procedures for resolving complaints under IDEA regulations. State complaint procedures are a separate and viable alternative to due process complaint procedures for resolving disputes with public agencies. Unlike due process complaints, state complaints can be filed by any organization or individual, including those from another state. Complaints must be resolved within 60 days unless an extension is granted. IDEA's disciplinary provisions aim to balance school safety with the need to address a child's behavior related to their disability. School personnel have options like removal or suspension for up to 10 days. Children with disabilities are not exempt from disciplinary procedures, but they differ from those for non-disabled children. IDEA's disciplinary provisions allow for removal or suspension for up to 10 school days, with the possibility of placing the child in an interim alternative education setting for up to 45 school days in certain situations. A manifestation determination must be made before changing the placement of a child with a disability for more than 10 days. A \"manifestation determination\" under IDEA ensures that a child with a disability is not punished for behaviors related to their disability. If behavior is not disability-related, long-term disciplinary action may occur, but educational services must continue. If behavior is disability-related, a behavior intervention plan must be implemented or modified. Exceptions apply for certain serious circumstances. IDEA allows for a manifestation determination to prevent punishment for disability-related behavior. If disagreement arises, a due process hearing can be requested. Reporting a crime committed by a child with a disability is permitted, with special education and disciplinary records transmitted to the appropriate authorities. The IDEA provides federal funding for children with disabilities and sets conditions for receiving funds, including funding allocations, expenditure requirements, and compliance with IDEA provisions. Grants to states are based on the percent of excess costs for educating children with disabilities that the federal government will pay, with full funding set at 40% of the national average per-pupil expenditure. In FY2018, Part B grants to states provided approximately 15% of the excess cost for educating children with disabilities. The Secretary of Education reserves funds for outlying areas, Indian children with disabilities, and technical assistance. The remaining funds are allocated to states based on a formula. If the amount available for allocations is equal to or greater than the previous fiscal year, each state receives a base grant. The formula for distributing Part B grants to states involves providing a base grant equal to the amount received in FY1999, distributing 85% of remaining funds based on states' population ages 3 to 21 and 15% based on poor children in that age range, ensuring states receive minimum and maximum amounts, and adjusting allocations based on funding increases or decreases. States can reserve funds for administration and other activities. States receiving Part B grants can reserve funds for administration and statewide activities, including monitoring, enforcement, and complaint investigation, as well as establishing parental mediation processes. Other allowable activities include technology integration, transition programs, and addressing personnel shortages. States may also establish a risk pool for high-need children, using 10% of reserved funds for state-level activities. A state plan must be developed and reviewed annually for the risk pool. The risk pool for high-need children with disabilities determines fund distribution for direct special education services. Funds not used for services are distributed to LEAs based on a formula. Allocation includes base grants and distribution based on school enrollment and poverty levels, with no set minimum or maximum grant. The IDEA state and LEA expenditure requirements aim to increase overall educational spending, with Maintenance of Effort (MOE) provisions ensuring support for special education is not reduced below previous levels. Supplement, not supplant (SNS) requirements prohibit using IDEA grants for services already funded by other sources. The Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirement under IDEA mandates that states maintain or increase funding for special education and related services for children with disabilities each fiscal year. Failure to meet this requirement results in a reduction of the state's subsequent year grant by the same amount. Waivers can be granted for exceptional circumstances, but if the MOE requirement is not met, future financial support is not reduced. The state must provide the amount required in the absence of failing to meet MOE in the previous year to ensure future financial support is not reduced for educating children with disabilities. LEAs can only use IDEA funds for excess costs and must not decrease expenditures for children with disabilities below the previous year's level. LEAs can be eligible for funds if they assure providing the same amount from local or state and local funds as the prior year. IDEA allows for specific circumstances where an LEA can reduce local expenditures. The regulations allow for specific circumstances in which an LEA may legally reduce its local expenditures for special education, including voluntary departures of personnel, decrease in enrollment of children with disabilities, termination of costly programs, and termination of long-term expenditures. Additionally, if a state establishes a risk pool for high-cost children, the LEA may also reduce its expenditures. In certain fiscal years, an LEA can reduce local expenditures if federal allocation exceeds the previous year by up to 50%. These funds must be used for ESEA activities, with exceptions such as state requirements to maintain MOE for FAPE and restrictions based on LEA performance evaluations. The LEA must use IDEA funds to supplement state, local, and federal funds, not supplant them. The Secretary can grant a waiver of the state-level supplanting requirement if all children with disabilities have FAPE available. If an LEA maintains its special education expenditures from year to year, it meets MOE and supplanting requirements. LEAs do not have waiver provisions for supplanting or MOE. The Secretary monitors compliance. The Secretary oversees the implementation of IDEA through state supervision and state performance plans. Monitoring focuses on improving educational outcomes for children with disabilities and ensuring compliance with IDEA requirements. Three priority areas are monitored using quantifiable indicators. The Secretary oversees the implementation of IDEA through state supervision and state performance plans, focusing on improving educational outcomes for children with disabilities and ensuring compliance with IDEA requirements. Three monitoring priorities include provision of education in the least restrictive environment, state supervisory authority, and disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education. States must establish measurable targets for these indicators and report annually on their performance. The state must report annually on the performance of each LEA through the Annual Performance Report (APR) as part of the State Performance Plan (SPP) under IDEA Part B. The state is required to make the SPP, APR, and annual LEA performance report publicly available through various means, such as posting on the SEA's website and distribution to media and public agencies. The Secretary evaluates the state's compliance with IDEA Part B based on this information, monitoring visits, and other public data. If the Secretary determines that a state needs intervention or substantial intervention in implementing the requirements of IDEA Part B, they must provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Enforcement actions can range from advising the state on technical assistance to withholding further IDEA funds. The state must be notified and given a hearing before any funds are withheld. The Secretary may propose enforcement actions against states for IDEA Part B non-compliance. States must post notices on their website and distribute them publicly. While not required, states are encouraged to report enforcement actions against LEAs for transparency. States must make determinations about LEAs similar to the Secretary's. The Secretary may propose enforcement actions against states for IDEA Part B non-compliance, and states must make determinations about LEAs similar to the Secretary's. States have discretion in making annual determinations on LEA performance, considering various factors such as SPP compliance indicators, data validity, audit findings, and performance on results indicators. Performance indicators in LEA determinations are not required by regulations. The regulations stipulate enforcement mechanisms for LEAs not meeting requirements, ensuring prompt correction of noncompliance. Part A of IDEA includes critical definitions for interpreting the act. Part B of IDEA provides federal funding for the education of children with disabilities, requiring the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children aged 3-21. School districts must identify, evaluate, and provide Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) for eligible children with disabilities. Section 619 of IDEA Part B authorizes grants to states for preschool programs serving children with disabilities ages three to five, providing supplementary funding for services to this age group. The provisions, requirements, and guarantees under the grants to states program that apply to school-age children with disabilities also apply to children in this age group. Part C of IDEA focuses on providing early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families, emphasizing individualized services in natural environments like the home. Part D of IDEA authorizes competitive grants to improve the education of children with disabilities in three areas: state personnel development, personnel preparation, technical assistance, model demonstration projects, and dissemination of information, and support to improve results for children. Competitive grants are made to state educational agencies to assist in reforming and improving their systems for personnel preparation and professional development in early intervention, educational, and transitions services. Under Subpart 2, competitive grants are provided to entities like SEAs, LEAs, IHEs, and nonprofit organizations for personnel development to ensure an adequate number of skilled personnel to help children with disabilities succeed. Subpart 3 offers grants to nonprofit organizations for parent training centers and entities for research purposes. Grants are awarded to SEAs, LEAs, IHEs, and nonprofit organizations for promoting technology in special education and early intervention services."
