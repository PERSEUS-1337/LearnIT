Agencies participated in a pilot program using commercial credit cards for acquisitions, streamlining the process for routine orders like office supplies. Critics found the traditional procurement process inefficient and time-consuming, especially for small purchases. The government's purchase card program, initiated by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, aimed to simplify procurement procedures and reduce costs for small purchases. A pilot program allowed nonprocurement staff to use purchase cards for small-dollar transactions directly with local suppliers, bypassing procurement officers. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) tasked the General Services Administration (GSA) with making purchase cards available government-wide in 1989. Participation in the GSA's purchase card program was not mandatory initially, but legislative and regulatory reforms in 1993 aimed to increase purchase card use following a report by the National Performance Review (NPR). The National Performance Review (NPR) recommended expanding the use of purchase cards across the government to lower costs and reduce bureaucracy in small purchases, estimating $180 million in annual savings if half of all small acquisitions were made using purchase cards. Congress later passed legislation to promote the use of purchase cards for small purchases, building on the NPR's recommendations. Congress passed the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA; P.L. 103-355) in 1994 to increase the use of purchase cards for small purchases. FASA established a simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) of $100,000, exempting purchases below this threshold from certain procurement laws. It also set a \"micro-purchase\" threshold of $2,500, later increased to $10,000 in 2017, allowing for small acquisitions to be made without competitive bids if deemed reasonable by the cardholder. The Clinton Administration issued Executive Order 12931 in 1994 to expand the use of purchase cards and delegate micro-purchasing authority to program offices. This order aimed to streamline procurement policies and designate the purchase card as the preferred method for making micro-purchases. The use of purchase cards for micro-purchases increased sharply, with the dollar value of goods and services acquired reaching $19.5 billion in FY2011. The number of cardholders tripled to 278,000, and the number of purchase card transactions rose to just under 22.8 million. The flexibility of purchase cards, allowing for in-store purchases or orders over the phone or internet, contributed to their growth. The use of purchase cards now saves the government $1.7 billion annually in administrative costs. The federal purchase card program is implemented by individual agencies, with the involvement of GSA and OMB. The federal purchase card program is implemented by individual agencies, with GSA and OMB involvement. Agencies establish and maintain their own programs, selecting purchase card services from GSA-negotiated contracts. Each agency sets internal rules for card use, assigns cardholders to Approving Officials, and handles billing. The AO ensures purchases comply with regulations. The Agency Program Coordinator (APC) is responsible for authorizing cardholder purchases, reconciling statements, and serving as the agency's liaison to the bank and GSA. They also oversee agency-wide activities such as developing guidelines, monitoring transactions for fraud, and managing accounts. GSA's primary responsibility is to award and administer contracts with card vendors on behalf of the government through the SmartPay initiative. Purchase cards are centrally billed accounts under the contracts, requiring agencies to make full payment at the end of each billing cycle. SmartPay2 contracts took effect government-wide in November 2008. In November 2018, federal agencies began operating under SmartPay3 contracts. OMB issues guidance in Appendix B of OMB Circular A-123 for charge card management, outlining agencies' responsibilities for purchase, travel, and fleet card programs. Chapter 4 of Appendix B specifies the duties of charge card managers in implementing risk management controls to prevent misuse. Managers must review cardholder statements and data to detect delinquency and misuse, separate key duties, and maintain records for training and appointment of cardholders and authorizing officials. Chapter 4 of Appendix B of OMB Circular A-123 outlines the responsibilities of charge card managers in preventing misuse. This includes maintaining records for training, appointment of cardholders, and authorizing officials, providing appropriate training, initiating disciplinary actions for misuse, and ensuring timely reconciliation of charge card statements. The chapter also specifies administrative and disciplinary actions for misuse, such as deactivation of employee accounts, and requires managers to report suspected fraud cases to the Office of Inspector General or the Department of Justice. Circular A-123 mandates agencies to submit a charge card management plan to OMB annually to demonstrate effective internal controls and risk minimization efforts. The government requires agencies to implement internal controls to prevent card misuse and payment delinquency. Audits have revealed cases of abuse, such as an employee funneling $642,000 to her boyfriend and another employee charging personal items to their purchase card. The government has identified cases of purchase card misuse, including employees buying personal items and brewing alcohol on duty. Congress addressed these issues through hearings and highlighted internal control weaknesses. One key safeguard is the review and approval of cardholder transactions by someone other than the cardholder. Before payment is made to the purchase card vendor, the review and approval process is crucial for preventing fraud and abuse. Some agencies have failed to ensure that cardholder statements are carefully reviewed prior to approval, leading to unauthorized transactions. For example, at the Department of Education, auditors found that 37% of monthly cardholder statements had not been approved by the approving official. Overall, nearly one in six purchase card transactions government-wide had not been properly authorized. Many government agencies have failed to properly authorize purchase card transactions, with some approving officials not meeting government standards. Agencies are required to compare cardholder statements with supporting documentation like invoices and receipts. However, many agencies have not ensured that supporting documentation is available and examined during the review process. For example, an audit of HUD's purchase card program found inadequate documentation for 47% of transactions. The audit found inadequate documentation for 47% of questionable transactions, leading to fraudulent and abusive transactions going unnoticed. Examples included purchases of jewelry, home furnishings, and electronics, with one Forest Service employee accumulating over $31,000 in such items using a purchase card. The lack of oversight in government purchase card transactions is evident in cases where employees made unauthorized purchases, including cash advances at a casino. Duplicate charges and purchases by unauthorized individuals have resulted in significant financial losses, with one audit identifying $177,187 in duplicate charges at one agency. Proper dispute processes should be followed when unauthorized transactions are identified. The SmartPay master contract should be used to dispute fraudulent charges in government purchase card transactions. Many agencies fail to monitor and evaluate purchase card controls, leading to unfulfilled responsibilities of the APC. For example, audits at FAA and the Forest Service found that APCs were not utilizing available reports to detect misuse and fraud, nor assessing the overall program effectively. The Forest Service purchase card program lacked proper oversight, leading to potential misuse and fraud. Agencies need to ensure separation of duties to prevent abuse, as demonstrated by Navy cardholders ordering $500,000 of goods for personal use. Inadequate separation of duties can result in millions of dollars of items being lost or stolen. The lack of proper oversight in the Forest Service purchase card program led to potential misuse and fraud. Separation of duties is crucial to prevent abuse, as shown by Navy cardholders ordering $500,000 of goods for personal use. Millions of dollars of items can be lost or stolen without adequate separation of duties. The Department of Education and FEMA both faced issues with missing and unaccounted-for items purchased with purchase cards. Training on the proper use and management of purchase cards is essential to ensure compliance with regulations. OMB requires agencies to train all participants in purchase card programs on federal procurement laws, agency policies, and proper card use. Cardholders, approving officials, and program managers must receive training on their respective responsibilities. Initial training is required before appointment, with refresher training every three years. Agency audits from 2002 to 2011 showed some agencies had not fully implemented training requirements. Audits from 2002 to 2011 found agencies had not fully implemented OMB's training requirements. The Department of the Interior (DOI) did not provide training to its AOs, leading to inadequate reviews. AOs lacked knowledge on conducting proper purchase card transaction reviews. FAA's lack of refresher training for cardholders and AOs contributed to violations of sourcing requirements, undermining congressional procurement objectives. The Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWOD) requires government purchases from nonprofits employing blind and disabled Americans. Cardholder non-compliance with JWOD and other sourcing statutes led to millions in unauthorized transactions. The number of cardholders increased significantly from FY1993 to FY2000. Concerns over excessive credit cards and limits prompted OMB to require agencies to deactivate unnecessary cards in 2002. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for FY2003 required the Department of Defense to limit purchase cards and credit. This led to a decrease in government purchase cards. However, audits showed that some agencies did not have proper controls over card issuance. For example, a 2006 GAO report found that 20% of Department of Homeland Security cardholders had not made any purchases in over a year. The VHA's audit revealed high credit limits on purchase cards, leading to unnecessary risk. The Charge Card Act was passed in response, setting new control requirements for purchase and travel cards. The Charge Card Act amended Title 41 for civilian agencies and Title 10 for DOD, establishing similar requirements. It added civilian agency purchase card requirements to Chapter 19, Title 41, including safeguards and internal controls for cardholders and AOs. The agency ensures proper management of purchase card transactions by reconciling statements, resolving disputes, making timely payments, reviewing rebates, retaining transaction records, conducting periodic reviews, providing training, and establishing policies for card issuance. The agency uses effective systems to identify improper purchases and invalidates cards of employees who leave or transfer. They take steps to recover costs of unauthorized purchases and follow guidelines for penalties and violations. The agency enforces penalties, including dismissal, for violations of purchase card policies. Agencies with over $10 million in annual expenditures must report violations semiannually. Inspectors General assess risks and conduct audits to identify misuse and patterns of improper purchases. The Inspector General conducts audits to identify misuse and patterns of improper purchases, reporting findings and recommendations to the agency head and OMB Director for action. The Charge Card Act imposes new purchase card management requirements for the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is required to invalidate purchase cards of employees who leave or transfer, recover costs of illegal purchases, and conduct assessments to identify misuse risks. Compliance with purchase card requirements is assessed by the GAO. The GAO reviewed agency compliance with purchase card requirements and data from FY2014, with the CIGIE conducting a coordinated audit of FY2017 purchase card data. Nearly 51% of sampled purchases failed to comply with at least one purchase card policy, as reported by the CIGIE analysis. Federal statutes and regulations, along with agency-specific rules, may restrict purchases from certain merchants or for specific items. For example, USDA's purchase card guidance prohibits cash advances, bail bonds, personal items, or escort services. Agencies can block certain merchant categories like cruise lines or casinos. Some merchants are considered \"questionable\" and may require specific conditions for purchase. Exceptions for transactions with prohibited merchants must be justified. The CIGIE analysis found that 8% of high-risk purchases violated agency policies regarding prohibited or questionable merchants, with nearly half lacking proper justification. An IG discovered an employee leasing multiple vehicles without documentation for over $5,700. Agencies often failed to block prohibited merchant categories, with one agency allowing transactions at seven types of prohibited businesses. Even when attempts were made to block certain categories, the technology did not consistently work, as evidenced by 20 purchase card transactions at blocked merchants that were not declined at the point of sale. Auditors found that in nearly 20% of transactions, purchase card holders bought supplies from nonmandatory sources instead of mandatory ones, leading to potential cost overpayments and failure to support certain categories of merchants. For example, one cardholder overpaid by 565% for batteries purchased from a nonmandatory source at $64.49, when they were available from a mandatory source for $11.42. The audit revealed that cardholders frequently made purchases from nonmandatory sources without providing written justifications, leading to potential overpayments. In one instance, a cardholder overpaid by 565% for batteries, while another purchased a GPS device for 15% more than the price from a mandatory source. Additionally, documentation policies were often violated, with a majority of transactions lacking justifications and missing requisition requests, evidence of receipt, or any documentation at all. Federal purchase card transactions are usually exempt from state and local sales taxes. However, a study by IGs at 20 federal agencies found that more than 5% of high-risk transactions included charges for sales taxes. Of these transactions, 58% lacked a written justification for paying the taxes and 20% of the items purchased may not have been necessary. Agencies often did not track whether the sales taxes were recovered, as shown in investigations by the USDA IG and NASA's audit on purchase card transactions. In high-risk federal purchase card transactions, 7% included sales tax without attempts to reclaim costs. The DOI paid $338,212 in sales taxes in the first six months of FY2017. HUD spent $42,944 on sales tax in FY2018. Cardholders have a single purchase limit to prevent splitting large purchases. The CIGIE report found that 6.6% of high-risk transactions involved split transactions, where multiple purchases from the same vendor on the same day exceeded the cardholder's single purchase limit. Examples included the USDA IG identifying transactions double the limit and NASA IG discovering an employee attempting to circumvent the limit with three purchases. The Social Security Administration also noted split transactions in 6.5% of its sample, attributing it to staff constraints in investigating these purchases. The CIGIE report highlighted weaknesses in agencies' internal controls regarding purchase card misuse. Audit findings showed that Accountable Officials (AOs) did not adequately monitor cardholder purchases, leading to gaps in agency policies and procedures. AOs play a crucial role in preventing misuse by reviewing cardholder statements and reconciling transactions with supporting documentation. The ongoing need for AOs to carefully review cardholder transactions was emphasized. The need for AOs to review cardholder transactions was emphasized due to many violations of agency purchase card policies. GAO found that 11% of sampled transactions in FY2014 were not reviewed by an AO, while the CIGIE report found even higher percentages for questionable transactions. Lack of complete documentation was also a common issue, with 22% of transactions lacking it in FY2014. Additionally, purchases violating agency policies often lacked written justification, indicating a lack of thorough review by AOs. The CIGIE report highlighted that 27% of transactions violating agency purchase card policies were approved without receipts, indicating a lack of proper documentation. Many agencies had inadequate purchase card training programs, with some policies not being covered and refresher training not occurring within the past three years. This lack of training was identified as a significant weakness with wide-ranging effects, leading to cardholder noncompliance and ineffective monitoring and control activities. The CIGIE report identified deficiencies in agency training programs on purchase card policies, leading to noncompliance and ineffective monitoring. Recommendations included revising training programs to emphasize documentation requirements and maintaining complete training records. Agency guidance on purchase card requirements was found to be unclear. The CIGIE report found that agency guidance on purchase card policies was unclear, leading to noncompliance. Recommendations included revising training programs to specify \"refresher training\" frequency. NASA and EPA IGs also recommended clarifying document requirements and mandatory sources guidance. EPA had a high rate of noncompliant transactions due to inappropriate use of nonmandatory sources. The GAO found that agency policies lacked sufficient information on purchase card requirements, including the lack of a requirement for someone other than the cardholder to receive purchases. The CIGIE report highlighted common violations like split transactions and agencies lacking policies to identify them. The USDA IG identified 1,410 transactions in FY2018 where sales taxes were paid without efforts to recover them due to a lack of documentation policies. The EPA lacked controls over its purchase card program, with no specific policy for the appropriate number of cardholders needed. Oversight of agency purchase card programs is limited by data availability. The implementation of the Charge Card Act is incomplete, with not all agencies providing data that reflects all requirements. Congress may request a study on the Act's implementation. The GAO could potentially examine the implementation of the Charge Card Act to target agencies at high risk of card misuse. Evaluation may include requirements such as separation of duties, appropriate dollar thresholds, and invalidating purchase cards for terminated employees. Compliance with purchase card requirements, including activity on closed accounts, is a potential weakness noted in a CIGIE report. An evaluation of agency compliance with purchase card requirements is needed to assess the effectiveness of SmartPay bank services. Issues such as merchant block codes not always preventing transactions at prohibited merchants and banks not retaining records for the required time have been identified. Comparing technologies used by different agencies and assessing the benefits they provide could help improve oversight and reduce the risk of improper purchases. To reduce administrative burden and prevent improper purchases, agencies can assess SmartPay bank services to identify useful technologies for their charge card programs."
