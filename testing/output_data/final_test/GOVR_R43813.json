    "content": "Colombia, a long-standing democracy in Latin America, ended a five-decade civil conflict in 2017. The conflict resulted in 220,000 deaths, with 81% being civilians. The toll included 23,000 selective assassinations, 5 million internally displaced, 27,000 kidnappings, and 11,000 deaths or amputees from land mines. Colombia has overcome violence from the conflict with FARC, with 8 million registered as conflict victims. The country has seen a significant decrease in kidnappings and homicides, promoting economic growth and foreign investment. However, the economy slowed to 1.7% growth in 2017 after years of steady growth. Colombia's economy slowed to 3.1% growth in 2015 and declined to 1.7% in 2017 due to its dependence on oil and commodity exports. President Santos focused on achieving a peace agreement with FARC, the largest guerrilla organization, leading to a 300-page accord in 2016. Despite initial rejection in a referendum, the agreement was revised, ratified by the Colombian Congress, and marked a significant step towards ending the longstanding conflict. The Colombian conflict predates the formal founding of the FARC in 1964, originating from peasant self-defense groups in the 1940s and 1950s. Colombian political life has been marked by polarization and violence due to disparities and inequalities faced by landless peasants. The violence escalated in the late 19th and 20th centuries between the Liberal and Conservative parties, leading to a period of extreme violence known as La Violencia. After a brief military rule, the parties agreed to a coalition governance called the National Front. The National Front in Colombia alternated presidency between Conservatives and Liberals for 16 years (1958-1974). This power-sharing arrangement did not resolve tensions, leading to the rise of leftist insurgencies like FARC and ELN. Paramilitary groups formed in the 1980s to combat these insurgencies. The United-Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) was an umbrella organization formed by paramilitary groups in the 1990s. They engaged in military battles with FARC and ELN, and were accused of collaborating with the Colombian military. The AUC later became involved in drug trafficking and other illicit activities. Designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) by the U.S. government, the AUC was dissolved between 2003 and 2006. Former paramilitaries joined criminal bands that continued illegal activities, including drug trafficking. After the demobilization of FARC in 2017, other armed groups seized control of former FARC territory and criminal enterprises. \u00c1lvaro Uribe, elected in 2002, aimed to tackle guerrillas, paramilitary issues, and drug trafficking in Colombia, the largest cocaine producer in the region. Peace talks with FARC during President Pastrana's term (1998-2002) failed. During President Pastrana's term (1998-2002), the FARC exploited a demilitarized zone in central Colombia to strengthen itself, engage in terror attacks, and increase coca cultivation. Despite the FARC's significant power, concerns arose that the Colombian state could fail, and the FARC might seize power. President Uribe's aggressive strategy was prompted by the FARC's display of strength at his 2002 inauguration. During President Uribe's first term (2002-2006), he focused on strengthening the country's military to combat the FARC rebels. He also promoted peace negotiations with the AUC paramilitary group, leading to the demobilization of 31,000 AUC forces by mid-2006. These efforts, along with increased counternarcotics operations and military victories against the FARC, helped reduce violence in Colombia. President Uribe's security policies, known as \"Democratic Security,\" gained him widespread popularity in Colombia. In 2005, voters approved a referendum allowing him to run for a second term. After his reelection in 2006, Uribe continued to aggressively combat the FARC rebels. In 2008, key FARC leaders, including Raul Reyes, were killed, and the founder Manuel Marulanda died of a heart attack, marking a significant blow to the organization. In July 2008, the Colombian government rescued 15 FARC hostages, including U.S. defense contractors and Ingrid Bentancourt. The rescue weakened FARC morale. Uribe faced scandals, including the \"parapolitics\" scandal in 2006 and the \"false positive\" murders during his tenure. In 2009, a scandal involving illegal wiretapping by the government intelligence agency to discredit journalists and political opponents was revealed. President Uribe's popularity remained despite controversies, and a proposed referendum for a third term was rejected by Colombia's Constitutional Court. Juan Manuel Santos succeeded Uribe and consolidated his position in the National Unity party. In 2010, Juan Manuel Santos, a centrist from the National Unity party, won the presidential election with 69% of the vote. He campaigned on continuing Uribe's security policies and promoting economic growth. Santos formed a ruling coalition with various political parties, including the Conservative and Liberal parties. President Santos, elected in 2010, aimed to continue Uribe's policies while also seeking peace talks with armed rebels. He improved relations with Ecuador and Venezuela, reorganized the executive branch, and secured a free-trade agreement with the United States. In April 2011, the United States and Colombia agreed on an \"Action Plan Related to Labor Rights\" to address concerns about labor relations and violence against union members. The Santos government maintained a strong security strategy, targeting top FARC leaders like \"Mono Jojoy\" and \"Alfonso Cano.\" Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri, also known as \"Timochenko,\" became the new leader of the FARC. The Santos administration re-oriented the Colombian government's stance on the internal armed conflict through reforms, including the Victims' and Land Restitution Law in 2011. This law aimed to provide reparations to millions of conflict victims, including compensation, support, and land restitution. Implementation began in 2012, with over 100,000 restitution applications by 2016. The law addressed issues of land distribution. The Victims' Law addressed land distribution issues and restitution of stolen property to displaced victims, indicating the Santos government's interest in addressing rural concerns. The Peace Framework Law, approved in June 2012, signaled growing congressional support for a peace process. In August 2012, President Santos initiated peace talks with the FARC, with international support from Norway, Cuba, Venezuela, and Chile. Formal negotiations began in mid-November 2012. During Colombia's 2014 national elections, the opposition Centro Democr\u00e1tico party gained seats in the Senate and Chamber of Representatives, led by former President Uribe. President Santos focused on peace negotiations with the FARC, supported by the Obama Administration in February 2015. In response to the voters' criticisms, President Santos and the FARC crafted a modified peace agreement, which was ratified by the Colombian Congress on November 30, 2016. President Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2016, showing international support for the peace deal despite its initial rejection in a national plebiscite. The Colombian Congress unanimously approved the peace agreement, despite opposition criticism. The accord, negotiated over 50 rounds of talks, covered topics such as rural development, political participation, conflict resolution, drug trafficking, and justice for victims. President Santos' approval ratings fluctuated during his two terms, with the peace process being hailed as his most significant achievement. New congress and presidential elections were held in 2018. In June 2018, a new president was elected in Colombia after a second-round runoff between Iv\u00e1n Duque and Gustavo Petro. Duque won with almost 54% of the vote, while Petro received nearly 42%. Duque formed a \"unity\" government with the Conservative Party, achieving a functional majority. In the new Congress, two extra seats in the Colombian Senate and House were added for the presidential and vice presidential runners up. This allowed Gustavo Petro to return to the Senate. The Democratic Center party won the majority in the Colombian Senate, with Duque becoming the youngest Colombian president elected in a century. He had limited experience in Colombian politics and was the handpicked candidate of former president Uribe. President Duque, the handpicked candidate of former president Uribe, presented himself as a modernizer focused on economic reform and fighting crime. In his policy objectives outlined at the U.N. General Assembly, Duque called for promoting peace, combating drug trafficking, and fighting corruption, emphasizing the humanitarian crisis in neighboring Venezuela. President Duque emphasized the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, with over 1 million migrants fleeing to Colombia, posing a threat to democracy and regional stability. He proposed a leadership role in denouncing President Maduro's authoritarian government and shifting drug policy back to a stricter counterdrug approach. The influx of Venezuelans was straining Colombia's finances, estimated at nearly 0.5% of the GDP. Duque campaigned on resuming aerial spraying of coca crops with glyphosate, reversing Colombia's 2015 decision. Corruption scandals plagued the 2018 elections, with officials accused of taking bribes from the Odebrecht firm. Gustavo Petro was accused of receiving political contributions from Odebrecht. In 2017 and 2018, Colombia faced a series of corruption scandals involving top officials, politicians, and members of the judicial branch. The issue became a prominent one in Colombian politics, with allegations of bribery, ties to illegal paramilitary groups, and failed anti-corruption referendums. President Duque narrowly missed a high vote threshold in a referendum endorsing seven proposed changes. His administration's 2019 budget of $89.7 billion includes an unpopular tax reform expanding the value-added tax to cover basic food items. Approval ratings dropped from 53% to 27% due to the tax reform, which even split his own party. Colombia's economy, the fourth largest in Latin America, has been impacted by oil price declines and peso devaluation. GDP growth slowed to 1.7% in 2017, with high poverty rates and inequality contributing to social upheaval. Despite a decline in poverty from 45% in 2005 to below 27% in 2016, limited land ownership and rural poverty remain significant issues. Colombia's economy has been impacted by oil price declines and peso devaluation, with GDP growth slowing to 1.7% in 2017. Despite a decline in poverty rates from 45% in 2005 to below 27% in 2016, limited land ownership and high rural poverty rates continue to be a problem. The country is described as having a developed, middle-income economy in metropolitan areas, while rural areas face poverty, conflict, and weak governance. Ethnic minorities and disadvantaged groups in remote areas are vulnerable to illicit economies due to limited connections to the formal economy. The United States is Colombia's leading trade partner. Colombia is the 22nd largest export market and 27th largest foreign exporter to the United States, accounting for approximately 1% of U.S. trade. The country has free trade agreements with the European Union, Canada, and the United States, as well as with most nations in Latin America. Foreign direct investment in Colombia grew by 16% between 2015 and 2016, with investments coming from various sectors including petroleum, mining, agriculture, transportation, and financial services. The Santos administration aimed to promote equitable growth and end internal conflict, with unemployment dropping below 10% during Santos's first term. Colombia's unemployment rate, which dropped below 10% during Santos's first term, was at 9.2% in 2016 and rose slightly to an estimated 9.6% in 2018. Despite being ranked highly for business-friendly practices, Colombia faces challenges with corruption and implementing institutional reforms, especially in regions with weak government presence. The country has shown political commitment to job creation, developing capital markets, and improving legal and regulatory systems. However, issues like a complex tax system, high corporate tax burden, and piracy and counterfeiting persist. Colombia's rural-sector protestors began strikes and blockades in 2013, demanding agricultural reform in a country with unequal land ownership. In 2018, secondary and university students protested for more education funding. Peace talks between FARC and the Santos administration in Norway and Cuba led to agreements on six major topics, with verification being the most challenging. The Colombian Congress approved a revised peace accord in late 2016, with fast track implementation granted by the Constitutional Court in December 2016. The post-accord peace programs face challenges due to declining revenues, with estimates of $30 to $45 billion needed over 15 years. Some programs, like those related to drug trafficking, received expedited regulation by Congress. In May 2017, a high court ruling affected all legislation related to FARC disarmament and demobilization. The high court ruling in May 2017 required full debate on legislation related to the peace accord implementation, slowing down the process. The Kroc Institute at the University of Notre Dame monitors the agreement and reported that 63% of the 578 commitments have started implementation. The implementation progress was considered average compared to other peace accords studied, with the demobilization of FARC being the first provision undertaken. The demobilization of the FARC was monitored by a U.N. mission approved by the U.N. Security Council. U.N. monitors seized over 750 caches of arms identified by FARC leaders. President Santos declared the conflict over in mid-August 2017. The United Nations verified the collection of 8,994 arms, 1.7 million rounds, and 40 tons of explosives by September 2017. The Colombian government accredited roughly 11,000 ex-combatants for transition to civilian life. The FARC revealed hidden assets worth over $330 million in mostly real estate investments in September 2017. The FARC's reintegration into civil society faces challenges, including security concerns for ex-combatants. Criticism arose over the government's handling of the group's demobilization, with reports of 85 FARC members and relatives killed by the end of 2018. The FARC's past attempts at political participation resulted in violence against party members. The government faced criticism for inadequate preparation for FARC's demobilization, leading to slow reintegration of former combatants. Delays were caused by a court ruling and controversy over the Special Jurisdiction of Peace. Limited attention was given to including ethnic Colombians in the peace accord's implementation. The peace accord in Colombia includes Territorially Focused Development Programs (PDETs) to aid in rural development in areas most affected by the armed conflict. These areas have chronic poverty, inequality, illicit crops, and low government performance. Failure to effectively reintegrate FARC former combatants could jeopardize peace efforts. Colombia's peace accord commitments, including the Special Jurisdiction of Peace to address crimes from the armed conflict, face skepticism. Challenges include the case of FARC leader Jes\u00fas Santrich, accused of drug trafficking post-accord. The country grapples with a complex security environment involving armed groups like the FARC. Colombia faces a complex security environment with armed groups like the FARC, ELN, and successors of the AUC. The FARC, reduced by government military campaigns, conducted terrorist activities during peace negotiations until 2015. A peace accord was reached in 2016, but some FARC members have become dissidents. The demobilized rebels transitioned to a political role as per the peace accord. The demobilized rebels from the FARC transitioned to a political party known as the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force (FARC) in 2017. The FARC Party announced their presidential ticket with Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o (Timochenko) as president and Imelda Daza as vice president. Despite running candidates in congressional races, the FARC Party only filled automatic seats in Congress. The ELN, involved in criminal activities, saw a decline in resources and fighters, estimated to be fewer than 2,000 in 2018. The ELN, with around 2,000 fighters in 2018, engaged in peace talks with the Santos government in Ecuador. Despite continued attacks and kidnappings, formal negotiations began in Quito in 2017 and moved to Cuba in 2018. President Duque suspended talks in September 2018. The ELN is decentralized and nonhierarchical compared to the FARC. In late 2018, FARC dissident groups and the ELN in Venezuela discussed increasing coordination. A car bomb attack in Bogot\u00e1 in January 2019, allegedly by the ELN, killed 20 police cadets. The ELN claimed responsibility, leading to large protests in Bogot\u00e1. The Duque government ended peace talks with the ELN and requested extradition of their delegation. The Duque government has persistently requested the extradition of ELN negotiators involved in peace talks in Cuba since 2017. The AUC, a paramilitary organization, officially disbanded a decade ago, but many former members continued illicit activities or joined criminal groups known as Bacrim. The Bacrim, successors to paramilitaries, are seen as the biggest threat to Colombia's security. The dominant Bacrim group, Los Urabe\u00f1os, is heavily involved in various criminal activities. Leaders like \"Don Mario\" and his brother were designated drug kingpins in 2009. In 2015, indictments were unsealed against 17 alleged Urabe\u00f1os members as part of the Colombian government's efforts to dismantle the group. The Urabe\u00f1os faced intense enforcement campaigns by the police and military, leading to the capture of top leaders. In 2017, the Urabe\u00f1os leader \"Otoniel\" requested surrender terms after his wife's arrest and siblings' deaths or arrests. Colombia captured 12 metric tons of cocaine linked to the Urabe\u00f1os in November 2017. Various splinter groups of Colombian drug cartels have emerged and disappeared over the years, including the Norte del Valle Cartel and Los Rastrajos. The DEA's 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment highlights the collaboration between Colombian TCOs and Mexican/Central American TCOs in exporting cocaine. Despite ideological differences, FARC and ELN have worked with Bacrim and other crime groups in drug trafficking. Venezuela serves as a major transit point. Venezuela is a key transit point for Colombian cocaine due to its porous border, economic crisis, weak judicial system, and corrupt environment. Insight Crime identified over 120 high-level Venezuelan officials involved in criminal activities, with the military, especially the National Guard, colluding with drug traffickers since 2002. Los Rastrojos control gasoline smuggling routes between Venezuela and Colombia, while ELN guerrillas seek safe haven in the region. In 2018, ELN guerrillas have shifted from seeking refuge in Venezuela to controlling illegal gold mining areas near the Venezuela-Guyana border. They recruit Venezuelans to grow coca in Colombia, while human trafficking and sexual exploitation of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia is widespread. Dissident FARC guerrillas are regrouping in border and remote areas, potentially forming a more unified organization or collaborating with criminal groups in Venezuela. The State Department's 2017 terrorism report noted a 40% decrease in terrorist incidents in Colombia by FARC and ELN. The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela has led to a mass exodus of migrants to Colombia, with over 3 million Venezuelans living outside their country. ELN aggression has decreased by 40%, but they are still carrying out high-impact attacks. Venezuela's economy has collapsed, leading to hyperinflation and severe shortages of food and medicine. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has refused most international humanitarian assistance. The deteriorating conditions in Venezuela have led to a mass exodus of migrants to neighboring countries, particularly Colombia. The spread of diseases like measles is a major concern in the region. The Trump Administration has backed Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president and offered humanitarian assistance. Colombia, along with other countries, is working towards a return to democracy in Venezuela. Colombia's efforts to reduce violence and strengthen the economy have been successful, but human rights violations persist, including violence targeting noncombatants such as killings, torture, and kidnappings. Various groups, including guerrillas and paramilitaries, have been responsible for these abuses. The report analyzes nearly 2,000 massacres in Colombia between 1980 and 2012, with 58.9% committed by paramilitaries, 17.3% by guerrillas, and 7.9% by security forces. Human rights abuses in Colombia include extrajudicial killings, torture, rape, and violence against journalists, human rights defenders, and vulnerable groups. The U.N. special rapporteur criticized the high rates of murders of human rights defenders in Colombia, often carried out by hitmen paid minimal amounts. The Colombian judicial system struggles to prosecute these crimes effectively, leading to ongoing concerns about extrajudicial executions, particularly by the military. In 2008, it was revealed that young men from Soacha were lured by military personnel with promises of employment, only to be executed. The Soacha murder victims were disguised as guerrilla fighters by the military to inflate body counts, known as false positives. 27 soldiers and officers were fired, including three generals, and the army's commander resigned. The Colombian prosecutor general's investigations have been slow, with some military members released due to statute of limitations. The U.N.'s Special Rapporteur investigated the false positive phenomenon in 2009. The U.N.'s Special Rapporteur investigated the false positive killings in Colombia, finding a systematic pattern within the military between 2004 and 2008. While the number of new cases decreased in recent years, some were still reported in 2012 through 2015. The Santos administration proposed a reform to address human rights violations, but it was not approved by the Colombian Congress. The Colombian Congress approved a law in late December 2012 to expand the jurisdiction of military courts, despite criticism from human rights groups. The law was later struck down by the Colombian Constitutional Court in October 2013. Human Rights Watch reported on false positive cases in 2015, noting investigations into over 3,000 cases resulting in about 800 convictions, mostly of lower-ranking soldiers. Few convictions involved former commanders, and investigations of 16 active and retired personnel were ongoing. In 2016, prosecutions against army generals for false positives continued, with some cases closed and 12 under investigation. The Colombian prosecutor indicted Santiago Uribe for murder and association with a paramilitary group. The State Department's 2017 human rights report mentioned new cases of homicide by security forces. 80 human rights defenders were murdered in 2016, and 51 in the first half of 2017. In 2016, 80 human rights defenders were murdered, with another 51 in the first half of 2017. The numbers may be higher, with some sources reporting up to 117 murders in 2016. Since the approval of the 2016 peace accord, violence against social leaders, ethnic community leaders, and human rights defenders has continued at high levels. Over 100 activists were killed in 2017 and 2018, with 109 human rights and civil society activists killed in 2018 alone. Some of the victims were leaders working to implement the peace accord, such as the 13 social leaders assassinated in the southwest department of Cauca in the first six months of 2018. Since early 2012, violence against land rights activists has increased sharply due to the implementation of the Victims' Law. Perpetrators of threats and assassinations have faced little to no prosecution, creating a threatening environment for claimants. Human Rights Watch reported a rise in violence against land activists, with over 500 serious threats against claimants in less than 18 months. Claimants who received land judgments were too scared to return, highlighting the lack of legal consequences for perpetrators. According to Human Rights Watch, violence against land rights activists in Colombia has increased sharply, with over 500 serious threats and killings in less than 18 months. Paramilitary-influenced Bacrim groups are often responsible, possibly acting on behalf of landowners trying to protect their land. The National Protection Unit (UPN) program in Colombia provides protection measures to at-risk individuals, but it has been criticized for corruption and lack of support in prosecuting attackers. The State Department's Report on Human Rights Practices for 2017 stated that the UPN protected around 6,067 individuals at risk. In 2017, the UPN protected 6,067 at-risk individuals, including 575 human rights activists, with a $150 million budget. Journalists in Colombia face a dangerous environment, with 47 killed since 1992. Three Ecuadorian journalists were killed by a FARC dissident group in 2018, leading to the end of peace talks with the ELN. The U.N.'s High Commissioner of Human Rights mandate was renewed in 2016 to monitor the peace accord implementation. Violence against the labor movement in Colombia has been a longstanding issue. Violence against the labor movement in Colombia has been a longstanding issue, leading to concerns about trade relations with the U.S. The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement required Colombia to address labor standards and violence against trade union members. In April 2011, an \"Action Plan Related to Labor Rights\" was agreed upon, containing 37 measures to address violence, impunity, and workers' rights protection. Despite progress made in implementing the Labor Action Plan (LAP) under the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, violence against labor union members in Colombia continues. The Colombian government acknowledges ongoing violence but highlights a general decrease in violence levels since 2002. Human rights and labor organizations raise concerns about targeted violence towards labor activists, although the reasons behind these attacks are debated. The homicide rate in Colombia has significantly decreased since 2002, with the rate dropping from 68.9 per 100,000 to 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016. The number of labor union killings has also declined, with a decrease from 191 murders in 2001 to 20 in 2012 according to the National Labor School. In 2017, there were 14 reported labor murders. Between January 2011 and August 2017, there were 162 homicide cases involving labor union members, resulting in 409 convictions. Labor advocates highlight the ongoing climate of intimidation faced by Colombian labor unions, including death threats and harassment. Despite efforts to combat impunity through the Labor Action Plan, there is still a significant backlog of cases involving violent crimes against union members. The internal conflict in Colombia has led to a mass displacement of civilians, impacting poverty levels and stability in the country. Colombia has one of the largest populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the world, with over 7 million IDPs, representing more than 10% of the population. The displacement crisis is particularly affecting Indigenous and Afro-Colombian people, who make up 15%-22% of the population but are disproportionately displaced. The Consultancy for Human Rights and Displacement (CODHES) reports that 36% of forced displacement victims in 2012 came from the Pacific region, where economic development is marginal due to weak government presence. The Pacific region in Colombia faces economic challenges due to weak government presence and societal discrimination. Illegal armed groups exploit the region's valuable land near a major port and drug trafficking routes, leading to conflicts with Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities. Displaced populations, including ethnic minorities, women, and children, suffer from stigma, poverty, and abuse. Women, who make up over half of the displaced population, are at risk of sexual harassment, violence, and human trafficking. Displacement in Colombia is driven by various factors, including armed conflict in remote regions and urban violence. Victims often face threats of recruitment, violence, and sexual abuse. The Victims' Law of 2011 aims to help displaced individuals reclaim their land. The Victims' Law of 2011 in Colombia aims to redress displacement victims by returning stolen land to those affected since 1991. The law targets 360,000 families (impacting 1.5 million people) with 50% of the land to be restituted containing land mines. Implementation has been hindered by armed groups in affected areas. Between 2011 and 2016, 100,000 restitution applications were filed, with only 5,000 properties successfully returned. International support from USAID has helped establish a Victims Unit to provide services like financial compensation and psychosocial support. The 2011 Victims' Law in Colombia aims to provide services for victims, including financial compensation and psychosocial support. The Colombian government's Victims Unit has provided reparations to over 800,000 victims and support to 700,000 as of October 2018. Despite efforts, internal displacement in Colombia continued with over 171,000 internally displaced in 2016. The influx of refugees from Venezuela into Colombia has increased due to the political crisis and economic turmoil in Venezuela. Colombia faces challenges with the influx of Venezuelan migrants due to Venezuela's economic crisis. Former President Santos announced stricter migratory controls and increased security personnel along the border. Colombia shares long borders with neighboring countries, some of which are porous to illegal armed groups. The territory is remote and rugged, with inconsistent state presence. Colombia's borders with Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama have been problematic due to spillover effects from the armed conflict. Relations with Venezuela and Ecuador have been strained by Colombia's counterinsurgency operations. Former President Uribe accused Venezuela of harboring insurgent groups. Ecuador-Colombia relations remained tense after a Colombian military bombardment in 2008. In 2008, a military bombardment of a FARC camp inside Ecuador led to Ecuador severing diplomatic relations with Colombia for 33 months. Ecuador later filed a suit against Colombia in the International Court of Justice for damages caused by spray drift from Colombia's aerial eradication of drug crops. In 2013, Colombia settled with Ecuador for $15 million. President Santos improved relations with Ecuador and Venezuela, but concerns about Venezuelan links to FARC and ELN persisted. Both countries committed to combating narcotics trafficking together. The Venezuelan and Colombian governments agreed to jointly combat narcotics trafficking and illegal armed group activities along the border. Venezuela supported the FARC-government peace talks. Ecuador hosted talks between the ELN and the Santos government, later moving them to Cuba due to border violence. The Darien region in Panama was used by FARC soldiers for rest, resupply, and drug transit, but by 2015 the FARC presence had diminished. In 2015, the FARC no longer had a permanent militarized presence in Panamanian territory, thanks to effective approaches by Panama's National Border Service in coordination with Colombia. Challenges in the remote Darien region include drug trafficking by smaller organizations and criminal groups like Bacrim, as well as issues with human smuggling with counterterrorism implications. The Action Plan on Regional Security Cooperation, announced during the Sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012 by Presidents Obama and Santos, focuses on combating transnational organized crime, counternarcotics, strengthening institutions, and building security capacity in Central America and the Caribbean. The Colombian government's plan focuses on capacity building for security personnel in Central America and the Caribbean. Between 2013 and 2017, almost 17,000 individuals were trained through hundreds of activities in cooperation with several countries. The program has expanded significantly, with a growing number of activities planned for 2018. Around 80% of those trained were from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, with efforts to export Colombian expertise in combating crime and terrorism. The Colombian government's plan aims to export expertise in combating crime and terrorism, with a focus on capacity building for security personnel in Central America and the Caribbean. Critics raise human rights concerns and call for more transparency in the funding of these activities. Training is mainly provided by the Colombian National Police, covering various areas such as interdiction, explosives, intelligence operations, and counternarcotics police programs. Some analysts praise the Colombian training, stating that U.S. assistance has helped improve and professionalize the Colombian military. Colombia's military has been improved and professionalized, becoming the region's second largest. The Colombian National Police now focus on domestic security, allowing Colombia to potentially play a greater role in regional and international coalition efforts. President Trump considered designating Colombia as noncompliant with U.S. counternarcotics requirements in 2017 but did not proceed due to Colombian training efforts to combat narcotics. The U.S. and Colombia have strong diplomatic ties dating back to the 19th century. Colombia's role in drug production has led to close collaboration with the United States. The United States and Colombia have a strong partnership that began with counternarcotics efforts under Plan Colombia. Over 16 years, the U.S. provided over $10 billion in assistance, leading to progress in combating drug trafficking and terrorism in Colombia. This partnership has expanded to include sustainable development, human rights, trade, and regional security cooperation. Colombia's role as a major source of illicit drugs, particularly cocaine, has been a key issue in U.S.-Colombian relations since the 1980s. The FARC and other armed groups in Colombia funded themselves through narcotics trafficking, fueling internal conflicts. By the late 1990s, Colombia had become the dominant player in the cocaine trade, leading to increased concern in the United States due to the crack cocaine epidemic. Colombia's significant role in drug production, including cocaine and heroin, led to U.S. support for Plan Colombia. This strategy aimed to end armed conflict, combat drug trafficking, and promote development. The plan evolved under changing leadership and conditions, followed by successor strategies like the National Consolidation Plan. U.S.-Colombia policy now focuses on post-conflict Colombia. The U.S. supported Plan Colombia under President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana to combat drug trafficking by strengthening security, rebuilding institutions, and extending state presence. The focus was on reducing drug production through training, equipping counternarcotics units, drug eradication programs, and alternative development. The goal was to reduce narcotics activities by 50% in six years through eradication and strengthening the Colombian Armed Forces. The U.S. supported Plan Colombia to combat drug trafficking by strengthening security, rebuilding institutions, and extending state presence. The program aimed to reduce drug production, protect citizens from violence, promote human rights, bolster the economy, and improve governance. U.S. officials emphasized counterdrug elements to gain bipartisan support in Congress. President George W. Bush oversaw changes to the program, with the primary vehicle for U.S. support being the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The Bush Administration requested new flexibility in foreign operations appropriations to support a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorist activities in Colombia. Congress granted this request but prohibited direct participation in combat missions by U.S. personnel. There was a legislative cap on the number of U.S. military and civilian contractor personnel stationed in Colombia, which was adjusted over time. President Uribe embraced Plan Colombia with an aggressive strategy towards insurgent forces, prioritizing citizen security. His Democratic Security Policy, implemented through Plan Patriota, relied on the military to push FARC forces to remote areas. Uribe expanded the Colombian military and police, enhancing their intelligence capacity and coordination with training from U.S. forces. This led to increased state control over national territory and a significant reduction in kidnappings. President Uribe's shift to a \"Policy of Consolidation of Democratic Security\" in 2007 aimed to consolidate state presence in neglected areas vulnerable to drug cultivation and violence. The National Consolidation Plan, implemented in 2009, saw increased Colombian support for security efforts, including a \"wealth tax\" to fund defense expenditures. Overall, U.S. contributions to Plan Colombia were minimal compared to Colombia's own investments. U.S. expenditures on Plan Colombia were a small fraction of Colombia's total security costs, with estimates suggesting it was less than 10%. Colombia increased its military and police spending from less than 2% of GDP in 2000 to over 4% in 2010. Congressional support for Plan Colombia shifted in 2008, with some members feeling there was too much focus on security compared to development and rule of law programs. Since FY2008, Congress has realigned assistance proportions, reducing security-related programs and increasing economic and social aid for Colombia. As Colombia's security situation improved, the U.S. began transferring operational and financial responsibility to Colombians for military programs. The goal was to gradually reduce U.S. assistance to pre-Plan Colombia levels, adjusted for inflation, while still aiming to reduce the supply of illegal drugs from Colombia. Plan Colombia, initially aimed at reducing illegal drug supply from Colombia, evolved into a broader policy with bipartisan support from three U.S. Administrations. Some analysts consider it one of the most successful U.S. initiatives in the Western Hemisphere, while others criticized its emphasis on militarization over addressing underlying issues like rural violence and poverty. Improvements in security conditions in Colombia have led to economic growth and reduced poverty levels over time. The National Consolidation Plan, launched during the Uribe Administration, aimed to integrate security, development, and counternarcotics efforts to establish a permanent state presence in vulnerable areas affected by marginalization, drug trafficking, and violence. The United States supported Colombia's consolidation plan through the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI), providing assistance to fill gaps in government programming. CSDI coordinated efforts of various U.S. agencies to expand state presence and promote economic opportunities in priority zones, combining counternarcotics assistance with economic and social development initiatives. The focus of U.S. assistance to Colombia has shifted towards post-conflict planning and supporting the country's transition to peace by building democratic institutions, protecting human rights, and promoting economic opportunity. USAID's strategy for 2014-2018 anticipated a negotiated agreement with the FARC and emphasized early implementation efforts to demonstrate effective practices. Colombia is envisioned to evolve from an aid recipient to a provider of technical assistance to neighbors in the next five years. Consolidating state authority in rural areas post-FARC disarmament is a challenge. Reintegration of insurgent forces like the FARC and ELN is costly and complex. Critics argue that the Colombian government lacks commitment to civilian-led development. USAID outlined priorities for U.S. economic assistance after President Duque took office in August 2018. After President Duque took office, USAID announced priorities for U.S. economic development assistance to Colombia, including dismantling organized crime, enhancing security institutions, promoting job creation through trade, improving the investment climate for U.S. companies, and strengthening governance for sustainable peace. Plan Colombia, initially approved by Congress in 2000, was funded annually through appropriations until FY2016. From FY2000 through FY2016, U.S. funding for Plan Colombia and its follow-on strategies exceeded $10 billion in State Department and Defense Department programs. Funding for Colombia shifted between different accounts over the years, with assistance gradually declining since FY2008 due to tighter foreign aid budgets. In FY2014, funds appropriated to Colombia from State were reduced in line with other foreign assistance reductions. In FY2014, funds for Colombia from State Department accounts declined to below $325 million, in line with other foreign assistance reductions. In FY2015, Congress appropriated $300 million for bilateral assistance to Colombia. The FY2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill provided nearly $300 million to Colombia from U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development accounts. In FY2017, Congress funded the \"Peace Colombia\" program at $391.3 million to support the peace process and accord implementation. In FY2017, Congress funded Peace Colombia at $391.3 million, with $187 million allocated to build government presence and assist conflict victims. INCLE funding increased to $143 million for coca crop eradication and police support, with additional funds for training Colombian forces. Foreign Military Financing received $38.5 million, and Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs received $21 million for demining efforts. The Trump Administration's proposed foreign aid budget for FY2018 would have reduced assistance to Colombia to $251 million, but Congress approved $391.3 million to support Colombia's transition to peace. The FY2019 budget request is $265 million, a 32% reduction from the previous year, while House and Senate bills aim to maintain funding at $391.3 million. The FY2019 Administration request would reduce post-conflict recovery programs and focus more on counternarcotics and security. Colombia has also received additional U.S. humanitarian funding to assist with over 1 million Venezuelan migrants, totaling approximately $96.5 million for FY2017 and FY2018 combined, with $54.8 million allocated for Colombia. The U.S. is providing humanitarian assistance to Venezuelan arrivals in Colombia, with $37 million in bilateral aid for medium- and longer-term efforts. Concerns about human rights violations in Colombia, especially by recipients of U.S. assistance, have been raised by some Members of Congress due to violations committed by various groups in Colombia's 50-year conflict. Security forces in Colombia have committed serious violations, including noncombatant killings, massacres, kidnappings, forced displacements, and land mine casualties. The Colombian judiciary is overwhelmed with human rights cases, leading to slow progress in prosecutions. Despite some prosecutions, impunity for these crimes persists, and continued violations remain a concern. Congress has required annual certification from the Secretary of State regarding the Colombian military's ties to paramilitaries since 2002. The Colombian military is cutting ties with paramilitaries and the government is investigating human rights abuses. Certification is required for a percentage of funds to be released, with some critics questioning the process. Critics acknowledge the flawed but useful tool of human rights conditions on military assistance to Colombia. The U.S. government consults with Colombian and international human rights groups. The \"Leahy Law\" restricts U.S. assistance to Colombian security forces if there are credible human rights violations. The DOD Leahy provisions, expanded in the FY2014 appropriations legislation, prohibit assistance to foreign security forces with credible human rights violations. Leahy vetting is conducted by U.S. embassies and State Department headquarters, disqualifying about 1% of forces annually. The Leahy provisions disqualify about 1% of foreign security forces annually due to human rights violations. In Colombia, the State Department vets more candidates for assistance than in any other country, with the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 cited for best practices in vetting operations. Some human rights organizations criticize the Leahy vetting process in Colombia, citing extrajudicial executions by Colombian military units as evidence of its failure. The Fellowship of Reconciliation alleges a link between false positive killings and vetted Colombian military units. Critics argue that the U.S. government has overlooked abusive behavior by Colombian security forces despite restrictions on assistance. Plan Colombia has had mixed success in counternarcotics efforts, with Colombia remaining a major producer of cocaine. Despite enforcement and eradication efforts, Colombia's production was squeezed, leading Peru to briefly surpass it as the global leader in cocaine production. Eradication of coca bush and opium poppy was a priority, along with alternative development programs funded by the U.S. Plan Colombia, funded by the U.S., aimed to reduce illicit drug cultivation but fell short of its goal. Despite this, Colombia saw significant reductions in coca cultivation, with estimates showing a decline from 167,000 hectares in 2007 to 78,000 hectares in 2012. Poppy cultivation also decreased by over 90% between 2000 and 2009. However, Colombia's potential cocaine production dropped to 170 metric tons in 2012, the lowest in two decades, before starting to rise slightly in 2013. In 2012, Colombia saw the lowest level of potential cocaine production in two decades. However, cultivation of coca and cocaine production increased significantly from 2014 to 2016 due to the end of aerial eradication of coca crops. In 2015, Colombia halted aerial eradication due to health concerns, and in 2016, the U.S. DEA reported that 95% of seized cocaine in the U.S. originated from Colombia. By 2017, Colombia cultivated a record 209,000 hectares of coca, capable of producing 921 metric tons of cocaine. In 2017, Colombia's potential cocaine production reached nearly 1,370 metric tons, a 31% increase from 2016. Despite economic stability and improved security, cocaine exports to the U.S. remain a major concern. Colombia cultivated 146,000 hectares of coca in 2016, increasing to 171,000 hectares in 2017. Cocaine seizures were high, but not enough to counter the production increases. Manual and aerial eradication were key components of Plan Colombia to reduce coca cultivation. Central components of Plan Colombia aimed to reduce coca and poppy cultivation through manual and aerial eradication. Manual eradication involved uprooting and killing plants, while aerial eradication used herbicide spraying from aircraft. Aerial spraying was preferred due to the dangers of manual eradication in Colombia's internal conflict. The practice of aerial spraying faced controversy for health and environmental reasons, leading to Colombia's decision to end it in 2015. Congress regularly funded the spraying program since 2002. The State Department, with input from relevant agencies, certifies the safety of aerial spraying for drug crop eradication. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness and costs compared to other strategies. Aerial eradication, along with manual eradication, led to a decline in coca cultivation in Colombia. However, eradication efforts decreased in 2013. In 2013, Colombia reduced aerial eradication efforts due to various reasons, including the suspension of the U.S.-supported spray program and security challenges. Ecuador also won a settlement for the negative effects of spray drift over its border. The government and FARC agreed to prioritize voluntary manual eradication over forced eradication in May 2014. Aerial eradication remained part of the government's drug control strategy. In April 2015, the Santos administration determined that glyphosate, a herbicide used to eradicate coca plants in Colombia, was \"probably carcinogenic\" to humans. The government ended spraying operations in October 2015 and shifted towards a new public health approach to illicit drugs, focusing on alternative development and interdiction efforts. The State Department warned of expanding illicit cultivation in Colombia, including in national parks and indigenous territories. Colombian interdiction practices are effective, with significant seizures of cocaine and other drugs. USAID funds alternative development programs to help communities transition from illicit crops to legal livelihoods. USAID supports alternative development programs in Colombia to shift communities from illicit crops to legal livelihoods, focusing on economic development and assisting farmers in transitioning to licit economic opportunities. These initiatives aim to strengthen small farmer organizations, improve productivity, and connect them to markets. Challenges in past programs were attributed to ongoing insecurity and lack of timely implementation during the Colombian conflict. The Colombian government's renewed commitment to alternative development and crop substitution in the 2016 peace accord with the FARC faces challenges due to ongoing insecurity. Implementation of the peace accord on drug eradication and crop substitution began in late May 2017, with a goal of eradicating 100,000 hectares of coca through voluntary and forced manual eradication. At the U.S.-Colombia High Level Dialogue in March 2018, a renewed commitment to the partnership between the United States and Colombia was announced. The goal is to reduce Colombia's cocaine production and coca cultivation by 50% by 2023 through expanded counternarcotics cooperation. A memorandum of understanding was signed to combat illegal gold mining funding criminal organizations. President Duque aims for a more aggressive drug policy, potentially restarting aerial eradication. President Duque aims to restart aerial eradication of the herbicide glyphosate, with experimentation using drones ongoing. He authorized police to confiscate drugs, leading to seizures, but this may violate a 1994 court ruling allowing personal drug possession. Drug trafficking in Colombia continues to fuel land conflicts. Drug trafficking in Colombia triggers conflict over land and affects vulnerable groups. National and international pressure for drug eradication could lead to human rights violations. Analysts suggest investments in economic and education opportunities to reduce drug cultivation. Economic relations between Colombia and the United States have deepened. The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement deepened economic relations between the two countries. U.S. investment in Colombia reached $7 billion in 2014 but dropped to $6.2 billion in 2016. U.S. exports to Colombia exceeded $26.8 billion in 2016, with major exports including oil, machinery, cereals, organic chemicals, and plastic. U.S. imports from Colombia declined due to a decrease in crude oil imports. Colombia's trade with the U.S. has diversified beyond crude oil, with imports including gold, coffee, cut flowers, and fruits. Congressional interest in Colombia now focuses on bilateral trade following the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Colombia is a key member of the Pacific Alliance, aiming to deepen trade integration and reduce barriers with partners like Chile, Mexico, and Peru. The Alliance seeks to create a common stock market and serve as an export platform to the Asia-Pacific region. Colombia plays a leadership role in the Alliance and has recently joined. Colombia's leadership in the Pacific Alliance and accession to the OECD in May 2018 are significant developments. The Santos administration worked towards meeting OECD membership criteria to showcase Colombia's world-class development standards. Progress has been made on trade issues such as copyright, pharmaceuticals, fuel regulations, and labor concerns. Congress remains interested in Colombia's future due to its advancements in these areas. Colombia's close alliance with the United States has been supported through 17 years of investment in security and stability. Plan Colombia and its successor strategies have expanded to include humanitarian concerns, democratic development, human rights protections, and trade and investment. However, the record expansion of Colombia's coca crop and increasing cocaine exports to the United States could hinder peace efforts and increase corruption. Some Colombians remain skeptical of the peace process and the FARC's role in democracy. Support for peace programs in Colombia is crucial to fulfill promises made in the peace accords to the country's 8.6 million victims of the conflict. President Duque's government faces challenges including an upsurge in illicit drug crops, slow implementation of peace accord provisions, violence among criminal groups, and Venezuela's humanitarian crisis leading to a surge of migrants. Foreign assistance from the U.S. Congress for Colombia has been declining since FY2008. Foreign assistance from the U.S. Congress for Colombia declined in FY2008 but increased in FY2017 and FY2018 to support peace and the FARC-government peace accord. Congress may want to continue cooperation with Colombian partners in training for counternarcotics and security, monitoring Colombia's domestic security situation, overseeing drug trafficking, human rights protections, and expanding cooperation in various sectors. Congress may also aim to foster Colombian leadership in the region. Congress may seek to foster Colombian leadership in the region to counter political instability in Venezuela and expand investment and trade opportunities bilaterally and within regional groupings like the Pacific Alliance. U.S.-Colombian trade improvements are seen to depend on the overall relationship between the two countries."
