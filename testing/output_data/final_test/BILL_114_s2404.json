    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Do Not Track Online Act of 2015\" and includes regulations related to \"do-not-track\" mechanisms. The \"Do Not Track Online Act of 2015\" mandates the Federal Trade Commission to establish standards for individuals to indicate their preference on personal information collection by online service providers, including mobile apps. Providers are prohibited from collecting information from individuals who opt out and from discriminating against them. The rules allow for the collection and use of personal information on an individual, even if the individual expresses a preference against it, under certain conditions: necessary for requested services with anonymization or deletion after service provision, or with clear notice and affirmative consent from the individual. The Federal Trade Commission considers factors like scope, technical feasibility, and existing mechanisms when promulgating standards and rules for the collection and use of personal information. Individuals must affirmatively consent to such collection and use. The Federal Trade Commission considers factors like scope, technical feasibility, and existing mechanisms when setting standards for personal information collection. Individuals must consent to data collection by online service providers, including mobile apps. Evaluation criteria include ease of use, universality, and how to publicize mechanisms meeting standards. Anonymized data collection methods are also explored. The standards for collecting personal information for online services must fulfill basic functionality, provide requested content or services, and serve other purposes determined by the Commission. The Federal Trade Commission will establish rules for collecting personal information, including persistent identifiers like IP addresses and MAC addresses, to enhance online service functionality without compromising user preferences. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT OF ``DO-NOT-TRACK'' MECHANISMS. The Federal Trade Commission enforces rules regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Act, treating violations as violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission has the same enforcement powers, jurisdiction, and duties as under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Act enforces penalties and privileges similar to the Federal Trade Commission Act. Nonprofit organizations are also subject to enforcement. States can also enforce the Act through their attorney general. The attorney general of a State can bring a civil action on behalf of residents to address violations of rules by individuals, seeking injunctions, compliance, damages, and other appropriate relief in federal court. The attorney general of a State can bring a civil action on behalf of residents to address violations of rules by individuals, seeking injunctions, compliance, damages, and other appropriate relief in federal court. Civil penalties for violating rules under section 2(a)(2) can be imposed up to $15,000,000, with a daily penalty not exceeding $16,000 for non-compliance. The civil penalties for violating rules under section 2(a)(2) shall not exceed $15,000,000 for all civil actions brought against the person. The amounts specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) will be adjusted for inflation annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The federal trade commission has rights, including receiving notice of actions. The attorney general of a State must notify the Federal Trade Commission before initiating a civil action, except in certain cases where it is not feasible to do so. The notification must include a copy of the complaint to be filed. When initiating a civil action, the attorney general must notify the Federal Trade Commission immediately. The FTC can intervene in the action, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. No limitations on investigatory powers in this subsection. The attorney general of a State has investigatory powers to conduct investigations and compel witnesses or evidence. If the FTC takes action on a violation, the State attorney general cannot bring a civil action against the same defendant during that time. The attorney general of a State has investigatory powers to conduct investigations and compel witnesses or evidence. If the FTC takes action on a violation, the State attorney general cannot bring a civil action against the same defendant during that time. Venue and service of process for actions brought under paragraph (1) are specified, allowing for actions in district courts meeting venue requirements or other courts of competent jurisdiction. Additionally, other state officials may also take civil actions. In addition to civil actions brought by attorneys general, other authorized state officials may also bring civil actions subject to the same requirements. Nothing in this subsection prohibits state officials from initiating proceedings for violations of state laws. A person may bring a private action in a state court if permitted by state laws. The court of a State can take action to enforce rules under section 2(a)(2), including injunctions and monetary damages for violations. If a defendant willfully or knowingly violates a rule, the court may increase the damages awarded up to three times the original amount. The Federal Trade Commission must conduct a biennial review and assessment of the regulations implemented under the Act within 2 years. This includes evaluating the effectiveness of the regulations, particularly in defining \"personal information,\" and assessing their impact on online commerce. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress."
