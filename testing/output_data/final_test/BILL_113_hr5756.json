The Congress acknowledges the severe restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms in the District of Columbia, leading to inadequate firearms skills for safety. The importance of safety education and training for using firearms for hunting and self-defense is highlighted, with recognition of the role of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act in facilitating such education. Richard A. Heller's efforts in advocating for Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia, culminating in the landmark Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, are commended. SEC. 3 of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to include the District of Columbia in apportionment. Section 8A is also amended to address cooperation and payment of funds.
