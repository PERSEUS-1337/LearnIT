    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine Aquaculture Enhancement Act of 1994\" establishes a Marine Aquaculture Research, Development, and Technology Transfer Program under the National Sea Grant College Program Act. The Marine Aquaculture Research, Development, and Technology Transfer Program aims to advance research, development, education, and technology transfer in marine aquaculture to boost the domestic industry's growth and competitiveness in the global market. The Marine Aquaculture Research, Development, and Technology Transfer Program focuses on developing competitive products, fundamental biological knowledge for aquaculture, environmentally safe technologies, aquaculture compatibility with other sea uses, marine biotechnology application, conflict resolution methods, and comparative state regulation studies. The Secretary maintains the capability to transfer technologies and information to the marine aquaculture industry, with emphasis on specific matters. The Director coordinates activities of sea grant colleges, consults with stakeholders to identify priorities, and ensures high-quality research and education in the Program. The Director awards grants and contracts for aquaculture education, technology transfer, and advisory projects based on scientific and educational merits, aiming to grow the marine aquaculture industry. The Director awards grants and contracts for the commercialization of the marine aquaculture industry. Applications for grants and contracts have special requirements and are evaluated by sea grant college directors before being forwarded to the Director for further evaluation. Funding for these grants and contracts comes from appropriations made pursuant to the authorization provided under section 212(c). The Director, in consultation with sea grant college directors and representatives of the marine aquaculture industry, establishes advisory committees and review panels to carry out the marine aquaculture program. At least 25% of the members of these committees are appointed from the marine aquaculture industry. The Director establishes advisory committees and review panels for the marine aquaculture program. Marine aquaculture is defined as aquaculture conducted in controlled or tidal environments. Authorization of appropriations is provided for grants and contracts. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the administration of the marine aquaculture program. $7,000,000 is authorized for each of fiscal years 1997 and 1998. SEC. 3 amends the Coastal Zone Management Act to regulate aquaculture facilities in the coastal zone. SEC. 4 addresses offshore marine aquaculture permitting. SEC. 4 addresses the ownership, construction, and operation of offshore marine aquaculture facilities, requiring permits issued by the Secretary for a 10-year term and compliance with relevant laws. The Secretary may issue permits for offshore marine aquaculture facilities if they comply with relevant laws, are in the national interest, and meet environmental standards. The site must not interfere with previously permitted facilities, and the permit is valid for a 10-year term. The Secretary must publish notices in the Federal Register for each application and permit issued under the offshore marine aquaculture facility regulations. A 90-day public comment period is provided for each application received. The person applying for a permit must agree to dispose of the facility as directed by the Secretary and provide a bond to cover removal costs. The Secretary must publish notices in the Federal Register for each application and permit issued under the offshore marine aquaculture facility regulations. A 90-day public comment period is provided for each application received. The Secretary forwards copies of applications to relevant agencies for review and comment. The Secretary forwards copies of permit applications to relevant agencies for review and comment, including the Secretary of Defense and Governors of affected states with approved coastal zone management programs. Within 120 days, the official must certify compliance with laws for activities proposed under the permit. The official must certify compliance with laws for activities proposed under the permit. If noncompliance is found, the official must provide reasons and permit conditions for compliance, which the Secretary will establish in the permit. An extension of up to 60 days may be granted for certification upon request with good cause shown. The Secretary may grant an extension for good cause shown. Permit revocation may occur if the permittee violates any terms, regulations, or this section. A permitee can surrender a permit at any time. Permits can be renewed or transferred following specific procedures. Permit fees are assessed to cover program administration costs. The Secretary may assess a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for permit violations. Regulations will be promulgated to establish minimum environmental standards for offshore marine aquaculture facilities, aiming to prevent escape of marine organisms and protect wild stocks. The standards for offshore marine aquaculture facilities include safeguards for wild stocks, disease prevention, and environmental protection. These standards are part of permit terms and apply to facilities located beyond State jurisdiction in US waters. The United States has an economic zone for marine and estuarine organism activities. The Secretary of Commerce oversees this zone, and a person involved must be a US citizen. SEC. 5. THE NANTUCKET PROGRAM. The Nantucket Program establishes a marine aquaculture development program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Program aims to create job opportunities in marine aquaculture, transplant, and relay operations through grants provided to eligible coastal communities for training and support activities. The Secretary will determine eligibility criteria for coastal communities to receive grants for marine aquaculture development. $2,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 1995-1997 for these grants. The Secretary of Commerce may establish a Multispecies Aquaculture Center in southern New Jersey to promote the aquaculture industry through technology transfer, research commercialization, and extension services. $4,500,000 is authorized for the Center's establishment and operation for fiscal years 1995-1997."
