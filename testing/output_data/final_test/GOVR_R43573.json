    "content": "Government-wide and agency-specific goals for the percentage of contract and/or subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses have been part of federal procurement since 1978. Agency heads, in consultation with the SBA, set agency-specific goals, while the President sets government-wide goals. Currently, the goals include 23% of federal contract dollars awarded to small businesses, 5% to women-owned small businesses, and 5% to small businesses owned and controlled by. The Small Business Goaling Program, established in 1978 and amended in 1988, sets government-wide and agency-specific goals for contract awards to small businesses. Goals include 5% for women-owned businesses, 5% for socially disadvantaged businesses, 3% for HUBZone businesses, and 3% for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. The executive branch has discretion in calculating contract awards and meeting these goals, prompting changes by the 111th and 112th Congresses. The 112th Congress made amendments to the Small Business Goaling Program to improve performance in achieving small business goals. This included reviewing \"Goaling Guidelines,\" establishing agency-specific contracting goals, directing agencies to take steps to meet goals, and increasing reporting on program performance. An independent assessment of the goaling program was also mandated. The 113th Congress built on the amendments made by the 112th Congress to the Small Business Goaling Program. They required training for Senior Executive Service members on contracting requirements, set government-wide and agency-specific goals for contracting with small businesses, and amended Section 15(h) to include a remediation plan for agencies failing to meet goals. The 113th Congress amended Section 15(g) to allow the Department of Energy to count first-tier subcontracts towards prime contract goals. This change reflects the unique nature of DOE purchases, which often involve contracts for managing national laboratories. DOE had lower prime contract goals in the past, potentially failing to comply with requirements to expand small business participation annually. The Department of Energy can count first-tier subcontracts towards prime contract goals, potentially impacting small business participation. There are arguments for and against this practice, with concerns about subcontractor protections and incentives for contracting with small businesses. Legislation was introduced in the 113th Congress to increase government-wide contract goals. The government was considering increasing contract goals for small businesses, including prime contract dollars awarded to small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses to better reflect the current marketplace. The government is considering increasing contract goals for small businesses, including prime contract dollars awarded to small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses in today's marketplace. Measures introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to prevent \"double dipping\" in counting contracts toward multiple goals. The 113th Congress introduced measures to prevent agencies from counting a small business in more than two categories when determining contract goals. Other bills aimed to clarify how specific contracts are counted and mandate reporting on agencies' performance in contracting with small businesses. Some measures also sought to repeal provisions allowing DOE to count certain subcontracts towards prime contracting goals. The 1978 amendments to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act require agencies to include subcontracting clauses in contracts exceeding $150,000, ensuring small businesses have opportunities to participate in federal contracts. Prime contractors must adhere to this policy while efficiently performing the contract. The Small Business Act requires agencies to include subcontracting clauses in contracts exceeding $150,000 to provide opportunities for small businesses. Larger contracts must also include subcontracting plans with percentage goals for subcontracting to small businesses and assurances of fair competition. Recent Congresses have made amendments to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act to address concerns about agencies' performance in meeting goals for contracting and subcontracting with small businesses. Amendments include requiring prime contractors to make \"good faith efforts\" to use small businesses in their bids and proposals, and provide explanations if they do not. The 112th Congress imposed additional requirements on prime contractors regarding subcontracting plans and performance evaluation. It also provided protections for subcontractors by requiring notification before identifying them in bids and proposals. The 113th Congress expanded requirements for prime contractors and subcontractors regarding subcontracting plans, including reviewing and approving subcontractors' plans, monitoring compliance, submitting reports, comparing performance to goals, and discussing performance as necessary to ensure compliance. Subcontracting plans must contain a recitation of certain obligations. The 113th Congress expanded subcontracting plan requirements for prime contractors, including maintaining records to demonstrate compliance with subcontracting plans. Legislation aimed to increase subcontracting with small businesses by setting goals at \"not less than 40 percent.\" The 113th Congress introduced bills to enhance subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses, including requiring collaboration between the SBA and contracting agencies for additional consideration. Another bill aimed to establish standards for considering contractors' past performance in subcontracting plans during source-selection determinations. The 113th Congress introduced bills to improve subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses, emphasizing collaboration between the SBA and contracting agencies. Congress has enacted limitations on bundling and consolidation of requirements by federal agencies to prevent difficulties for small businesses in performing contracts. The 113th Congress introduced bills to improve subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses, emphasizing collaboration between the SBA and contracting agencies. Congress has enacted limitations on bundling and consolidation of requirements by federal agencies to prevent difficulties for small businesses in performing contracts. Agencies are required to ensure that any bundling is \"necessary and justified,\" with specific steps to be taken before executing any acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements valued over a certain threshold. The 113th Congress enacted limitations on bundling and consolidation of federal agency contracts to support small businesses. The 112th Congress repealed consolidation-related provisions and extended requirements to defense agencies. The 111th Congress mandated a government-wide policy on bundling, justification for bundled contracts, and performance reports on agency officials. The 113th Congress further amended the Small Business Act to ensure bundling is \"necessary and justified.\" The 113th Congress enacted limitations on bundling and consolidation of federal agency contracts to support small businesses. Currently, agencies are required to identify bundled and consolidated contracts in FPDS-NG, and Chief Acquisition Officers must annually certify the accuracy and completeness of records. Measures introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to further limit bundling or consolidation of contracts or address bundling and consolidation within the context of strategic sourcing specifically. The 113th Congress enacted limitations on bundling and consolidation of federal agency contracts to support small businesses. Measures introduced aimed to further limit bundling or consolidation of contracts, including addressing bundling and consolidation within the context of strategic sourcing specifically. The General Services Administration (GSA) promotes government-wide strategic sourcing to save money. Small businesses are concerned that strategic sourcing may limit their opportunities for federal contracts. Measures in the 113th Congress aimed to address these concerns by requiring guidance on strategic sourcing that reflects the Small Business Act. The 113th Congress aimed to address concerns of small businesses regarding strategic sourcing in federal contracting. Measures included reflecting the Small Business Act requirements, promoting competition for lower prices, transparency, and accountability, and ensuring fair opportunities for small businesses in contracting. Congress has enacted statutes to ensure small businesses receive a fair share of federal procurement dollars, allowing agencies to use set-aside or sole-source contracts under certain conditions, such as the \"Rule of Two\" requiring bids from at least two small businesses. The Department of Veterans Affairs also has separate authority for set-asides. The Small Business Act provides statutory authority for set-aside and sole-source awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and other veteran-owned small businesses. Legislation for set-aside programs for different types of small businesses is typically enacted separately, with occasional measures affecting all small businesses grouped under \"General.\" Congress has enacted laws to ensure fair procurement opportunities for small businesses, including the \"Rule of Two\" requiring bids from at least two small businesses. The Department of Veterans Affairs also has separate authority for set-asides. Congress has enacted legislation to allow agencies to set aside multiple-award contracts for small businesses, providing them with fair opportunities for orders valued over $3,000. Prior to this, there was no explicit statutory authority for such set-asides, leading to concerns that federal law may have effectively barred them. The 111th Congress enacted legislation allowing set-asides of orders under multiple-award contracts, overriding fair opportunity requirements. This legislation also includes provisions for set-asides and reservations of parts of contracts, including Federal Supply Schedules contracts. Members of the 113th Congress introduced measures affecting small businesses' ability to obtain set-aside contracts, such as allowing \"timely offers\" from Federal Prison Industries. The proposed legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to prevent Federal Prison Industries from being considered for contracts set aside for small businesses under Section 15(a) of the Small Business Act. This would overturn a GAO decision and ensure that small business set-asides cannot be awarded to FPI. The 113th Congress proposed legislation to prevent Federal Prison Industries from receiving contracts set aside for small businesses under the Small Business Act. This would exempt contracts awarded under the Small Business Act from restrictions imposed by the proposed legislation. The Small Business Act allows agencies to award contracts on a set-aside or sole-source basis to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals participating in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The Small Business Administration (SBA) established \"net worth\" standards in 1989 for determining economic disadvantage in the 8(a) Program. Participation is limited to a single term of nine years for firms and individuals, with certain owner-groups like Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) having different terms. Despite proposed amendments in the 113th Congress, no significant changes have been made to Section 8(a) recently. Proposed amendments to Section 8(a) aimed to increase the SBA's \"net worth\" standard to $1.5 million, allow firms to participate for more than nine years under certain conditions, and address concerns about low thresholds and decreased contract awards to individual 8(a) firms. Another proposed change would streamline the process for economically disadvantaged NHOs applying to the program. The SBA has regulations that allow Indian tribes to demonstrate economic disadvantage only once for firms applying to the 8(a) Program. However, for NHO-owned firms, individual NHO members must meet specific economic disadvantage thresholds for initial and continued eligibility. The proposed legislation aimed to streamline 8(a) eligibility for NHOs by requiring economic disadvantage to be established only once. Another measure in the 113th Congress suggested allowing 8(a) firms to self-certify their eligibility for federal contracting preferences. Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act authorizes set-asides for women-owned small businesses, with a focus on industries where they are underrepresented or economically disadvantaged. Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act authorizes set-asides for women-owned small businesses in industries where they are underrepresented. Implemented in 2011, it has undergone significant amendments, including the removal of caps on contract values. Initially, contracts below $3 million ($5 million for manufacturing) were eligible, but this was later adjusted to $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing). The 113th Congress removed caps on contract values for women-owned small businesses, allowing larger contracts to be set aside. They also authorized sole-source contracts up to $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing). Additionally, they accelerated the deadline for reporting on underrepresented industries and proposed certification for women-owned small businesses. The 113th Congress removed caps on contract values for women-owned small businesses, authorized sole-source contracts up to $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing), and proposed certification for women-owned small businesses. Currently, only certain entities certify women-owned small businesses, and firms may also self-certify. Section 31 of the Small Business Act allows agencies to set aside contracts for HUBZone small businesses, make sole-source awards, and grant price evaluation adjustments. Eligibility criteria include having a principal office in a HUBZone and at least 35% of employees residing in a HUBZone. The HUBZone program, defined by Section 31 of the Small Business Act, includes areas with income levels below 80 percent of the nonmetropolitan State median income. Redesignated areas can also qualify as HUBZones until certain conditions are met. Amendments to Section 31 have been made over the years in response to decennial census data, affecting the eligibility of firms as HUBZone small businesses. Legislation in the 112th and 113th Congress aimed to extend HUBZone status for closed military bases for up to five years. The definition of \"base closure areas\" was amended to include military installations closed under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. In the 113th Congress, legislation was introduced to expand the definition of base closure areas to include municipalities, counties, and census tracts with a population of not more than 50,000, along with contiguous tracts. Another bill aimed to include small businesses owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) in the HUBZone program, aligning them with other groups like ANCs, Indian tribes, and CDCs under federal procurement law. In 2003, Congress added Section 36 to the Small Business Act, allowing agencies to set aside contracts for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and make sole-source awards of contracts up to $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts). In 2006, additional legislation was enacted for set-asides and sole-source awards by the Department of Veterans Affairs to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and other veteran-owned small businesses, separate from the Small Business Act. There is some overlap between the programs under these two acts. The Veterans Benefits Act and the Small Business Act have differences in eligibility verification for contracting preferences. The Veterans Benefits Act allows firms owned by surviving spouses of certain veterans to participate for up to 10 years. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to standardize eligibility requirements for the two programs. The proposed legislation aimed to standardize eligibility requirements for the Small Business Act and the Veterans Benefits Act by aligning definitions of service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and allowing certain surviving spouses of veterans to participate in the program for a period of time. The proposed legislation aimed to align the Small Business Act with the Veterans Benefits Act regarding eligibility requirements for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. It also included provisions for verifying eligibility and potentially transferring control of the VA's \"Veterans First\" contracting program to the SBA. The Small Business Act aligns with the Veterans Benefits Act for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, allowing other agencies to make set-aside and sole-source awards. Sole-source contracts under the Small Business Act are limited to $4 million, while the Veterans Benefits Act allows up to $5 million. The Small Business Act authorizes set-aside programs for various types of small businesses, including service-disabled veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses. Some have proposed additional set-aside programs for historically disadvantaged individuals. The Small Business Act authorizes set-aside programs for various types of small businesses, including service-disabled veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses. Proposed measures in the 113th Congress aimed to give preference to socially or economically disadvantaged groups, including creating a new category of \"emerging business enterprises\" for federal contract awards. The Small Business Investment Act was amended in 1970 to allow the SBA to guarantee bonds for small businesses unable to obtain bonding on reasonable terms. Initially limited to contracts valued at $500,000 or less, Congress has since increased the maximum contract value. The maximum contract value for SBA-guaranteed bonds has increased over the years, reaching $6.5 million in the 112th Congress. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to further increase the maximum guarantee percentage for surety's loss in case of contractor default. In the 113th Congress, legislation aimed to increase the maximum guarantee percentage for surety's loss in case of contractor default to 90%. The term reverse auction refers to a bidding procedure where sellers compete to offer supplies or services at the lowest price, which is permissible under FAR provisions. The use of reverse auctions by federal agencies has raised concerns about its impact on small businesses. The 113th Congress responded by requiring clarification of Department of Defense regulations to ensure compliance with existing rules, including allowing offerors to submit revised bids during the auction. Reverse auctions in federal agencies are restricted from performing inherently governmental functions and disclosing past performance or financial responsibility information. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to address concerns about inappropriate use of reverse auctions, especially for contracts suitable for small businesses. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to restrict the use of reverse auctions for contracts involving small businesses, design, construction services, and supplies where technical qualifications are a key factor in the award. The VA faces limitations in using reverse auctions for contracts awarded to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and other veteran-owned small businesses under the Veterans Benefits Act. Section 4105 of the Federal Acquisition Reform Act requires agencies to use two-phase selection procedures for public building contracts, focusing on technical qualifications in the first phase and cost in the second phase. The first-phase solicitation must state the maximum number of offerors selected for consideration in the second phase, not exceeding five unless specified otherwise. Concerns have been raised about agencies selecting more than five offerors, imposing costs on firms, especially small businesses. Proposed measures aim to require contracting officers to justify selecting more than five firms in line with the two-phase selection process. The proposed legislation aims to require contracting officers to justify selecting more than five firms in line with the two-phase selection process for contracts exceeding $750,000. It would also mandate public notice for cases where more than five finalists are selected or two-phase selection procedures are not used. The proposed legislation aims to require contracting officers to justify selecting more than five firms in the two-phase selection process for contracts valued over $750,000, with a focus on benefiting small businesses. Federal law currently reserves acquisitions between the micro-purchase threshold and the simplified acquisition threshold for small businesses. The 111th Congress responded to reports of contracts not awarded to small businesses by requiring OMB to issue guidelines for government-wide commercial purchase cards. Despite this guidance, legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to increase small business opportunities in government purchases. The 111th Congress responded to reports of contracts not awarded to small businesses by requiring OMB to issue guidelines for government-wide commercial purchase cards. In the 113th Congress, legislation was introduced to require agencies to award contracts between $3,000 and $500,000 to small businesses, with additional authority for sole-source awards to women-owned small businesses. This expanded the scope beyond HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned, and 8(a) Program businesses. The Small Business Act requires entities to meet specific criteria to qualify as \"small businesses\" for set-aside contracts. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to amend the definition of small businesses to exclude publicly traded and foreign-owned firms. The proposed legislation aimed to exclude foreign-owned firms from being recognized as small businesses under the Small Business Act. It also included requirements for agencies and contractors to be aware of these changes, penalties for misrepresentation, and a process for resolving complaints about firm size or status. Fraudulent misrepresentation would result in a five-year debarment from government contracts. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act (VBHCITA) of 2006 imposes agency-specific requirements on the VA for small business contracting, giving preference to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Other agencies also have similar requirements for contracting with small businesses. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act (VBHCITA) of 2006 gives preference to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses in VA contracts. The Veterans First program under Section 502 has specific requirements for contracting with veteran-owned small businesses, including goals, set-asides, eligibility criteria, and sanctions for misrepresentation. The 111th Congress amended eligibility requirements by requiring verification in the VA's database, and the 112th Congress changed penalty provisions for actionable conduct. The 112th Congress amended penalty provisions for actionable conduct by requiring \"willful and intentional misrepresentations\" of status, leading to a five-year debarment from VA contracts. The 113th Congress proposed transferring responsibility for verifying firms and owners from the VA to the SBA under the Veterans First program. The 113th Congress proposed transferring responsibility for verifying firms and owners from the VA to the SBA under the Veterans First program. Additionally, legislation introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to expand participation in the program for surviving spouses of veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at less than 100% disabling. Legislation proposed in the 113th Congress aimed to expand participation in the Veterans First program for surviving spouses or dependents of armed services members killed in the line of duty. It also included measures to modify procedures for making awards under the program, such as giving priority to veteran-owned firms located within a 60-mile radius of a VA facility. The 113th Congress proposed changes to contracting preferences for small businesses, giving local small businesses priority over others in the same category. Another measure aimed to apply limitations on subcontracting to contracts awarded under VBHCITA. The Small Business Act grants the SBA's Administrator the discretion to impose limitations on contracts awarded to small businesses under other authority, but this has not been done to date. Other measures in the 113th Congress addressed contracting and subcontracting with small businesses by individual agencies, such as allowing the DOE to count first-tier subcontracts toward goals for prime contracts and extending the DOD subcontracting plan test program. The Small Business Act allows for certain measures to support small businesses in contracting, such as reporting subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses and allowing incumbent contractors to compete for Job Corps center contracts set aside for small businesses. DOD must include terms in larger contracts acknowledging that exceeding small business size standards may disqualify them. Certain DOD and USAID contracts are exempt from certain requirements when contracting with small businesses. The Small Business Act includes measures to support small businesses in contracting, such as reporting subcontract dollars awarded to them. One measure would repeal the provision allowing the DOE to count certain subcontracts towards contract goals."
