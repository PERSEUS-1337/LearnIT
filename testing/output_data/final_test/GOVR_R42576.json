    "content": "Federal incentives for renewable electricity projects come in the form of tax benefits like production tax credits (PTC) and investment tax credits (ITC). The PTC, introduced in 1992, applies to wind, biomass, geothermal, and other renewable projects. The PTC for new wind projects ended in 2013, but remains for other renewables until 2014. This policy provides a tax credit for each kilowatt-hour of electricity produced during the first 10 years of operation. The production tax credit (PTC) for wind projects is 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour and is adjusted for inflation annually. The wind industry has seen significant growth, with 48,611 megawatts of capacity in the US by March 2012. Wind power accounted for 4% of total US generation capacity and was the largest source of non-hydro renewable electricity in 2011. Manufacturing facilities were established to supply wind turbine components in response to market growth. In 2012, the U.S. wind manufacturing sector has the capacity to produce 13 GW of wind turbines annually, with approximately 470 facilities supporting 30,000 jobs. Arguments for extending the wind PTC include potential job loss, environmental benefits, and global leadership. Opponents argue for market-based approaches for all electricity generators. The wind Production Tax Credit (PTC) extension is debated, with proponents arguing for market competition for all electricity generators and opponents advocating for wind projects to stand on their own economic and environmental merits without federal incentives. The impact of the PTC expiration on the wind industry and market demand for wind power projects is examined, with record levels of U.S. wind installations expected in 2012. Accelerated wind projects are being planned to qualify for tax credit incentives. The pending expiration of the wind Production Tax Credit (PTC) at the end of 2012 has led to a surge in wind-related manufacturing and employment. Most manufacturing activities for 2012 wind projects likely occurred in 2011 or early 2012. Wind development in the second half of 2012 will focus on construction and installation. However, it is unlikely that 2012 wind development levels can be sustained in the long term, regardless of PTC availability, potentially leading to a market downturn in the following year. The wind Production Tax Credit (PTC) is set to expire, which could lead to a market downturn in the following year. The wind industry has experienced drops in capacity installations when the PTC expired in the past. Without an extension, wind capacity additions in 2013 may decrease significantly. While the PTC is a key factor in wind project development, other factors like state renewable portfolio standards, electricity demand growth, and natural gas prices also play a crucial role. The potential impact of a PTC extension on U.S. wind project installations and manufacturing is discussed, with forecast information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Estimates show varying levels of wind development under different PTC availability scenarios, with comparisons to existing U.S. wind turbine manufacturing capacity. The levels of wind development in 2013 and 2014 are expected to be much lower than in 2012, resulting in decreased investment, manufacturing, and employment activity. A short-term PTC extension may temporarily boost development activity, but it is unlikely to stimulate additional wind manufacturing facilities in the United States. Wind installations in 2013 and 2014 are projected to fall below existing U.S. manufacturing capacity, regardless of PTC extension scenarios. This indicates that U.S. wind manufacturing utilization levels will likely be insufficient to support the wind market. Manufacturing utilization levels may be insufficient to support the wind market in 2013 and beyond, leading to potential shutdowns of U.S. wind manufacturing facilities. Global wind turbine manufacturing sector also faces excess capacity, limiting export opportunities. Wind turbine price decreases are expected due to excess manufacturing capacity, improving cost and technology performance. Wind turbine price declines could make new wind projects more economically competitive. Advocates argue for a long-term extension of the PTC to provide stability and stimulate growth in the wind industry. The expiring nature of production tax credits has created market volatility, with installations ramping up before credits expire. The uncertainty surrounding the duration of the PTC could impact investment, research, and employment in the wind industry. Short-term PTC extensions lead to temporary boosts in manufacturing and development activities, but a long-term extension is advocated for stability and growth in the industry. Accelerated wind deployments may be necessary to comply with state renewable portfolio standards if a short-term extension is implemented. The PTC extension forecast shows annual installations reaching 4 GW in 2013, 5 GW in 2014, and ramping up to approximately 10 GW in 2015. RPS-related demand may decline in later years without further incentives. A stable long-term PTC incentive could provide manufacturers and developers with known levels of incentives. EIA forecasts suggest that an indefinite PTC extension could result in more total wind capacity installations compared to a reference case scenario. The long-term extension scenario for wind development in the United States shows modest annual installation levels peaking at around 4 GW, much lower than the existing 13 GW assembly capacity. Factors like the federal production tax credit, state-level renewable portfolio standards, electricity demand growth, and natural gas prices impact wind project competitiveness. These non-PTC factors play a critical role in influencing the U.S. wind sector. The U.S. wind industry is influenced by non-PTC factors such as state-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS). RPS policies in 29 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico require a percentage of electricity to come from renewable sources. Each state has a unique approach to implementing RPS, with California aiming for 33% renewable energy by 2020. State RPS policies are the main driver for renewable electricity demand. The U.S. wind industry is influenced by state-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS) which require a percentage of electricity to come from renewable sources. Analysis by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory shows that RPS policies have led to significant additions of non-hydro renewable electricity capacity, with wind power projects dominating. Compliance with RPS policies often involves submitting renewable energy certificates (RECs) to state agencies. RECs represent renewable electricity generated from qualified facilities, with one REC equaling one megawatt-hour. They can be obtained bundled or unbundled, providing an additional revenue source for wind projects. State RPS compliance suggests existing capacity is sufficient for the next few years, with future demand not likely to drive significant growth in the wind sector. LBNL estimates 4-5 GW of annual renewable capacity additions. LBNL estimates that 4-5 GW of annual renewable electricity capacity additions are needed between 2011 and 2025 to meet state RPS requirements. RPS policies may not be enough to support annual wind industry growth, and electricity demand growth plays a crucial role in creating opportunities for renewable electricity projects. The larger the electricity base, the greater the amount of renewable electricity required to comply with state RPS policies. Long-term U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow modestly, while China's demand is forecasted to grow significantly. This difference in growth levels presents opportunities for new electric generation capacity in China. The Chinese electricity market offers more opportunities for renewable projects like wind power due to the need for additional installations to meet growing demand. Natural gas prices impact the competitiveness of wind power in the U.S., with lower prices reducing its economic viability and higher prices creating opportunities for wind to compete without subsidies. Wind power economics vary by location, and natural gas prices affect wind projects differently based on their operating region. In the United States, wind power operates differently based on the region and market type. There are competitive markets where power generators face price competition and cost-of-service markets where rates are regulated. Natural gas prices impact wind projects in various ways depending on the market characteristics. Natural gas prices can impact wind projects in competitive electricity markets managed by Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) or Independent System Operators (ISOs). RTOs organize bids from power generators based on variable costs to establish wholesale electricity rates. The RTO organizes bids from power generators to establish the clearing price for wholesale electric power. Generators supplying electricity at or below the clearing price are paid at that level. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) may bypass the clearing price mechanism for long-term revenue certainty. In certain electricity markets, transactions may occur outside of the RTO clearing price mechanism to meet PPA terms and conditions. During peak daytime hours, natural gas power generation influences the wholesale electricity clearing price, which is also impacted by total electricity demand. Wind projects without a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) rely on the clearing price for revenue, but can also sell Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to comply with state policies. Higher natural gas prices can increase revenues for wind projects, making them attractive investments. Wind projects in RTO-coordinated markets can mitigate wholesale market price risk by entering into long term PPAs with utility companies. Utilities may enter into PPAs to comply with state RPS policies or hedge against rising natural gas and wholesale electricity prices. The California RPS policy includes an alternative compliance payment (ACP) element where utilities can make payments to an ACP fund instead of generating or purchasing renewable electricity. Natural gas prices can impact the decision to enter into PPAs with renewable generators. California's RPS policy includes a cost containment element linked to natural gas prices, using Market Price Referent (MPR) as a benchmark for determining price premiums for renewable electricity. The California RPS policy includes a cost containment element linked to natural gas prices, using Market Price Referent (MPR) as a benchmark for determining price premiums for renewable electricity. If contract prices for renewable electricity exceed MPR levels, formal approval by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is required, along with above market funds (AMFs) to compensate for the additional cost. The 112th Congress may decide on the extension, modification, or termination of the PTC incentive for wind electricity. The 112th Congress may decide on the extension, modification, or termination of the PTC incentive for wind electricity. If the PTC expires, wind capacity additions could decline, impacting manufacturing and employment in the industry. Expiring the PTC may push manufacturers and developers to enhance turbine performance and reduce costs to compete without subsidies, potentially leading to a stronger but possibly smaller wind energy sector. The potential extension of the PTC incentive for wind electricity by Congress could lead to increased U.S. wind capacity installations, although at levels lower than those observed since 2009. Determining the duration of the extension is crucial for stimulating near-term wind market activity. The potential extension of the PTC incentive for wind electricity by Congress could lead to increased U.S. wind capacity installations. A one-year extension may have limited impact due to wind project development lead times. A permanent PTC may not stimulate near-term wind development activity, but could potentially stimulate wind electricity demand in a rising natural gas price market. Several bills in the 112th Congress aim to extend the availability of the PTC incentive for wind electricity projects. During the 112th Congress, discussions have focused on extending the PTC incentive for wind electricity projects. One proposal suggests a phased-out approach to gradually reduce the incentive over time, aiming to encourage industry efficiency and competitiveness. Designing a PTC phase-out policy may be challenging as it needs to consider various market factors like natural gas prices and electricity demand. The Family and Business Tax Cut Certainty Act of 2012 (S. 3521) extends production tax credits for wind facilities until January 1, 2014. A dynamic PTC phase-out design is proposed to adjust incentives annually based on market conditions like natural gas prices and technology improvements. The bill extends production tax credits for wind facilities until January 1, 2014, and allows projects starting construction by that date to qualify for incentives. This modification eases investment pressures and follows a precedent set by the Section 1603 cash grant program. The bill extends production tax credits for wind facilities until January 1, 2014, with no placed-in-service deadline, allowing flexibility in construction schedules. A placed-in-service deadline could stimulate manufacturing and construction activity for PTC incentives."
