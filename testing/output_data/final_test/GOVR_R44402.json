    "content": "Rwanda has achieved political stability, economic growth, and development gains despite a history of genocide. President Paul Kagame is credited with the country's progress, winning reelection by wide margins. The United States and Rwanda have close ties since the mid-1990s, supported by U.S. aid for Rwanda's development and peacekeeping efforts. U.S. officials promote the partnership but express concerns about Rwanda's political system and support for rebel groups. Congress has held hearings and imposed aid restrictions based on these issues. In late 2017, then Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Africa acknowledged democracy and human rights concerns in U.S.-Rwandan relations. Relations between the United States and Rwanda are described as \"close but complex,\" with acknowledgment of democracy shortcomings and human rights concerns. President Trump met with President Kagame in January 2018, expressing appreciation for economic ties, peacekeeping contributions, and Kagame's AU reforms. The Administration has proposed cuts to Rwanda's funding, including health and development aid, and suspended trade benefits under AGOA in response to alleged protectionist policies. International perspectives on Rwanda are polarized, with Kagame's supporters viewing him as a visionary leader. Critics of Kagame in Rwanda question restrictions on political and civil rights, expressing concerns that these limitations may hide underlying tensions. Some doubt the accuracy of Rwanda's development statistics and worry about the ruling party's heavy involvement in the economy stifling private sector growth. Kagame dismisses external criticism. President Kagame of Rwanda has been criticized for stifling independent private sector growth and suppressing political dissent. He has dismissed external criticism as inaccurate and neocolonialist, emphasizing the international community's failure to address the genocide. Kagame, the leader of the RPF, has been in power since 2000 and consistently wins elections with over 90% of the vote. The RPF-led government dominates parliament, with few opposition parties willing to directly criticize Kagame. The State Department has raised concerns about the conduct of elections in Rwanda. The State Department has noted concerns with elections conducted under RPF rule in Rwanda, citing procedural irregularities, lack of transparency in vote tabulation, media restrictions, and legal challenges targeting opposition candidates. Human rights advocates claim that state intimidation has weakened civil society and media outlets. Political opponents have faced imprisonment, exile, or suspicious deaths. Laws criminalizing genocide ideology and denial are used against government critics. Official surveillance is pervasive to ensure rapid implementation of state policies. Kagame's involvement in citizens' daily lives aims to ensure rapid development, mobilize support for the RPF, suppress criminal activity, and monitor potential threats. He defends Rwanda's political system as rooted in popular support and rejects allegations of human rights abuses. Restrictions on civil liberties are deemed necessary to prevent ethnic violence. A new constitution approved in 2015 exempted Kagame from a two-term limit, allowing him to run for a third term. After being exempted from a two-term limit by a new constitution in 2015, Kagame won with 99% of the vote for a third term. He could potentially remain in office until 2034 but has denied any intention to do so, claiming to be preparing Rwanda for a future leadership transition. Tolerance of opposition voices has slightly increased since his reelection in 2017, with two prominent opposition figures being released from jail in 2018. In 2017, Victoire Ingabire, who sought to run for president against Kagame in 2010, was acquitted with international advocacy. She received a presidential pardon along with members of her FDU-Inkingi party. The Democratic Green party, an independent opposition movement, won two seats in parliament in 2018. Presidential candidate Frank Habineza won less than 1% in the 2017 election. The RPF's political leadership has narrowed to a small circle around the president. Various RPF officials and military officers have faced criminal charges or fled the country. In 2010, RPF defectors formed the Rwandan National Congress. Some members have been targeted in armed attacks or assassinations in foreign countries. President Kagame denies state involvement in these incidents. The State Department's 2018 human rights report on Rwanda cites forced disappearances and alleged violations. The State Department's 2018 human rights report on Rwanda highlights forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, and torture by state security forces, with allegations of asphyxiation, electric shocks, and mock executions. It also mentions impunity among civilian officials and some security forces, political prisoners, threats to journalists, censorship, restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association, and government surveillance through various means. Human Rights Watch has reported arbitrary detention and torture of individuals linked to political movements in Rwanda. Rwanda has expelled international researchers from Human Rights Watch and detained a local employee in 2018. The government also closed thousands of churches and mosques, proposing stricter registration requirements for religious groups. Experts believe these actions targeted non-denominational places of worship. Rwanda is a top peacekeeping troop contributor in Africa, valued for its military professionalism and commitment to civilian protection. President Kagame, as chair of the AU in 2018, aimed to enhance financial sustainability of African-led stability operations. However, Rwanda has a history of unilateral military intervention in DRC and supporting rebel groups in DRC and Burundi, citing national security, ethnic solidarity, and economic motivations. In 2012-2013, Rwanda faced international criticism and donor aid cuts. Rwanda has faced international criticism and donor aid cuts for supporting insurgent groups in DRC and Burundi. Reports of Rwandan involvement in regional conflicts have decreased, but tensions with DRC, Burundi, and Uganda persist. Tensions between Rwanda and Uganda have escalated due to accusations of espionage and support for armed dissidents. Regional conflicts in eastern DRC, fueled by illicit resource extraction, continue to strain relations. Competition over access to DRC minerals is believed to be a key factor in the Rwanda-Uganda friction. Despite this, Rwanda's economic growth has been supported by donor aid, political stability, and pro-investor policies. Rwanda's economic growth is driven by political stability, low corruption, and pro-investor policies, with high growth rates of 4-9% annually. Despite being one of the world's poorest countries, Rwanda ranks relatively higher on the 2018 U.N. Human Development Index. The government aims to transform the economy into a services-oriented, middle-income one, focusing on sectors like tourism, coffee, tea, tin mining, and financial services. Additionally, Rwanda seeks to become a regional trade and logistics hub, investing in internet access, education, and domestic energy production. Rwanda aims to become a regional trade and conference hub, with investments in hotels, a convention center, a new airport, and RwandAir expansion. The country has received international recognition for its clean and safe streets and ranks high on the World Bank's Doing Business report. Despite improvements, challenges for foreign investors remain, as documented by the State Department. The State Department has documented challenges for foreign investors in Rwanda, including payment delays, inconsistent adherence to incentives, property rights infringements, and competition from state-owned businesses. Rwanda has seen significant human development gains since the genocide, with improvements in life expectancy, child mortality rate, and maternal mortality rate. The country provides near-universal health coverage through a donor-backed national insurance system. About 39% of Rwandans reportedly live below the poverty line as of 2015. As of 2015, about 39% of Rwandans lived below the poverty line, a significant improvement from 56% in 2006 and 78% in 1994. Some researchers question the reliability of Rwanda's poverty statistics, but the World Bank defends the official methodology. President Bill Clinton expressed remorse in 1998 for not intervening more forcefully during the 1994 genocide. U.S. support for the RPF-led government has been consistent across administrations. Over the past decade, Rwanda has received substantial aid for development and peacekeeping efforts, but there have been increasing criticisms of its involvement in regional conflicts and domestic human rights conditions. President Trump praised Rwanda's relationships with the United States and its achievements in bilateral trade. In congressional testimony, Rwanda was commended for its gains in health and development, as well as its contributions to regional peace and security. The State Department expressed concerns about Rwanda's human rights and democracy record, urging a democratic transition of power. They criticized irregularities in the 2017 presidential election and questioned its fairness. The U.S. Ambassador-designate to Rwanda outlined policy goals including development partnership, economic ties, peacekeeping support, and promotion of democratic ideals. President Trump suspended duty-free treatment of Rwandan apparel exports to the United States under AGOA in 2018, citing protectionist policies. Concerns were also raised about harassment of political opposition leaders, restrictions on media freedom, and trade barriers. The impact of the suspension may be largely symbolic as U.S. imports from Rwanda totaled $44 million in 2017, with $5 million under AGOA. U.S. exports to Rwanda totaled $64 million that year. U.S. bilateral aid to Rwanda focuses on promoting economic growth, food security, health, and military professionalism. The State Department has provided military aid to build Rwanda's peacekeeping capabilities under the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership (APRRP) initiative. The United States also offers humanitarian assistance for refugees in Rwanda. Congress has enacted measures restricting certain types of U.S. military aid to Rwanda if it supports rebel movements in neighboring countries. The Obama Administration suspended military aid to Rwanda for supporting rebel movements in neighboring countries, citing the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008. Aid for peacekeeping capabilities was exempted through legislative provisions and executive waivers. The interplay between the executive and legislative branches under the Obama and Trump Administrations is detailed. The Obama Administration suspended military aid to Rwanda for supporting rebel movements in neighboring countries, citing the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008. Aid for peacekeeping capabilities was exempted through legislative provisions and executive waivers. The FY2012 appropriations act suspended FMF for Rwanda due to its support for the M23 rebellion in DRC, extended into FY2013. In FY2014, FMF was continued to be suspended unless Rwanda ceased support to armed groups in DRC. In FY2015, FMF for Rwanda was prohibited unless certified by the Secretary of State. In FY2016, the Obama Administration did not designate Rwanda under CSPA, and there were no restrictions on security assistance for Rwanda. FMF funds were not requested or provided, but IMET assistance continued. In FY2017, Rwanda was designated under CSPA for supporting Burundian rebel groups in recruiting child soldiers, leading to restrictions on IMET which were later waived by President Obama. President Obama waived CSPA restrictions on IMET and other security aid for Rwanda, but no FMF funding was requested or provided. The appropriations act restricted certain IMET programs for countries in Africa's Great Lakes region unless certified by the Secretary of State. State Department provided some IMET funds for Rwanda, but activities prohibited by the act were not supported. Appropriations measures in FY2018-FY2019 continued to restrict IMET programs for the Great Lakes region until the Secretary of State reports no participation in destabilizing activities in neighboring countries. The Trump Administration has not designated Rwanda under CSPA or provided FMF for Rwanda. Congress shapes U.S. policy and assistance to Rwanda through authorization and appropriation of U.S. assistance. Legislative restrictions on U.S. security assistance have influenced Rwandan support for armed groups in neighboring countries. Members may consider lessons from past events when deciding on future legislative proposals regarding U.S. aid to Rwanda. Questions remain on how the United States can best support Rwanda's stability and growth, including whether continued U.S. aid should be tied to political pluralism and individual liberties."
