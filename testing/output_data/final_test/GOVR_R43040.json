    "content": "Under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), certain categories of persons are prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition, including those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, fugitives from justice, unlawful drug users, mentally defective individuals, illegal aliens, dishonorably discharged military personnel, individuals who renounced US citizenship, those under court orders, and individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits certain categories of persons from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, fugitives from justice, unlawful drug users, mentally defective individuals, illegal aliens, dishonorably discharged military personnel, individuals who renounced US citizenship, those under court orders, and individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. One specific category related to mental health issues involves individuals adjudicated as a mental defective, defined as those deemed a danger to themselves or others, or lacking the capacity to manage their own affairs. The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits certain persons from possessing firearms, including those adjudicated as mentally defective. A diagnosis or treatment of mental illness alone does not qualify someone as \"adjudicated as a mental defective.\" This determination must be made by a court or other lawful authority. Physicians and health care providers are generally not authorized decision-makers under the Gun Control Act of 1968, except in certain instances under state law for involuntary psychiatric treatment. The definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" may include individuals with fiduciaries managing monetary benefits, subject to interpretation. The definition of agency in relation to individuals with fiduciaries managing monetary benefits varies between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). VA policy requires individuals lacking mental capacity to manage their financial affairs to be assigned a fiduciary and reported to NICS, while SSA does not have a comparable policy for representative payees. The National Council on Disability (NCD) has urged the Vice President regarding this issue. The National Council on Disability (NCD) urges the Vice President to avoid linking the Social Security Administration's database of representative payees with the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) due to concerns about inaccurate and discriminatory implications. NCD recommends ensuring that the selection of a representative payee does not impact other rights beyond financial decision-making. The term \"committed to a mental institution\" is defined through regulation as a formal commitment involuntarily. The term \"committed to a mental institution\" includes involuntary commitment for mental defectiveness, mental illness, or other reasons like drug use. It does not cover voluntary admissions or individuals seeking treatment voluntarily. The definition may apply only to inpatient settings, but there are proposals to include outpatient commitments. Outpatient commitments may be authorized by state law for involuntary psychiatric treatment in emergency situations. In United States v. Waters, the court ruled that involuntary hospitalization under state law qualifies as an \"involuntary commitment\" for the Gun Control Act. In United States v. Rehlander, the court considered Maine's law allowing brief involuntary detention of mentally ill individuals. The court found that due to lack of procedural safeguards, this emergency hospitalization may not qualify as \"involuntary commitment\" under the Gun Control Act. The court overturned its decision on emergency hospitalizations not qualifying as \"involuntary commitments\" under the Gun Control Act due to lack of procedural safeguards. The DOJ proposed a rule to amend definitions related to mental health adjudications. The proposed rule aims to clarify that the term \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" applies to all courts determining mental responsibility in criminal cases, excluding those who have received relief from disability under federal or state programs. The proposed rule clarifies that \"committed to a mental institution\" includes involuntary commitments for mental defectiveness or illness by a court, board, or other authority, but not voluntary admissions or observations. The proposed rule clarifies that \"committed to a mental institution\" includes involuntary commitments for mental defectiveness or illness by a court, board, or other authority, but not voluntary admissions or observations. The term also excludes persons undergoing voluntary outpatient treatment. Temporary admission for observation would not be included unless it turns into a qualifying commitment as a result of formal commitment by a court or other lawful authority. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is seeking feedback on whether to include commitments or adjudications that occurred when the person was under 18 in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) established under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. NICS facilitates background checks on individuals acquiring firearms from licensed dealers. The FBI uses databases like NCIC, III, and NICS to check if individuals are eligible to receive firearms. The NICS Index contains disqualifying records not found in NCIC or III. The Brady Act allows the Attorney General to request information on individuals prohibited from receiving firearms from federal agencies. Federal agencies are not mandated to disclose these records but must provide them upon request. States are not required to submit records to the system. The Brady Act provided grants to states to improve record systems for sharing information required by the Attorney General. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act incentivizes states to submit records of individuals prohibited from possessing firearms, with a focus on those adjudicated as mentally defective or convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. The NIAA clarifies standards for adjudication and commitments related to mental health for federal agencies. It prohibits the sharing of records if certain conditions are met and requires agencies to establish a program for relief from disabilities imposed under federal law. President Obama issued a memorandum in January 2013 directing federal agencies to comply with these requirements. President Obama's 2013 memorandum directed federal agencies to provide relevant records to NICS, including criminal histories and mental health information. Over 1.2 million additional records have been made available to NICS since then. States can receive a waiver from the matching requirement in the National Criminal History Improvements Grant program if they provide at least 90% of relevant records for determining firearm possession disqualifications. Other requirements for the waiver include updating NICS on record modifications or removals. The NIAA provides updates to NICS for record modifications or removals, detailed information on those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or adjudicated as mentally defective. It allows the Attorney General to award grants for upgrading firearms disability determination technologies through the NARIP program. Non-compliance results in penalties, including reductions in Byrne Justice Assistance Grant funds. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on states' progress in reporting mental health records to the NICS databases, showing a significant increase in records from 2004 to 2011. This increase was mainly driven by 12 states, with almost half of all states increasing the number of mental health records provided. According to GAO, almost half of all states increased the number of mental health records they reported by fewer than 100 over the same time period. DOJ and state officials cited technological, coordination, and legal challenges as limiting factors in reporting mental health records. States used NARIP grant funding to automate record collection and transmission. DOJ emphasized the difficulty in capturing mental health records from various sources within the state. The challenges in reporting mental health records for background checks involve coordination issues between entities outside law enforcement, leading to a lack of collaboration in making records available to the FBI. For example, in Illinois, only a small fraction of mental health records were reported to NICS due to coordination challenges and privacy concerns. Officials in several states cited privacy concerns and the lack of statutory authority as obstacles to sharing mental health records for NICS reporting. A report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that states face various challenges in reporting mental health records, including technological issues, privacy concerns, funding shortages, and lack of leadership. States with improved reporting programs share common attributes, but there is still significant variation in the number and type of records submitted to NICS. The Mayors Against Illegal Guns (MAIG) report highlighted the importance of funding, political leadership, and state laws in improving reporting of mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Privacy laws and HIPAA regulations were identified as potential obstacles to NICS reporting in some states. The HIPAA Privacy Rule sets federal standards to protect personal health information, including individual privacy rights and limitations on disclosure. It applies to health plans, clearinghouses, and providers transmitting health information electronically. Covered entities must safeguard protected health information (PHI) related to an individual's physical or mental health. The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits the unauthorized use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) related to an individual's health care or payment. Covered entities can only disclose PHI in specific circumstances, such as patient access rights and investigations by HHS officials. The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows covered entities to use or disclose PHI for treatment, payment, and routine health care operations with few restrictions. Individuals have the right to object to certain disclosures, and there are specific \"national priority purposes\" where PHI can be used or disclosed, such as when required by law. Covered entities may disclose PHI for law enforcement purposes, to avert serious threats to health or safety, and for specialized government functions. Written authorization is required for all other uses or disclosures of PHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits health care providers from disclosing mental health records for NICS reporting without patient authorization. State laws may also impact the scope of the Privacy Rule in this regard. The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits health care providers from disclosing mental health records for NICS reporting without patient authorization. State laws may impact the Privacy Rule, especially in cases where disclosure is not required by the state. HHS has proposed amendments to allow disclosure to NICS in states with permissive laws. Both courts and health care providers may also be subject to state health privacy laws that could be more protective than HIPAA. State laws that are more protective of privacy include those that prohibit or restrict a use or disclosure that would otherwise be permitted under the Privacy Rule, and those that provide individuals with greater access to their own health information. This final section of the report provides a basic overview of the different types of state privacy laws that may impact the sharing of prohibiting mental health records with NICS. Twenty-three states have NICS reporting mandates, requiring courts and mental health facilities to report directly to NICS or through a state agency. In states with NICS reporting mandates, courts and mental health facilities are required to report directly to NICS or through a state agency. However, in states where reporting is authorized but not mandatory, HIPAA-covered entities may not have permission to disclose PHI for the purpose of reporting mental health records to NICS. The Privacy Rule does not specifically address reporting to federal databases for background checks. The Privacy Rule does not authorize the disclosure of PHI for reporting to NICS databases for background checks. PHI can only be disclosed for law enforcement purposes as required by law or in response to specified judicial and administrative processes. The rule focuses on disclosing PHI to prevent serious threats to health or safety, but NICS reporting is not included in these provisions. California has one of the best NICS reporting rates for mental health records due to a state law requiring mental health facilities to report to the California Department of Justice. This requirement bypasses HIPAA restrictions on reporting mental health records to federal databases. California has a reporting infrastructure for mental health records to NICS, bypassing HIPAA restrictions. 13 states lack laws for reporting mental health records for firearm background checks. Some states are \"Point-Of-Contact\" (POC) states for firearm background checks, running checks against their own records which may not be in NICS. POC states may have more stringent checks due to access to disqualifying records and stricter state prohibitions on firearm possession. However, state-level checks do not capture prohibited individuals purchasing long guns across state lines. HHS's OCR proposed a rule to modify the HIPAA Privacy Rule, allowing certain covered entities to disclose limited demographic information to NICS for reporting purposes. This change aims to clarify the Privacy Rule and facilitate the reporting of individuals disqualified from owning firearms due to mental health issues. The proposed rule aims to simplify reporting individuals disqualified from owning firearms due to mental health issues to NICS without affecting existing uses of PHI under the Privacy Rule. Covered entities can only report individuals prohibited under federal mental health laws, not other disqualifying factors. States may have additional mental health prohibitions related to firearms not reported to NICS. HHS seeks feedback on whether HIPAA is a barrier to reporting state law firearm prohibitions to NICS and if the final rule should address this. The new provision primarily covers HIPAA entities involved in commitment, adjudication, or repository functions, not treatment. HHS also seeks public comment on whether there are other entities responsible for reporting to NICS in certain states. The proposed amendments to the HIPAA Privacy Rule seek feedback on reporting state law firearm prohibitions to NICS and potential barriers. It also addresses entities responsible for NICS reporting and additional data elements that may be disclosed. If finalized, covered entities may gradually increase records shared with NICS, but states may still lack necessary infrastructure or support. States may still lack the infrastructure, capital, or political support to share records with NICS for federal background checks on firearm transfers. Questions have been raised about the efficacy of the background check system, particularly regarding the sharing of mental health records of individuals prohibited from owning firearms. The HIPAA Privacy Rule and state laws may pose obstacles to populating NICS with these records. Some state officials are concerned about the disclosure of information required by state law for NICS reporting. HHS proposed a rule to modify the HIPAA Privacy Rule to allow certain entities to disclose mental health disqualifications to NICS. States are unsure if HIPAA-covered entities can share records with NICS for individuals prohibited from firearm possession under state laws. The definition of \"committed to a mental institution\" remains unclear. The Department of Justice has proposed a rule to clarify that the term \"committed to a mental institution\" includes both mandatory inpatient and outpatient commitments. This clarification aims to address barriers under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and uncertainties in federal definitions, which have hindered states from sharing relevant mental health records with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). While these clarifications may enable states to provide more records to NICS, some states may still face challenges due to technological limitations."
