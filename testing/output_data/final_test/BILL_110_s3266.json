    "content": "The Act is titled as the \"Immediate Steps to Conserve Gasoline Act\" and it focuses on federal conservation of gasoline. Congress finds that Americans are altering family budgets to cope with rising gasoline prices by driving less frequently, changing daily routines, and cancelling vacations. These conservation efforts bring hardships but save funds that can be redirected to essential family needs and relieve some demand for gasoline. Congress acknowledges the efforts of individuals in reducing gasoline consumption and calls for government initiatives to conserve gasoline, signaling recognition of the burdens imposed by high gasoline costs. A 3% reduction in federal gasoline consumption would demonstrate national efforts to conserve energy. In 2005 and 2007, policies were enacted to reduce energy usage in Federal buildings by 20% and 30% respectively. Congress and the President should extend these initiatives to reduce gasoline consumption by Federal departments and agencies by at least 3% annually. For fiscal year 2009, Congress must reduce gasoline consumption by at least 3% annually. SEC. 3. STUDIES AND REPORTS ON NATIONAL SPEED LIMIT AND FUTURE GASOLINE CONSERVATION. The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration will conduct a study on the potential fuel savings of implementing a national speed limit of 60 miles per hour on highways. The study will analyze the fuel efficiency of current automobiles and their optimal efficiency range on the Interstate System. During the 1973-1974 energy crisis, the Federal Government, with Congress' support, imposed a national speed limit of 55 miles per hour on highways. This measure saved 167,000 barrels of oil per day, showing potential for even greater savings today. The Comptroller General of the United States will determine if a national speed limit of 60 miles per hour on highways could generate gasoline savings, considering the improved fuel efficiency of cars today. This assessment will be submitted to the relevant committees within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The report will describe the results of a study to determine the feasibility of additional gasoline reduction measures by Federal departments and agencies and Congress, including a proposed schedule of future measures if deemed feasible."
