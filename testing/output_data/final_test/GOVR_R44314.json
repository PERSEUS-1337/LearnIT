    "content": "Social Security is a federally administered entitlement program financed by payroll taxes. It provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers, their family members, and the family members of deceased workers. Eligibility is based on work history. As of September 2015, there were nearly 60 million Social Security beneficiaries, including 43 million retired workers and their family members, 11 million disabled workers and their family members, and 6 million survivors of deceased workers. Workers need a minimum of 10 years of covered employment to qualify for a retired-worker benefit, while fewer years are needed for a disabled-worker benefit. To qualify for a disabled-worker benefit, a worker under age 62 needs a certain number of credits depending on their age when they become disabled. Disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 12 months. A worker can receive a retirement benefit as early as age 62, but starting before full retirement age results in a permanent benefit reduction. Before the full retirement age (FRA), a worker's benefit is permanently reduced for early retirement. The FRA varies from age 65 to 67 based on the worker's birth year. As of September 2015, retired workers made up 67% of beneficiaries, while disabled workers accounted for 15%. A worker's Social Security benefit is determined by their career-average earnings in covered employment, with the primary insurance amount (PIA) being the monthly benefit at FRA. The PIA is calculated by indexing annual earnings to wage growth, summing the highest 35 years of earnings, and dividing by 420 months. The Social Security benefit is calculated based on the worker's career-average earnings in covered employment. The total earnings are divided by 420 months to determine the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). A progressive benefit formula is then applied to the worker's AIME, with adjustments made for early or delayed retirement. As of September 2015, the average monthly Social Security benefit was $1,338 for retired workers and $1,165 for disabled workers. Benefits can be adjusted based on age, earnings, and eligibility as a family member. Spouses, children, and dependents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers may also qualify for benefits. The Social Security benefit payable to a young widow(er) caring for a deceased worker's child is based on the worker's record. If the person is entitled to benefits from their own work record and as an eligible family member, they receive the higher of the two benefit amounts under the dual entitlement rule. The Social Security Act defines terms for qualifying for benefits as an eligible family member of the worker. Dependents and survivors of retired, disabled, or deceased workers make up 18% of the beneficiary population. Benefits may be reduced if total benefits exceed the maximum family benefit. The Social Security Act references state law in determining entitlement to benefits as a family member of a retired, disabled, or deceased worker. SSA looks to the laws of the state where the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of application or death. \"Domiciled\" is interpreted as the true and fixed home of a person. The relationship requirement for spousal benefits under the Social Security Act is met if the applicant and the Number Holder were validly married under state law at the time of application or death. Alternatively, the requirement is met if the applicant would be able to inherit a spouse's share of the Number Holder's property under state intestate law. The Uniform Probate Code does not explicitly define \"spouse\" or \"marriage\" for intestate law purposes. The Uniform Probate Code does not define marriage for intestate law purposes, instead, state legislatures are directed to incorporate their own legal definition of marriage. If a valid marriage cannot be established under state law, benefits may still be available based on a deemed valid marriage under certain circumstances. Changes in Social Security eligibility for same-sex couples have been impacted by Supreme Court decisions like U.S. v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges. The Defense of Marriage Act previously limited spousal benefits to heterosexual couples, but state laws and court rulings have since influenced SSA's processing of claims for same-sex couples. The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Windsor on June 26, 2013, declared Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, allowing federal recognition of same-sex marriages. This decision led to changes in Social Security processing for same-sex couples, with the SSA now accepting applications for spousal benefits for legally married same-sex couples. Social Security benefits for same-sex couples depended on meeting the relationship requirement to the Number Holder as outlined in 216(h). Not all applicants in a same-sex marriage were eligible for benefits between the Windsor and Obergefell decisions. The Social Security Act's Section 216(h) looks to the state laws where the Number Holder is domiciled to determine family relationship for benefits. Valid marriage and domicile in a state recognizing same-sex marriage were necessary for SSA to recognize a same-sex couple as married during this period. Social Security benefits for same-sex couples depended on meeting the relationship requirement to the Number Holder as outlined in 216(h). Eligibility for spousal benefits was determined by the domicile state's recognition of the marriage or legal relationship at the time of application. The state laws where the Number Holder is domiciled played a crucial role in determining eligibility for benefits. SSA determined marital relationship eligibility based on the intestate laws of the Number Holder's domicile. If the state recognized inheritance rights for same-sex couples, the relationship was considered valid for Social Security benefits. If not, the marriage was not considered valid. The Supreme Court decision on June 26, 2015, struck down state same-sex marriage bans. The Supreme Court decision on June 26, 2015, in Obergefell v. Hodges struck down state same-sex marriage bans, granting same-sex couples the right to marry under the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision also made same-sex couples eligible for spousal Social Security benefits. The Social Security Administration is working on providing guidance for processing applications from same-sex couples following the Obergefell decision. States and U.S. territories have varying dates for permitting or recognizing same-sex marriage, which impacts eligibility for Social Security benefits. New information on implementing the Obergefell decision will be updated on the SSA website. The recent Supreme Court decisions United States v. Windsor (June 26, 2013) and Obergefell v. Hodges (June 26, 2015) impact Social Security eligibility for same-sex couples. Table A-1 outlines Social Security benefits for eligible family members based on a worker's record, with potential adjustments. Dual entitlement rule reduces auxiliary benefits if a person is entitled to benefits based on their own work record and another person's work record. The dual entitlement rule may reduce auxiliary benefits if a person is entitled to benefits based on their own work record and another person's work record, due to various reasons such as exceeding the maximum family benefit or receiving a pension from uncovered work."
