    "content": "The U.S. Constitution established the U.S. Supreme Court as the only federal court, with Congress authorized to create other inferior tribunals. Over the years, Congress has created numerous federal courts, including 13 circuit courts of appeals and over 90 district courts. Additionally, there are various non-Article III tribunals with different types of judges. The Constitution limits Congress's authority to create federal tribunals, leading to debate and divided Supreme Court decisions. This area of law is complex and often misunderstood, with various types of federal tribunals established by Congress for different legal disputes. The report discusses the rationale behind the creation of these courts and explores the factors and issues involved. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution vests the \"judicial power\" in one supreme Court and inferior Courts established by Congress. Congress has wide discretion to assign adjudication tasks to legislative tribunals under federal law. Federal courts differ in personnel, purposes, and powers, with Article III courts and non-Article III tribunals being the two central types. Article III Courts are defined by constitutional provisions, allowing them to resolve specific categories of cases and controversies. Judges on these courts serve during \"good behavior,\" with rules of justiciability imposed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court interprets the Good Behavior Clause as guaranteeing life tenure to Article III judges, only removable by impeachment. The Compensation Clause prohibits lowering a judge's pay directly or indirectly. These provisions are fundamental to the purpose of Article III courts in the American constitutional scheme, ensuring checks on power even within a democratic system. The Framers established a written Constitution to limit changes through ordinary political processes, with the federal judiciary serving as a \"counter-majoritarian branch\" to interpret and protect its principles. Insulating the judiciary from political pressures ensures the integrity and legitimacy of federal court decisions. The judiciary is insulated from political processes through the Good Behavior Clause and Compensation Clause of Article III, ensuring independence and preventing political influence. Concerns about unchecked power in the judiciary were also present among the founding generation. The power of judicial review allows unelected officials to interpret the Constitution against legislative acts, making the judiciary the \"least dangerous\" branch of government according to the Framers. The judiciary, envisioned as the \"least dangerous\" branch by the Framers, raises questions about when a court is subject to Article III restrictions. The 1962 case of Glidden v. Zdanok provides insight, highlighting the confusion and controversy surrounding this issue. The Glidden v. Zdanok case involved a dispute over whether the Court of Claims was an Article III court, with the Supreme Court ultimately ruling that it was, despite previous uncertainties. The Supreme Court ruled in Glidden v. Zdanok that the Court of Claims was an Article III court, with Justice Harlan arguing that the establishing legislation complied with constitutional provisions, such as life tenure for judges and protection of salaries. The Supreme Court ruled in Glidden v. Zdanok that the Court of Claims was an Article III court, with Justice Harlan emphasizing the importance of the enabling legislation in determining the court's status. Justice Clark and Chief Justice Warren concurred in the judgment but noted changes in the court's jurisdiction to align it more closely with an Article III court. The Glidden decision in the Court of Claims emphasized the court's status as an Article III court, leading to a shift in evaluating courts based on their structure rather than the subject matter of cases. The case highlighted that Congress cannot change a court's constitutional nature simply by labeling it, with a focus on adherence to Article III requirements in court structure. The touchstone of determining a court's constitutional nature is whether it was established under Article III of the Constitution. Lower courts have followed a functional approach post-Glidden to assess this. For instance, in United States v. Cavanagh, the Ninth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court based on judges' lifetime tenure, salary protections, and adjudication of \"case-or-controversy\" matters. The Cavanagh court upheld the constitutionality of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court based on judges' lifetime tenure, salary protections, and adjudication of \"case-or-controversy\" matters. The system of courts established under Article III consists of three layers of review, with cases brought in federal district courts and appeals heard in regional courts of appeal. Federal judges are generalists with limited knowledge of specialized fields. The Federal Circuit is a specialized Article III court that handles appeals from federal district courts and certain administrative bodies in various subject areas such as international trade, government contracts, patents, trademarks, and more. Unlike generalist federal judges, judges in specialized courts like the Federal Circuit have limited jurisdiction by subject matter rather than geographic area. The Federal Circuit is a specialized Article III court that handles appeals from federal district courts and certain administrative bodies in areas like international trade, government contracts, patents, and trademarks. Congress has established other specialized Article III courts, including the FISA Court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, and the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. These courts have specific roles and are staffed by federal judges from different courts. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, Alien Terrorist Removal Court, and Court of International Trade are specialized Article III courts with specific roles and judges appointed by the Chief Justice or President. Article III of the Constitution does not mandate lower federal courts. Congress has the authority to establish federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court, with strict limits on their deployment. Despite the limitations, Congress has chosen to create Article III courts to align with the Framers' intentions for insulated courts. The existence of independent federal courts, insulated from political pressures, helps ensure compliance with federal legal interests and protects against encroachments by federal political branches. Lower federal courts, established by the first Congress in 1789, play a crucial role in protecting federal interests and preventing chaos in the enforcement of federal law. The lower federal courts played a crucial role in enforcing desegregation after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling. Congress chooses Article III courts for adjudication due to the high quality judges attracted by constitutional protections like life tenure and salary safeguards. This helps promote public confidence in judicial decisions. The federal judiciary, particularly Article III courts, attract high-quality judges with prior judicial experience or strong academic credentials. This has been supported by a recent study showing that over half of active U.S. Circuit Court judges had prior judicial experience. Efforts to establish new Article III courts have highlighted the autonomy and power that life-tenured judges would possess. The court argues that life-tenured judges would have more autonomy, power, and prestige, attracting better judges. Article III of the Constitution mandates that judicial power be vested in the Supreme Court and inferior courts. Congress has assigned non-Article III bodies to adjudicate cases, despite the requirement for judges to be free from political pressure. Non-Article III courts, including specialized stand-alone courts, administrative agencies, and magistrate judges, lack Article III guarantees but have historical and legal justifications for their use. An analytical framework is provided for determining when non-Article III courts can be employed. These adjudicatory entities have been referred to as \"non-Article III courts,\" \"Article I courts,\" or \"Article I tribunals.\" Non-Article III courts, also known as \"Article I courts\" or \"legislative courts,\" have judges with term limits and lack constitutional salary protection. They are created under Congress's Article I power and have similar authority as Article III courts. Examples include the U.S. Tax Court and the Court of Federal Claims. Non-Article III courts, also known as \"Article I courts\" or \"legislative courts,\" include the U.S. Tax Court, the Court of Federal Claims, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and federal district courts in Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. These courts are considered adjuncts to Article III courts and are mainly comprised of federal administrative agencies and magistrate judges. Congress establishes legislative courts for various reasons, such as preserving the unique status of Article III courts and creating specialized courts like bankruptcy courts under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. In 1978, some Members of Congress opposed creating new specialized Article III courts, fearing it would diminish their prestige. Legislative courts offer an alternative for handling matters dealt with by administrative agencies and specialized tribunals. Specialized non-Article III tribunals focus on specific areas of law, with experts needed to adjudicate complex disputes. For example, the Tax Court's predecessor, the Board of Tax Appeals, was created in 1924 to handle tax-related disputes. Congress has established legislative courts within executive branch agencies for efficiency and cost savings, allowing specialized non-Article III tribunals to handle complex tax issues. These tribunals provide an expert and inexpensive method for resolving specific disputes, such as those related to the Commodity Exchange Act. Congress has established non-Article III tribunals, like the Court of Claims, to handle specific cases referred by Congress, known as \"congressional reference\" cases. These tribunals issue advisory reports to Congress, which can choose to ignore their recommendations. This allows for a more efficient resolution of disputes outside of the constitutional restrictions imposed on Article III courts. Congress has established non-Article III tribunals, like the Court of Claims, to handle congressional reference cases. These tribunals issue advisory reports to Congress, allowing for efficient dispute resolution outside of Article III court restrictions. Congress can exert control over these tribunals by establishing Article I tribunals with judges lacking life tenure and salary protections. Despite Article III requirements, historical and legal support exists for Congress's authority to create non-Article III tribunals to hear matters falling under Article III jurisdiction. Non-Article III tribunals have been entrenched in federal adjudications for over 200 years and are likely to remain. Congress has historically placed adjudicating authority in various non-Article III forums that could have been vested in Article III courts. The legitimacy of legislative courts is justified as an \"exception\" to Article III's jurisdiction. The legitimacy of legislative courts as exceptions to Article III's tenure and salary protection is supported by the need to accommodate Congress's plenary grants of power in specialized areas. Justice Brennan's opinion in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co. highlights three instances where Congress has created legislative courts: territorial courts, military courts, and courts adjudicating public rights. The creation of legislative courts is justified by historical, legal, and practical reasons, including the need to accommodate Congress's plenary grants of power in specialized areas. These courts are adjuncts to federal courts and are primarily justified by direct oversight from Article III courts. They do not necessarily rely on the \"exceptions\" rationale and serve a crucial role in adjudicating public rights cases. The use of non-Article III courts is justified in certain instances, such as territorial courts, military courts, cases involving \"public rights,\" and as adjuncts to federal courts. Litigant consent may also allow for the use of non-Article III courts. Article IV, \u00a73, cl. 2 grants Congress the power to establish courts in territories. The Supreme Court addressed territorial courts in the 1828 case Florida in American Insurance Co. v. Canter, where it ruled that these courts could hear cases under admiralty law despite judges not having life tenure. Chief Justice John Marshall explained that legislative courts in federal territories are created by Congress under its authority over territories, allowing for alternative judicial forums outside of Article III courts. This authority has been applied in modern examples like district courts in Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. In the District of Columbia, Congress has the authority to create courts under Article I of the Constitution for local matters. This includes the Superior Court and Court of Appeals, limited to hearing purely local cases. In the District of Columbia, Article I courts were created for local matters, limited to hearing purely local cases. In Palmore v. United States, the constitutionality of these courts was challenged, but the Court upheld their validity for specialized areas with particularized needs. Additionally, Article I courts are employed in the military context under Congress's authority to make rules for the land and naval forces. In the 1858 case Dynes v. Hoover, the Supreme Court upheld Congress's authority to create military courts for trying military and naval offenses. However, military courts cannot try civilians or spouses of military members, and their jurisdiction is limited to active-duty service members. Military courts can hear non-service related crimes while the defendant is still in service. Military courts, including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, can hear non-service related crimes while the defendant is in service. The CAAF judges serve 15-year terms and can be removed by the President for neglect of duty, misconduct, or disability. Article I courts also handle \"public rights\" cases involving disputes between private actors and the government. This concept originated from the ruling in Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co. by Justice Story. The public rights doctrine involves cases concerning claims or benefits against the government, which can be handled in Article I courts like the U.S. Tax Court. Tax Court judges serve 15-year terms and can be removed by the President for various reasons. The rationale for allowing public rights cases in Article I courts includes sovereign immunity and Congress's authority. The Supreme Court has broadly defined public rights cases as those involving claims against the government and can be handled in Article I courts. Private rights cases, on the other hand, involve liability between individuals under the law. The Supreme Court has struggled to define the exact parameters of the public rights doctrine, with Chief Justice Roberts noting inconsistencies. In the case of Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipeline Co., the Court addressed whether bankruptcy courts could adjudicate common law claims. Justice Brennan acknowledged the lack of clarity in distinguishing public and private rights in the Court's precedents. In Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipeline Co., Justice Brennan traced historical exceptions to Article III, rejecting public rights argument as case involved two private parties. In Thomas v. Union Carbide, Court shifted to functional approach for non-Article III forums. The arbitrator's decision was subject to judicial review for \"fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct.\" Justice O'Connor rejected the public/private rights dichotomy and emphasized that the nature of the right at issue should guide the inquiry. The Court found that the arbitration scheme, created by federal statute, was a pragmatic solution that did not threaten the independent role of Article III courts. The Court's decision in Thomas v. Union Carbide broke away from the strict public rights category and allowed private rights to be adjudicated in a non-Article III forum if closely integrated into a public regulatory scheme. In Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, the Court reaffirmed this approach, empowering the CFTC to hear common law counterclaims. However, in Stern v. Marshall, the Court shifted back towards the formalism of Northern Pipeline. In Stern v. Marshall, the Court addressed the issue of whether a bankruptcy court could adjudicate a common law claim for fraudulent interference with a gift. Chief Justice Roberts authored the 5-4 decision, ruling that Article III prohibited the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction as it did not fall under the public rights exception. The Court rejected the application of the public rights exception to the fraudulent interference counterclaim, stating that it was not a claim that could only be pursued by the other branches. The Court in Stern v. Marshall ruled that the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction over a common law claim for fraudulent interference with a gift was not permissible under Article III. The claim did not fall under the public rights exception and could not be exclusively determined by the executive or legislative branches. The Court rejected the bankruptcy court's exercise of jurisdiction over the counterclaim as a breach of Article III. Adjuncts, like magistrate judges, assist federal courts with heavy caseloads. The support for adjunct theory dates back to the 1932 case Crowell v. Benson, where the U.S. Employees' Compensation Commission handled claims under the Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. The employer appealed the commission's decision, questioning its jurisdiction. The Supreme Court upheld the use of adjuncts in relation to Article III courts, stating that adjuncts can make findings of fact and initial legal determinations, but questions of law must be reviewed by an Article III court. Questions of jurisdictional and constitutional fact require a more thorough review by a constitutional court to maintain the essential attributes of the judicial power. The Crowell framework established that adjuncts must act as subordinates to Article III courts. Federal agencies play a key role in policy-making, rule promulgation, and adjudication under federal law, especially in public rights cases involving government entitlements like those administered by the Social Security Administration. The judicial review of SSA decisions closely follows the Crowell model, with administrative law judges' factual findings subject to the \"substantial evidence\" standard. Legal determinations do not receive deference from the district court or court of appeals. Federal magistrate judges replaced the U.S. commissioner system in 1968 under the Federal Magistrates Act to modernize the first echelon of the Federal judiciary. The role of U.S. magistrate judges has evolved over the years to include deciding motions, hearing evidence, and trying cases in both criminal and civil matters. Despite their importance in the federal judicial process, there is some concern about vesting authority in officials without life tenure and salary protections. Magistrate judges are selected by district court judges and can be removed for cause or if their services are no longer needed. The Supreme Court's first encounter with the Magistrates Act was in Wingo v. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Magistrates Act in cases like Wingo v. Wedding and Mathews v. Weber clarified the authority of magistrate judges to hold evidentiary hearings and review administrative records in certain legal proceedings. The Supreme Court upheld the magistrate's \"preliminary-review function\" as an \"additional duty\" permitted under the Magistrates Act in the case United States v. Raddatz, addressing constitutional issues surrounding the act. The district judge retains the authority to make the final determination, either following or rejecting the magistrate's recommendation. The Magistrates Act allows magistrate judges to hear motions to suppress evidence in criminal cases, with the district court judge having the authority to review and make final decisions on the magistrate's recommendations. In the case of United States v. Raddatz, the defendant argued that the district court judge should rehear the testimony on which the magistrate based their findings. The Magistrates Act allows magistrate judges to make recommendations, with the district court judge having the final decision. In Gomez v. United States, the Court clarified that magistrate judges can oversee civil trials and enter final judgments with consent of the parties. In Gomez v. United States, the Court ruled that magistrate judges cannot oversee the selection of jurors in felony criminal prosecutions, as it is not permitted under the Magistrates Act. The Court focused on the importance of ensuring a fair and unbiased jury selection process. In Gomez v. United States, the Court held that magistrate judges cannot preside over jury selection in felony criminal prosecutions, as it is not authorized by the Magistrates Act. The decision emphasized the need for a fair and impartial jury selection process. In Gomez v. United States, the defendant did not consent to the magistrate selecting the jury, showing limits of adjunct theory when consent is withheld. Non-Article III tribunals can be constitutional if parties consent, as seen in statutes like the Federal Magistrates Act allowing adjudication with consent. The Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 allows district courts to refer proceedings related to bankruptcy cases to bankruptcy judges with the consent of all parties involved. Other federal laws may also allow arbitration based on consent. The constitutionality of non-Article III tribunals adjudicating matters with party consent is still a question. The Supreme Court has identified two rationales for the constitutional limitations on creating non-Article III tribunals: protecting individual litigants' right to impartial adjudication and preserving the role of the Judicial Branch in our government. Article III, \u00a71 safeguards both personal rights and structural principles. Article III, \u00a71 prohibits Congress from undermining Article III courts by reassigning federal judicial business to legislative judges without life tenure and guaranteed compensation. Consent to non-Article III tribunals undermines individual rights rationale. Individual rights protected by the Constitution can be waived voluntarily. For example, the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination can be waived by a criminal defendant. The defendant can waive the right against self-incrimination during custodial interrogation by voluntarily answering questions or executing a written waiver. Individual rights protected under Article III, \u00a71 can be waived, but structural protections provided by Article III, \u00a71 cannot be waived as they serve institutional interests. The Supreme Court has compared the structural protections of Article III, \u00a71 to federal court jurisdiction limits, which cannot be waived. When evaluating consent cases, the Court uses balancing tests based on different principles. In Commodities Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, the Court upheld a law allowing non-Article III tribunals to adjudicate certain matters based on the breadth of issues involved. The Supreme Court upheld a law allowing the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to adjudicate common law claims that were incidental to federal law claims. This was seen as a minimal intrusion on the judicial branch, with the Court emphasizing the narrow nature of its holding. Congress was warned against creating non-Article III tribunals without proper supervision or control. The Supreme Court upheld a law allowing the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to adjudicate common law claims incidental to federal law claims, emphasizing the narrow nature of its holding and minimal intrusion on the judicial branch. Congress was cautioned against creating non-Article III tribunals without proper supervision or control. In a separate case, the Court rejected the argument that having a magistrate judge oversee voir dire proceedings implicated the structural protections provided by Article III. The Court's reasoning in Peretz focused on the control exercised by a constitutional court over non-Article III court's work. Magistrate judges are appointed and subject to removal by Article III judges, with the district court making the ultimate decision on their assistance. This ensures no danger of undermining the power of constitutional courts. Lower court judges have struggled to determine the threat posed by consent cases to Article III's structural protections. Lower court judges have grappled with the constitutional limits of allowing parties to seek judicial relief from non-Article III tribunals. In a 1984 case, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Federal Magistrates Act provision allowing magistrates to try civil cases with consent, stating they function as adjuncts of district courts. Judge Posner dissented, arguing that only Article III courts can enter final judgments. The constitutionality of allowing consenting parties to proceed before non-Article III courts has been questioned, especially after the Supreme Court's condemnation of broad jurisdiction given to bankruptcy courts. The federal appellate courts are divided on whether consenting parties can have claims similar to those in Stern proceed before a bankruptcy court. To resolve this split, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Wellness International v. Sharif in July 2014. In July 2014, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Wellness International v. Sharif. In May 2015, the Court ruled 6-3 that bankruptcy courts can decide Stern claims with consent, relying on a functionalist approach similar to Schor and Peretz. The Court used an ad hoc balancing test to determine that allowing bankruptcy courts to decide Stern claims by consent does not threaten the Judicial Branch's integrity. The Wellness International Court ruled that bankruptcy courts can decide Stern claims with consent, without threatening the separation of powers. This decision was based on the oversight provided by a constitutional court, not Congress, and the lack of evidence of Congress trying to assert dominance over the Judiciary. The Wellness International Court's decision allows bankruptcy courts to decide Stern claims with consent, under the oversight of a constitutional court. The Court did not specify limits on litigant consent, leaving open questions about the scope of claims non-Article III courts can adjudicate with consent and the oversight needed for legislative courts ruling on traditionally Article III claims. This signals a return to a more functionalist approach in the Court's separation of powers jurisprudence regarding Article I courts."
