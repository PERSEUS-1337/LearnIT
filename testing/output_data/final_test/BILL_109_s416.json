    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Business Intermediary Lending Pilot Program Act of 2005\". Congress acknowledges the challenges faced by small and emerging businesses in accessing midsized loans due to banking industry consolidation, leading to fewer locally controlled banks and a shift towards credit scoring techniques over relationship-based lending. Nonprofit intermediary lenders supplement small business lending by providing riskier capital, flexible terms, and technical assistance to reduce banks' transaction costs and risk exposure. Federal programs like the Microloan Program and Intermediary Relending Program support these efforts. Nonprofit intermediary lenders in the United States are successfully providing financial and technical assistance to small and emerging businesses, leveraging additional capital for their business borrowers, and creating employment opportunities for low-income individuals through their lending and business development activities. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Pilot Program is established. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Program, established after the Small Business Intermediary Lending Pilot Program, defines an intermediary as a private, nonprofit entity that borrows funds from the Administration to provide midsize loans to small business concerns. This includes private, nonprofit community development corporations, consortiums of nonprofit organizations, and quasi-governmental economic development entities. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Program establishes a 3-year pilot program for providing direct loans to eligible intermediaries to make fixed interest rate midsize loans to small businesses. The term 'midsize loan' refers to a fixed rate loan ranging from $35,000 to $200,000 for startup, newly established, or growing small businesses. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Program aims to provide fixed interest rate midsize loans to startup, newly established, and growing small businesses in areas lacking credit due to poor economic conditions. The program also aims to create employment opportunities for low-income individuals by administering a midsize loan program for eligible intermediaries to offer small-scale loans averaging not more than $150,000. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Program provides midsize loans to startup, newly established, and growing small businesses. Intermediaries with at least 1 year of experience in lending to small businesses are eligible to participate in the program. The program aims to test nonprofit intermediaries as a delivery system for midsize loans and determine the feasibility of implementing a nationwide midsize loan program. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Program offers midsize loans to startup, newly established, and growing small businesses through qualified intermediaries. Applicants must provide details on the type of businesses to be assisted, loan sizes, geographic area served, economic characteristics, credit availability, and applicant qualifications. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Program sets loan limits for intermediaries at $1,000,000, with a maximum loan duration of 20 years and an annual interest rate of 1.00%. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Program sets loan limits for intermediaries at $1,000,000 with a maximum 20-year duration and 1.00% annual interest rate. No fees or collateral are required for loans. Loans to small businesses cannot exceed 75% of project costs, with the rest leveraged from other sources. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Program allows for delayed payments on loans for the first 2 years. The program provides funding for midsize loans to 20 intermediaries, ensuring geographic diversity. A report to Congress is required within 30 months. The Small Business Intermediary Lending Pilot Program Act of 2005 requires the Administration to submit an initial report within 30 months and annual reports thereafter to evaluate the program's effectiveness to the Senate and House Committees on Small Business. The report evaluating the Program must be submitted to the Committees, including details on intermediaries receiving funds, loan amounts, loans made to small businesses, repayment history, and loan portfolios. The Administrator must issue regulations within 180 days of the enactment of the Act to evaluate the Program, including details on intermediaries, loan amounts, loans to small businesses, employment of low-income individuals, and legislative recommendations. Authorization of appropriations is also included. The Small Business Administration is authorized to receive necessary appropriations for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 to provide $20,000,000 in loans under section 7(l) of the Small Business Act. Appropriated amounts will remain available until expended."
