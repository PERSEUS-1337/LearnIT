    "content": "The Act titled \"Retirement Savings Security Act of 2011\" provides participant loan death and disability protection. The Retirement Savings Security Act of 2011 introduces a Qualified Participant Loan Protection Arrangement, allowing participants in eligible retirement plans to obtain protection against death and disability when receiving a loan. The paragraph describes protection for death and disability provided through group insurance or debt protection products. Cost allocation and reimbursement requirements are specified for debt protection products. The arrangement must cancel any outstanding loan balance upon the death or disability of the participant or beneficiary. Payment to the plan should cover the outstanding loan balance and the amount specified in section 402(m)(1)(B). Participants have the option to opt out of coverage. Participants in a qualified participant loan protection arrangement have the option to opt out of coverage for death or disability by electing in writing. This election is irrevocable, and the interest rate on the loan is not affected by the cost of the protection. The term 'debt protection product' refers to a loan term or contractual arrangement that cancels part of a borrower's obligation in specific circumstances, such as death or disability, and may provide additional credit to the borrower's account. The term 'disability' in the context of a debt protection product refers to an impairment that causes a participant to be disabled, as defined by specific sections of relevant acts. Additionally, a debt protection product used in a qualified participant loan protection arrangement is not considered a swap or security-based swap. In the event of death or disability, outstanding participant loans cancelled under a qualified participant loan protection arrangement will be paid to the plan and credited to the participant or beneficiary's interest in the plan. In the event of death or disability, outstanding participant loans cancelled under a qualified participant loan protection arrangement will be paid to the plan and credited to the participant or beneficiary's interest in the plan. An exception to income inclusion rules regarding the purchase of life insurance protection is detailed in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Repayments of loans to participants or beneficiaries by certain plans or trusts are exempt from this rule. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for certain distributions from eligible retirement plans to be excluded from gross income if they are used to repay participant or beneficiary loans for death and disability protection under a qualified participant loan protection arrangement. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for distributions from eligible retirement plans to be excluded from gross income if used to repay participant or beneficiary loans for death and disability protection under a qualified participant loan protection arrangement, subject to certain conditions. The paragraph specifies that not more than 135 percent of a certain amount can be considered for an employee who receives a loan from an eligible retirement plan, obtains protection under a qualified participant loan protection arrangement, dies or becomes disabled, and is deemed to receive a distribution following such events. The amendments made by this section specify that distributions from group insurance policies or debt protection products for disabled employees receiving loans from eligible retirement plans will not violate certain requirements. The effective date for these amendments is one year after the enactment of the Act. No person as a fiduciary of an eligible retirement plan described in certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code will be in violation of certain fiduciary standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by adopting or not adopting a qualified participant loan protection arrangement."
