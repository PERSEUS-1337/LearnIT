    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on January 12, 2005, that federal sentencing guidelines must be advisory, not mandatory, under the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. This decision gives federal judges discretion in sentencing offenders, allowing them to deviate from the guidelines as long as the offense does not carry a mandatory sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court clarified federal sentencing guidelines to be advisory, not mandatory, under the Sixth Amendment. Congress must decide whether to require judges to follow guided sentences or allow discretion in sentencing. The Court addressed the issue of moving to a higher guideline maximum based on factual determinations. The Court examined whether the Sixth Amendment is violated by enhanced sentencing under the USSG based on judge's fact determination not found by jury or admitted by defendant. Background on federal sentencing guidelines, U.S. penal policy, and legislation leading to the Booker decision is discussed. Different sentencing guidelines, including the one approved by Congress, are analyzed in relation to recent Supreme Court decisions. The report discusses the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision and analyzes departures from federal sentencing guidelines. It also explores possible policy options for Congress to consider. Historically, the United States has used indeterminate and determinate sentencing policies, with a shift towards determinate sentencing in recent years. Rehabilitation became the focus of criminal sentencing in the United States in 1870, leading to the adoption of an indeterminate sentencing system in the federal penal system. Congress established penalty ranges for judges to impose sentences, with parole boards determining rehabilitation after serving one-third of the sentence. In the early 1970s, Congress reexamined federal sentencing policy, leading to a proposal to revise the Federal Criminal Code in 1973. Congress passed a sentencing reform in 1984. In 1984, Congress passed a sentencing reform measure that abolished indeterminate sentencing at the federal level and established determinate sentencing through federal sentencing guidelines. Under the previous system, defendants did not know the exact length of their sentence, with judges setting minimum sentences and the U.S. Parole Board deciding release dates. At the state level, judges would sentence defendants within a specified range of years for a particular crime. Indeterminate sentencing allowed judges to set a range of years for a sentence, with parole boards determining the actual time served. Critics argued that this system led to sentencing disparities and failed to rehabilitate offenders. In response, in 1984, federal sentencing guidelines were established to move towards determinate sentencing. In the mid-1970s, states and the federal government experimented with sentencing systems, leading to the creation of sentencing guidelines. Despite this, indeterminate sentencing remains predominant for most states, evolving towards more determinate structures through mandatory minimums and truth in sentencing provisions. Prior to structured sentencing policies, the only alternative was determinate sentencing. Congress and states revised laws in the 1970s to 1990s, often requiring mandatory sentencing. In the 1970s to 1990s, states and Congress passed laws that mandated imprisonment for certain crimes, established sentencing guidelines, and implemented \"three-strikes\" provisions. Determinate sentencing, with set punishment and release dates, became more common as an alternative to indeterminate sentencing. Critics argue that both indeterminate and determinate sentencing practices in the criminal justice system lead to disparities in sentences and potential abuse by officials. Indeterminate sentencing allows for individualized sentences but can result in inconsistencies, while determinate sentencing sets fixed periods based on statutes, potentially disregarding offender characteristics and shifting discretion from judges to prosecutors. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 created federal sentencing guidelines to address disparities in sentencing. The act eliminated indeterminate sentencing at the federal level and established the United States Sentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines for federal judges. Factors considered in sentencing guidelines include the nature of the offense and the offender's prior record. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 established federal sentencing guidelines to address disparities in sentencing. Factors considered in the guidelines include the nature of the offense, offender's prior record, public views, deterrent effect, and aggravating or mitigating circumstances. The Act abandoned rehabilitation as a goal of punishment and emphasized retribution, education, deterrence, and incapacitation. The U.S. Sentencing Commission was created to consolidate the power of sentencing decisions. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 established federal sentencing guidelines, abolished paroles, and created the U.S. Sentencing Commission. It made all federal sentences determinate and allowed appellate review of sentences. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges cannot impose sentences beyond the statutory maximum without jury findings beyond a reasonable doubt. In Apprendi v. New Jersey, the Court struck down a hate crime law allowing judges to increase sentences based on a preponderance of evidence. The Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington declared that judges cannot sentence a criminal defendant to a term of imprisonment greater than the statutory maximum assigned for the crime without jury findings. Washington State's sentencing guidelines were found to violate the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a trial by jury in criminal cases. After Blakely, federal courts grappled with arguments that the USSG also violated the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Court addressed this in United States v. Booker, where they considered two cases involving drug offenses. Booker was arrested with crack cocaine and admitted to selling more, leading to a jury trial in the District Court. Booker was found guilty of possessing and distributing crack cocaine. The judge sentenced him to 360 months based on the additional cocaine and obstruction of justice. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but overturned the sentence. Fanfan was arrested with 1.25 kilograms of cocaine. Fanfan was arrested with 1.25 kilograms of cocaine and 281.6 grams of cocaine base in his vehicle. He was found guilty of possessing \"500 or more grams\" of cocaine with intent to distribute. The sentencing judge considered the impact of the Blakely v. Washington case on federal sentencing guidelines. The Court recalculated sentencing guidelines based on possession of 500 grams, imposing a 78-month maximum. It ruled that discretionary guidelines do not violate the Sixth Amendment, requiring any fact for a sentence beyond the maximum to be admitted by the defendant or proven to a jury. This is in response to judges enhancing sentences based on factual findings not supported by jury verdicts or admissions. The Court upheld Blakely's applicability to federal sentencing guidelines, emphasizing the importance of jury findings in determining sentences. The decision granted judges more discretion in sentencing, with dissent from Justice Ginsburg and four other judges. The Supreme Court, with Justice Ginsburg joining four dissenting judges, declared two provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act unconstitutional. The majority evaluated the impact on the SRA's language, history, and purpose, concluding that Congress would not have intended a mandatory system post-Blakely. This led to the removal of the mandatory guideline requirement. The Supreme Court, with Justice Ginsburg joining four dissenting judges, declared two provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act unconstitutional. The majority considered three options: invalidating the act entirely, engrafting the Sixth Amendment \"jury trial\" requirement, or severance and excision of the offending parts. The Breyer majority opined that Congress would prefer excision of some parts rather than total invalidation. They concluded that 18 U.S.C. \u00a73553(b)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a73742(e) should be severed and excised to match Congress' intent of increased uniformity of sentencing. The Supreme Court declared two provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act unconstitutional, leading to a decision on whether to invalidate the act entirely, engraft the Sixth Amendment \"jury trial\" requirement, or sever and excise the offending parts. The majority opted to sever and excise 18 U.S.C. \u00a73553(b)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a73742(e) to align with Congress' goal of increased sentencing uniformity. Questions remain on the retroactivity of the decision, with guidance possibly found in the Court's ruling in Schriro v. Summerlin. The issue of retroactivity hinges on whether a new rule is substantive or procedural, with the potential for retroactive application if deemed substantive. The Summerlin Court concluded that the decision in Ring v. Arizona regarding the need for a jury to find certain facts beyond a reasonable doubt does not apply retroactively. In McReynolds v. United States, it was determined that the Booker decision is considered procedural and does not apply retroactively to cases finalized before January 12, 2005. District courts are not bound by certain provisions due to their severance. District courts are not bound by certain provisions due to their severance, allowing them to consult and consider sentencing guidelines without being obligated to follow them. A sentence outside the guidelines-determined range can be reversed if it fails to meet a \"reasonableness\" standard, which has not been clearly defined. This lack of definition may lead to varying standards of review, as noted by Justice Scalia in his dissent. After the Booker decision, appellate courts have been split on using a presumption of reasonableness for within-guidelines sentences. In Rita v. United States, guidance was provided on how appellate courts should review a lower court's sentencing decision. Mr. Rita received a 33-month sentence for perjury, false statements, and obstructing justice, which he argued was unreasonable on appeal. The Fourth Circuit upheld Mr. Rita's 33-month sentence, stating it was reasonable within the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The Supreme Court ruled that appellate courts can view guideline ranges as presumptively reasonable, although non-binding. The guidelines are considered reasonable as they reflect severity accurately. The sentencing judge can deviate from the guideline sentence if it doesn't reflect statutory considerations or if the case falls outside the typical guidelines. The defendant's sentence is subject to the court's discretion. The sentencing court affirms district judges' broad discretion in imposing non-guideline sentences under Booker. Reasons for sentencing decisions are crucial, especially when departing from guidelines or when contested under \u00a73553(a). The guidelines serve as a reasonable starting point for review, but should not be blindly followed. The plurality cautions that using guidelines as a starting point for review is not obligatory. Justice Stevens, with a concurrence from Justice Ginsburg, distinguishes Rita from prior unconstitutional practices. Justice Souter, the lone dissenter, is concerned that presuming guideline ranges as reasonable may move sentencing back to the unconstitutional mandatory scheme in Booker. Questions remain about factors appellate courts may consider to overcome this presumption. Questions remain about factors appellate courts may consider to overcome the presumption in reviewing sentences. In Gall v. United States and Kimbrough v. United States, the Court clarified sentencing and appellate review methods in a post-Booker regime. Gall involved a defendant who deviated from guidelines without needing to show \"extraordinary circumstances.\" In Gall v. United States, the defendant received probation instead of imprisonment for conspiracy to distribute ecstasy. The Eighth Circuit reversed the decision, but the Supreme Court held that appellate review for sentences should be deferential. Justice Stevens rejected a presumption of unreasonableness for sentences outside the guidelines range. The appellate court must ensure proper sentencing procedure was followed, including calculating guidelines range and considering \u00a73553(a) factors. Deviation from guidelines range can be considered, but deference must be given to the district court's decision. In Kimbrough v. United States, the Court held that a sentence outside the guidelines range is not per se unreasonable based on a disagreement with sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses. The cocaine guidelines, like all others, are advisory. The Court found that the cocaine guidelines are advisory and just one factor in determining a sentence under \u00a73553(a). Kimbrough pleaded guilty to various drug-related offenses, facing a minimum of 15 years in prison. The district court judge deemed a sentence within the guidelines range excessive, considering Kimbrough's history and characteristics. The Court found that the district court considered Kimbrough's history and characteristics, as well as the disparity between crack and powdered cocaine. The Court determined that the district court followed proper procedure in calculating the guidelines range and addressing relevant sentencing factors. It was noted that the reduction in Kimbrough's sentence was not an abuse of discretion, providing federal district court judges with some discretion in crafting reasonable sentences. Judges have flexibility in determining sentences in drug cases, as seen in Spears v. United States where they can reject crack-cocaine guidelines based on policy disagreement. This discretion does not eliminate mandatory minimums. Sentencing guidelines can be presumptive, statutory, advisory, or voluntary. Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in Booker, federal sentencing guidelines were presumptive, setting penalties based on offense seriousness and criminal history. These guidelines were adopted by a sentencing commission and judges were expected to follow them unless they provided reasons for departure. Prior to the Booker ruling, federal sentencing guidelines were presumptive, requiring judges to adhere to them unless they provided reasons for departure. Statutory sentencing guidelines are directly authorized by a legislative body, while presumptive sentencing guidelines are established by a sentencing commission. The Booker ruling made federal sentencing guidelines advisory, allowing judges to use them as a reference but not requiring strict adherence. The Booker ruling made federal sentencing guidelines advisory, leading to the implementation of various sentencing guidelines in states. Departures from the guidelines can take three forms: substantial assistance, other downward, and upward departures. Upward departures are used least often. In federal sentencing guidelines, departures can be upward, downward, or for substantial assistance. The guidelines restrict when judges can depart, with departures not available in most cases. Congress restricted downward departures in the 108th Congress, limiting grounds for judges to apply them. The majority of federal sentences are handed down under the guidelines, with approximately 1% falling outside the guidelines. Pre-Booker departures were mostly downward, often due to substantial assistance or mitigating factors. In 2003, federal judges departed from the guidelines 29.7% of the time, with less than 1% being upward departures. Since the Booker decision, federal sentencing practices have shifted, with a decrease in sentences falling within the guideline range and an increase in both upward and downward departures. In 2007, there was an 8% drop in judges adhering to the guidelines compared to 2003, leading to an almost 8% increase in downward departures and a half percent increase in upward departures. Further analysis at the district and circuit court level is needed to fully understand these changes. The data shows that most departures in federal sentencing are downward, leading to concerns about judges bypassing sentencing guidelines. Critics argue that departures create unwarranted disparity by allowing judges to sentence outside the specified range, potentially resulting in significant sentence variations for defendants. However, some see departures as a necessary tool for judges to individualize sentences. In light of recent court rulings, Congress is considering whether to amend laws to require federal judges to follow guided sentences or allow discretion in sentencing. One option is to maintain sentencing guidelines with mandatory minimums and increased maximums for specified offenses. This would limit upward departures in sentencing. One option presented to the U.S. Sentencing Commission after the Blakely decision is to require any upward departures to align with the statutory maximum for the offense, preserving current federal practice almost unchanged. This would allow judges to sentence above current guideline ranges without formal upward departures, similar to a measure implemented in Kansas after the state's presumptive sentencing guidelines were invalidated. The state's legislature responded to the invalidation of presumptive sentencing guidelines by incorporating jury fact-finding for enhanced sentences. Judges can try aggravating factors before the jury, who must find them beyond a reasonable doubt for the enhanced sentence to apply. This approach may address constitutional concerns but could be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, federal judges may be given discretion in sentencing when Congress has not specified a mandatory term. Congress has not specified a mandatory term of sentence, which could lead to a lack of uniformity in sentencing across jurisdictions."
