U.S. refinery DFO production has increased, with a focus on diesel fuel production for export to European markets. In 2013, the U.S. exported 409.7 million barrels of DFO, with the majority leaving from Gulf Coast ports. Additionally, the U.S. imports DFO in the form of heating oil, with imports exceeding 56.4 million barrels in 2013. The Northeast region in the United States has the highest demand for home heating oil, with over 5.5 million households relying on it for primary space heating in 2012-2013. However, the number of household users has been declining, with a projected 3% decrease for 2013-2014. Factors contributing to this decline include price, improved home energy efficiency, new construction, population shifts, availability of alternative heating fuels, and milder weather. Home heating oil, a middle-distillate refined petroleum product similar to diesel and jet fuel, can be used interchangeably under certain conditions. Taxation and air emission regulations vary based on use, with availability being seasonally dependent and subject to price fluctuations. Certain middle distillate fuels, including those used for heating, farming, government, non-profit organizations, and boats, are tax-exempt or subject to reduced tax rates. The IRS and EPA require red dye in certain middle distillate fuels for tax evasion prevention and sulfur content identification. Refineries switch product slates in late summer to produce heating oil and winter gasoline blends, causing price fluctuations. The demand for home heating oil in the Northeast has been declining over the last decade, with all states experiencing a decrease in consumption. New York, the largest consumer, dropped 40% from 2001 to 2012, while Rhode Island, the smallest consumer, experienced a 22% drop during the same period. The number of households relying on heating oil as their primary source of heat decreased by 12% from 6.7 million to 5.9 million between 2006-2007 and 2012-2013. The Energy Information Administration predicts a further decline for the 2013-2014 winter due to factors like price, availability of alternative fuels, population changes, and housing construction. Despite declining demand in the Northeast, the price of oil increased from $1.50 to over $4.00 per gallon from 2000 to 2013. The availability of natural gas in the Northeast region depends on transmission pipelines, with Canadian imports coming through New York, Maine, and New. The Northeast region receives Canadian natural gas imports through New York, Maine, and New Hampshire. LNG supplies enter through Highgate Springs, VT, and Everett, MA. Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale gas production started after 2008, but pipeline infrastructure in New England has not expanded. Northeast's demand for natural gas has remained steady at 20-22% since 2000, with a slight increase after 2006. Residential heating fuel trends in the Northeast have shown a decline in the use of kerosene and propane as alternatives to natural gas. The price of residential propane has significantly increased, indicating it may not be a more economical option. Some Northeastern states have seen a rise in electricity demand for heating, particularly in populous states like New York and Pennsylvania. This shift to electricity for heating has coincided with a decrease in demand for heating oil in these states. In the Northeast, there has been a decline in the use of kerosene and propane for residential heating, with some states showing an increase in electricity demand for heating. This shift to electricity may be due to a decrease in heating oil demand, suggesting a possible switch to electricity for heating. The Northeastern states experienced a 3.21% increase in population from 2000 to 2010, with New York and Pennsylvania leading in population growth. The Northeast states, including Maine and New Hampshire, saw population growth above the average. Housing units in the region increased from 22.1 million in 2000 to 23.6 million in 2010. Each state in the Northeast experienced similar changes. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides funds to help low-income households with home energy expenses. The LIHEAP program provides funding for home energy expenses to low-income households. It consists of regular funds allocated based on a formula and emergency contingency funds released at the discretion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. LIHEAP was created in 1981 as part of the predecessor program, LIEAP, which distributed funds based on a formula favoring cold-weather states. In 1981, Congress enacted LIHEAP to replace LIEAP, with a formula favoring cold-weather states. In 1984, the formula was changed to consider heating and cooling costs, leading to a shift of funds from cold-weather to warm-weather states. Congress added \"hold-harmless\" provisions to prevent a dramatic shift of funds. The \"new\" formula enacted in 1984 led to a shift of funds from cold-weather to warm-weather states. Citizens Energy Corporation provides heating oil assistance through vouchers, serving half a million low-income and elderly residents in 25 states. They rely on charitable contributions and support from Citgo Petroleum Corporation. Critics question Citizens' association with Citgo. Critics claim that Citizens' association with Citgo led to politicians benefiting from cheap oil while unknowingly indebting themselves to Hugo Chavez. The Northeast's declining demand for heating oil may be due to price increases, consumers using less oil, and switching to alternative energy sources like electricity, natural gas, kerosene, or wood. Increased electricity sales could indicate a shift from heating oil, but could also be attributed to population growth and new home construction. The rise in housing stock and occupancy rates from 2000 to 2011 suggests a higher demand for residential heating, although newer, more energy-efficient homes and oilheat furnaces may have replaced older units. The Northeast's heating oil demand has declined 47% since 2000, with newer, more efficient oilheat furnaces replacing older units. Congress authorized the National Oilheat Research Alliance (NORA) to promote cleaner and more efficient oilheat equipment. Additionally, a 2 million-barrel Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) was established in response to the 1999-2000 heating oil price spike and supply shortage. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) could be depleted in as few as four days if consumption reaches half a million barrels per day. However, at the current average consumption rate of 70.9 million barrels annually, the Reserve could last up to a week. Fuel shortages are more likely towards the end of the heating season, especially during prolonged cold spells. NHHOR has only been used during natural disasters to address distillate fuel shortages, not market disruptions. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) was established under the 2000 Energy Policy Conservation Act amendment (P.L. 106-469) to address distillate fuel shortages during natural disasters. However, the amendment did not account for emergency contingencies like the ones that arose after Hurricane Sandy. Congress may need to clarify the Energy Secretary's authority to release NHHOR stocks for such situations. NHHOR's impact on heating oil prices is not as significant as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's influence on crude oil prices. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve can affect crude oil prices, while heating oil futures contracts may be influenced by long-term weather forecasts for a colder winter. Speculative bidding may drive prices higher, but heating oil brokers may need to enter higher bids to secure future supplies. Independent retail marketers respond to local market conditions and price changes reflect their expectations of replacing fuel stocks. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve was established to prevent price gouging during fuel shortages by providing a price signal to consumers. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) provides a price signal to consumers during fuel shortages, influencing them to conserve fuel. The presence of NHHOR may have instilled confidence in consumers that supply shortages would be temporary. However, after Hurricane Sandy, NHHOR supported federal disaster response efforts instead of addressing market dislocations as originally intended. The question arises whether the Department of Energy should continue maintaining NHHOR and if Congress should monitor the region's heating oil supply. Distillate Fuel Oil is a classification for petroleum fractions including diesel fuels and fuel oils. No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4 diesel fuels are used in on-highway and off-highway engines, while No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4 fuel oils are used for space heating and power generation. No. 2 Fuel Oil, also known as Heating Oil, is used in burners for domestic and commercial/industrial heating. No. 4 Fuel Oil is a distillate fuel oil used in industrial plants and commercial burner installations without preheating facilities. No. 1 Distillate is a light petroleum distillate that can be used as diesel fuel or fuel oil. No. 1 Diesel Fuel is a light distillate fuel oil used in high-speed diesel engines. No. 1 Fuel Oil is a light distillate fuel oil used for portable outdoor stoves and heaters. No. 2 Diesel Fuel is a fuel used in high-speed diesel engines in vehicles like railroad locomotives, trucks, and automobiles. No. 2 Diesel Fuel is used in high-speed diesel engines in vehicles like railroad locomotives, trucks, and automobiles. It comes in three variations: High Sulfur, Low Sulfur, and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel. The National Oilheat Research Alliance (NORA) was authorized in the 2000 Energy Act to develop clean and efficient oilheat utilization equipment and training programs. The National Oilheat Research Alliance (NORA) was a not-for-profit industry trade association of heating oil suppliers established under Title VII of the act. It was funded through a check-off program where a portion of the wholesale cost of the product was set aside. Initially authorized for four years, NORA's sunset provision was extended to nine years in 2005. Despite its official end in 2010, NORA continued operations until 2011, disbursing remaining funds. NORA, established under Title VII, continued operations beyond its sunset date in 2011. The Agricultural Act of 2014 extended NORA for 9 years, allowing it to resume full operations in 2014. NORA started collecting fees in 2001 and had participation from marketers and suppliers in 23 states and the District of Columbia. NORA, established under Title VII, continued operations beyond its sunset date in 2011. The Agricultural Act of 2014 extended NORA for 9 years, allowing it to resume full operations in 2014. NORA started collecting fees in 2001 and had participation from marketers and suppliers in 23 states and the District of Columbia. NORA developed programs and projects, entered contracts for consumer and employee safety, research, and consumer education. Funding was sourced from assessments on distillate sales, totaling nearly $125 million by 2011. By the end of 2011, NORA had collected $125 million in fees, with fee assessments accounting for 97% of total revenue. NORA was authorized to invest funds in specific types of obligations. By the end of 2011, NORA had spent $124.5 million, with only $0.5 million remaining from the assessments. The majority of the assessments ($92 million) were spent on state grants. General and administrative expenses accounted for slightly over 6% ($7.6 million) of the total spending. In a 2010 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed NORA's activities and found that while research and development aligned with strategic goals, consumer education and training lacked clear goals. GAO concluded that NORA met 11 out of 18 legislative requirements without significant issues. GAO identified issues with NORA's activities under legislative requirements of the Oilheat Act, including lobbying prohibitions and use of funds for influencing legislation. NORA president sought support for reauthorization from state senators and traveled to Washington for advocacy efforts. The NORA president traveled to Washington to urge Massachusetts senators to support NORA reauthorization. However, there is uncertainty regarding the prohibitions in the Propane Act and Oilheat Act on influencing legislation or elections. The near doubling of heating oil prices in the winter of 1999-2000 was mainly due to low storage levels of middle distillate stocks. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) was established in response to the 1999-2000 heating oil price spike and supply shortage. It is a 2 million barrel emergency stockpile intended to meet roughly 10 days of demand by Northeastern states. The region continues to rely on heating oil but at a reduced level due to alternative fuels and improvements in home heating. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) was established to meet 10 days of demand in the Northeastern states during supply disruptions. The reserve reached full capacity in October 2000 at sites in New Haven, CT, Woodbridge, NJ, and Providence, RI. NHHOR is part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and has a drawdown authority for severe energy supply interruptions. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) was established to address supply disruptions in the Northeastern states. It defines a dislocation as a significant price differential between crude oil and No. 2 heating oil, triggering the release of NHHOR oil through a competitive bid process or exchange agreement. Critics raised concerns about the reserve's potential misuse. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) was established to address supply disruptions in the Northeastern states. Critics argued that its use might be inappropriate and could disincentivize private suppliers from maintaining sufficient inventories. The President could authorize a release of the NHHOR in the event of a regional supply shortage. During December 2000, heating oil prices breached the 60% differential due to a decline in crude prices, not a rise in home heating oil prices. During a general strike in Venezuela in late 2002, the United States lost 1.5 million barrels of daily crude supply, leading to a reliance on refined product inventories for home heating oil during a cold winter. Despite calls for the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) to be used, the price of heating oil did not meet the criteria for a drawdown. In May 2007, the Department of Energy announced the sale of approximately 35,000 barrels of home heating oil from the NHHOR. In May 2007, the Department of Energy announced the sale of approximately 35,000 barrels of home heating oil from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR). The sale was conducted to supplement funds for new storage contracts due to rising storage costs. The sale represented less than 2% of the NHHOR's authorized capacity of 2 million barrels. The Department of Energy sold high sulfur stocks to purchase cleaner-burning ultra-low sulfur distillate, generating $227 million. Superstorm Sandy in October 2012 caused severe energy supply interruptions, prompting President Obama to direct DOE to transfer emergency resources. During Superstorm Sandy in October 2012, President Obama directed the Department of Energy to transfer emergency fuel from the Reserve to the Department of Defense for use in emergency operations and support for those affected by the storm. The Defense Logistics Agency distributed fuel to responders in the New York/New Jersey area, totaling over 120,000 barrels to support relief efforts.

The Defense Logistics Agency distributed over 120,000 barrels of fuel to responders in the New York/New Jersey area. The 2000 Energy Policy Conservation Act amendment that established the National Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) had only authorized the Energy Secretary to sell NHHOR stock in the event of a dislocation in the heating oil market resulting from an interruption or regional supply shortage, not for the type of contingency that arose after Sandy."
