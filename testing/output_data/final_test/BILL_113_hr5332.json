The \"Serving America's Veterans Effectively Act of 2014\" or the \"SAVE Act of 2014\" recognizes the unique health needs of veterans, including conditions like cancer, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury. Knowing a patient is a veteran helps physicians make accurate treatment recommendations. If a physician is unaware of a patient's veteran status, necessary screenings may be overlooked. The importance of asking patients about their veteran status lies in helping physicians diagnose symptoms accurately and provide appropriate treatment. By including questions about veteran status in routine patient history assessments, physicians can better understand potential health risks and tailor treatment plans accordingly. This practice is especially crucial in frameworks like the \"Welcome to Medicare\" physical examination. The \"Welcome to Medicare\" physical examination and Medicare Electronic Health Record program aim to become part of clinicians' routine for new patients. Up to 70 percent of veterans seek care from facilities outside the Department of Veterans Affairs, highlighting the need for all physicians to be properly prepared to diagnose and treat patients who have served in the Armed Forces.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to include information on whether a patient served in the Armed Forces in electronic health records for Medicare and Medicaid meaningful use. Additionally, veterans are to be identified as part of an individual's history during the Welcome to Medicare Visit. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is mandated to include information on military service in electronic health records for Medicare and Medicaid meaningful use.
