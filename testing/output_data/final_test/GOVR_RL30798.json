    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established under the Nixon Administration through Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 to consolidate federal pollution control laws. This reorganization also led to the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to manage environmental responsibilities. The EPA and NOAA were created with congressional approval under the Reorganization Act of 1949 to improve the execution and efficiency of federal laws and agencies. The EPA was established in 1970 under President Nixon to consolidate federal pollution control responsibilities. The agency's authorities have expanded over time to include regulating air quality, water quality, and chemicals in commerce. The EPA regulates air and water quality, chemicals in commerce, and waste management. States enforce federal standards, with EPA providing financial assistance. This report outlines federal environmental statutes but is not comprehensive. The report highlights key provisions of selected federal statutes authorizing EPA activities, explaining program scope and definitions of statutory terms. While some EPA programs have received renewed appropriations, comprehensive reauthorization of statutes has not occurred in years. Program authority typically does not expire unless repealed. The authorization of appropriations for a specific program or activity may expire, but Congress can still provide funding through annual appropriations if certain rules are not enforced. House and Senate rules generally do not allow funding for unauthorized programs, but Congress can appropriate funding if no point of order is raised or rules are waived. This has been done to continue funding for EPA programs and activities. Once enacted, appropriations provide legal authority for agencies to obligate federal funds in a specific fiscal year. Congress appropriates funding for EPA within the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies annual appropriations bill. This report focuses on EPA's program authorities under discussed statutes, with a list of major amendments provided at the beginning of each summary. The final table at the end of each summary lists individual provisions of the statute. The report provides summaries of major provisions of statutes, linking public laws to the United States Code. It omits certain details for brevity and does not cover all provisions. The focus is on existing law, not implementation issues or EPA regulations. Other CRS reports cover current developments related to EPA's statutory authorities. The Clean Air Act, found in 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., aims to protect human health and the environment from air pollution by setting national air quality standards. States are responsible for ensuring compliance, with nonattainment areas required to implement pollution control measures. The act also regulates mobile sources of pollution, hazardous air pollutants, and implements a cap-and-trade program for acid rain emissions. The Clean Air Act establishes a permit system for major sources of air pollution, addresses prevention in clean air areas, and protects the ozone layer. Federal efforts to control air pollution have evolved through phases, starting with information collection and research before setting federal standards and enforcement. Federal legislation on air pollution began in 1955 and was strengthened in subsequent amendments, notably the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, 1977, and 1990. EPA sets national standards for ambient air quality under the 1970 amendments. The Clean Air Act, established in 1970, set national standards for ambient air quality and required a 90% reduction in emissions from new automobiles by 1975. The 1977 amendments adjusted auto emission standards and added the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program. The 1990 amendments included provisions to classify nonattainment areas, tighten emission standards for mobile sources, require reformulated fuels, and revise the air toxics section. The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act included provisions to establish new technology-based standards, address sudden releases of air toxics, implement an acid rain control program, require state-run permit programs for major sources of air pollutants, phase out ozone-depleting chemicals, and update enforcement provisions. The amendments also authorized appropriations for clean air programs through FY1998. The Clean Air Act's authorization of appropriations has expired, but programs continue to be funded. The act's legal authorities to issue and enforce regulations are permanent. The report describes major programs required by the act, focusing on changes from the 1990 amendments. EPA is required to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to protect public health and welfare from air pollutants. EPA has used this authority to promulgate regulations. The Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and welfare from air pollutants. NAAQS have been set for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and lead. EPA must review and revise the standards as needed, with deadlines for compliance extended multiple times due to difficulties in meeting them. Compliance schedules are staggered based on the severity of an area's air quality. The Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health. Compliance schedules are staggered based on air pollution severity. States are responsible for establishing procedures to meet standards through State Implementation Plans (SIPs) based on emission inventories and computer models. If standards are exceeded, additional controls must be imposed on existing sources. Proposed new sources need state construction permits to ensure emissions stay within limits. The Clean Air Act requires states to establish State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). In nonattainment areas, new or modified sources must offset emissions with reductions from existing sources. Failure to comply with SIP requirements can result in sanctions, including emissions offsets and bans on federal grants. Federal Implementation Plans may be imposed if states do not submit or implement adequate SIPs. No federal permits or financial assistance can be granted for activities that do not conform to SIPs in nonattainment areas. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments require demonstrating conformity of transportation plans and State Implementation Plans (SIPs) in nonattainment areas to receive federal funding for new highway and transit projects. Nonattainment areas are classified based on NAAQS exceedance levels, with specific pollution controls and attainment dates established for each classification. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments established five classes of ozone nonattainment areas based on pollutant concentration levels. Los Angeles was the only area classified as \"extreme,\" with 97 others falling into different categories. Different deadlines were set for ozone nonattainment areas, ranging from 1993 to 2032 under the current eight-hour ozone standard. Under the current eight-hour ozone standard, deadlines for ozone nonattainment areas range from 2015 to 2032. Areas with worse pollution face more stringent control requirements, including emissions inventory updates every three years, VOC emission offsets, and RACT for major sources. Moderate areas must also meet marginal area requirements and implement a 15% reduction in VOC emissions. In moderate areas, a 15% reduction in VOC emissions must be implemented. Major sources emitting over 100 tons per year must adhere to RACT guidelines. Gas stations selling over 10,000 gallons per month must have vapor recovery. Fleet vehicles must use clean alternative fuels. Transportation control measures are required if vehicle miles traveled exceed expectations. In severe areas, VOC emissions must be reduced, major sources defined as emitting over 25 tons per year. Transportation control measures and reformulated gasoline programs are required. Penalties are imposed on major sources not meeting reductions. In extreme areas, VOC emissions must be further reduced, major sources defined as emitting over 10 tons per year. Clean fuels or advanced control technology are required for boilers emitting over 25 tons per year of NOx. EPA introduced a new 8-hour ozone standard in July 1997. The EPA introduced a new 8-hour ozone standard in July 1997, leading to the designation of nonattainment areas in 2004. State Implementation Plans were required by 2007. Carbon monoxide nonattainment areas have specific control requirements based on severity levels, with measures such as emissions inventory, vehicle inspection programs, and transportation control in place. The EPA introduced new standards for carbon monoxide and particulate matter nonattainment areas, with specific control requirements based on severity levels. Areas failing to meet the standard had to revise their State Implementation Plans and demonstrate reductions until compliance was achieved. All areas have now met the standard. EPA also promulgated new standards for fine particulates (PM 2.5) in July 1997, which faced court challenges and implementation delays due to a lack of monitoring network. The absence of a monitoring network delayed the implementation of pollutant standards. Nonattainment areas for PM 2.5 were designated in 2005, with states given three years to submit plans. Revisions to the NAAQS in 2006 strengthened the PM 2.5 standard. Meeting clean air standards is complex due to transported air pollutants. States and EPA are working on compliance strategies for ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS. SIPs must prevent sources from contributing to nonattainment in downwind states. EPA can require revised SIPs if needed. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments provided EPA and states with tools to address regional pollution problems through SIP Calls. Section 176A allows EPA to establish transport regions to address violations of NAAQS. A commission makes recommendations for mitigation strategies, and EPA notifies states of inadequacies in their SIPs, setting deadlines for revisions. EPA can require revised SIPs to address noncompliance with NAAQS. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments created an Ozone Transport Region (OTR) in the Northeast, requiring additional controls for all areas in that region. The Ozone Transport Commission recommends regionwide controls, and affected downwind states can address the issue through a Section 126 petition to EPA. EPA must respond to the petition within 60 days, granting it if pollutants significantly contribute to nonattainment of NAAQS. The Clean Air Act amendments in 1990 established the Ozone Transport Region in the Northeast, requiring additional controls. Downwind states can petition EPA under Section 126 if pollutants contribute to nonattainment of NAAQS. EPA must respond within 60 days, and if granted, offending sources must comply with emission controls or cease operations. The amendments also tightened emission standards for automobiles, with Tier 1 standards phased in from 1994-1996 and Tier 2 standards planned for after 2004. In 2004, Tier 2 standards were promulgated by the EPA after reporting to Congress on the need for emission reductions, availability of technology, and cost-effectiveness. These standards required emission reductions of 77% to 95% from cars and light trucks, phased in over the 2004-2009 model years. Additionally, a more than 90% reduction in sulfur content of gasoline was required starting in 2004 to facilitate more effective emission controls. The EPA implemented fuel regulations to reduce emissions in nonattainment areas, including the use of reformulated gasoline (RFG) in specific regions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 modified the fuels provisions by requiring renewable fuels like ethanol in motor fuels. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 further strengthened renewable fuel requirements. In 2007, the Clean-Fuel Fleet Program mandated centrally fueled fleets in polluted areas to purchase a percentage of clean-fuel vehicles annually, starting in 1999. The requirement increased to 50% in 2000 and 70% in 2001 for passenger cars and light-duty trucks, and 50% for heavy-duty fleets. Clean fuel vehicles meet LEV standards and operate on specific fuels like methanol, ethanol, natural gas, or electricity. California's ZEV program also promotes zero-emission vehicles. California's ZEV program, authorized under Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, allows the state to set its own vehicle emissions standards if they are as strict as federal standards and necessary due to unique conditions. The program, established in 2003, requires auto manufacturers to sell ZEVs like electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Over time, the program has evolved to include credits for hybrid and partial ZEV vehicles, serving as a catalyst for lower emission technologies. The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act imposed stricter standards on emissions, certification, refueling, low temperature CO emissions, in-use performance, and warranties for expensive emission control components. These regulations also extended to nonroad fuels and engines, as well as strengthened standards for trucks and buses using diesel engines. At least 10 states have adopted California's stricter standards, with the act allowing for this adoption. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments imposed stricter standards on emissions for diesel engines in urban buses and heavy-duty vehicles, with reductions required for diesel particulates and NOx emissions. Further regulations in 2001 and 2004 mandated additional reductions in emissions and sulfur content in diesel fuel for highway and nonroad equipment. Section 112 of the act was revised to establish programs for protecting public health from toxic air pollutants. Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, as revised by the 1990 amendments, includes provisions for Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) requirements, health-based standards, standards for stationary \"area sources,\" and requirements for the prevention of catastrophic releases. The EPA is tasked with establishing technology-based emission standards for 187 pollutants, revising them every eight years, and can add or remove substances or source categories from the lists based on petitions or its own initiative. The Clean Air Act's Section 112 mandates MACT requirements for pollutants, with EPA setting standards for emissions reduction in new sources, ensuring they are at least as stringent as the best performing similar source. Existing sources must meet emission limitations of the top 12% performers. EPA considers health and environmental effects in regulating designated pollutants. The Clean Air Act's Section 112 mandates MACT requirements for pollutants, with EPA setting standards for emissions reduction in new sources. Existing sources must meet emission limitations achieved by the best performing sources. Compliance deadlines are set with possible extensions for special circumstances. EPA is also directed to set health-based standards to address residual health or environmental risks after MACT installation. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to submit a report to Congress on residual risks and recommend legislation. If Congress does not act, EPA must issue standards for sources of hazardous air pollutants to protect public health. Residual risk standards are needed for sources emitting cancer-causing pollutants with added risks. Compliance deadlines are set for existing sources, with possible extensions. Residual risk standards do not apply to area sources. EPA is required to contract with the National Academy of Sciences for a risk assessment study. The Clean Air Act mandates the EPA to contract with the National Academy of Sciences for a risk assessment study and establish standards for stationary \"area sources\" of hazardous air pollution. EPA is required to regulate the stationary area sources responsible for 90% of emissions of the 30 hazardous air pollutants posing the greatest risk to public health in urban areas. EPA can impose less stringent standards when setting regulations. The Clean Air Act mandates the EPA to regulate hazardous air pollutants in urban areas by establishing standards for stationary sources. EPA can impose less stringent control technologies, rather than MACT, to address air toxics. Section 112 focuses on preventing catastrophic releases by establishing a Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. Owners and operators are required to prepare risk management plans under Section 112(r) to prevent and respond to releases. EPA is also directed to issue requirements for catastrophic releases by major sources under Section 112. Additionally, Section 111 requires EPA to establish technology-based standards called New Source Performance Standards (NSPS). The Clean Air Act mandates the EPA to regulate hazardous air pollutants in urban areas by establishing standards for stationary sources. EPA can impose less stringent control technologies, rather than MACT, to address air toxics. NSPS establish maximum emission levels for new major stationary sources with the best control technology available. EPA must regularly update NSPS to prevent new pollution problems and promote clean air for future growth. The Clean Air Act aims to regulate hazardous air pollutants in urban areas by setting standards for stationary sources. New Source Review (NSR) process applies to modifications of existing facilities to prevent new pollution problems and enforce new control technology. The 1990 amendments established federal requirements for emissions from incinerators burning various types of waste. EPA has proposed changes to its interpretation of NSR requirements in recent years. The Clean Air Act amendments established emissions monitoring and operator training requirements, as well as requirements for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality (PSD). The PSD program protects areas with better air quality from new pollution, dividing clean air areas into three classes with specific pollution allowances for each class. The Clean Air Act amendments established emissions monitoring and operator training requirements, as well as requirements for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality (PSD). III represents selected areas that states may designate for development; allowable increments of new pollution are large (but not so large that the area would exceed NAAQS). States can have regions redesignated from Class II to Class III through a hearing and review process. EPA is supposed to establish standards for other criteria pollutants besides SO2 and particulates, with only NO2 addressed so far in 1988. Newly constructed polluting sources in PSD areas must install best available control technology (BACT) for air quality protection and health preservation. The Clean Air Act sets national goals to prevent pollution and impairment of visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. It requires EPA to establish commissions to ensure progress towards these goals, with specific provisions for the Grand Canyon region. EPA must promulgate regulations within 18 months of receiving a commission report to ensure reasonable progress towards visibility improvement. The EPA is required to promulgate regulations to ensure reasonable progress towards the visibility goal, including updating State Implementation Plans with emission limits and schedules of compliance. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 added a regional haze program applicable to all 50 states and an acid deposition control program (Title IV) with goals to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions by specific amounts from 1980 levels. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set SO2 reduction targets for electric generating facilities, with Phase 1 targeting facilities over 100 megawatts by 1995 and Phase 2 targeting those over 75 megawatts by 2000. Compliance has been 100%, with allowances issued by the EPA for emissions. New units after 1990 must obtain allowances from existing holders. Allowances can be traded nationally. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set SO2 reduction targets for electric generating facilities, with allowances issued by the EPA for emissions. Allowances can be traded nationally, and industrial sources and powerplants can sell allowances to utility systems. A special reserve fund and annual open auctions were established to improve liquidity and ensure availability of allowances for utilities and independent power producers. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established a system for capping SO2 emissions at individual sources through a tonnage limitation and an allowance system. Emissions from existing sources are capped at a specified rate, while new plants must offset their emissions with reductions at existing facilities. Utilities with excess allowances can auction them off, and those without enough allowances face a penalty. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established a system for capping SO2 emissions at individual sources through a tonnage limitation and an allowance system. If emissions exceed allowances, a penalty of $2,000 per ton of SO2 is imposed, and additional reductions are required the following year. EPA must inventory industrial emissions of SO2 every five years, taking action if levels may exceed 5.60 million tons per year. Specific NOx emission rate limitations were set for boilers, with Phase 1 controls requiring compliance with NOx requirements. EPA set emission limitations for other boilers by 1997 based on low-NOx burner costs. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established emission limitations for boilers based on low-NOx burner costs by 1997. EPA also proposed a revised standard for NOx from fossil fuel steam generating units in 1998. Since 2005, EPA has further reduced SO2 and NOx emissions by 50% in the eastern half of the country. The Act added Title V, requiring states to administer a permit program for sources emitting air pollutants, similar to the Clean Water Act. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established emission limitations for major stationary sources to obtain construction permits under Section 165 of the act. Sources subject to the permit requirements generally include those emitting 100 tons per year of any regulated pollutant, plus sources emitting lesser specified amounts of hazardous air pollutants. States were required to develop permit programs and submit them for EPA approval by November 15, 1993. EPA had one year to approve or disapprove a state's submission. After the effective date of a state plan, sources had 12 months to submit a permit application. States are to collect annual fees from sources to cover reasonable costs. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established emission limitations for major stationary sources to obtain construction permits. States must collect annual fees to cover the costs of administering the permit program. The fee must be at least $25 per ton of regulated pollutants. Permits specify the amount of pollutants a source can emit, with a term limit of five years. EPA can veto a permit if necessary. The Clean Air Act allows EPA to review and potentially veto permits for major changes. However, EPA may not review permits that align with a state's clean air plan or are for small sources. Holding a permit can protect a source from enforcement actions if it complies with permit requirements. Section 113 of the act covers enforcement, giving federal authority to issue orders for compliance and impose penalties for violations. Section 114 authorizes EPA to require reports, monitor emissions, and ensure compliance with the act's requirements. The Clean Air Act allows EPA to review permits for major changes, with federal authority to issue orders for compliance and impose penalties for violations. States or local governments enforce the act by issuing permits, monitoring compliance, and conducting inspections. The federal government acts as a backstop, with authority to review state actions and file enforcement actions when necessary. Citizen suits can be brought against violators or EPA for failing to perform required actions. The 1990 Amendments have been used by citizen groups to compel the Administrator to promulgate required regulations. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments increased penalties for violations, authorized EPA to assess penalties, and awarded $10,000 for information leading to convictions. Title VI of the Amendments addresses domestic ozone depletion and aligns with the Montreal Protocol. Section 606(a)(3) allows EPA to adjust phase-out schedules for ozone-depleting substances according to changes in the Protocol. The phase-out schedules in Title VI for ozone-depleting compounds have been superseded by amendments to the Montreal Protocol. Industrial countries, including the United States, have phased out substances like CFCs and halons. New uses of HCFCs are banned starting January 1, 2015, with production frozen and phased out by January 1, 2030. EPA must add any substance with an ozone depletion potential of 0.2 or greater to the list of banned substances. Title VI requires the addition of substances with an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0.2 or higher to the list of banned Class 1 substances with a phase-out schedule of up to seven years. Congress adjusted the phase-out schedule for methyl bromide to align with the Montreal Protocol's 2005 deadline. Additionally, substances harmful to the stratosphere must be added to the list of Class 2 substances with a phase-out schedule of no more than 10 years. Various strategies are outlined to prevent the release of ozone-depleting chemicals into the atmosphere, including strict regulations for refrigerants and servicing. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or Clean Water Act, governs pollution of the nation's surface waters. Enacted in 1948 and revised in 1972, it includes ambitious programs for water quality improvement implemented by industries and municipalities. Fine-tuning amendments were made in 1977. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948, later revised in 1972, includes programs for water quality improvement by industries and municipalities. Congress made amendments in 1977, 1981, and 1987. The original law provided technical assistance funds to address water pollution problems. Federal involvement was limited to interstate waters enforcement with state consent. During the 1950s and 1960s, federal water pollution control programs were shaped by four laws amending the 1948 statute. The federal role and jurisdiction gradually extended to include intrastate waters. Water quality standards were introduced in 1965, requiring states to set standards for interstate waters. By the late 1960s, there were concerns about enforcement procedures and difficulties linking dischargers to violations. The 1972 amendments to water pollution control laws set ambitious goals for treating municipal and industrial wastewater before discharge into waterways. It also increased federal assistance for treatment plant construction, streamlined enforcement, and expanded the federal role while maintaining state responsibility for implementation. The 1972 Clean Water Act aimed to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters with goals of zero discharge of pollutants by 1985 and fishable/swimmable water quality by mid-1983. It consists of Title II and Title VI provisions for federal financial assistance for sewage treatment plants and regulatory requirements for industrial and municipal dischargers. The act is technology-forcing, demanding higher levels of pollution abatement. Industries had until July 1, 1977, to comply. The 1972 Clean Water Act required industries to install \"best practicable control technology\" by July 1, 1977, to clean up waste discharges. Municipal wastewater treatment plants had to achieve \"secondary treatment\" by the same date. Cities discharging wastes into marine waters could apply for waivers if natural factors helped eliminate pollution. The 1972 Clean Water Act required industries to install \"best practicable control technology\" by July 1, 1977, to clean up waste discharges. The act focused on controlling discharges of conventional pollutants like suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demanding material, and bacteria. Compliance extensions were available for industrial sources using innovative technology. The Clean Water Act requires industries to meet statutory deadlines for water quality protection using technology-based effluent limitations and water quality standards. States must establish standards for all bodies of water to ensure designated beneficial uses are not compromised by pollutants. The Clean Water Act requires states to set water quality standards for all bodies of water to ensure pollution control. If technology-based effluent limitations are met but water quality standards are not, additional controls may be required. States must also establish total maximum daily loads (TMDL) to address pollution problems and restore water quality in impaired waters. EPA estimates over 40,000 U.S. waters are impaired and need TMDL preparation. The Clean Water Act focuses on controlling toxic pollutant discharges, with states required to implement strategies for polluted waters even after industrial cleanup efforts. Prior to 1987, the Act primarily targeted point-source pollution, but post-BAT pollutant management programs became a key aspect of CWA implementation. Nonpoint-source pollution, such as stormwater runoff from agricultural lands, received little attention before the 1987 amendments. Nonpoint-source pollution, including stormwater runoff from various sources, accounts for over 50% of the nation's water pollution issues. The 1987 amendments of the Clean Water Act authorized measures to address this type of pollution, directing states to develop nonpoint pollution management programs. Federal financial assistance was provided for demonstration projects and control activities, covering up to 60% of implementation costs. Groundwater protection activities were also encouraged as part of nonpoint pollution control efforts. The Clean Water Act covers up to 60% of program implementation costs and emphasizes the need for research on water quality issues. It authorizes support for training personnel in wastewater treatment facilities and establishes national standards for effluent limitations. The EPA issues regulations for industrial sources to comply with effluent standards. Certain responsibilities are delegated to the states under this act. The Clean Water Act delegates responsibilities to states for issuing discharge permits and enforcing them. States also establish water quality standards and receive grants for sewage treatment facilities. EPA issues permits in a few states and the District of Columbia. Congress expanded the Clean Water Act grant program in 1972, authorizing $65 billion and appropriating over $85 billion for wastewater infrastructure construction. Grants are allocated based on state population and sewage treatment funding needs. An EPA-state estimate in 2008 showed a $203 billion need for wastewater treatment plants and water quality projects eligible for funding. EPA's 2002 Gap Analysis report estimated the US needs significant investment in water infrastructure over the next two decades. The Gap Analysis estimated that the United States needs $390 billion for wastewater infrastructure over the next two decades. Federal grants under the Title II program provided funding for various projects, with up to 55% of costs covered. Policymakers debate the balance between assisting municipal funding needs and the impact of grant programs. In the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act, Congress extended federal aid for wastewater treatment construction through FY1994, transitioning towards state and local government responsibility for financing. Grants under Title II were authorized through FY1990, with Title VI authorizing grants for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds starting in FY1989. States contribute matching funds, and the revolving loan fund concept allows for repayment and future construction in other communities. The shift from federal grants to loans for wastewater treatment construction has been easier for some communities than others. Cities, especially small towns, are facing challenges in repaying project loans. Congress has provided annual appropriations since the expiration of grants for state loan programs in 1994. Some cities are dealing with overflow discharges of inadequately treated wastes from municipal sewers and the costly remediation projects. In 2000, Congress authorized a $1.5 billion grant program to help cities reduce wet weather flows, but the authorization expired in FY2003. The Clean Water Act emphasizes that all discharges into the nation's waters are unlawful without a permit. More than 65,000 industrial and municipal dischargers must obtain permits from EPA for discharges into the nation's waters. NPDES permits also required for stormwater discharges. Permits specify technology-based effluent limits, control technology, effluent limitations, and compliance deadlines. Permits are issued for five-year periods and must be renewed for continued discharge. The NPDES permit includes effluent limitations for conventional and toxic pollutants, as well as water quality criteria for over 115 pollutants. Separate permits are needed for dredge or fill material disposal in waters, including wetlands. The Section 404 permit program, authorized by the Clean Water Act, allows for the disposal of dredge or fill material in the nation's waters, including wetlands. Some activities are exempt from these permit requirements, and certain states have been delegated permitting responsibility. The wetlands permit program has been a controversial aspect of the law, with developers criticizing federal regulation while environmentalists advocate for more protection of wetlands. Environmentalists advocate for more protection of wetlands and limits on activities in wetlands. Nonpoint sources of pollution, not covered by CWA permits, are managed by state programs. EPA regulations under the CWA include guidelines on sewage sludge and ocean pollutant discharge. NPDES permits enforce effluent limitations. EPA provides guidance on achieving effluent limitations. Compliance orders and civil enforcement are used by EPA. The Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to enforce compliance through civil and criminal penalties, including fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for violations. EPA, in collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers, also enforces against activities that impact wetlands. The Clean Water Act authorizes EPA and states to enforce compliance through civil and criminal penalties for activities impacting wetlands. States issue permits to dischargers and handle most enforcement actions due to federal resource limitations. EPA oversees state enforcement and can intervene if necessary. Individuals can also bring citizen suits against violators of effluent standards in U.S. district court. The Ocean Dumping Act allows for citizen suits against the EPA or state officials for failing to carry out duties. It regulates intentional ocean disposal and authorizes research. The Act contains permit and enforcement provisions for ocean dumping, as well as provisions for general and ocean disposal research. It also establishes a regional marine research program and addresses coastal water quality monitoring. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) authorizes the establishment of marine sanctuaries and regulates disposal of wastes in U.S. marine waters. International treaties and conventions have evolved to address marine pollution issues globally. The MPRSA utilizes a comprehensive waste management system to control dumping of materials into ocean waters. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) regulates disposal of wastes in U.S. marine waters. New authorities added since 1972 include research responsibilities for EPA, phasing out harmful sewage sludges and industrial wastes, banning ocean disposal by 1991, Long Island Sound inclusion, and medical waste provisions. Funding expired in 1997 but Congress continues to appropriate funds. Four federal agencies have responsibilities under the act. The Ocean Dumping Act assigns responsibilities to four federal agencies: EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, and the Coast Guard. EPA regulates ocean disposal, except for dredged spoils under the Corps of Engineers. NOAA conducts research on human-induced changes to the marine environment, while EPA focuses on phasing out sewage sludge and industrial waste dumping. The Coast Guard monitors ocean dumping activities. The MPRSA prohibits ocean dumping without permits in U.S. waters, banning radiological, chemical, and biological warfare agents. The Ocean Dumping Act prohibits dumping of radiological, chemical, and biological warfare agents, high-level radioactive waste, and medical wastes. EPA can issue permits for dumping other materials, excluding dredge spoils, after public hearings. The law regulates ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the U.S. baseline and transportation of material by U.S.-flagged vessels. EPA designates dumping sites and specifies disposal locations in permits. Annual reports on ocean dumping permits were prepared by EPA until 2010. Congress amended the act in 1977 to require permits for dumping municipal sewage sludge or industrial wastes. In 1986, Congress directed ocean disposal of all wastes to cease at the 12-mile site off the New York/New Jersey coast and be moved to a new site 106 miles offshore. In 1988, Congress enacted laws amending the Ocean Dumping Act to phase out sewage sludge and industrial waste disposal in the ocean. In 1992, Congress amended the act to allow states to adopt stricter ocean dumping standards and require permits to conform with long-term management plans for marine dumpsites. The Corps of Engineers issues permits for ocean dumping of dredged material, primarily from maintenance dredging, totaling 70 million cubic yards annually. EPA ensures ocean disposal of dredge spoils does not harm the environment, with permits based on established criteria. The EPA plays a crucial role in permitting ocean dumping of dredged material, with the authority to impose conditions or deny permits to prevent environmental harm. Permits specify material type, amount, dumpsite location, validity period, and surveillance provisions. The EPA can also assess civil penalties for permit violations. The EPA can assess civil penalties of up to $50,000 for each violation of a permit or permit requirement, considering factors like gravity of the violation and prior violations. Criminal penalties are also authorized for knowing violations of the act, including seizure and forfeiture of vessels. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing laws to prevent unlawful ocean dumping, with penalties for dumping medical wastes reaching up to $125,000 for civil violations and up to $250,000 in criminal penalties. Individuals can bring a citizen suit in U.S. district court against any violator, including the United States. The Clean Water Act allows citizens to sue in U.S. district court for violations of permits issued under Title I. The Ocean Dumping Act and CWA regulate discharges into navigable waters, with EPA standards preempting conflicts. States can regulate ocean dumping within their jurisdiction, and the EPA must apply international standards. The 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution prohibits dumping of various substances and requires special permits for certain wastes. The MPRSA authorizes research on ocean resources and phasing out ocean disposal activities. NOAA conducts long-term research on ocean dumping, pollution, and overfishing. NOAA and EPA conduct research on the effects of ocean dumping, pollution, overfishing, and other human-induced changes on the marine ecosystem. EPA focuses on minimizing sewage sludge and industrial waste dumping, while also studying technological options for removing heavy metals and organic materials. Title IV of the MPRSA established regional marine research boards to develop comprehensive marine research plans. Title V of the MPRSA established a national coastal water quality monitoring program, directing EPA and NOAA to collect and analyze scientific data on coastal ecosystems. The program aims to provide information for effective programs under the Clean Water Act and Coastal Zone Management Act. The Safe Drinking Water Act is the key federal law for protecting public water supplies from harmful contaminants. The Safe Drinking Water Act, enacted in 1974 and amended in 1986 and 1996, establishes standards for public water supplies, controls waste injection, funds infrastructure projects, and protects drinking water sources. States can be delegated implementation authority, with the PWSS Program regulating water systems. Amendments have been made since 1974, addressing water quality issues. The 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act revealed widespread water quality problems and health risks due to poor management of public water supplies. The 1986 amendments aimed to increase EPA's regulation pace, requiring regulations for specified contaminants and disinfection/filtration of water supplies. Lead pipes and solder were banned in new installations. The 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act aimed to increase EPA's regulation pace by requiring regulations for specified contaminants, banning lead pipes and solder in new installations, establishing wellhead protection programs, and issuing rules for monitoring injection wells. The Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988 added provisions to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water. The 1996 SDWA Amendments (P.L. 104-182) made significant changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act, aiming to target resources to address health risks, provide regulatory flexibility, fund federal mandates, and improve compliance capacity. These amendments removed the requirement for EPA to regulate 25 new contaminants every three years, introduced a risk-based approach for selecting contaminants, added flexibility to the standard-setting process, required health risk reduction and cost analyses for new standards, and established a state revolving loan fund program to help water systems meet SDWA requirements. The 1996 SDWA Amendments (P.L. 104-182) made significant changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act, including adding programs to improve small system compliance, expanding consumer information requirements, focusing on pollution prevention, and extending authorizations for appropriations. In 2002, drinking water security provisions were added through the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-188), requiring vulnerability assessments and emergency preparedness plans for community water systems serving more than 3,300 individuals. EPA was also mandated to conduct research on preventing and responding to terrorist attacks. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requires EPA to establish regulations for contaminants in public water supplies. EPA must select contaminants based on occurrence and health effects, issuing regulations for about 90 contaminants. Every five years, EPA publishes a list of contaminants for potential regulation. The Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to publish a list of contaminants for potential regulation every five years. EPA must evaluate contaminants of greatest health concern and set non-enforceable maximum contaminant level goals for regulation. EPA then sets enforceable maximum contaminant levels using best technology feasible. The Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to evaluate contaminants for regulation every five years, setting non-enforceable maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG) and enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCL) using feasible technology. EPA must consider affordability for large communities and small public water systems, listing compliant technologies for small systems and variance options if MCL cannot be met. EPA must also assess if the benefits of a regulation justify the costs before proposing it. The Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to evaluate contaminants for regulation every five years, setting non-enforceable maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG) and enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCL) using feasible technology. EPA must consider affordability for large communities and small public water systems, listing compliant technologies for small systems and variance options if MCL cannot be met. EPA must also assess if the benefits of a regulation justify the costs before proposing it. New SDWA regulations generally become effective three years after promulgation, with up to two additional years allowed for capital improvements. Section 1448 outlines procedures for judicial review of EPA actions involving the establishment of SDWA regulations and other final EPA actions. EPA is required to use the best available, peer-reviewed science and supporting studies when developing regulations. The EPA must consider risks, uncertainties, and studies in proposing drinking water regulations. An interim standard can be promulgated without a benefit-cost analysis if a contaminant poses an urgent threat to public health. The SDWA includes provisions for variances and exemptions to help systems, especially smaller ones, comply with regulations. States can grant variances if raw water quality prevents meeting a standard despite using the best technology, as long as it does not pose an unreasonable health risk. Small systems can also receive variances based on specific criteria. (Subsection 1415(e)) authorizes variances for small systems based on best affordable technology. EPA must identify variance technologies for small systems unable to afford standard compliance. States can grant variances to systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons if compliance is unaffordable and public health is protected. Systems serving 3,301 to 10,000 persons can receive variances with EPA approval. Variance technology installation is required for small system variances. The curr_chunk discusses the process of granting exemptions to public water systems from standards or treatment techniques for compelling reasons, such as cost constraints. These exemptions provide additional time for compliance without posing unreasonable health risks. States can assume primary oversight (primacy) for water systems by meeting specific requirements. Currently, 55 out of 57 states have assumed primacy. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes funding for EPA grants to states to supervise public water systems, ensuring compliance with standards. States review monitoring data to assess system compliance, with EPA monitoring primarily through state violation data. EPA notifies states and systems of non-compliance. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes EPA to enforce compliance with regulations for public water systems. If a state fails to take enforcement action within 30 days, EPA can issue an administrative order or civil action. The 1996 amendments strengthened enforcement authorities, streamlined the process for federal orders, and required states to have penalty authority. No enforcement action can be taken against a system with a consolidation plan. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes EPA to enforce compliance with regulations for public water systems, including notifying customers of violations and providing annual consumer confidence reports on contaminants detected in drinking water. States must prepare annual compliance reports, and citizens can bring civil actions against violators. The 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act added state-administered programs for operator certification and capacity development to improve public water system compliance with regulations. States are required to adopt training and certification programs for operators and establish capacity development programs based on EPA guidance. EPA can withhold 20% of a state's revolving fund grant if these programs are not implemented. The Safe Drinking Water Act amendments in 1996 added state-administered programs for operator certification and capacity development to improve public water system compliance with regulations. These programs must include legal authority to ensure new systems meet requirements and assist existing systems in compliance. EPA can withhold a portion of grants from states without capacity development strategies. Part C of the act focuses on ground water protection, with Section 1421 authorizing state underground injection control programs. EPA issued regulations in 1977 for underground injection of wastes into disposal wells, requiring state permits. The Safe Drinking Water Act amendments in 1996 added state-administered programs for operator certification and capacity development to improve public water system compliance with regulations. Section 1421 authorized state underground injection control programs for the underground injection of brine from oil and gas production. States with UIC programs can assume primary enforcement responsibility, and EPA can implement the program if a state's plan is not approved. Section 1424(e) allows EPA to determine if an aquifer is the sole or principal drinking water source for an area. Section 1427 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, added in 1986, established procedures for demonstration programs to protect critical aquifer areas designated as sole source aquifers. Section 1428, also added in 1986, created a state program for safeguarding wellhead areas around public water system wells. Section 1429, added in 1996, allows EPA to provide 50% grants to states for developing comprehensive ground water protection programs. In 1996, Congress expanded the Safe Drinking Water Act to include surface water protection in addition to ground water. Section 1453 required EPA to provide guidance for states to implement source water assessment programs, while Section 1454 authorized a source water petition program for voluntary partnerships between state and local governments. States with approved assessment programs may adopt alternative monitoring requirements for community water systems. States may establish a program for community water systems to request assistance in developing a voluntary source water quality protection partnership to reduce contaminants in drinking water, receive financial or technical aid, and create a long-term protection strategy. Congress authorized grants for this program until FY2003. Additionally, a drinking water state revolving loan fund program was established in 1996 to help systems comply with SDWA regulations. EPA can provide grants to states for this fund, which can then be used to offer loans to public water systems. States must match 20% of the funds. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) allows states to make loans to public water systems, with a 20% federal grant match requirement. Grants are distributed based on needs surveys, ensuring each state and DC receive a minimum of 1% of funds. States can transfer funds between the DWSRF and Clean Water Act SRF. DWSRFs can provide loans for compliance and health protection projects. 15% of funds must assist systems serving 10,000 or fewer people, and up to 30% can be used for loan subsidies. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) allows states to use up to 30% of their grant for loan subsidies to help economically disadvantaged communities. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to address threats to drinking water security, requiring vulnerability assessments for community water systems serving more than 3,300 individuals. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to require vulnerability assessments for community water systems serving more than 3,300 individuals. Section 1433 exempts the contents of the assessments from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and mandates penalties for inappropriate disclosure. Community water systems must complete vulnerability assessments by June 30, 2004, and prepare emergency response plans based on the assessment results. EPA provides guidance to smaller systems on compliance. The Bioterrorism Act of 2002 required EPA to provide guidance and financial assistance to community water systems for vulnerability assessments, emergency response plans, and security enhancements. It also directed EPA to review methods to prevent disruptions to safe water supplies and provide alternative drinking water sources. The Bioterrorism Act of 2002 authorized $15 million for FY2002 and necessary funds for FY2003-FY2005 for EPA to address threats to public water supplies. The Administrator has emergency powers to act in case of a contaminant threat or terrorist attack. Section 1432 imposes penalties for tampering with public water systems. The Bioterrorism Act increased criminal and civil penalties for tampering with public water supplies. Maximum prison sentences for tampering, attempting to tamper, or making threats were increased. EPA is authorized to provide technical assistance and grants for emergency situations. Section 1417 prohibits the use of certain materials in water systems. Section 1417 of the Bioterrorism Act prohibits the use of non-lead free materials in public water systems and plumbing. It also restricts the sale of non-lead free pipes, fittings, and fixtures, as well as solder and flux. EPA was directed to set health-based standards for lead leaching from plumbing fittings and fixtures. The Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act amended Section 1417 to add new exemptions. The Water Act (P.L. 111-380) amended Section 1417 to add exemptions from prohibitions on lead pipes, solder, and flux, and revised the definition of \"lead-free.\" It reduced the allowable level of lead in products in contact with drinking water to 0.25%, making federal law align with state laws and industry standards. The amendments became effective on January 4, 2014. The Water Act amended Section 1417 to add exemptions for certain plumbing products and revised the definition of \"lead-free\" to limit lead content. It also authorized the EPA to conduct research on water contaminants and provide technical assistance to states and municipalities. Section 1444 authorizes grants for new technologies in safe drinking water and investigating health implications of waste water reclamation/reuse. Section 1445 requires compliance with monitoring and reporting regulations under the SDWA. Section 1445(b) authorizes the Administrator or a representative to inspect water suppliers' properties to ensure compliance with the act, with civil penalties for non-compliance. EPA must establish monitoring criteria for unregulated contaminants, with a list of contaminants to be monitored every five years. States can develop monitoring plans for small systems, with grants available for monitoring costs. Section 1446 established a National Drinking Water Advisory Council with 15 members to advise the Administrator on activities and policies. Section 1447 requires federal agencies to comply with drinking water requirements for federally owned systems. The President can grant exemptions for facilities if in the country's interest. Section 1456 authorized grants for monitoring small systems. Section 1456 authorized grants to Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas for colonias with health risks from lack of drinking water access. Congress allocated $25 million annually from 1997 to 1999. Section 1457 allowed EPA to test estrogenic substances in drinking water. Section 1458 directed EPA to study at-risk subpopulations and biological mechanisms. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) established federal regulations for solid and hazardous waste management, amending earlier legislation. It defines waste types, sets standards for facilities, and authorizes EPA to regulate hazardous waste treatment. Last reauthorized in 1984, RCRA includes a permit program for waste facilities and criteria for municipal solid waste disposal. EPA conducts studies for specific regulations, including disinfectants and Cryptosporidium. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 set deadlines for permit issuance, prohibited land disposal of hazardous waste without treatment, and established criteria for municipal solid waste landfills. The Resource Recovery Act of 1970 shifted focus to reclaiming energy and materials from solid waste. Funding for EPA programs in this area has continued despite the authorization for appropriations expiring in 1988. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 authorized grants for new resource recovery technology and required annual reports on recycling and waste reduction. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 aimed to prevent future cleanup issues by prohibiting untreated hazardous waste disposal and implementing closure deadlines for non-compliant facilities. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 focused on grants for resource recovery technology and required recycling reports. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 aimed to prevent future cleanup issues by prohibiting untreated hazardous waste disposal and setting closure deadlines for non-compliant facilities. The management of solid waste is regulated based on whether it is hazardous or non-hazardous, with hazardous waste being regulated at the federal level and non-hazardous waste being primarily managed by individual states. Hazardous waste is determined by the EPA based on certain characteristics or specific listings. If a waste is deemed hazardous, it falls under the regulations of RCRA Subtitle C, allowing EPA to regulate its management from generation to disposal. This \"cradle to grave\" approach includes standards for generators and transporters of hazardous waste. EPA was directed to establish standards for hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment facilities under RCRA Subtitle C. This includes regulations for record keeping, waste accumulation, storage, and operating standards for treatment facilities. EPA also coordinated transporter standards with the Department of Transportation. Subtitle C of RCRA establishes standards for the disposal of hazardous waste, requiring treatment before land disposal and cleanup of any releases to protect human health and the environment. TSDFs must demonstrate financial assurance for closure, post-closure care, and liability, operating under a permit with EPA standards. EPA implements hazardous waste program with states authorized to implement their own programs. States must meet federal standards, and EPA oversees state programs. EPA reviews state programs for compliance with new regulations. Many states also implement individual RCRA program elements. The EPA enforces RCRA regulations with criminal fines up to $50,000 per day for violations. Civil penalties can reach $25,000 per day, and imprisonment can be up to 15 years for endangering human life. State agencies also enforce RCRA regulations. RCRA is enforced by state agencies with authority equivalent to the federal level. EPA can enforce in authorized states but must notify the state before taking action. Citizen suits can be filed against violators or EPA for failing to act. Solid wastes not classified as hazardous are regulated under Subtitle D, with EPA's authority limited compared to Subtitle C. Under Subtitle D, state and local governments are primarily responsible for managing non-hazardous solid waste. EPA established national standards to prevent adverse health and environmental effects from solid waste disposal. States and citizens can enforce regulations against open dumping, as EPA lacks direct enforcement authority. Under HSWA, EPA was required to revise its criteria for evaluating solid waste management practices and facilities conducting open dumping. Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills were established, applying to landfills receiving household waste. EPA may intervene if waste disposal practices pose a threat to human health or the environment. Under HSWA, EPA revised criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills, applying to landfills receiving household waste. Requirements include location restrictions, design criteria, groundwater monitoring, closure, and financial assurance. States were directed to implement a permit program to ensure compliance with landfill criteria. EPA could intervene if waste disposal practices posed a threat. EPA also had inspection and enforcement authority for states with inadequate permit programs. Under the EPA's permit program, enforcement authority was granted to regulate open dumping under Subtitle C. MSW landfills have specific requirements, while non-hazardous commercial or industrial waste landfills are subject to state-level regulations. Financial and technical assistance for solid waste provisions under Subtitle D were cut in FY1981. Open dumping prohibitions are enforced by states or through citizen suits under RCRA. Under Section 7003 of RCRA, EPA can take action against waste generators or disposal facility owners for violating permits, regulations, or causing endangerment to health or the environment. This provision allows EPA to initiate judicial or administrative actions in situations where other enforcement tools may not apply. Under Section 7003 of RCRA, EPA can take action if conditions pose an imminent endangerment to health or the environment due to handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of solid or hazardous waste. EPA has the authority to address leaking underground storage tanks on a case-by-case basis and obtain relevant information to mitigate potential endangerments. To address leaking underground storage tanks, Congress established a program through the 1984 RCRA amendments and the 1986 SARA. The program regulates USTs containing petroleum and hazardous chemicals to prevent corrosion and structural defects, minimize leaks, and set operating requirements and technical standards for tank design, installation, leak detection, spill control, corrective action, and closure. Administered by states, it requires tank registration, bans unprotected tanks, sets federal technical standards, coordinates federal and state efforts, and allows for federal inspection and enforcement. In 1986, Congress created a petroleum UST response program through SARA, allowing the federal government to respond to petroleum spills and leaks. The program established a Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund funded by a federal tax on motor fuels to clean up leaks from petroleum USTs when owners/operators do not take action. The fund supports EPA administration, state oversight, enforcement actions, and cleanups. The 1986 amendments established financial responsibility requirements for UST owners and operators to cover costs of corrective action and compensate for damages caused by leaking tanks. Regulations require insurance coverage of $1 million or reliance on state assurance funds. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included new leak prevention and enforcement provisions for USTs. The USTCA of 2005 added new provisions to the UST regulatory program, requiring compliance inspections every three years, prohibiting fuel delivery to ineligible tanks, developing training requirements for operators, and implementing groundwater protection measures. It also authorized $155 million annually for states to implement leak prevention requirements and administer state programs. EPA was directed to address UST releases on tribal lands. The USTCA of 2005 added provisions for UST regulatory program compliance inspections, fuel delivery restrictions, operator training, and groundwater protection. It authorized $155 million annually for leak prevention and state programs. Congress also allocated $200 million annually for EPA and states to address LUST corrective actions and releases involving MTBE and oxygenated fuels. RCRA focuses on waste management rather than recycling, leaving recycling decisions to states and local governments. Funding for recycling projects is provided for research and development. Currently, there are limited solid waste grants available for projects promoting waste reduction, recycled-content products, and markets for recycled materials. The RCRA also aims to stimulate markets for recycled products through a federal procurement program, requiring federal agencies to \"buy recycled\" products with the highest recovered material content level practicable. EPA provides guidelines to assist agencies in meeting these requirements. The RCRA has been amended multiple times, with some amendments clarifying the law and encouraging recycling of solid waste. The Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980 aimed to strengthen EPA enforcement against illegal hazardous waste dumping and authorized funds for hazardous waste site inventory. Amendments in 1980 also established an Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and excluded certain large-volume wastes. The 1980 amendments to the RCRA excluded large-volume wastes like coal combustion waste, ore processing waste, cement kiln dust, and oil/gas exploration waste from hazardous waste regulation under Subtitle C. These \"special wastes\" were considered less risky and required EPA studies before exclusion. The regulation of special wastes, including coal combustion waste, has been a complex process largely at the state level. However, a spill in 2008 raised concerns about national standards under RCRA. In 2010, the EPA proposed two options to manage coal combustion waste, one under Subtitle C for hazardous waste regulation and the other under Subtitle D for solid waste management requirements. The EPA proposed regulations for coal combustion waste disposal under Subtitle D of RCRA, relying on states or citizen suits for enforcement. The Used Oil Recycling Act of 1980 required EPA to develop management standards for used oil to protect human health and the environment. EPA's final rule issuance date is unknown. The EPA's used oil program encourages recycling by assuming all generated used oil will be recycled, simplifying management by only requiring compliance with used oil regulations. Hazardous waste regulations come into play only when used oil is disposed of. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 introduced detailed technical requirements to RCRA. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 introduced new regulatory programs for underground storage tanks and hazardous waste facilities, including inspections and permit requirements. EPA was directed to issue regulations for fuels produced from hazardous waste, and federal agencies had to submit inventories of hazardous waste facilities they owned. EPA was also given a timetable for issuing permits for TSDFs and required permits to be for fixed terms not exceeding 10 years. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 introduced new regulatory programs for underground storage tanks and hazardous waste facilities. Permits were required for fixed terms not exceeding 10 years, and EPA was authorized to issue experimental permits for facilities with new technologies. Enforcement powers were increased, penalties were raised, and citizen suit provisions were expanded. Other provisions included prohibiting the export of hazardous waste without consent, creating an ombudsman's office for complaints, and reauthorizing RCRA through FY1988 at $250 million per year. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 introduced new regulatory programs for underground storage tanks and hazardous waste facilities, including permits for fixed terms and increased enforcement powers. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) was reauthorized through FY1988 at $250 million per year. The amendments also called for owners or operators of facilities to investigate and clean up releases, established RCRA Corrective Action, and proposed a National Ground Water Commission, which was never funded. The Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992 specified federal facilities' enforcement under RCRA and waived sovereign immunity for prosecution. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) allows federal departments and agencies to be subject to enforcement through injunctions, administrative orders, and penalties for noncompliance. Federal employees may face criminal sanctions for violations of solid or hazardous waste laws. Special provisions apply to mixtures of radioactive and hazardous waste at Department of Energy facilities, as well as to munitions, military ships, and military sewage treatment facilities handling hazardous wastes. The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act exempts hazardous waste from RCRA regulation under certain conditions. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act (P.L. 112-195) requires EPA to develop an electronic manifest system to track the shipment, transportation, and receipt of hazardous waste. This act added a new section to RCRA and authorized appropriations of $2 million. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act (P.L. 112-195) added a new Section 3024 to Subtitle C of RCRA and authorized $2 million annually for start-up activities. User fees from hazardous waste generators, transporters, and facility owners would fund the system. Congress has also enacted solid/hazardous waste-related measures, including the Sanitary Food Transportation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-500) regulating trucks and rail cars hauling food and solid waste. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 mandated stronger federal standards for solid waste incinerators, requiring EPA to issue new performance standards for controlling air emissions. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 established regulations for record keeping, decontamination procedures, and materials for construction of tank trucks and cargo tanks. EPA rules must be followed by new facilities within six months and existing units within five years of issuance. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 declared pollution prevention as national policy, directing EPA to focus on preventing pollutants rather than controlling them after creation. It authorized matching grants for states to establish technical assistance programs for businesses and required industry to report on source reduction and recycling efforts annually. EPA also established a Source Reduction Clearinghouse to disseminate information. The Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-399) mandated the Indian Health Service (IHS) to support closing open dumps on Indian lands. Only two out of over 600 waste dumps met EPA regulations before the law. The 104th Congress passed legislation (P.L. 104-142) exempting battery collection and recycling programs from certain hazardous waste management requirements, promoting proper disposal and recycling. This aimed to stimulate new recycling programs. In the late 1970s, the discovery of severely contaminated sites led to the enactment of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to clean up contaminated sites and hold responsible parties financially liable. The Superfund program was created to carry out these authorities under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) established a liability scheme holding owners and operators responsible for cleanup costs. If responsible parties cannot be found or pay, the federal government can finance the cleanup, known as \"orphan shares.\" EPA administers the program, including a grant program for brownfields redevelopment. The liability scheme of CERCLA holds parties accountable for environmental contamination, with \"orphan shares\" funded by the federal government. The Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund finances cleanup at sites where responsible parties are unable to pay. The fund was initially financed by industry taxes and Treasury revenues, but the authority to collect industry taxes expired in 1995. The Superfund Trust Fund, initially funded by industry taxes and Treasury revenues, had its authority expire in 1995. Congress increased general Treasury contributions to make up for the shortfall. Cleanup of federal facilities is not funded by the Superfund Trust Fund but by other federal monies allocated for specific programs. The Department of Defense and the Department of Energy oversee most contaminated federal facility cleanups, while EPA and states enforce CERCLA implementation. CERCLA directs EPA to establish a National Priorities List (NPL) of contaminated sites, prioritizing cleanup actions. Potentially responsible parties may be required to clean up sites or EPA may use Superfund monies and later recover costs. Federal facility cleanups are funded separately from the Superfund Trust Fund. The Superfund Trust Fund may be used to pay for cleanup costs at sites where responsible parties cannot pay or be found. CERCLA outlines cleanup authorities and financial liability for cleanup actions. Enforcement against responsible parties aims to minimize the need for federal tax revenues to finance cleanup efforts. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) outlines cleanup authorities and financial liability for cleanup actions. Specific cleanup requirements for contaminants at individual sites are determined on a site-by-site basis, with more detailed guidance provided by the EPA. Other federal agencies administer cleanup of federal facilities under CERCLA. Federal agencies administering cleanup of federal facilities under CERCLA have developed additional guidance documents specific to their facilities. Congress has made amendments to CERCLA to clarify cleanup authorities, provide liability relief for certain parties, and authorize federal assistance for brownfields properties. Amendments have also addressed unique cleanup challenges at federal facilities. Certain amendments have addressed unique cleanup challenges at federal facilities, such as the cleanup of unexploded ordnance on decommissioned military training ranges in the United States, and responsibility for the cleanup of contaminated federal property when it is transferred out of federal ownership. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 clarified that federal facilities are subject to the cleanup requirements of CERCLA to the same extent as non-federal entities, and established a separate Defense Environmental Restoration Program within DOD to address contamination at active and decommissioned military facilities in the United States. Sections 311 and 312 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 expanded the cleanup efforts. The Superfund program's cleanup authorities were expanded by various legislative acts, including the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Despite reauthorizing legislation being introduced, the taxing authority for the Superfund Trust Fund has not been renewed, and funding for the program now primarily comes from general Treasury revenues through annual appropriations by Congress. The Defense Environmental Restoration Program is funded through annual appropriations by Congress, with some funding coming from the sale or lease of closed military bases. Legislation such as the Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act and the National Defense Authorization Act have amended CERCLA to facilitate the transfer and cleanup of contaminated federal properties. Assurances are provided to guarantee property cleanup for intended use after transfer. Amendments have addressed fairness of CERCLA liability scheme by limiting or eliminating liability for certain parties. Acts like the Asset Conservation Act and Superfund Recycling Equity Act have protected fiduciaries, lenders, and exempted generators and transporters of recyclable materials from cleanup liability under CERCLA. This was to prevent liability from being a deterrent to recycling. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 provided relief from cleanup liability for certain parties under CERCLA, including those who contributed small quantities of waste, owners of contaminated property due to migration, and bona fide prospective purchasers. The act also established criteria for exempting innocent owners of contaminated property from cleanup liability. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 provided relief from cleanup liability for certain parties under CERCLA. Exemptions are available for bona fide prospective purchasers, contiguous property owners, and innocent landowners who have conducted appropriate due diligence before acquiring the property. These parties are still responsible for preventing environmental contamination on their properties. The act also authorized federal grants to assist in the cleanup of brownfields properties, which are abandoned or underutilized sites with known or suspected contamination. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 provided relief from cleanup liability for certain parties under CERCLA, including bona fide prospective purchasers, contiguous property owners, and innocent landowners. This act also authorized federal grants to assist in the cleanup of brownfields properties, which are abandoned or underutilized sites with known or suspected contamination. EPA established a program in 1993 to provide federal assistance for the cleanup of brownfields properties, with CERCLA as the legal basis for this assistance. P.L. 107-118 provided explicit statutory authority for this purpose and established a separate Brownfields grant program within EPA. Section 104(a) of CERCLA authorizes the President to respond to hazardous substance releases posing imminent danger to public health. Response authorities are delegated to EPA and other federal agencies. EPA handles inland zone releases, while the U.S. Coast Guard manages coastal zone releases. Federal facilities can take response actions with oversight from EPA and state authorities. Federal funding is available for response actions under CERCLA. Federal funding for response actions under CERCLA is subject to appropriations by Congress. Notification of a hazardous substance release triggers a federal response. The responsible party must notify the National Response Center if the release exceeds the regulatory limit. Reportable quantities are specified in federal regulations. State, local officials, or the public can also report incidents. The National Response Center notifies the appropriate federal agency for response and enforcement actions. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) authorizes federal enforcement actions for environmental contamination cleanup, including containment, removal, or treatment to prevent harmful exposure. Certain types of contamination are excluded from CERCLA's authority and may be addressed under other federal laws. Congress has set limitations on response actions for hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. The response authorities of CERCLA do not cover releases of petroleum, which are excluded from the definition of \"hazardous substance\" and \"pollutant or contaminant.\" Instead, petroleum releases are addressed by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Oil Pollution Act, rooted in the Clean Water Act, authorizes federal actions to respond to petroleum releases into navigable waters. EPA leads cleanup for inland spills, while the U.S. Coast Guard leads coastal spills. The Solid Waste Disposal Act provides federal response authorities for petroleum leaked from underground tanks. CERCLA is applied to wastes containing petroleum only if they also contain hazardous substances. Certain releases are excluded from CERCLA's reach. The Clean Water Act's Oil Pollution Act and the Solid Waste Disposal Act provide federal response authorities for petroleum releases. CERCLA generally applies to the release of radionuclides, excluding specific nuclear materials. EPA has designated several hundred radionuclides as hazardous substances subject to CERCLA. Certain types of releases are excluded from CERCLA's response authorities. CERCLA limits response actions to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants in specific situations, excluding naturally occurring substances, releases from products in structures, or releases into drinking water supplies. However, response actions can be authorized in emergencies declared by the President if no other party can respond promptly. The President delegates the task of developing a National Priorities List (NPL) of hazardous sites to the EPA, updated annually using the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) to prioritize response actions based on various factors. Contamination severity alone may not be enough to list a site on the NPL. The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) is used by the EPA to prioritize response actions for hazardous sites, but contamination severity alone may not be sufficient for placement on the National Priorities List (NPL). CERCLA mandates the development of a National Hazardous Substance Response Plan to establish procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. The plan is incorporated into the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) by the President, with EPA regulating response actions under CERCLA through removal and remedial actions. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) allows for removal and remedial actions to address contamination, with remedial actions being financed with Superfund monies only at sites listed on the National Priorities List (NPL). Removal actions can be financed with Superfund monies at non-NPL sites for emergency situations. This funding restriction is based on the statutory requirement of CERCLA to prioritize contaminated sites for remedial actions at NPL sites presenting the greatest risks. The EPA prioritizes contaminated sites for remedial actions under CERCLA Section 105(a). Remedial actions are long-term solutions that involve extensive and costly measures, requiring a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for review. Public participation is required for remedial actions under CERCLA Section 117. Removal actions, on the other hand, address immediate risks and do not undergo the same level of review or public comment. Removal actions funded by Superfund have timing and cost restrictions, but exceptions exist for certain situations. These limitations ensure removal actions are not used to avoid the more thorough review required for remedial actions. However, removal actions funded by responsible parties or federal agencies are not subject to these restrictions. The limitations on timing and cost for removal actions funded by Superfund do not apply to removal actions at federal facilities administered by the Department of Defense and Department of Energy. States must agree to share costs for remedial actions at non-federal NPL sites, but not for federal facilities funded by the agencies that administer them. The cost-sharing requirement in CERCLA Section 104(c)(3) aims to reduce the financial burden on federal taxpayers by having states share the costs of orphan shares of cleanup costs. States are not required to share costs for removal actions, which can be fully financed by federal Superfund monies. States must provide financial assurances in a contract or agreement with the federal government to share costs for remedial actions at non-federal NPL sites. The state must agree to share costs for remedial actions at non-federal NPL sites to access federal Superfund monies. The state's obligation includes paying a percentage of the costs and performing future maintenance of the remedial actions. Maintenance responsibilities can be delayed for groundwater or surface water remedies for up to 10 years. 104(c)(6) allows states to delay maintenance responsibilities for the first 10 years of remedial actions to reduce costs. During this period, federal Superfund monies can cover maintenance costs for groundwater or surface water remedies. CERCLA requires response actions to protect human health and the environment, emphasizing cost-effectiveness and preference for actions involving permanent treatment. The preference for remedial actions involves treatment to reduce contamination significantly. Actions not involving treatment may entail on-site waste containment or off-site waste removal. On-site waste containment could pose risks if the method fails over time. Section 121 requires periodic review of remedial actions to ensure continued protection of human health and the environment. Additional actions may be taken if needed to achieve cleanup goals. Section 121 of CERCLA governs the selection of remedial actions for cleanup, but does not specify the level of cleanliness required for individual sites. Cleanup decisions are made based on factors like potential human exposure, land use, and feasibility of cleanup alternatives. The required level of cleanup varies depending on contaminants, standards, and response actions. CERCLA requires cleanup to comply with applicable standards to protect human health and the environment. It serves as an umbrella statute allowing other regulations to be applied. Waivers can be granted for specific standards under certain conditions. CERCLA requires cleanup to comply with applicable standards to protect human health and the environment. Remedial actions must achieve Maximum Contaminant Levels for drinking water and be consistent with water quality criteria. The Clean Water Act requires water quality criteria to be consistent with established standards. States have a role in cleanup processes and must share costs at non-federal sites. However, states have limited involvement in cleanup decisions at federal facilities. CERCLA allows states to challenge federal agency decisions on cleanup at facilities, requiring substantial evidence. The public can comment on remedial actions, similar to other federal laws. EPA must provide opportunities for public input on proposed actions and notify the public of final decisions. The EPA provides opportunities for public input on proposed cleanup actions under CERCLA. Public comments are considered for remedial actions, not removal actions, which are expedited to address immediate risks. Technical assistance grants are available to affected communities for understanding cleanup decisions. The ATSDR was established under CERCLA. The ATSDR, established under CERCLA, assesses health risks at NPL sites by evaluating human exposure to contamination through various pathways. Its assessments inform the public of potential health hazards and aid decision-makers in evaluating cleanup actions to prevent harmful exposure. The agency prepares toxicological profiles of hazardous substances commonly found at NPL sites to identify health effects from exposure. The ATSDR, authorized under CERCLA, assesses health risks at NPL sites and provides medical care during public health emergencies caused by toxic substances. The agency focuses on educating the public about health risks and assessing potential risks from exposure to hazardous substances. Section 107 of CERCLA identifies potentially responsible parties liable for cleanup costs and damages from hazardous substance releases. It discusses liability categories, defenses, and limitations for parties involved. Section 107(a) of CERCLA outlines four categories of potentially responsible parties liable for costs associated with hazardous substance releases. This includes current owners or operators of facilities where releases occurred, past owners or operators at the time of disposal, generators of waste, and those involved in the transport or disposal of hazardous substances. Financial responsibility for cleanup costs may extend to actions beyond these parties. Financial responsibility for cleanup costs under CERCLA may extend beyond facility boundaries if hazardous substances migrate through the environment. Liability is strict, joint and several, and retroactive, requiring cleanup actions wherever substances travel. This includes land, surface water, groundwater, and ambient air. Courts have interpreted liability broadly based on case law, legislative history, and statutory definitions. Strict liability under CERCLA applies the same standards as the Clean Water Act, allowing parties to be held liable regardless of negligence. Joint and several liability means one or more parties can be responsible for full cleanup costs. Contribution claims can be made in court for cost recovery, with allocation based on equitable factors. Parties can avoid joint and several liability if they can prove their waste did not contribute to contamination. Retroactive liability holds parties accountable for cleanup costs beyond facility boundaries. Retroactive liability under CERCLA holds parties accountable for cleanup costs of hazardous substances released before December 11, 1980. Liability for natural resource damages extends only to releases after CERCLA's enactment. Court decisions have interpreted these liability standards, determining financial responsibility for cleanup costs. Section 107(b) of CERCLA provides defenses to liability for cleanup costs, including acts of God, acts of war, or acts of third parties if due care was exercised. Liability for cleanup costs is determined based on legal issues beyond the scope of this summary. The third party defense under CERCLA allows property owners with no involvement in contamination to claim lack of contractual relationship to avoid liability. Congress has amended provisions to limit liability for parties not directly responsible for contamination. The third party defense under CERCLA allows certain parties, such as response action contractors, state and local governments, fiduciaries, financial lenders, generators and transporters of scrap materials, and those who contributed only small quantities of waste, to avoid liability for contamination they did not cause. CERCLA established the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund to provide funds for the federal government to finance the cleanup of contaminated sites. The fund benefits parties such as innocent landowners, service station dealers disposing of recycled oil, and bona fide prospective purchasers. The Superfund Trust Fund provides funds for the federal government to finance the cleanup of contaminated sites where responsible parties cannot pay. The availability of funds is subject to appropriations by Congress and cost-sharing agreements with states. The special taxing authority to finance the Trust Fund expired in 1995. The Superfund Trust Fund was primarily funded by taxes on petroleum, chemical feedstocks, and corporate income. Revenues from the U.S. Treasury's General Fund also contributed to the trust fund. The Superfund excise taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks were authorized in 1980 and expanded in 1986 to include imported chemical derivatives. The taxes varied in amount, with the petroleum tax at 9.7 cents per barrel and the chemical feedstocks tax ranging from $0.22 to $4.87 per ton. The Superfund Trust Fund was funded by taxes on petroleum, chemical feedstocks, and corporate income. The Superfund tax on corporate income was 0.12% of corporate alternative minimum taxable income in excess of $2 million. The Superfund taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks varied in amount, with the petroleum tax at 9.7 cents per barrel and the chemical feedstocks tax ranging from $0.22 to $4.87 per ton. Congress created these taxes to raise additional revenues for the Superfund Trust Fund. The Superfund tax on corporate income aimed to generate extra revenue from businesses that used or disposed of hazardous substances. Critics questioned the fairness of the tax, arguing that it targeted all businesses meeting the income threshold, regardless of their involvement in hazardous substances. The controversy extended to petroleum companies, as they were excluded from CERCLA cleanup authorities, leading to debates on the appropriateness of the tax on petroleum. Congress established separate trust funds to address petroleum releases. The Superfund taxes expired, and revenues from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury now fund the Superfund Trust Fund. Industry contributes to the fund through corporate income taxes. The General Fund now funds the Superfund Trust Fund, with revenues coming from corporate income taxes, individual income taxes, and miscellaneous federal receipts. Cleanup costs recouped from responsible parties, fines, penalties, and interest also contribute to the trust fund. The federal government enforces cleanup liability under CERCLA through mechanisms like judicial orders, cost-recovery actions, and voluntary settlement agreements with responsible parties. These actions help finance the Superfund Trust Fund, which is primarily funded by general Treasury revenues. The federal government enforces cleanup liability under CERCLA through mechanisms like judicial orders, cost-recovery actions, and voluntary settlement agreements with responsible parties. Enforcement authorities have the discretion to use various mechanisms available under the law to enforce cleanup liability. Typically, agencies negotiate voluntary settlement agreements with responsible parties first before resorting to Section 106 orders or Section 107 cost-recovery actions. When a negotiated settlement seems unlikely, enforcement agencies may resort to Section 106 orders or Section 107 cost-recovery actions. Parties' ability to pay is considered in determining their share of cleanup costs. The decision on a reduced settlement based on ability to pay is not reviewable. Citizens can challenge cleanup actions under Section 310 of CERCLA. Section 310 of CERCLA allows citizens to challenge cleanup actions in court, with limitations on timing. Citizen suits cannot be brought until a cleanup action is completed, and not for removal actions at sites with planned remedial actions. These limitations aim to ensure full implementation of cleanup actions before judicial review. Questions arose post-enactment of CERCLA in 1980 regarding federal facilities' inclusion under the statute's cleanup requirements and liability provisions. Section 120 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 clarified that federal facilities are subject to CERCLA cleanup requirements and liability provisions. Federal agencies are responsible for funding the cleanup of contamination at their facilities, with Congress appropriating the necessary budget. Superfund Trust Fund monies cannot be used for federal facility cleanups, except in specific circumstances outlined in Section 111(e)(3). Section 111(e)(3) allows the use of Superfund Trust Fund monies for alternative water supplies at federal facilities with groundwater contamination beyond their boundaries and involvement of other responsible parties. Most contaminated federal facilities are managed by DOD and DOE, with dedicated appropriations for cleanup. The Defense Environmental Restoration Program under DOD administers the cleanup of active facilities. The Defense Environmental Restoration Program under DOD administers the cleanup of active and decommissioned military installations in the United States. Congress expanded DOD's cleanup authorities to include unexploded ordnance, discarded munitions, and hazardous substances leached from munitions into the environment. DOE established an Office of Environmental Management to consolidate cleanup efforts under CERCLA and other statutory authorities. EPA and states oversee and enforce CERCLA implementation at federal facilities. The EPA and states oversee the cleanup of federal facilities under CERCLA, with EPA taking the lead for facilities on the NPL. States have a prominent role for facilities not on the NPL, but certain provisions limit their authority in directing cleanup actions. EPA has final decision-making authority for selecting remedial actions at NPL-listed federal facilities. The EPA oversees cleanup at federal facilities on the NPL, but lacks authority to direct schedules or long-term maintenance. Enforcement is complicated by limited ability to sue federal agencies. States and local governments have limited decision-making authority in cleanup decisions. These limitations may restrict oversight of federal facility cleanups. Section 120 of CERCLA clarifies that federal facilities must comply with cleanup requirements like other entities, but allows the President to exempt individual facilities for national security reasons. This exemption aims to prevent interference with essential national security activities during cleanup actions. The President can exempt DOD or DOE facilities from specific CERCLA requirements if necessary to protect national security. The President can exempt DOD or DOE facilities from specific CERCLA requirements for national security reasons. The exemption can be renewed annually with notification to Congress. Historically, this exemption has not been invoked at any DOD or DOE facility, which are generally subject to CERCLA cleanup requirements. Disagreements may arise at some facilities regarding applicable cleanup requirements and how to satisfy them. In 1993, EPA established a program to assist communities with cleaning up lower risk sites known as \"brownfields\" to encourage economic redevelopment. The program provided federal financial assistance for properties with contamination that deterred redevelopment. EPA used Superfund appropriations to provide grants and loans for cleanup actions. The Brownfields Act of 2002 amended CERCLA to give EPA explicit authority to administer a separate Brownfields program funded apart from the Superfund program. Congress had previously set aside funding for brownfields cleanup within the Superfund account without amending CERCLA. The Brownfields Act of 2002 authorized separate appropriations for a new program, distinct from the Superfund account, to address contamination resulting from petroleum releases. This program is similar to one established by the EPA in 1993 but allows federal financial assistance for petroleum cleanup. Two types of grants were created within the Brownfields program to provide direct financial assistance. The Brownfields program includes grants for assessment and cleanup of properties, as well as financial assistance to states and tribes for their cleanup programs. Congress has also provided tax incentives to encourage brownfields cleanup. Relevant sections of CERCLA and the Internal Revenue Code are listed in Table 14. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) was enacted in 1986 as part of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act. It established procedures for handling hazardous chemical releases, mandated annual reporting by facilities, and allows EPA to mobilize local officials and citizens for chemical emergency planning. EPA enforces compliance and provides public access to information on toxic chemical releases. Subtitle A of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires local planning for chemical accidents, ensuring officials are aware of hazardous chemicals stored by businesses. Each state must establish a State Emergency Response Commission and local emergency planning committees. EPA lists extremely hazardous substances and sets planning quantities. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires facilities to notify the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) if they store or use any \"extremely hazardous substances\" above a certain threshold quantity. LEPCs work with facilities to develop response procedures, evacuation plans, and training programs for first responders. Facility owners must provide necessary information for emergency planning upon request. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act mandates facilities to report sudden releases of hazardous substances to authorities. Subtitle B outlines reporting requirements for facilities to develop emergency plans and provide public information on chemical exposure. The Occupational Health and Safety Act requires employers to provide employees with material safety data sheets. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires employers to provide employees with access to material safety data sheets (MSDS) for hazardous chemicals. EPCRA Section 311 mandates facilities to submit MSDS or a list of hazardous chemicals to authorities. MSDS must be provided upon request by LEPC or the public. Hazardous chemicals are defined by CFR Title 29 Section 1910.1200(c). EPCRA Section 312 governs reporting requirements for facilities. EPA regulations under EPCRA Section 312 require employers to annually submit an emergency and hazardous chemical inventory form to authorities, providing details on chemical amounts and locations in the facility. Section 313 mandates reporting to the Toxic Release Inventory for toxic chemical releases by manufacturing facilities. EPA can set threshold quantities for reporting. EPA regulations under EPCRA Section 313 require manufacturers to report annually to EPA on the amounts of toxic chemicals released to the environment. The public can access this data in raw or summarized form through written requests or online. Reporting thresholds may be adjusted by EPA for different chemicals or facility categories. EPCRA requires manufacturers to report annually on toxic chemicals released to the environment. Reporting includes details on chemical use, amounts present, treatment methods, and environmental releases. EPA can expand reporting requirements to additional industries beyond manufacturing facilities. EPA promulgated a rule in 1997 to include toxic releases from seven additional industrial categories. EPA has the authority to add or remove chemicals from the list of toxic chemicals for reporting under EPCRA. More than 15 chemicals have been removed, and roughly 350 chemicals have been added to the original list based on specific criteria. EPA can add a chemical if it is known to cause significant adverse health effects or if it is toxic and persistent in the environment. Subtitle C of EPCRA contains provisions related to reporting requirements for chemicals that have significant adverse effects on the environment. Section 322 allows reporting facilities to protect the identity of a chemical if it is a trade secret. Section 323 provides for informing health professionals of withheld chemical identities if needed for medical treatment. Section 324 directs various entities to make emergency response plans and information available to the public. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 requires the EPA to establish an Office of Pollution Prevention, develop a pollution prevention strategy, and require reporting on source reduction and recycling by manufacturing facilities. EPCRA establishes penalties for non-compliance, allows citizens to bring civil action, exempts chemicals in transport, authorizes EPA to issue regulations, and provides definitions and funding authorization. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 requires manufacturing facilities to report annually on source reduction and recycling activities. It marked a shift towards pollution prevention by reducing generation of pollutants at their origin. This change was supported due to the need for cost-effective alternatives and controlling pollution from dispersed sources. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 emphasizes source reduction as the primary method to control pollution from nonpoint sources. It promotes cost-effective strategies such as recycling and waste treatment before resorting to safe disposal of waste residues. Source reduction offers industry savings in raw materials, pollution control costs, and liability costs while reducing risks to workers and the environment. Despite plentiful opportunities for source reduction in 1990, many industries failed to realize its benefits. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 promotes source reduction as the primary method to control pollution, emphasizing the importance of preventing or reducing pollution at the source whenever feasible. Source reduction practices aim to reduce hazardous substances and encourage recycling and environmentally safe treatment, with disposal as a last resort. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 defines source reduction as practices that reduce hazardous substances entering the environment before recycling or disposal. The Act mandated the EPA to establish an Office of Pollution Prevention to promote an integrated, multi-media approach to source reduction. EPA was directed to develop a strategy to consider the impact of all programs and regulations on source reduction and recommend ways to eliminate barriers. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 mandated the EPA to establish an Office of Pollution Prevention to promote source reduction practices. EPA must conduct workshops, produce guidance documents, and identify opportunities for federal procurement to encourage source reduction. Additionally, EPA is required to develop model auditing procedures, promote research, and establish an annual award program to facilitate source reduction by industry. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 mandated the EPA to establish an Office of Pollution Prevention to promote source reduction practices, including the establishment of an annual award program. The act also includes provisions to improve data collection and public access to environmental data, directing the EPA to develop improved methods of coordinating and assuring access to data collected under federal environmental statutes. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 mandated the EPA to establish an Office of Pollution Prevention to promote source reduction practices and improve public access to environmental data. Section 6607 requires industrial facilities to report annually on their releases of toxic chemicals, including information on source reduction, recycling, and quantities of toxic substances entering waste streams. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 requires industrial facilities to report annually on their toxic chemical releases, including source reduction techniques and amounts treated on- or off-site. Enforcement authority is provided under Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, with penalties for non-compliance. EPA must biennially report on the implementation of its Pollution Prevention Strategy. The Toxic Substances Control Act authorizes EPA to screen chemicals for potential dangers and regulate their manufacture and use. EPA may require testing and reporting on the effects of chemicals on living things. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) empowers EPA to regulate chemicals that pose risks to human health or the environment. EPA can use various regulatory tools, from bans to warning labels, to mitigate risks. TSCA aims to use the least burdensome option to reduce risks while considering the benefits of the chemical product. Title I of TSCA originally focused on controlling risks from PCBs and was later amended to restrict sales of elemental mercury. Five additional titles have been added to address specific concerns. Title II of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) directs EPA to set standards for asbestos mitigation in schools and requires asbestos contractors to be trained and certified. Title III provides technical assistance for radon monitoring and control. Title IV offers assistance for lead-based paint hazard abatement. Title V addresses environmental issues at schools, including energy efficiency. Title VI establishes limits on emissions of formaldehyde from composite wood products. Federal legislation to control toxic substances was proposed in 1971 by the President's Council on Environmental Quality. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was proposed in 1971 to regulate dangerous chemicals not covered by other environmental laws. Legislation was passed in the 92nd and 93rd Congresses, but controversies over screening, costs, and other regulations delayed final action. Environmental contamination incidents and cost estimates further highlighted the need for regulation. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was signed into law by President Ford on October 11, 1976. It directs the EPA to require manufacturers to conduct tests for existing chemicals if they pose a risk to health or the environment, lack sufficient data, or require testing for data development. The TSCA also aims to prevent future risks through pre-manufacture screening and regulatory tracking of new chemical products. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) aims to control risks of existing chemicals, gather information on their effects, and induce the development of test data by producers. Authorization for appropriations expired in 1983, but programs have continued. Many chemicals lack sufficient data on health and environmental effects, prompting EPA to require test data development under certain conditions. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) aims to control risks of existing chemicals by requiring testing if there is a potential for substantial human exposure or environmental release. An Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) helps determine which chemicals should be tested first and coordinates testing efforts among government agencies. EPA must issue rules for testing if existing data are insufficient to ensure safety. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) directs the Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) to designate chemicals for EPA action within 12 months. The list can contain up to 50 designated chemicals, with EPA required to respond within one year by issuing a proposed test rule or explaining why no testing is needed. Factors considered include quantity of the substance, environmental releases, human exposure, chemical similarity, data availability, and information gain. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires EPA action to prevent or reduce risks from chemicals known to cause cancer, gene mutations, or birth defects. Manufacturers must notify EPA before introducing new chemical products in the US. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires EPA notification of any information on chemicals that may pose risks to human health or the environment. EPA must be informed of any new uses of existing chemicals that may result in significant changes in exposure. The 90-day notice allows EPA to evaluate and potentially restrict activities to prevent harm. EPA has up to 45 days to assess the risk posed by the chemical after notification. The EPA uses a screening procedure to evaluate the potential risks posed by chemicals. If a substance is deemed to present an unreasonable risk, the Administrator must establish protective requirements. If data is insufficient, decisions may be based on similar chemicals. The goal is to identify and control hazards before widespread use. EPA may issue a proposed order to prohibit or limit activities for chemicals with substantial environmental or human exposure risks until sufficient data is provided. TSCA prohibits blanket testing requirements for all new chemicals to avoid stifling innovation in the industry. EPA reviews over 1,000 new chemical manufacturing notices annually and decides which chemicals warrant premarket testing based on potential risks. EPA has the authority under TSCA to control chemical hazards that present unreasonable risks by prohibiting or limiting production, distribution, or use of a substance, requiring warning labels, record-keeping, disposal methods, and more. The EPA has the authority under TSCA to regulate chemical hazards by imposing requirements on producers for record-keeping, disposal methods, and product replacement. EPA must use the least burdensome approach to protect against risks and maintain an inventory of chemicals manufactured in the US. New chemicals not on the inventory must be notified to EPA before entering commerce. Title I of TSCA addresses the regulation of PCBs and elemental mercury. EPA is directed to regulate PCBs and ban most uses, while federal agencies are prohibited from selling elemental mercury. EPA has the authority to collect information from industries, including chemical identities, amounts manufactured, environmental effects, and disposal methods. Manufacturers, processors, and distributors of chemicals are required to comply with these regulations. Manufacturers, processors, and distributors of chemicals must maintain records of adverse reactions to health or the environment caused by a substance. Records of employee health effects must be kept for 30 years. Industry must submit health and safety studies, and report unknown adverse effects to the EPA. EPA can take emergency action to control chemicals posing serious risks, and refer cases to other federal agencies. EPA has discretion over statutes under TSCA. Section 11 of TSCA grants EPA authority to inspect facilities, issue subpoenas, and gather necessary information. Section 13 mandates enforcement at national borders by the Treasury Department. Section 15 outlines prohibited acts, with Section 16 detailing penalties, including civil penalties up to $25,000 per violation per day and criminal penalties for willful violations. Section 17 of TSCA grants jurisdiction to U.S. district courts in civil actions to enforce Section 15 by restraining or compelling actions that violate or comply with it. Chemicals may be seized and condemned for violations. Section 19 allows for judicial review of specified rules within 60 days of issuance. Section 20 authorizes civil suits against violators and EPA for noncompliance. Section 21 allows the public to petition for toxicity testing rule issuance, amendment, or repeal. Section 21 of TSCA allows the public to petition for toxicity testing rule issuance, amendment, or repeal, with broad protection of proprietary confidential information about chemicals in commerce under Section 14. EPA employees are restricted from disclosing such information, except in specific circumstances. Section 26 permits EPA to impose regulatory controls on categories of chemicals, but not solely based on being new chemical substances. Wrongful disclosure of confidential data may result in criminal penalties. TSCA Section 18 preempts state actions that establish requirements for federally regulated chemicals unless they provide higher protection. Section 10 directs EPA to conduct necessary research. Section 12 excludes chemical products for export from most TSCA requirements. Section 22 of TSCA waives compliance for national defense interests, while Section 23 protects whistle-blowers. Section 24 requires EPA to monitor TSCA's impact on employment. Section 25 mandates studies on indemnification for affected individuals and a classification system for chemical substances. Section 26 allows data sharing between EPA and other agencies and authorizes fee collection for data processing. EPA is directed to establish an office for TSCA implementation. Section 26 of TSCA establishes a new Assistant Administrator for Toxic Substances within EPA. Section 27 authorizes research on test methods for chemicals by the Public Health Service in cooperation with EPA. Grants to states for programs to prevent health or environmental risks are authorized by Section 28. Section 29 allows appropriations through 1983, and Section 30 mandates an annual report. Congressional efforts to address hazardous asbestos in buildings, especially schools, were prompted by public concern. Title II of TSCA, known as the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA), was enacted in 1986 and amended in 1988. It required EPA to set standards for responding to asbestos in schools by October 1987. Schools had to inspect for asbestos, develop a management plan, and use certified contractors for abatement work. Title II of TSCA, the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA), mandates certification for analytical laboratories, schools, inspectors, contractors, and workers involved in asbestos abatement in public and commercial buildings. EPA can provide training grants for asbestos health and safety programs, but funding expired in 1995. Emergency actions can be taken by EPA for schools not protecting children from asbestos. Citizen action and civil penalties up to $5,000 are authorized for violations. The Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act of 1984 (ASHAA) authorized civil penalties up to $5,000 for violations related to asbestos in schools. ASHAA also provided grants and interest-free loans to schools with asbestos issues. Congress appropriated $382 million for this program from FY1984 to FY1993. Repaid loans are returned to an Asbestos Trust Fund for future asbestos control projects. Funding for the program expired in 1995, and Congress has not allocated funds since FY1993. Title III of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) provides financial and technical assistance to states for radon monitoring and control. EPA is required to update informational materials, develop construction standards, and establish an information clearinghouse for radon levels. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Title III provides financial and technical assistance to states for radon monitoring and control. Private firms are involved in various activities such as developing new radon measurement methods, operating cooperative projects with states, and conducting research. Congress authorized funding for programs like proficiency rating and certification for training programs. Congress authorized $3,000,000 annually for three years starting in 1989 for Sections 303, 304, and 305. A $30 million matching grant program was established to assist states in radon assessment and mitigation. Funds were targeted for states adopting EPA's construction standards, prioritizing low-income individuals, addressing radon contamination, and developing innovative techniques. EPA was required to study radon contamination in schools and identify high-risk areas in the U.S. for indoor radon levels. Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) aims to reduce risks to young children exposed to lead-based paint in their homes. It accelerates federal efforts and stimulates the development of lead inspection and hazard abatement services in the private sector. The authorization for appropriations specific to this title expired in 1991, but appropriations have continued. The 102nd Congress added Title IV to TSCA in 1992. Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act directs EPA to define lead hazards, train individuals in detection and control, accredit training programs, evaluate commercial products, set standards for laboratory analysis, certify testing laboratories, and publish a list of accredited environmental sampling labs. These requirements also apply to federal facilities and activities. Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act requires EPA to define lead hazards, train individuals, evaluate products, set standards for analysis, certify labs, and establish a clearinghouse for information on lead-based paint hazards and new technologies. Congress also mandated public education and outreach activities for various stakeholders. Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act mandates EPA to define lead hazards, train individuals, evaluate products, set standards, certify labs, and establish a clearinghouse for information on lead-based paint hazards. States can propose programs to train and certify inspectors and contractors for lead-based paint hazards. EPA can approve state proposals and provide grants for program development. The Department of Health and Human Services also has responsibilities under Title IV. The Department of Health and Human Services has responsibilities under Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act, which includes conducting studies on lead exposure in children and occupational exposure to lead during abatement activities. The act also established a rule-making docket to ensure transparency in regulatory decisions. The EPA must explain major changes to proposed rules in the final rule, based on information filed in the docket. Dockets are required in each EPA regional office. TSCA Title IV authorizes appropriations as necessary. Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 authorized grants for lead-based paint removal in low-income housing. HUD establishes guidelines for federally supported work on risk assessments and inspections. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received $10 million for training on paint removal. The 110th Congress added a fifth title to TSCA for Healthy High-Performance Schools, authorizing EPA to establish a state grant program for school environmental health programs. This includes standards for school building design, construction, and renovation, as well as identifying and solving ongoing environmental problems. Environmental problems mentioned in the law include contaminants, hazardous substances, and pollutant emissions. EPA's authority for grants expires five years after enactment. Title V mandates guidelines for selecting school sites considering children's vulnerability to hazards, transportation options, energy efficiency, and emergency shelter use. EPA must issue these guidelines within 18 months of enactment. Title V mandates the issuance of voluntary guidelines within two years for state environmental health programs in schools, considering various factors such as environmental problems, natural lighting, ventilation, and maintenance. The guidelines must align with federal initiatives related to school facilities and high-performance green buildings. Title V of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates the issuance of voluntary guidelines for state environmental health programs in schools to improve the environmental health of children, especially in low-income and minority communities. The guidelines cover siting, design, management, and operation of school facilities, aligning with federal initiatives for high-performance green buildings. Title V of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires the Federal Director to ensure that the national high-performance green building clearinghouse informs the public about environmental hazards in school facilities. Congress authorized $7 million for this purpose through FY2013 and directed the EPA Administrator to prepare an annual report on Title V activities. The Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act (P.L. 111-199) was enacted in July 2010, adding a new Title VI to TSCA. It mandates specific formaldehyde emission standards for hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard, and particleboard in the United States, based on ASTM International standards. The standards apply to various wood products but exclude certain items like structural plywood and outdoor applications. The Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act (P.L. 111-199) mandates emission standards for wood products like I-joists, windows, and composite wood used in various vehicles. Regulations include labeling, chain of custody, third-party testing, and enforcement. Prohibited activities include stockpiling and labeling products manufactured before the designated date. Annual reports to Congress on implementation are required. The Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act (P.L. 111-199) mandates emission standards for wood products and requires an annual report to Congress on compliance. The act also directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to update regulations on formaldehyde emissions from composite wood in manufactured homes. EPA is responsible for implementing federal pesticide policies under two statutes: FIFRA and FFDCA. FIFRA regulates the sale and use of pesticides in the US through registration and labeling. Pesticides are chemicals used to kill pests, including insects and weeds that harm crops. The definition of \"pesticide\" also includes products used to control mold, mildew, algae, and other nuisance growths. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) regulates the sale and use of pesticides in the US. It directs the EPA to restrict pesticide use to prevent adverse effects on people and the environment. Pesticides must be registered and labeled for approved uses, and it is illegal to use them in a manner inconsistent with label instructions. EPA registers each pesticide product for approved uses, and older products must be reregistered. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) directs the EPA to regulate pesticide use to prevent adverse effects. Pesticides must be registered and labeled for approved uses, and older products must be reregistered periodically. Establishments selling pesticide products must register with EPA and comply with record-keeping and inspection requirements. The FFDCA Section 408 authorizes EPA to establish maximum residue levels (tolerances) for pesticides in food to ensure safety. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) regulate pesticide use and establish maximum residue levels for pesticides in food to ensure safety. FIFRA authorizes EPA to collect fees from pesticide registrants for registration-related activities. Federal pesticide legislation dates back to 1910, authorizing the USDA to set manufacturing standards. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorized the USDA to set standards for insecticides and fungicides, require labeling, and inspect products for effectiveness. In 1970, EPA took over FIFRA administration, leading to a complete revision in 1972 due to concerns about pesticide toxicity on humans, wildlife, and non-targeted organisms. The 1972 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) replaced the original 1947 law to regulate pesticides' impact on wildlife, insects, birds, and food consumers. Amendments in 1978, 1988, 1996, 2004, 2007, and 2012 addressed concerns about pesticide reregistration and required EPA to review products with the same active ingredients on a generic basis. The 1988 amendments to FIFRA focused on accelerating reregistration of older pesticides by implementing additional registration fees and establishing the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund. Agricultural chemical producers were required to pay a one-time reregistration fee for each active ingredient, while product registrants had to pay an annual registration maintenance fee. The Fund was created to supplement appropriations for the cost of reregistration and tolerance reassessment. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) established stricter safety standards for pesticide residues on food, prioritized reassessment of high-risk pesticides, and mandated periodic reviews of all registered pesticides. It also authorized fees to support reregistration and tolerance reassessments, with exemptions for minor-use pesticides, public health pesticides, and small business registrants. Congress extended fee authority annually through appropriations legislation after FY2001. The omnibus appropriations legislation signed in January 2004 (P.L. 108-199) modified EPA's fee collection authority until FY2008. This included the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA 1), which reauthorized annual maintenance fees for reregistration and tolerance reassessment activities. PRIA 1 also established Registration Service Fees to expedite pesticide registration applications. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA) established a new fund in the U.S. Treasury to receive registration fees. PRIA 1 prohibited collection of fees other than maintenance and new registration fees. PRIA 2 and PRIA 3 reauthorized and revised fee provisions through FY2017, with certain fee collections authorized on a reduced basis through FY2019. Authorization for appropriations for the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) expired in 1991, but funding has continued through appropriations bills. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was directed by Congress to set residue tolerances for pesticides in food to protect consumers from pesticide residues. The Food Additives Amendment of 1958 expanded this requirement to include setting tolerances for food additives, including pesticide residues in processed foods. Section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) also prohibited the addition of any additive to food. In 1970, the Delaney Clause prohibited the addition of potential cancer-causing agents to food. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 revised pesticide residue tolerance setting, removing processed foods from regulation as food additives. The Act established a new safety standard of \"reasonable certainty of no harm\" from pesticide exposure. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 revised pesticide residue tolerance setting, establishing a new safety standard of \"reasonable certainty of no harm\" from pesticide exposure. Fees for tolerance assessments are authorized by FFDCA Section 408(m), but PRIA 1 prohibited collection of tolerance fees in 2004. EPA requires pesticide manufacturers to submit scientific data on toxicity and behavior in the environment when registering a pesticide under FIFRA Section 3. EPA may require data from more than 100 different tests, depending on the potential toxicity. The EPA requires pesticide manufacturers to submit scientific data on toxicity and behavior in the environment when registering a pesticide under FIFRA Section 3. This data includes information on residues of active and inert ingredients, breakdown products, and residue levels on crops and food products. EPA uses this data to determine the potential risks to human health and the environment, as well as establish safe tolerance levels under the FFDCA for pesticide residues on food crops. The FFDCA requires a tolerance to be established before granting pesticide registration for use on food crops. The EPA specifies approved uses, conditions, and safe storage methods on product labels. FIFRA pre-empts state regulations on pesticide labels and prohibits inconsistent use. Restricted-use pesticides are for more dangerous applications and require training for applicators. States and tribes are responsible for certifying pesticide applicators. EPA may grant conditional registrations under FIFRA Section 3. FIFRA Section 3 allows conditional registrations for pesticides that are substantially similar to existing products, have no additional environmental risks, or require more time for data generation. EPA can collect fee revenues to expedite its activities. Maintenance fees are collected annually from pesticide registrants. The EPA collects maintenance fees annually from pesticide registrants to continue existing registrations. Section 33 of FIFRA describes a fee system for new pesticide registrations, amended registrations, and tolerance actions. Fees are based on a prescribed schedule and deposited in the Pesticide Registration Fund. Revenues from the fund cover costs associated with review and decision making for applications. The EPA collects maintenance fees from pesticide registrants annually to cover registration activities, with remaining costs funded by appropriations. PRIA 3 prohibits reducing appropriations based on fee revenues and maintains funding levels for EPA OPP functions. Authorization to collect fees must be provided in advance in appropriations acts. These requirements have been met in EPA annual appropriations from FY2004 to FY2012. The EPA collects maintenance fees from pesticide registrants annually to cover registration activities, with remaining costs funded by appropriations. PRIA 3 prohibits reducing appropriations based on fee revenues and maintains funding levels for EPA OPP functions. Authorization to collect fees must be provided in advance in appropriations acts. These requirements have been met in EPA annual appropriations for FY2004 through FY2012, and until March 27, 2013, in the FY2013 continuing appropriations resolution ( P.L. 112-175 ). Any person who has registered a pesticide may petition EPA proposing establishment of a tolerance or an exemption for that pesticide to permit its use on food-related crops. Tolerance petitions must include information about pesticide application rates, measured concentrations of pesticide residues on the food after the pesticide has been applied according to directions on its label, and safety of pesticide use on food crops. The FFDCA requires EPA to respond to each petition by establishing a tolerance or exempting the pesticide from the requirement. If the pesticide will not leave residues above an established safe level, EPA will register the pesticide for use on that food product and set the tolerance level by issuing a regulation. EPA tolerances for pesticide residues preempt state and local. The FFDCA, Section 408, as amended by the FQPA, requires EPA to assess safety in terms of total exposure to pesticides, including other pesticides with similar toxic effects. EPA sets standards to ensure safety, with a tolerance providing 'reasonable certainty of no harm' if the Administrator determines so. EPA tolerances for pesticide residues preempt state and local restrictions on food, unless states petition for an exception based on public health concerns. The FFDCA, Section 408, as amended by the FQPA, requires EPA to assess safety in terms of total exposure to pesticides. Tolerance will provide a 'reasonable certainty of no harm' if the Administrator determines that the aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue will be lower by an ample margin of safety than the level at which the pesticide chemical residue will not cause harm to human health. EPA considers many factors, including dietary exposure to pesticides among infants and children, when determining a safe level. EPA can maintain or adjust tolerances based on available information. The FFDCA, Section 408, as amended by the FQPA, allows EPA to maintain or modify existing tolerances at higher residue levels only if necessary to avoid greater risks to consumers or significant disruption in food supply. Higher tolerance levels are set for potential carcinogens or health effects with no known safe exposure level. These tolerances must be safe for infants and children, with a maximum annual cancer risk increase of 10. The House Commerce Committee provides guidance on establishing safe residue levels for non-threshold effects like cancer. They expect a tolerance to ensure a 'reasonable certainty of no harm' with a negligible increase in lifetime risk, defined as a one-in-a-million lifetime risk by the EPA. The Committee expects the Administrator to continue following the \"safe\" standard for pesticide residue levels in food, with a one-in-a-million lifetime risk. EPA must consider cumulative exposure to pesticides in various sources. Congress mandated EPA to review all tolerances against this standard by August 2006. FDA and USDA monitor pesticide residues in food and enforce tolerances through inspection programs. EPA is required to make pesticide registration data public, but some information can be protected as trade secrets. Applicants can claim data as trade secrets under FIFRA, Section 10, which EPA may withhold from the public if agreed upon. Protected information includes manufacturing processes, testing methods, and inert ingredient details. Companies can register products based on data from original registrants, with a 10-year exclusive use period for new data submissions. Congress has directed EPA to reregister older pesticide products to assess their safety in line with current scientific standards. Many of these products have had their registrations canceled, with at least 14,000 no longer in use. Registrants and EPA face the task of reregistering the remaining older pesticide products. The EPA and registrants are tasked with reregistering older pesticide products, which is a costly and ongoing process. The EPA groups products with the same active ingredients for evaluation, assessing scientific data to determine eligibility for reregistration based on safety standards. If data is insufficient, registrants are required to generate new data following EPA protocols. EPA also reassesses tolerance for food-use pesticides under the FFDCA during this process. Registrants can share testing costs. EPA reviews data to ensure product safety. EPA issues a Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) when all data is received. Failure to provide data promptly can lead to product registration suspension. EPA collects reregistration fees for the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund. Annual maintenance fees also go into this fund to expedite processing of pesticide applications. The EPA directs the completion of REDs for pesticides with food uses/tolerances by specific deadlines. After a pesticide is declared eligible for reregistration, individual end-use products containing the active ingredient must also be reregistered to ensure risk reduction measures are reflected on product labels. Product reregistration is the final step in the process. EPA plans to complete product reregistration decisions after signing the last REDs. Congress mandated periodic review of pesticide registrations every 15 years. PRIA 2 authorized use of funds to offset review costs, with a deadline of October 1, 2022, for EPA to complete registration reviews for products registered by October 1, 2007. PRIA 3 continued fund authorization and retained the 2022 deadline for registration reviews to ensure pesticides meet safety standards. The EPA conducts registration reviews of pesticides to assess their safety and potential risks. If new evidence suggests unreasonable risk, a special review may be initiated to reevaluate the registered pesticide's risks and benefits. Registrants are required to report any adverse effects promptly, and EPA may require new studies to fill gaps in scientific understanding. \"Under FIFRA, EPA conducts special reviews to assess pesticide registrations, which may lead to amendments or cancellations if unreasonable adverse effects are found. Registrants can voluntarily request cancellation if the cost of additional studies outweighs the expected profit. Canceled registrations prohibit sales for specific uses in the U.S., but existing stocks can be used for a limited time. Registrants have the right to appeal EPA's cancellation decisions.\" FIFRA allows registrants to appeal EPA's decision to cancel a pesticide registration, initiating a lengthy review process. If there is an \"imminent hazard,\" EPA can suspend the registration, stopping sales and use of the product. In case of suspension and cancellation, EPA can request compensation from Congress for owners who suffered losses. Registrants are responsible for transportation, disposal, and storage costs. FIFRA also permits unregistered use of pesticides in special circumstances through experimental use permits for research purposes. Section 5 allows experimental use permits for research purposes and data collection. Section 18 grants \"emergency exemptions\" for virulent disease outbreaks. Section 24(c) permits states to allow additional uses for \"special local needs.\" EPA enforces FIFRA requirements, but Section 26 gives primary enforcement authority to states with adequate procedures. EPA can rescind a state's enforcement responsibility under Section 27. Section 11 authorizes EPA to form cooperative agreements with states for training. EPA will collaborate with states to train and certify pesticide applicators. States can also review emergency exemptions and special local needs registrations. Inspections and enforcement actions are authorized by EPA. Civil and criminal penalties are established for FIFRA violations. Indemnity payments are provided for end users, distributors, and dealers when registrations are suspended. Federal district courts can review EPA actions. FIFRA does not authorize citizen suits against violators, but allows for judicial review of EPA orders. EPA lacks authority to regulate domestic production for export of unregistered pesticides, but exporters must comply with labeling provisions and obtain purchaser acknowledgments. EPA must notify other countries and international agencies about unregistered pesticide exports. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was enacted in 1969, declaring a national policy to create and maintain conditions for man and nature to exist harmoniously. NEPA also established the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to oversee environmental matters. EPA is required to inform other countries and international agencies about pesticide registrations, cancellations, and suspensions in the United States. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was tasked with developing national policies to improve environmental quality and played a key role in shaping regulations for the implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in the 1970s. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts and alternatives in their decision-making through environmental impact statements (EIS), without prioritizing environmental concerns over other factors. NEPA requires federal agencies to conduct environmental impact statements (EIS) to assess the environmental consequences of proposed actions. The agency must take a \"hard look\" at the project's environmental effects, but can still prioritize other benefits over environmental costs. CEQ and EPA are responsible for ensuring NEPA's proper implementation. Before final decisions are made, NEPA mandates the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for major federal actions that significantly impact the human environment. An EIS discloses details of the proposed action, existing environment, and analyzes the potential environmental effects of all reasonable alternatives. When environmental impacts are uncertain or not significant, an environmental assessment (EA) is required to determine the level of significance of the impacts, leading to a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or a decision to prepare further assessments. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) mandates the preparation of environmental impact statements (EIS) for major federal actions that significantly impact the human environment. Actions that do not have a significant effect may result in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or a decision to prepare an EIS. Categorical exclusions are actions that do not have a significant social, economic, or environmental effect and are excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or EA. Compliance with various legislative and regulatory requirements may be necessary for federal actions. Consultation with other federal agencies is required to document compliance with environmental laws and executive orders. The NEPA process serves as a means of coordinating compliance with environmental laws for federal projects, which may involve multiple agencies and various statutory and regulatory requirements. Interagency coordination for complex projects like highway construction or oil and gas development has been criticized for inefficiencies causing delays. Improved interagency cooperation is crucial for streamlining the NEPA process. CEQ's regulations aim to expedite compliance by reducing paperwork, directing agencies to integrate NEPA requirements with other planning procedures, prepare environmental reviews concurrently, establish time limits on EISs, and emphasize early planning integration. Integrate the NEPA process into early planning, emphasize interagency cooperation, and ensure swift resolution of lead agency disputes. EPA has a role in reviewing and commenting on environmental impacts of proposed federal activities, including EIS evaluations. EPA rates EIS adequacy and environmental impact as \"adequate,\" \"needs more information,\" or \"inadequate.\" EPA is not authorized to enforce NEPA requirements, but federal agencies must implement them. The EPA plays a role in reviewing and rating the environmental impacts of proposed federal activities through the EIS process. The agency may rate EISs as \"adequate,\" \"needs more information,\" or \"inadequate,\" and also assess projects based on lack of objections, environmental concerns, objections, or being environmentally unsatisfactory. If an action is deemed environmentally unsatisfactory, EPA refers the matter to CEQ for resolution. Additionally, EPA is responsible for the administrative duties associated with the EIS filing process, as outlined in a Memorandum of Agreement with CEQ. The EPA maintains a national EIS filing system to provide public access to EISs and participates in the NEPA process as a lead agency for its own federal actions. NEPA documentation is required for various EPA activities, but legislation has limited EPA's requirement to comply with NEPA for certain actions. The Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 exempts actions under the Clean Air Act from NEPA requirements. EPA is also exempt from environmental laws for response actions under CERCLA. Courts recognize EPA procedures as equivalent to NEPA, exempting them from NEPA requirements."
