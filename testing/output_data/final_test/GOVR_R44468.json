    "content": "Agencies use guidance documents to establish regulatory policy swiftly, unlike legislative rules which require notice and comment procedures. These documents inform the public of an agency's interpretation of laws and enforcement priorities. For example, the Department of Education has utilized guidance documents for Title IX more frequently than legislative rules, sparking scrutiny. Other agencies, like the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury, have also issued guidance on enforcement priorities. The Department of Homeland Security expanded DACA and created DAPA programs in 2014, allowing relief for certain immigrants. The Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of these programs due to a preliminary injunction. The Fifth Circuit upheld a preliminary injunction against implementing agency guidance documents, which has faced criticism for potentially changing laws. This report examines agency policy statements, discussing judicial review, deference to agency interpretations, and the costs and benefits of rules regarding their use. The APA outlines rulemaking procedures for agencies, requiring formal rulemaking if the organic statute mandates it. Otherwise, agencies follow informal notice and comment rulemaking under Section 553. This process involves issuing rules with public notice, opportunity for comment, and publication in the Federal Register before the effective date. The APA's rulemaking procedures require agencies to follow formal or informal processes outlined in Section 553, with exceptions for interpretive rules and guidance documents. Individuals can challenge agency actions in federal court for violating procedural provisions, potentially requiring notice and comment procedures. Judicial review of agency documents often hinges on determining if the document is a legislative rule, interpretive rule, or general statement of policy. The Attorney General's Manual on the APA defines Substantive Rules as rules with the force of law, Interpretative Rules as agency interpretations of statutes, and General Statements of Policy as prospective guidance on discretionary powers. The report focuses on the difference between legislative rules and guidance documents, specifically on agency issuance and judicial review of policy statements. It highlights the challenges in determining what constitutes a legislative rule in practice, noting that while procedural requirements are strict for legislative rules, they are minimal for policy statements under federal law. The APA does not require notice and comment for policy statements, but agencies must follow certain steps in issuing them. The FOIA amendments to the APA mandate publication of policy statements affecting the public in the Federal Register. This requirement must be read alongside provisions allowing agencies to make some policy statements available to the public without publication. The line between \"statements of general policy\" that must be published under Section 552(a)(1) and \"statements of policy\" that do not need to be published under Section 552(a)(2) is difficult to draw. Courts have rarely addressed the question of what types of policy statements require publication in the Federal Register, leading to varying approaches. Some courts focus on whether a policy statement affects \"substantive rights\" or is of \"general applicability\" to determine publication requirements. Recent administrations have added procedural requirements for issuing certain policy statements, like the George W. Bush Administration's Executive Order 13422 on \"significant guidance documents.\" The George W. Bush Administration issued Executive Order 13422, which required additional consultation before issuing guidance documents. Although later withdrawn, a 2007 OMB bulletin on agency practices for guidance documents remains in effect. The bulletin establishes standard elements for significant guidance documents and requires agencies to publish economically significant guidance documents in draft form in the Federal Register for public comment. The APA does not mandate notice and comment procedures for policy statements, but the executive branch requires a similar process for economically significant ones. Compliance with OMB bulletin procedures is not reviewable judicially. Some policy statements are subject to CRA submission and disapproval procedures, allowing Congress to invalidate rules through joint resolutions. The CRA adopts a broad definition of \"rule\" from the APA, which may include some policy statements. However, certain types of rules are excluded from CRA coverage, such as those of particular applicability or relating to agency management. The CRA defines \"rule\" broadly, including policy statements, which may affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. Policy statements that do not qualify for CRA exceptions are considered rules subject to submission and congressional disapproval. Unlike legislative rules, policy statements are exempt from notice and comment procedures, leading to challenges in federal court based on APA procedural violations. Judicial review often hinges on determining if an agency document is a legislative rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit distinguishes between legislative rules, which impose legally binding obligations, and policy statements, which explain how an agency will enforce a statute. A legislative rule can be the basis for enforcement actions, while a policy statement is not legally binding and requires agency support when applied in specific situations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit distinguishes between legislative rules, which impose legally binding obligations, and policy statements, which explain how an agency will enforce a statute. While distinguishing between the two in practice can be difficult, agencies may not rely on nonlegislative rules to support enforcement actions. The agency's guidance on enforcing statutes can lead to questions about whether the law has effectively been altered. Courts struggle to differentiate between policy statements and legislative rules, with the distinction often unclear. The focus is on whether the agency has established a binding norm, with various approaches used to determine legal effects. This includes analyzing the practical impact of policy statements on regulated parties to assess if they have altered the law. When determining if an agency statement constitutes a legislative rule, the key factor is whether legal consequences result from a violation of the statement itself or if it is based on an underlying statute or regulation. If the violation is based on the latter, it is not considered a legislative rule. Even if a guidance document does not have formal legal force, it can still be practically binding and qualify as a legislative rule. A guidance document can be practically binding and qualify as a legislative rule if it restricts agency discretion, narrowing the scope for officials to apply a statute or rule. If a policy statement limits administrative discretion, it may be considered a binding rule of substantive law. This analysis overlaps with the impact on regulated parties. An agency's document can be considered a substantive rule if it has a present-day binding effect on the public and expands regulatory reach or creates new rights. Courts focus on the language used in the document to determine if it binds the agency or the public. Mandatory language indicating the agency's position can show intent to bind. Agency statements appearing binding on their face may eliminate agency discretion, making them practically binding. In General Electric Company v. E.P.A., a court vacated an EPA guidance document as it imposed binding obligations, indicating the force of law. Agency directives allowing discretion are seen as guidance documents. In National Mining Association v. Secretary of Labor, agency officials were permitted to make individualized determinations on a case-by-case basis regarding exemptions from compliance with regulations. The court ruled that the directive was a statement of policy, not a binding norm, due to the officials' discretion in considering individual facts. Similarly, agency statements can be practically binding if parties are led to believe non-conformity will result in adverse consequences. Agency statements can be practically binding if they create a \"safe harbor\" or specify compliance with legislative rules. Courts may consider an agency's treatment of a document to determine its binding nature. If an agency acts as if a document is controlling in the field, it can be seen as binding. In U.S. Telephone Association v. F.C.C., the Federal Communications Commission issued a schedule of penalties for violations of the Communications Act. The court found that the agency's repeated application of the schedule and limited departures indicated a binding intention, leading to the schedule being set aside for lack of notice and comment rulemaking. The importance of distinguishing between formal and functional heuristics is highlighted in the case of Texas v. United States. A federal district court issued a nationwide injunction against the Obama Administration's DAPA program and DACA expansion, ruling that the memorandum directing relief from removal was a legislative rule requiring notice and comment under the APA. The court in Texas v. United States ruled that the agency's claim of maintaining discretion in granting deferred action to aliens was rejected as the memorandum virtually extinguished agency personnel's discretion. Data from the DACA program showed that denials were due to not meeting criteria or fraud, not individual discretion. The Fifth Circuit reviewed the district court's order on appeal. The Fifth Circuit upheld the district court's ruling on the DHS memorandum, which was criticized by Judge King for being a statement of policy. She argued that the memorandum did not define certain terms, leaving room for agency discretion. Judge King believed that the memorandum had no legal effect and denied applicants could not challenge the agency's decision in court. Judge King criticized the district court's focus on the DHS memorandum, stating that it did not define terms and allowed for agency discretion. She argued that applicants could not challenge the agency's decision in court and that the memorandum did not become a legislative rule as long as the agency retained discretion for individualized determinations. King also disagreed with the court's findings on the memorandum's discretionary language and lack of evidence on agency employees' discretion. The court erred in relying on DACA data for DAPA implementation, as the eligibility criteria differ. The case is pending before the Supreme Court, with arguments for affirmance based on the DHS memorandum legally binding the agency and modifying substantive rights. The plaintiff states argue that the agency's policy, outlined in a memorandum, establishes legal rights by modifying substantive rights and interests. The Department of Justice disputes this, stating that the memorandum preserves agency discretion and confers no legal rights. The DOJ argues that not enforcing a law against an individual does not have the force of law to make the policy a legislative rule. Notice and comment procedures have already occurred independently for the regulations authorizing specific benefits. The Department of Justice argues that policy statements can direct agency staff activities without being legislative rules subject to notice and comment. Determining if a document is a legislative rule or policy statement affects judicial review of agency actions. Obtaining judicial review of a policy statement can be challenging compared to legislative rules. Policy statements are not immediately reviewable like legislative rules. The Supreme Court has provided limited guidance on when they can be challenged. Lower courts lack a uniform approach to their reviewability. The APA only extends a presumption of judicial review to \"final\" agency action. In Bennett v. Spear, the Supreme Court defined final agency action as the completion of the decision-making process with legal consequences. The finality requirement for judicial review of agency policy statements is flexible and pragmatic. While policy statements may satisfy the first prong of finality by representing the culmination of the agency's deliberative process, the legal consequences prong often poses a barrier to review. Policy statements are typically nonbinding and advisory, lacking direct legal consequences, which hinders their judicial review. Lower federal courts have struggled with the reviewability question when challengers argue that agency policy statements, although labeled as nonbinding, have legal consequences and should have gone through notice and comment procedures. Some courts have merged the finality inquiry with the question of whether a policy statement is actually a legislative rule, requiring proof that it constitutes a de facto rule or binding norm. In Center for Auto Safety v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the D.C. Circuit determined that agency letters establishing guidelines for a regional recall policy were policy statements, not final agency action subject to judicial review. The court considered whether the letters constituted a de facto rule, which would require notice and comment rulemaking under \u00a7553 of the APA. The court distinguished between unreviewable policy statements and agency actions subject to review by considering factors used to determine legislative rules. In National Mining Association v. McCarthy, the D.C. Circuit found an EPA guidance document on Clean Water Act permits to be unreviewable, stating that legislative rules may be subject to pre-enforcement judicial review, but general policy statements are not. The court determined that the EPA guidance was not a legislative rule and therefore not subject to immediate judicial review. However, if an applicant is denied a permit, they can challenge the denial as unlawful. The guidance, being nonbinding, cannot serve as a source of authority for agency action. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit does not view opinion letters from the NHTSA chief counsel as final agency action subject to judicial review. The court distinguished between the \"essential content\" and \"legal interpretations\" of the letters, deeming them tentative and not final under Supreme Court standards. The Sixth Circuit Court in Bennett focused on the conditional nature of the chief counsel's conclusions, noting they were tentative based on limited information. The court considered legal interpretations in the letters, questioning if they had legal consequences for review. The court suggested that agency interpretations may be reviewable if they could claim Chevron deference. The Chevron doctrine allows courts to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. The application of Chevron deference to policy statements is debated, with lower federal courts taking varying approaches on finality and reviewability. In Mineta, informal letters were found not to qualify for Chevron deference, making them not final for APA purposes and not subject to judicial review. Federal courts have differing views on the finality and reviewability of policy statements. Policy statements may be subject to judicial review if they have \"legal consequences\" or if the agency implements the policy in a concrete way through final agency action. Tests to distinguish between policy statements and legislative rules may impose procedures on agencies. The APA sets procedural requirements for agencies, courts cannot impose additional requirements. In Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., the Supreme Court rejected courts imposing extra procedures on agencies. This practice was deemed unpredictable and unnecessary. The Supreme Court recently invalidated a line of cases in the D.C. Circuit, known as the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine, which imposed procedural requirements on agencies beyond the APA's. In Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association, the Court ruled that agencies do not need notice and comment rulemaking procedures when modifying an interpretive rule. The D.C. Circuit had previously required notice and comment procedures when an agency significantly changed its interpretation of a regulation. The Supreme Court reversed a decision that required agencies to undergo notice and comment procedures when changing an interpretive rule, stating that the APA exempts interpretive rules from such requirements. Courts cannot impose additional procedural requirements beyond what the APA establishes for reviewing agency actions. This decision clarified that notice and comment procedures are only necessary for legislative rules, not interpretive rules. In Lincoln v. Vigil, the Supreme Court ruled that the Indian Health Service's decision to discontinue a program did not require notice and comment procedures as it fell under policy statements, not legislative rules. The decision had direct consequences for the public and was considered binding on the agency itself. The Supreme Court's decision in Lincoln v. Vigil deemed the Indian Health Service's program discontinuation as having a \"binding effect\" on the agency and the public. Despite the direct consequences for the public, the Court rejected the notion that it constituted a legislative rule, classifying it as a policy statement instead. This decision may conflict with other appellate opinions distinguishing between legislative rules and policy statements, suggesting that the force of law in an agency statement is a key factor in identifying legislative rules. The debate revolves around whether agency statements should be considered legislative rules based on their force of law. One perspective argues for a strict interpretation, only classifying documents with independent legal force as legislative rules. Another viewpoint defends the practical binding test, emphasizing the importance of determining what constitutes a legislative rule. The Supreme Court's decision in Lincoln v. Vigil is seen as limited to agency decisions. The Supreme Court's opinion in Lincoln v. Vigil may be seen as limited to agency decisions on discretionary appropriations, rather than rejecting a legal test that includes statements binding the agency or the public. If agency statements that bind the agency or the public qualify as legislative rules, then notice and comment procedures are required by the APA. A legislative rule includes situations where the agency binds itself or the public, not just those relied upon in enforcement actions. The weight given to an agency's interpretation of the law is crucial in judicial review, as it can impact the outcome of challenges to agency actions. Courts requiring notice and comment procedures for agency statements that effectively bind the agency or the public are simply complying with the APA's procedural requirements. Agencies establishing binding norms through documents are essentially creating substantive rules, even if not formally binding. The Supreme Court's Chevron test outlines the limited role of courts in reviewing agency interpretive decisions. Courts must first enforce Congress's clear intent, and if ambiguity exists, defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation. This allows federal agencies, not courts, to resolve ambiguities in implementing authority. The Supreme Court's Chevron test allows agencies, not courts, to resolve ambiguities in interpreting authority provided by Congress. Not all methods of interpretation receive Chevron deference, with the formality of the agency process being a key factor. Informal interpretations like opinion letters and policy statements do not qualify for Chevron deference, as seen in Christensen v. Harris County. The Supreme Court's Chevron test distinguishes between formal adjudications and informal agency interpretations for deference. Christensen v. Harris County established that policy statements do not qualify for Chevron deference. Subsequent cases like United States v. Mead Corp emphasized that deference depends on both the agency's process and Congress's delegation of authority. The Court's Chevron deference hinges on agency authority to make rules with the force of law, not necessarily requiring formal rulemaking. Barnhart v. Walton further complicated Chevron eligibility. The Court in Barnhart v. Walton added additional factors to consider for Chevron eligibility, stating that interpretations from agency adjudications, manuals, and letters can qualify for deference. Factors include the legal question's nature, agency expertise, importance to statute administration, and complexity. In determining Chevron deference eligibility, federal courts consider the process and binding nature of agency interpretations. Formal interpretations with the force of law are more likely to qualify, while informal, nonbinding interpretations, like policy statements, are unlikely to receive deference. Policy statements, although nonbinding, may receive a lesser degree of deference under Skidmore v. Swift. Skidmore deference requires respect for agency policies based on specialized experience and information. This deference allows for persuasive interpretations, even if not controlling, and is evaluated in the absence of Chevron deference. The degree of deference given to an agency's interpretive choice is based on the strength of the agency's reasoning. Factors such as thoroughness, validity, consistency, care, formality, past interpretations, and expertness are considered. The legal test for agency policy statements has implications for the executive branch and the public, requiring notice and comment procedures only for rules with the \"force of law.\" Judicial review would typically occur ex post under a strict understanding. The legal test for agency policy statements has implications for the executive branch and the public, requiring notice and comment procedures only for rules with the \"force of law.\" Judicial review would typically occur ex post under a strict understanding, allowing agencies significant latitude to release guidance documents without procedural constraints. Policy statements can enhance administrative efficiency by informing the public of an agency's priorities, guiding staff on enforcement directives, and allowing resources to be focused away from procedural requirements. This guidance helps clarify agency requirements, potentially saving costs for regulated firms. However, there are concerns that agencies could issue binding policy statements without effective oversight, especially in nonenforcement contexts where judicial review may not apply. Policy statements can influence regulated parties' behavior without judicial review. Third-party beneficiaries may not have a chance to object to agency positions without ex ante review. Agencies may still engage in notice and comment procedures to receive Chevron deference. An alternative legal test could limit when agencies issue policy statements by considering their practical effects on the agency or the public. This could increase public participation in the process. Increased public participation in agency decisions could be justified by requiring agencies to consult with the public before issuing policy statements. This fosters dialogue, bolsters democratic legitimacy, and provides more information for formulating policies. Public comment helps regulators understand industry behavior and preferences, leading to better enforcement policies that consider the practical effects on the public. The effects of enforcement policies on the public are unclear, as agencies may limit their use of policy statements due to stricter limits. The choice between adjudication and rulemaking is up to the agency, but requiring notice and comment procedures could result in less concrete guidance for the public on enforcement strategies and priorities. Ultimately, the impact of these legal approaches on agency actions remains uncertain. The lack of clear principles in federal courts for determining legislative rules allows for discretion in requiring notice and comment procedures. Congress can amend the APA to define rules and policy statements more precisely, clarifying when public input is necessary."
