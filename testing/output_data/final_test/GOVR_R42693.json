    "content": "The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act mandates that employers notify employees, states, and localities 60 days in advance of plant closings or mass layoffs. The Act aims to give workers time to find new jobs, access retraining, and allow for adjustment to job loss. It also alerts state dislocated worker units and local governments to provide services and adjust to changes in the labor market. The WARN Act does not provide funding for training but affected workers may be eligible for training under the Workforce Investment Act or Trade Adjustment Assistance. The WARN Act, enacted in 1988, requires employers to notify employees, states, and localities 60 days before plant closings or mass layoffs. Proposed amendments have aimed to expand the law's scope or increase employer responsibilities, with the most recent amendment proposed in the 110th Congress. The Assistance Act of 2007 proposed increasing the notice period under the WARN Act from 60 to 90 days and required employers to inform the Secretary of Labor of intended layoffs. The WARN Act applies to employers with at least 100 employees and covers temporary layoffs or employees on leave with a reasonable expectation of being recalled. The act is located in Title 29, Chapter 23 of the U.S. Code. The WARN Act applies to employers with at least 100 employees and covers temporary layoffs or employees on leave with a reasonable expectation of being recalled. Subsidiaries and independent contractors are separate from a parent company. Federal, state, local, and federally recognized tribal governments are not subject to the WARN Act. There are three types of events that require notification under the WARN Act: plant closing affecting at least 50 employees, mass layoff affecting at least 50 employees with a 33% employment loss, or mass layoff with 500 or more employees at a single site. The WARN Act applies to employers with at least 100 employees and covers temporary layoffs or employees on leave with a reasonable expectation of being recalled. It applies to events like plant closings affecting at least 50 employees, mass layoffs with a 33% employment loss, or mass layoffs of 500 or more employees at a single site. Employment loss is defined as involuntary separation exceeding six months or a 50% reduction in hours worked for six months. WARN Act can be applied retroactively if layoffs extend past six months after meeting criteria. The WARN Act requires employers with at least 100 employees to provide notice 60 days prior to layoffs or plant closings affecting a significant number of employees. Layoff extensions must be justified as unforeseeable circumstances to avoid penalties. The law covers hourly and salaried employees, managers, and supervisors but excludes business partners, contract employees, and self-employed individuals. Part-time employees are defined as those working fewer than 20 hours per week. Part-time employees under the WARN Act include those working fewer than 20 hours per week or employed fewer than 6 months. They are entitled to advance notice from covered employers, even if not counted towards employer coverage thresholds. Temporary employees and those with limited duration projects are not entitled to notice unless their employment was understood to be temporary. The understanding of temporary employment can be established through various means, but the burden of proof lies with the employer. Under the WARN Act, written notice of layoff events must be given to affected employees 60 days in advance. Notifications can also be sent to union representatives and government entities. The content of the notifications varies depending on the recipient, but must include details about the planned action and its expected duration. The employer must provide written notice of layoff events under the WARN Act, including details about the planned action, expected dates of layoffs, and contact information. Bumping rights may allow a more senior employee to replace a less senior worker whose job was not eliminated. If the worker to be laid off cannot be identified, notice must be given to the incumbent worker whose job is being eliminated. The WARN Act requires employers to provide written notice of layoff events, including details about the planned action and expected dates of layoffs. In cases where bumping rights exist, the affected employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement will receive notice through an employee representative. The U.S. Department of Labor does not have investigative authority under the law but enforces the WARN Act through the federal court system. Employers who violate the WARN Act can face civil actions in district court and are liable for back pay and benefits to affected employees. The penalty is calculated for each day notice was not provided, up to a maximum of 60 days. Employers may also be subject to a $500 civil fine for each day notice was not given. The WARN Act allows employers to provide less than 60 days' notice in certain exceptions, such as the faltering company exception and the unforeseeable business circumstances exception. Employers can avoid civil penalties by paying aggrieved employees in full within three weeks of a plant closing or mass layoff. Employers can provide reduced notice under the WARN Act if they could not foresee the business circumstances leading to plant closings or mass layoffs, such as a major client terminating a contract or a natural disaster like a flood. Special circumstances are also addressed, and affected parties have specific responsibilities in each situation. Plant closings or mass layoffs due to relocation or consolidation may not be considered employment loss if the employer offers to transfer employees within a reasonable commuting distance with no more than a six-month break in employment. Strikes or lockouts exempt from notice requirements unless used to evade compliance. Economic strikers do not count towards employee-size thresholds triggering WARN Act. Employees affected by plant closings, mass layoffs, strikes, or lockouts are entitled to advance notice under the WARN Act. The sale of a business does not automatically result in employment loss, and the responsibility for providing notice lies with the seller in certain situations. If the seller is aware of the buyer's plans for plant closings or layoffs, they may give notice on behalf of the buyer. The WARN Act requires advance notice to affected employees in cases of plant closures or layoffs. The buyer may give notice if empowered by the seller, otherwise, the buyer is responsible. It is recommended for employers to provide notice even in situations not requiring formal notification. Regulations emphasize the importance of advance notice to employees, unions, and government entities in case of significant workforce reductions. The WARN Act encourages employers to give advance notice to employees in cases of layoffs or plant closures to avoid costly litigation. Employers should weigh the benefits of providing notice against the risks of not doing so. The Act does not require firms to notify the federal government before layoffs or closures, but employers should not issue notices regularly to stay in compliance with the law. The WARN Act does not mandate firms to inform the federal government before layoffs or plant closures, leading to a lack of centralized data on WARN Act notifications. A 2003 report by the Government Accountability Office found that out of 5,349 WARN notices issued, only 717 (13%) could be linked to specific mass layoffs or plant closures. Additionally, 1,257 events requiring notification under the WARN Act did not have corresponding layoff notices. The WARN Act does not require firms to notify the federal government before layoffs or plant closures, leading to a lack of centralized data on WARN Act notifications. A 2003 report found that 1,257 events requiring notification under the WARN Act did not have corresponding layoff notices filed with the state."
