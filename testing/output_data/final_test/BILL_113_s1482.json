    "content": "The \"Empower States Act of 2013\" allows for the regulation of oil or natural gas development on federal land in states, amending the Mineral Leasing Act to include new regulations in section 44. The Secretary of the Interior is restricted from issuing guidelines or regulations on oil or gas exploration on Federal land in a State if the State meets requirements under the Act or other Federal laws, except in cases of imminent danger to public health or the environment. Additionally, the Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include new regulations in section 1459. Before issuing guidelines or regulations on oil and gas exploration, the head of a Federal department must consult with affected States, State agencies, and Indian tribes. Each Federal agency must also provide a statement on the energy and economic impact of the proposed regulations. Each Federal department or agency must develop a Statement of Energy and Economic Impact before imposing new regulations. This statement should analyze adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, and use, as well as the impact on the domestic economy, including job loss and revenue decrease. The Federal department or agency must determine if a rule is necessary to prevent imminent danger to public health or the environment and prove that the State or Indian tribe lacks a reasonable alternative. Any regulation requiring disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals must refer to a specific database. Judicial review is available for regulations described. A State or Indian tribe affected by a regulation can seek review in a US district court to ensure compliance. The court can halt federal actions until compliance is confirmed, but cannot award monetary damages. The court can review a regulation under this subsection, but cannot award money damages. The review must only consider evidence in the agency record, and the standard of review is de novo."
