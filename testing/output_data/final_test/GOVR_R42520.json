    "content": "The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided funding for the full fiscal year through September 30, 2013, including appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The discussion in this report focuses on the debate and actions regarding EPA FY2013 appropriations during the 112th Congress. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175, H.J.Res. 117) provided appropriations for federal departments and agencies, including EPA, funded through March 27, 2013. It continued appropriations at the FY2012 level with a 0.612% increase, except for activities funded in the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012. Additionally, it funded certain activities of the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies with specific funding levels designated in the resolution. EPA and other agencies were required to comply with the provisions of the resolution. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175, H.J.Res. 117) mandated EPA and other agencies to submit spending plans to Congress. A draft bill proposed $8.52 billion for EPA for FY2013. The House Committee on Appropriations had earlier proposed $7.06 billion for EPA in FY2013. The bill proposed $7.06 billion for the EPA for FY2013, which is less than the President's request and the previous year's enacted budget. EPA's responsibilities include regulating air and water quality, pesticides, toxic substances, waste management, and environmental cleanup. EPA awards grants to assist states and local governments in pollution control and enforcement of federal regulations. Federal funding for these responsibilities has become a contentious issue due to declining state revenues. Congress funds EPA programs within the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. EPA is included in Budget Function 300 for Natural Resources and Environment in the annual budget resolution. The discretionary funding for EPA programs is determined through the annual appropriations process, even though the authorization of appropriations for many programs has expired. Congress can still fund these programs if no points of order are raised or rules are waived. This has allowed funding to continue for some EPA programs while others have not been funded. The House committee proposed limiting funding for unauthorized programs in FY2013, including EPA's U.S. Mexico border grant and environmental education grant programs. Historical funding levels for EPA have generally increased over time to meet statutory responsibilities, with a peak of $14.86 billion in FY2009. The total appropriation in H.R. 6091 for EPA in 2013 was less than prior fiscal years adjusted for inflation. The funding for EPA peaked at $14.86 billion in FY2009, including regular appropriations and emergency supplemental funds. Historical funding trends and FTE employment ceiling are depicted in figures. The term appropriations in this report refers to total discretionary funds available to EPA. The EPA's funding includes regular fiscal year and emergency supplemental appropriations, as well as any rescissions, transfers, and deferrals in a particular fiscal year. The majority of the agency's funding consists of discretionary appropriations requested by the Administration and appropriated by Congress within eight statutory accounts. The House Committee on Appropriations is the primary source for enacted amounts and proposed budgets. The FY2013 funding amounts for EPA are not reflected in this report due to the lack of specific funding levels for individual departments and agencies. Section 116(a) of P.L. 112-175 required EPA to submit a spending plan to Congress. The FY2013 amounts included in the Senate draft bill are also not included in the comparisons. Additional information was obtained from EPA's FY2013 Justification of Appropriation Estimates. The EPA's FY2013 funding amounts are not included in this report. Historical funding data is from various sources, including the EPA FY2013 Congressional Justification and the President's Budget for FY2013. Prior fiscal year appropriations have not been adjusted for inflation, leading to potential decreases in real dollar values. Funding increases and decreases are discussed in detail based on proposed comparisons. The report provides a detailed analysis of funding levels for EPA programs and activities for FY2013, comparing proposed funding levels from the House Appropriations Committee and the President's budget request to enacted FY2012 appropriations. It also references funding levels from FY2009, including regular appropriations and emergency supplemental appropriations. The report highlights funding levels and key issues for selected EPA programs during the 112th Congress debate. The report analyzes funding levels for EPA programs in FY2013, comparing House Appropriations Committee and President's budget requests to enacted FY2012 appropriations. It also references FY2009 funding levels and key issues during the 112th Congress debate. The House committee-reported bill proposed a $7.06 billion budget for the EPA in FY2013, which is 15.5% below the President's request. The proposed decrease in funding largely comes from reductions in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account. The proposed decrease in the STAG account is attributed to reductions below the FY2013 request and FY2012 enacted funding for grants to help capitalize Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. Categorical grants support the day-to-day implementation of federal environmental laws and multimedia projects. House committee-proposed reductions would generally fund these grants at FY2012 levels. The House committee-proposed bill would fund grants at FY2012 levels, with exceptions for certain grants. Funding levels for EPA accounts in the bill were generally below the FY2013 request and FY2012 enacted levels, except for the Office of Inspector General and Buildings and Facilities accounts. The bill proposed various decreases and increases in funding for different programs compared to previous years. The House committee-proposed bill would fund grants at FY2012 levels, with exceptions for certain grants. Funding levels for EPA accounts in the bill were generally below the FY2013 request and FY2012 enacted levels. The bill proposed a rescission of $130.0 million from unobligated balances funded through the STAG account, similar to previous years. The House Appropriations Committee proposed funding for various environmental projects and grants, including water infrastructure, air pollution control, and climate change initiatives. Congressional interest also focused on specific programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay. Concerns were raised about EPA's regulatory expansion beyond congressional intent. The House Appropriations Committee proposed funding for environmental projects and grants, including water infrastructure and air pollution control. Concerns were raised about EPA's regulatory expansion beyond congressional intent, with debates on funding reductions for EPA programs supporting water quality, pollution control, and Superfund site cleanup. The debate regarding EPA's FY2013 appropriations focused on regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act, including controls on greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to address conventional pollutants. Other pollution control statutes administered by EPA also received attention, with concerns raised by some Members during hearings and markup of appropriations. Congressional committees continued to address EPA regulatory actions through hearings and legislation during the 112th Congress. Several EPA regulatory activities, including controls on greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to address conventional pollutants, received attention in the congressional appropriations debate during the 112th Congress. Proposed provisions in H.R. 6091 addressed these actions, along with concerns regarding Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, FIFRA, and TSCA regulations. During the 112th Congress, concerns were raised about EPA regulatory actions, particularly in relation to federal pollution control statutes. Stakeholders and Members expressed worries about the agency's perceived overreach and lack of consideration for costs and economic impacts of regulations. The House committee-reported bill proposed provisions that would impact ongoing and anticipated EPA activities, including addressing greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous air pollutants, water quality impacts, lead-based paint removal, and stormwater discharge. The bill included restrictions on the use of funds, prohibitions on certain actions, and requirements for conducting analyses. EPA and others defended their actions, stating they were consistent with statutory mandates and properly evaluated costs and benefits. The House committee-reported bill for FY2013 proposed provisions impacting EPA activities, including restrictions on fund use and requirements for analyses. It included provisions similar to those enacted for FY2012 and a subset of those in the House Appropriations Committee-proposed bill for FY2012. EPA's \"Administrative Provisions\" in H.R. 6091 contained six provisions, including a larger rescission of unobligated balances and authorization for funding transfer for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The House committee-reported bill for FY2013 proposed provisions impacting EPA activities, including restrictions on fund use and requirements for analyses. It included provisions similar to those enacted for FY2012 and a subset of those in the House Appropriations Committee-proposed bill for FY2012. Certain directives for FY2013 built upon those included in the agencies participating in this effort. Other provisions would have authorized EPA to enter into cooperative agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes or Intertribal consortia; authorized collection and obligation of pesticide registration fees under FIFRA; raised the limitation on projects for construction, alteration repair, rehabilitation, and renovations of EPA facilities to $150,000 per project within S&T, EPM, Superfund, OIG, and LUST accounts; and increased the number of appointments for the Office of Research and Development under the authority provided in 42 U.S.C. 209 from the existing maximum 30 persons to 50 persons per fiscal year. The House Appropriations Committee for FY2013 proposed directives for EPA, including specific refinements to human health risk assessments under IRIS. They did not provide a $4.25 million increase for hydraulic fracturing research as requested by the President and disallowed funds for researching environmental justice impacts related to hydraulic fracturing. The House Appropriations Committee for FY2013 rejected funding for various EPA activities in the EPM account, including research on hydraulic fracturing impacts on drinking water and innovative technologies for small drinking water systems. They also specified no funding for programs such as the greenhouse gas New Source Performance Standards and the Community Action for Renewed Environment program. The House Appropriations Committee for FY2013 rejected funding for EPA \"Administrator Priorities\" due to lack of transparency and performance metrics. They proposed $2.20 million for the Administrator's Immediate Office and $4.24 million for the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations. The House Appropriations Committee for FY2013 proposed a budget $4.0 million below the request. Concerns were raised about a backlog of responses to congressional inquiries and enforcement issues, specifically regarding aerial compliance monitoring. The committee directed EPA to submit a report on aerial monitoring activities. Aerial monitoring has been used for nearly a decade as a cost-effective enforcement tool. The committee requested information on the number of enforcement actions using aerial monitoring and their outcomes. The House Appropriations Committee proposed a budget $4.0 million below the request for FY2013. Concerns were raised about a backlog of responses to congressional inquiries and enforcement issues, specifically regarding aerial compliance monitoring. The committee directed EPA to submit a report on aerial monitoring activities, which has been used for nearly a decade as a cost-effective enforcement tool. The FY2013 funding for Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs was $507.0 million less than the President's request and $866.3 million less than the FY2012 enacted level. The funding supports local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects to comply with the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. H.R. 6091 proposed $689.0 million for Clean Water SRF grants, 41% below the President's request, and $829.0 million for Drinking Water SRF grants. The House Appropriations Committee noted a decrease in funding for Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs compared to previous years. They highlighted the additional funding received in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and expressed concerns about the sustainability of funding these accounts through regular appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee highlighted concerns about the sustainability of funding for Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs. FY2013 funding levels remained the same as FY2008, with objections raised about proposed reductions. Recent years saw an infusion of resources through the ARRA of 2009, but FY2013 request and enacted levels were smaller than total FY2009 appropriations. The ongoing issue of federal assistance for Drinking Water SRF capitalization grants in P.L. 111-5 is highlighted. Advocates argue for maintaining or increasing federal assistance due to the significant long-term needs in water infrastructure, while others call for more self-reliance among state and local governments. Reductions in federal funding for SRFs are also mentioned in light of federal deficit concerns. House committee-reported H.R. 6091 would have made changes to the funding levels for the SRFs, removing a requirement for \"green\" infrastructure funding. It also proposed that 20-30% of SRF funds be used for additional subsidies to eligible recipients. This bill would impact EPA grant funds within the STAG account. The President's FY2013 request included funding for Alaska Native Villages and U.S./Mexico Border water infrastructure grants projects, but the House Appropriations Committee did not provide funding for these projects. Enacted appropriations for FY2011 and FY2012 had included funding for these areas, with $10.0 million for Alaska Native Villages and $10.0 million for U.S./Mexico border wastewater infrastructure projects in FY2013. Some Members and state stakeholder groups have concerns about the adequacy of federal grant funding for states. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about federal grant funding for pollution control activities, including Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs, categorical grants, Brownfields projects, and diesel emissions reduction grants. H.R. 6091 proposed $994.4 million to support state programs. The House Appropriations committee proposed $994.4 million for state and tribal categorical grant programs within the STAG account, which is below the President's budget. EPA categorical funds support various environmental activities such as monitoring, permitting, training, and pollution control. These grants also assist multimedia projects like pollution prevention and enforcement programs. Table 3 compares H.R. 6091 with the President's FY2013 budget request and the past three fiscal years for 20 categorical grant programs. The House committee proposed reductions for most grants, funding them at FY2012 levels except for a few exceptions. They eliminated Beach Protection grants but restored Radon grant funding to $8.0 million. The Administration proposed to terminate funding for the Beach Protection categorical grant for FY2013, citing that non-federal agencies can now run their own programs after 10 years of federal assistance. They also suggested eliminating the Radon categorical grant, stating that states have the expertise to continue efforts without federal assistance. The remaining federal role in mitigating radon risks would focus on coordinating existing federal housing programs. The House committee-reported bill proposed significant reductions in State and Local Air Quality Management grants, with a $100.8 million decrease below the FY2013 request. The President's FY2013 request aimed to support various initiatives related to air quality management, including permitting greenhouse gas emissions sources and implementing stricter Clean Air Act regulations. Additionally, H.R. 6091 suggested a $61.0 million reduction in funding. The House committee-reported H.R. 6091 proposed a $61.0 million reduction for Section 106 Water Pollution Control Grants, supporting efforts to improve water quality and address nutrient runoff. The President's FY2013 request included a $26.9 million increase for these grants to address nutrient loads and strengthen state programs. The House Appropriations Committee omitted language from the FY2013 request. The House Appropriations Committee did not agree to the President's proposed increase for the Tribal Assistance Grant Program (GAP) in FY2013. The Administration's proposed increase was aimed at enhancing program resources to build tribal capacity and leverage other funding for environmental and health protection. EPA actions under the Clean Air Act received attention, including addressing greenhouse gas emissions and hazardous air pollutants. During the 112th Congress, issues related to emissions, including mercury and particulate matter, were a focus of proposed legislation and appropriations debates. The House committee-reported bill proposed provisions for EPA's use of FY2013 funds for regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act. These provisions included directives for evaluations and reporting to the committee, similar to those in the FY2012 Interior appropriations law. The FY2013 appropriations bill included provisions similar to those in previous years, with a focus on climate change and air quality regulations by the EPA. Specific restrictions were proposed, such as prohibiting permits for emissions from livestock and regulating GHGs from new motor sources. The House committee expressed skepticism about new climate change programs and funding, proposing regulations for asbestos in residential buildings and emission standards for electric utility generating units. Additionally, they suggested a pilot project for the North American Emission Control Area and revisions to air quality models. The House committee proposed cutting climate change funding by 29% in H.R. 6091, citing concerns about duplicative programs and lack of coordination. Funding for climate change programs nearly doubled from $192.0 million to $372.0 million between FY2008 and FY2011. EPA receives appropriations for climate change programs, with a relatively small share of funding compared to other agencies. The funds are distributed across various program activities, making it challenging to compare overall funding levels. Congress specifies line-items for certain activities in the appropriations process, allowing for comparisons. The House committee-reported bill for FY2013 compared appropriations for air quality and climate change programs within various EPA accounts. The bill allocated $372.5 million for clean air and climate programs, lower than the President's request of $440.2 million and the FY2012 appropriation of $410.5 million. The committee did not provide increased funding for the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule implementation. The House committee-reported bill for FY2013 proposed funding allocations for air quality and climate change programs within various EPA accounts. The bill included $95.0 million for \"Research: Air, Climate, and Energy\" in the S&T account, lower than the FY2013 requested amount of $105.9 million. Additionally, there was a $27.1 million increase for Climate Change and Air Quality in the EPM account. The proposed funding levels varied across different program activities compared to previous fiscal years. The House committee-reported bill for FY2013 proposed $200.7 million for State and Local Air Quality Management grants, $100.8 million less than the FY2013 request. No funds were allocated for greenhouse gas permitting grants or the GHG reporting rule. States use these federal funds for their air pollution control programs. The National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA) highlighted the decline in federal grants for state and local air quality programs authorized by the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA requested a $65.8 million increase for FY2013 to support implementing stricter air quality standards and monitoring compliance with air toxics regulations. This increase would also assist states and tribes in permitting sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The House committee proposed $30.0 million for the Diesel Emission Reduction Grants program for FY2013, $15.0 million more than the FY2013 request. The ARRA of 2009 provided an additional $300.0 million in supplemental funds for these grants in FY2009. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized $200.0 million annually for these grants from FY2007 through FY2011. The House committee-reported bill also would have reinstated funding for state indoor radon grants at the FY2012 level of $8.0 million. The House committee proposed funding for various air quality programs in the President's FY2013 budget request, with much focus on EPA regulatory actions related to air quality and climate change. The debate includes EPA's responses to a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision on greenhouse gases as \"air pollutants\" under the Clean Air Act. The EPA's \"endangerment finding\" on GHGs raised concerns about compliance costs and economic impacts. The Superfund program assesses and cleans up hazardous substance sites, funded by the Superfund Trust Fund. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $1.16 billion for the Superfund account in FY2013, slightly less than the President's request. The proposed funding for the Superfund account in FY2013 was $11.5 million less than the President's request and $48.9 million less than the FY2012 enacted appropriation. This funding trend has been decreasing since FY2010, with annual levels averaging $1.25 billion in the previous decade. The Superfund program cleans up hazardous sites and enforces liability for cleanup costs, with state programs complementing federal efforts. The EPA's Superfund program aims to identify responsible parties for cleanup costs, using their funds or Superfund appropriations. If no responsible parties are found, EPA can use Superfund money for cleanup, especially at high-risk sites on the National Priorities List. The EPA's Superfund program funds the cleanup of high-risk sites on the National Priorities List. Federal facilities on the list are funded separately from the Superfund program by the agencies that administer them. The annual funding for federal facility cleanup exceeds EPA's Superfund appropriations by several billion dollars. EPA oversees the cleanup of federal facilities through the Superfund program in collaboration with the states. The Superfund account also funds EPA's homeland security responsibilities, operational expenses, and enforcement of cleanup liability under CERCLA. Enforcement is a key aspect of the Superfund program to ensure responsible parties pay for contamination cleanup. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a decrease in the Superfund account for EPA's operational expenses and enforcement of cleanup liability in FY2013. While a decrease in enforcement budget may save money in the short term, it could lead to more costs being shifted to taxpayers in the future if fewer parties contribute to cleanup. The committee proposed an overall decrease in the Superfund account but recommended an increase for long-term remedial actions at NPL sites, albeit at a lower funding level than FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee recommended lower funding levels for cleanup activities within the Superfund account in FY2013, including a decrease in operational expenses and enforcement of cleanup liability. While the committee proposed an increase for long-term remedial actions at NPL sites, it did not include statutory authority in the bill itself to transfer funds to the Science and Technology account and the Office of Inspector General account, a departure from past appropriations acts. The House Appropriations Committee recommended lower funding levels for cleanup activities within the Superfund account in FY2013. The committee presented funding levels as transfers in tables, presuming EPA would execute the transfers under different authority. Transfers must be authorized by law. Table 5 shows proposed funding levels for the Superfund account compared to previous years. Selected issues in the appropriations debate include funding for long-term remedial actions at NPL sites and overall cleanup progress. The Superfund program involves cleanup progress at NPL sites, financial responsibility requirements, management of settlement funds, and the use of Alternative agreements. CERCLA authorizes Remedial and Removal actions at sites, with Remedial actions addressing long-term risks and Removal actions addressing immediate hazards. Only NPL-listed sites are eligible for Superfund appropriations for Remedial actions. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $546.8 million for Remedial projects in FY2013, an increase of $15.0 million above the President's request, but $18.2 million less than the FY2012 enacted appropriation. The committee expressed concern about the President's requested cuts for Remedial projects and stated that the distribution of funds for the Superfund account was incorrect. The House Appropriations Committee proposed a $1.1 million reduction for Removal projects in FY2013, following the President's request. EPA acknowledged that the decrease in funding for Remedial projects could impact long-term cleanup efforts. Despite budget constraints, ongoing Remedial projects would be prioritized, with no new construction projects planned for FY2013. New Remedial projects could still begin at sites funded by responsible parties. The agency proposed a decrease in funding for Remedial projects due to state budget constraints, leading to some sites being deferred to the federal Superfund program. EPA will prioritize ongoing projects and enforce liability of responsible parties first. The debate over Superfund funding focuses on cleanup pace and adequacy at NPL sites, tracked by \"construction completion.\" Operation and maintenance of remedies may continue for years after completion. The annual number of construction completions for Superfund sites has been declining since the late 1990s, raising concerns about the adequacy of annual appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the slowed pace of construction completions in FY2013, stating it is the wrong policy for addressing the nation's most contaminated hazardous waste sites. The House Appropriations Committee recommended higher funding for Remedial projects at hazardous waste sites, citing concerns about the slow pace of construction completions. Factors such as site complexity and technological capabilities also impact cleanup timelines. The completion of construction at individual projects may not necessarily indicate overall site progress. Section 447 of H.R. 6091 would have prohibited EPA from using funds for Superfund financial responsibility requirements for facilities managing hazardous substances. Section 108(b) of CERCLA directed the President to identify facilities subject to these requirements by December 11, 1983, for maintaining evidence of financial responsibility. EPA is delegated implementation of Section 108(b) by executive order. The court found that EPA had a non-discretionary duty to identify classes of facilities for financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA. EPA identified hardrock mining facilities as the initial class, but it was years past the deadline. The court found that EPA had a non-discretionary duty to identify classes of facilities for financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA. However, the court rejected plaintiffs' claim for EPA to take the next step of promulgating these requirements, deeming it a discretionary duty. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for Superfund financial responsibility requirements until EPA completes an analysis of the financial and credit markets' capacity. The committee expressed concerns about imposing new financial responsibility requirements on industries due to current economic conditions. There are questions about whether existing requirements from other statutes could fulfill the need for similar requirements under CERCLA. The adequacy of existing requirements remains an issue for facility owners' liability in case of hazardous substance releases. Supporters argue that Superfund requirements are necessary to prevent shifting cleanup costs to taxpayers. The EPA manages private settlement funds from responsible parties to finance cleanup of sites under CERCLA. Funds can be reclassified or transferred to the Superfund Trust Fund for discretionary appropriations. The EPA reported depositing $3.7 billion in private settlement funds into Special Accounts, with $1.8 billion remaining for cleanup work. Special Account funds are meant for long-term site cleanup and may be spent over several years or decades. This balance does not reflect annual funding available to EPA from Special Accounts. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the pace of spending the $1.8 billion balance in Special Accounts for future cleanup work. They directed the EPA to consider reprioritizing funds for near-term risks at other sites. The use of Special Account funds is governed by site-specific settlements, and reallocating funds would depend on individual settlement terms. Special Account funds are not subject to agency reprogramming authorities like discretionary appropriations. Reallocation of these funds for other purposes may require appropriations in later years to ensure EPA can perform necessary work for human health and environmental protection. The House Appropriations Committee is interested in EPA's use of Superfund Alternative agreements, allowing responsible parties to perform cleanups without EPA listing sites on the NPL. The House Appropriations Committee is interested in EPA's use of Superfund Alternative agreements, which allow responsible parties to perform cleanups without EPA listing sites on the NPL. These agreements address cleanup liability, free up Superfund appropriations, and may help avoid the stigma of an NPL listing. EPA reported 51 Superfund Alternative agreements covering 67 sites in FY2013. The EPA's use of Superfund Alternative agreements allows responsible parties to perform cleanups without EPA listing sites on the NPL. This approach addresses cleanup liability, frees up Superfund appropriations, and may help avoid the stigma of an NPL listing. EPA reported 51 Superfund Alternative agreements covering 67 sites in FY2013. The number of sites covered under these agreements is a small fraction of the more than 1,600 sites historically listed on the NPL by the EPA, including federal facilities and deleted sites. Listing a site on the NPL is not necessary for funding if responsible parties are willing to perform the cleanup. EPA can enter into settlements with responsible parties under CERCLA to allow them to perform the cleanup, and settlements are commonly used at many NPL sites to address cleanup liability. The key difference with the Superfund Alternative approach is that EPA chooses not to pursue NPL listing as long as the responsible party satisfactorily performs the cleanup according to the agreement. The Superfund Alternative approach allows responsible parties to clean up sites without being listed on the NPL. EPA believes this can save time and resources, but some are concerned about reduced transparency and awareness of hazards. The debate over reinstating industry taxes for the Superfund program has been ongoing for over 15 years. The expired taxes once provided the majority of funding for the program, and Congress has been using tax revenues from the General Fund to make up for the shortfall. The controversy revolves around whether these taxes ensure that polluters pay for cleanup or unfairly burden costs. The President's FY2013 budget proposed reinstating Superfund taxes through 2022, with estimated revenues of $21 billion. Several bills were introduced in Congress for reauthorizing Superfund taxes. EPA also administers a cleanup program for brownfield sites with contamination that may hinder economic development. The Brownfields program focuses on providing federal financial assistance for \"orphan\" sites where cleanup needs remain unaddressed. EPA awards competitive grants for assessment and remediation of eligible brownfields sites, job training, and technical assistance. Formula-based grants are also awarded to help with cleanup efforts. The House Appropriations Committee proposed a total of $131.2 million for EPA's Brownfields program, $35.3 million less than the President's FY2013 request. This decrease is attributed to reductions in competitive grants and overall appropriations. The committee expressed support for the program but at a reduced rate. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $131.2 million for EPA's Brownfields program in FY2013, $35.3 million less than the President's request. The committee also included language in its bill to limit EPA's use of grant funds for petroleum sites to 25%. The proposed appropriations for EPA's Brownfields program in H.R. 6091 were compared to previous years' funding levels. The House committee proposed $104.1 million from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund for EPA activities in FY2013, along with $12.3 million for EPA staff and extramural expenses within the EPM account. An additional $1.5 million was proposed within the STAG account for categorical grants to support state implementation of UST leak prevention and detection regulations. The LUST Trust Fund was established by Congress to provide funds for EPA and states to conduct cleanups in cases where no responsible party is identified or fails to comply with cleanup orders. The fund is supported by a motor fuels tax and had a balance of $3.33 billion as of FY2012. EPA and states use the funds primarily to oversee and enforce cleanup activities conducted by responsible parties. The LUST Trust Fund was established by Congress to provide funds for EPA and states to conduct cleanups in cases where no responsible party is identified or fails to comply with cleanup orders. Funds are used for emergency actions, clean up abandoned tank sites, and pursue cost recovery actions. Regulations have led to a decline in releases from USTs, with cleanup initiated or completed at 82.5% of confirmed release sites. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded leak prevention provisions and imposed new responsibilities on states and EPA. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded leak prevention provisions for underground storage tanks (USTs) and authorized the use of the LUST Trust Fund to support state implementation of new requirements. Congress now appropriates funds from the trust fund for both the LUST cleanup program and the UST leak prevention and detection program. Funding for the UST program has shifted from general revenues to the trust fund, leading to a perennial issue of balancing appropriations with tax receipts and interest earned on the fund. The trust fund for state leak prevention and cleanup programs faces challenges due to a backlog of sites needing remediation and increased resources required for UST leak prevention. The impact of alternative fuels on storage tank infrastructure may lead to more leaks and a greater need for cleanup funds in the future. EISA mandates for biofuel use present technical issues for USTs and fuel infrastructure. Ethanol blending is the most common option, but storage tanks may not be designed to handle these blends effectively. The EPA is concerned about the structural integrity of storage tanks with ethanol blends above 10%. Half of the tanks are 20 years old and have not been tested for compatibility with higher ethanol blends. There is a risk of leaks contaminating groundwater, potentially requiring cleanup funds from state programs and the LUST Trust Fund. EPA is working on assessing UST compatibility with alternative fuels. The Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account includes funding for geographic-specific/ecosystem programs to address environmental and human health risks in the United States. Collaboration among EPA, state and local governments, communities, and nonprofit organizations is common in these programs. A comparison of FY2013 funding proposed in H.R. 6091 with previous years' appropriations for specific program areas is presented in Table 8. President Bush established a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force in 2004 to develop a strategy for federal Great Lakes protection. The FY2010 budget requested a Great Lakes Restoration Initiative involving EPA and eight other federal agencies to target significant ecosystem problems through grants and agreements with various organizations. This initiative consolidates funding for existing federal Great Lakes programs, including EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office and the Great Lakes Legacy Act. The proposed $250.0 million for FY2013 is aimed at Great Lakes restoration efforts. The House committee proposed $250.0 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in FY2013, which is $50.0 million less than requested and $49.5 million less than the FY2012 enacted level. Concerns have been raised about the reduced funding levels since FY2011. President Obama issued Executive Order 13508 in May 2009 for Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration. Despite past restoration efforts, the Bay's overall health remains degraded. The House committee also proposed $50.0 million for Chesapeake Bay restoration in FY2013.
