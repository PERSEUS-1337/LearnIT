The new section \"PART E--CLASS SIZE REDUCTION\" aims to reduce class sizes by hiring qualified teachers, training 100,000 teachers, and improving teaching in grades 1 through 3 to achieve an average of 18 students per classroom. Additionally, a reservation of not more than 1 percent of funds is made for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and outlying areas.

If the amount available is insufficient, there will be a ratable reduction in payments. The Secretary shall ratably reduce amounts if insufficient to pay full eligible amounts for States in a fiscal year. Additional funds are allotted based on the percentage of the amount available compared to the previous year. The Secretary will ratably reduce excess amounts to States based on percentages received in the previous fiscal year under different sections. If the excess amount is insufficient, reductions will be made proportionally to eligible amounts for all States. The Secretary will ratably reduce excess amounts to States based on previous fiscal year percentages. States must allocate 100 percent of funds to local educational agencies, with 80 percent based on the number of children from low-income families. The Secretary will allocate funds to local educational agencies based on the number of children in the school district compared to the state total. 20 percent of funds will be allocated based on the enrollments of children in public and private schools. The agency can use funds to help pay for fully qualified teachers to reduce class size or for activities related to teaching in smaller classes.

The local educational agency can use funds to recruit, hire, and train fully qualified teachers, including special education teachers, to improve educational achievement. They must ensure that all teachers have the necessary knowledge and skills to teach effectively in their subject areas, in accordance with the Higher Education Act of 1965. There is a limitation on the use of funds for testing and professional development activities, with a maximum of 25 percent allowed for certain activities. A local educational agency can use more than 25 percent of funds to help teachers who are not fully qualified if a certain percentage of classes are taught by unqualified teachers or if state certification requirements are waived for some teachers. A local educational agency that has already reduced class size in early elementary grades may use funds to further reduce class size, improve teacher quality, or carry out professional development activities. Each agency must use funds to supplement, not supplant, state and local funds for specified activities. Funds cannot be used to increase salaries or provide benefits to teachers not hired under this section, except for professional development. The section allows funds to be used for teacher salaries hired under specific provisions. States must report biennially on activities funded and progress in reducing class size and increasing qualified teachers. The local educational agency must notify parents if their child has been taught by a substitute teacher or a teacher who is not fully qualified for 2 or more consecutive weeks. Under this section, funds are available for professional development activities with equitable participation of private nonprofit schools. A local educational agency receiving funds can use up to 3% for administrative costs. To receive funds, the agency must include a program to reduce class size by hiring qualified teachers. Funds cannot be used to pay teachers unless they are fully qualified. In this section, the term 'fully qualified' refers to teachers who have obtained certification, passed the State licensing exam, and hold a license. For elementary school teachers, it means holding a bachelor's degree and demonstrating knowledge and skills required to teach core academic subjects at the elementary level. A fully qualified middle or secondary school teacher must hold a bachelor's degree and demonstrate high competency in all subject areas they teach through performance on an academic subject test or completion of an academic major in each subject area. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 is set at $2,000,000,000 to carry out this part."
