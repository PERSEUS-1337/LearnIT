The Act \"Reciprocity Ensures Streamlined Use of Lifesaving Treatments Act of 2015\" introduces reciprocal marketing approval for covered products, allowing approval based on existing approvals in certain countries. The covered product must meet certain criteria for reciprocal marketing approval, including not being banned, having no safety concerns, and addressing public health needs. The Secretary may decline reciprocal marketing approval if the covered product is not safe or effective, or if there is no reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices. Approval may be conditioned on postmarket studies. The Secretary may decline reciprocal marketing approval for a covered product if it is not safe or effective, or if there is no reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices. Approval may be conditioned on postmarket studies, including those under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. If approval is declined, the Secretary must report the denial to Congress and provide necessary information for a request for reciprocal marketing approval. The Secretary must issue an order granting or declining reciprocal marketing approval for a covered product within 30 days of receiving a request. Approval may be subject to Congressional disapproval. During this period, labeling and device classification are also addressed. During the 30-day period, the Secretary and sponsor negotiate labeling and device classification for a covered product seeking reciprocal marketing approval. The Secretary will classify the device and determine if it needs clearance or approval under specific sections for lawful marketing. The Secretary's decision to decline reciprocal marketing approval can be overturned by a joint resolution of disapproval, following specific procedures outlined in the subsection. The provisions of this Act apply to a covered product with reciprocal marketing approval in the same way as they apply to products with approval under specific sections of the Act. The Secretary will conduct outreach to encourage sponsors of covered products eligible for reciprocal marketing approval to request such approval. A covered product refers to a drug, biological product, or device."
