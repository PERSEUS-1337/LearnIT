The Gas Tax Replacement Act of 2014 eliminates the manufacturers and retail taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, along with making conforming amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Gas Tax Replacement Act of 2014 eliminates fuel taxes and makes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments include changing the heading of subsection (a) to \"Special Motor Fuels\" and specifying a tax rate of 18.3 cents per gallon. These changes apply to fuel sold or used after December 31, 2015. SEC. 3. CARBON TAX ON HIGHWAY FUELS. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a carbon dioxide equivalent rate for total life-cycle emissions of carbon dioxide at $50 per metric ton. The amendment introduces a carbon dioxide equivalent rate for total life-cycle emissions of greenhouse gases in crude oil or petroleum products subject to tax under subsection (a) for refining into gasoline or diesel fuel. Total emissions are determined by the EPA. The Gas Tax Replacement Act of 2014 includes an adjustment for inflation in the carbon dioxide equivalent rate for total life-cycle emissions of greenhouse gases in crude oil or petroleum products subject to tax. The dollar amount is increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The Gas Tax Replacement Act of 2014 adjusts the carbon dioxide equivalent rate for greenhouse gas emissions in crude oil or petroleum products subject to tax. Amounts increased are rounded to the nearest dollar. \"SEC. 4611A. CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE FUELS.\" A tax is imposed on methanol, ethanol, and biodiesel produced in the US and those imported for consumption. The tax rate is $50 per metric ton of total life-cycle emissions of carbon dioxide and an equivalent amount for other greenhouse gases in these fuels. The tax imposed on methanol, ethanol, and biodiesel in the US and imported products is based on total life-cycle emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The tax is paid by the producer for US production and by the person entering the product for consumption or warehousing for imported products. The tax imposed on methanol, ethanol, and biodiesel in the US and imported products is based on total life-cycle emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The tax is paid by the producer for US production and by the person entering the product for consumption or warehousing for imported products. Additionally, a new item is inserted after section 4611. The tax on alternative fuels in the US is based on carbon dioxide emissions. A new rule is added for gasoline used on farms, specifying the tax rate based on carbon dioxide equivalent. The tax on alternative fuels in the US is based on carbon dioxide emissions. A new rule is added for gasoline used on farms, specifying the tax rate based on carbon dioxide equivalent. The tax imposed under section 4611 is attributed to subsection (c)(1)(C) on a gallon of gas refined from a barrel of crude oil or petroleum product. The tax rate for gasoline used on farms is based on carbon dioxide equivalent. The tax imposed under section 4611 is applied to a gallon of gasoline refined from a barrel of crude oil or petroleum product. Additionally, a credit is provided for alcohol fuel, biodiesel, and alternative fuel mixtures against the tax imposed by section 4611. The tax credit for biodiesel mixtures is determined based on the number of gallons used in production for sale or business purposes. A credit is also provided for alcohol, biodiesel, and alternative fuel mixtures against the tax imposed under section 4611A. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a special rule for the carbon dioxide equivalent rate for fuel refined from crude oil or produced from methanol, ethanol, or biodiesel. This rule applies when the sale or use of such fuel would trigger a payment under the tax code, but the fuel was already taxed under a different section. The tax rate is adjusted accordingly in these cases. The tax rate for fuel subject to tax under sections 4611 or 4611A is adjusted based on the amount of fuel or fraction of a gallon in the barrel. These amendments will be effective starting January 1, 2016. SEC. 4. LIFE-CYCLE EMISSIONS. The Administrator must provide a report on carbon dioxide emissions for each covered transportation fuel, considering regional differences in emissions. Additionally, the Administrator will determine which transportation fuels meet on-road transportation requirements. The Administrator will update a report on carbon dioxide emissions for covered transportation fuels, including specifications on total life-cycle emissions for each newly determined fuel. Definitions include Administrator, biofuel, and covered transportation fuel. The term \"transportation fuel\" includes gasoline, diesel fuel, biofuel, and other fuels that have a significant market share for on-road transportation. \"Greenhouse gas\" refers to gases as defined in the Clean Air Act. \"Life-cycle emissions\" encompass emissions from all stages of fuel production, transport, storage, and use, including land use changes and resource extraction."
