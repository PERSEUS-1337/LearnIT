Compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is not a consideration. A decision to proceed with closure or consolidation must follow an investigation. The Postal Service must investigate the impact of closing or consolidating a post office on the community, employees, and government policy. A decision to close or consolidate a post office must be made in writing and include findings on specified considerations. Notice of the decision and findings must be posted in the affected post office and mailed to all served persons at least 90 days before a final determination is made, allowing for comments. The notice must include a proposal to close or consolidate the post office and instructions for submitting comments. The final determination to close or consolidate a post office must be made in writing after considering any comments received during a 90-day period.
