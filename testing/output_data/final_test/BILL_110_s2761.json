This tax imposes rules and definitions for windfall profits. The \"Recapture Excess Profits and Invest in Roads (REPAIR) Act of 2008\" introduces an excise tax of 25 percent on windfall profits for applicable taxpayers in the United States, including integrated oil companies and other crude oil producers or refiners with over $1,000,000,000 in gross receipts.
