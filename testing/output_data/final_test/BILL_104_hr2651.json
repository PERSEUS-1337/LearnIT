    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"NAFTA Accountability Act\". The Congress finds that the NAFTA has led to a trade deficit exceeding $30 billion in 1995 with Mexico and Canada, draining $2.5 billion monthly from the US economy. Additionally, the agreement lacks safeguards to address negative economic impacts of currency exchange rate shifts among the NAFTA Parties. The United States has supported the Mexican peso with $30 billion in loans to protect its economy, despite the devaluation offsetting expected trade benefits from NAFTA. There has been a rapid increase in one-way trade of Canadian grain exports to the US, disrupting markets. The implementation of NAFTA has led to disruptions in markets and importation channels, with surges in Mexican fruit and vegetable imports threatening domestic production. The importation of livestock and meat products from NAFTA Parties has worsened issues for US livestock producers, resulting in a substantial loss of over 300,000 high-paying jobs in the United States. Since the implementation of NAFTA, there has been a significant impact on employment and wages in the United States and Mexico. Many companies that expected job growth did not see an increase in employment. US workers experienced a sharp decline in real hourly wages, while over 2 million workers in Mexico became unemployed with a 50% cut in real wages. This has led to a decrease in living standards in the US, Canada, and Mexico. The NAFTA aimed to enhance competitiveness in the global market, but it has not improved the ability of the US manufacturing sector to compete effectively. The NAFTA has led to a net loss of 227,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States and an influx of imports of manufactured goods. It has also undermined public welfare by allowing imports of food products that do not meet US health standards and accelerated the relocation of manufacturing facilities to Mexico. The NAFTA has led to an influx of illegal drugs into the United States from Mexico, with a significant portion of cocaine and marijuana entering through Mexico. This has been facilitated by limited inspections on trucks under the NAFTA agreement. The NAFTA aims to promote sustainable development and protect basic rights, but these objectives are not being met, especially in Mexico. The Congress approved the NAFTA to bring economic, social, and environmental benefits to the US, but these goals are not being achieved. Therefore, the NAFTA should not be expanded to include any other country. Based on the experience with NAFTA, further negotiation is needed to address trade imbalances, currency differences, and agricultural issues. Responsible officials must certify progress in economic, social, and environmental areas, or Congress may withdraw approval of NAFTA expansion. Conditions for continued participation in NAFTA are outlined in Section 3. The approval of NAFTA by Congress will cease on October 1, 1997, unless specific conditions are met. The President must provide written notice of withdrawal by April 1, 1997, and renegotiate the terms of NAFTA before December 31, 1996. The approval of NAFTA by Congress will cease on October 1, 1997, unless specific conditions are met. The President must provide written notice of withdrawal by April 1, 1997, and renegotiate the terms of NAFTA in accordance with specified subsections. Various Secretaries and Administrators must provide certifications as outlined in subsection (b). The President is authorized to renegotiate NAFTA terms to address trade deficits exceeding 10% of US exports to another NAFTA Party. The Attorney General must provide certification as outlined in subsection (b)(7). The President is authorized to renegotiate NAFTA terms to address trade deficits exceeding 10% of US exports to another Party. This includes correcting currency distortions and agricultural provisions by implementing emergency adjustments of tariffs, quotas, and other measures. The President is authorized to renegotiate NAFTA terms to address trade deficits exceeding 10% of US exports to another Party, including adjusting tariffs, quotas, and other measures. This includes establishing provisions to prevent unfair displacement of US production by imports from NAFTA Parties and providing relief for impacted US producers. The Secretary of Commerce certifies to Congress if the number of jobs from increased exports of US manufactured goods to NAFTA Parties exceeds jobs lost due to imports since 1994, and if wage-earners' purchasing power has increased. If US exports of manufactured goods to NAFTA Parties exceed imports, the Secretary certifies increased domestic manufacturing. The Secretary certifies to Congress regarding job numbers and wage-earners' purchasing power in relation to NAFTA Parties. The Secretary excludes goods not originating in the US or destined for other countries in the certification process. Certification on health and environmental standards for imports from NAFTA Parties is determined by the Secretary of Agriculture and the FDA Administrator. The Secretary and Administrator will certify to Congress any food imports with additives or pesticide residues exceeding US standards or containing illegal substances. All foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, oilseeds, and meats, will be reviewed, with a focus on those with a history of violations. Additionally, if conditions in the US-Mexico border zone affecting public health have not worsened, the EPA Administrator will report to Congress. The EPA Administrator will certify to Congress if conditions in the US-Mexico border zone affecting public health have not worsened since January 1, 1994. The report will include information on pollution and health hazards, industrial site cleanup projects, and environmental improvement projects in the border zone. The EPA Administrator will provide information on the incidence of various health disorders and pollution in the US-Mexico border zone since January 1, 1990. This includes data on hepatitis, birth defects, diarrhea, tuberculosis, cholera, botulism, and other disorders related to pollution and inadequate infrastructure. The Attorney General of the United States will certify to Congress if increased imports from NAFTA Parties are not leading to more illegal drugs from Mexico or Canada. The Drug Enforcement Administration will review the flow of illegal drugs from Mexico and Canada in relation to trade with NAFTA Parties. Additionally, the President will certify regarding democracy and human freedoms after consultation. The President, after consulting with relevant agencies and organizations, will certify to Congress if the Government of Mexico meets certain criteria related to free and fair elections, protection of citizens' rights to political organization, free speech, media freedom, assembly, and human rights advancement.
