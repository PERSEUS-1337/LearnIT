    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal and Small Business Telework Promotion Act\". The Congress finds that billions of dollars are spent annually on transportation needs, with road congestion costing over $63 billion in lost work time and fuel consumption. On-road vehicles contribute 34 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions, and teleworking could eliminate pollutants, save gas, and free up personal time. Telework can reduce congestion, decrease maintenance costs by $500 million annually, and save time for the average American commuter. The increase in information work allows for decentralization of paid work, leading to a reduction in peak commuter traffic. Telework reduces peak commuter traffic, congestion, and air pollution. Communities benefit from telework by giving workers more time with their families. Small businesses can retain valued employees and boost productivity with telework programs. Individuals with disabilities can also benefit from telework options. Telework benefits individuals with disabilities and small businesses, provides employment opportunities in rural areas, and is valued for worker productivity. The number of teleworkers in the Federal Government has steadily increased over time. SEC. 3. REDUCTION OF EMPLOYEE VEHICLE FUEL CONSUMPTION BY FEDERAL AGENCIES. Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to require federal agencies to reduce employee vehicle fuel consumption by 10% within a year through methods like telework, carpooling, and biking/walking to work. Federal agencies are required to reduce employee vehicle fuel consumption by 10% within a year through methods like telework, carpooling, biking/walking to work, fuel-efficient trip planning, public transportation use, and limiting travel days for vehicle travel outside the office. The Small Business Telework Pilot Program is established under Section 4. The Small Business Administration will conduct a pilot program in up to 5 regions to promote telework among small businesses and encourage offering telework options to employees. Special outreach will be made to businesses owned by or employing individuals with disabilities, including disabled American veterans, as well as agencies and organizations assisting individuals with disabilities. The Small Business Administration's pilot program aims to promote telework among small businesses by producing educational materials, conducting outreach, and acquiring telework technologies. Regions with a strong commitment to telework will be given priority for participation. Employers in regions with a strong commitment to telework are participating in the Small Business Administration's pilot program. A report will be submitted to Congress after 2 years, evaluating the program and recommending potential extensions to include all Small Business Administration regions. Definitions for \"disability\" and \"telework\" are provided in the section. The pilot program allows employees to work outside the office, reducing commuting needs. The program will end 2 years after funding starts, with $5,000,000 authorized for the Small Business Administration."
