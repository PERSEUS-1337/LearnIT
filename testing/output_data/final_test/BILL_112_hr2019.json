    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transportation Opportunity and Accountability Act of 2011.\" Congress acknowledges the importance of public investment in the US transportation system for equitable opportunities and economic prosperity. Regulations have been issued by the Department of Transportation to prevent discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in Federal transportation funding, in accordance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Enforcement of these regulations is crucial. Enforcement of Department of Transportation regulations under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is essential to prevent discrimination in the use of Federal funds. The absence of a private right of action could hinder the full protection of nondiscrimination rights, as demonstrated in the Supreme Court case Alexander v. Sandoval. The Supreme Court case Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), highlights the need for Congress to confirm a private right of action to address discrimination prohibited by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This is crucial to ensure that victims of discrimination have a remedy when faced with exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination in programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Effective enforcement of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination laws is essential to prevent discriminatory outcomes in transportation decisions and investments. Discriminatory outcomes in transportation decisions can lead to residential segregation, population displacement, and exclusion from transportation benefits based on race, color, or national origin. Lack of oversight can result in underemployment of minority workers and underrepresentation of disadvantaged businesses in Federal contracting. Ownership of automobiles varies by race, with lower rates for African-American and Latino households. Public transportation usage varies by race, with higher reliance among African-Americans, Latinos, and Asian-Americans compared to Caucasians. Investment in public transportation is crucial for providing access to job opportunities for communities dependent on mass transit. People of color make up a significant portion of transit riders, especially in urban areas. Exposure to harmful air pollutants from transportation investments disproportionately affects African-Americans and Latinos. African-American workers are underrepresented in the construction industry, impacting their hiring on transportation projects. Minority representation in transportation decision-making bodies is low, with Caucasians dominating voting memberships. Minorities, including Asian or Pacific Islanders, are underrepresented in State departments of transportation across all workforce categories, including leadership roles and hiring positions. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT RELATING TO TITLE VI OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964. The Secretary of Transportation will enhance monitoring, enforcement, and technical assistance to ensure compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for recipients of Federal financial assistance. $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. There is a private right of action to enforce Department of Transportation regulations for title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Any person aggrieved by the failure of a recipient of Federal financial assistance to comply with regulations prohibiting discrimination under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 may bring a civil action in Federal or State court. Recovery for intentional discrimination includes equitable and legal relief, attorney's fees, and costs. In cases of discrimination based on disparate impact, the aggrieved person can seek equitable relief, attorney's fees, and costs. States receiving Federal financial assistance must waive immunity for civil actions in Federal court. This subsection does not limit any other rights or remedies provided by law. SEC. 4. TRANSPORTATION EQUITY RESEARCH PROGRAM. The Secretary of Transportation conducts research on transportation planning's impact on low-income and minority populations, including transit-dependent groups. Activities include developing strategies for economic and community development, increasing participation in planning, providing training for equitable employment opportunities, and researching the impact of transportation projects. Research on transportation policy impact on vulnerable populations, including disaster preparedness, public health, and land use, with an authorization of $1,000,000 for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. SEC. 5. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT. The Secretary of Transportation will assess nondiscrimination and equal opportunity in federally funded transportation projects. This includes reviewing demographic data, discrimination complaints, and coordinating with the Secretary of Labor for equitable employment and contracting opportunities. A report is due within 4 years of enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress every 4 years on impediments to nondiscrimination in federally funded transportation projects, along with recommendations for improvement. Information collected for the assessment will be made available to the public. The Secretary will issue regulations for collecting and reporting information necessary for the assessment. Coordination with various agencies is required. $500,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2012 through 2016."
