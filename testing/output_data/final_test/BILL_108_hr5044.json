    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Hydroelectric and Environmental Enhancement Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to hydroelectric and environmental issues. Congress finds that Federal multi-purpose dams and reservoirs with hydroelectric generation provide necessary power, enhance recreational pursuits, and meet environmental needs. Hydroelectric generation is a renewable resource that helps meet growing power needs nationwide. Federal dams along the Savannah River generate electricity for consumers, offer recreational and environmental benefits, and have implemented technological advancements to protect aquatic resources. The value of Federal hydropower facilities can be enhanced for more hydroelectric generation and environmental protection. Study and report on increasing electric power production capability of existing federal facilities. The Secretaries of the Interior and the Army, in consultation with Federal power marketing administrations, will conduct a study on increasing electric power production at existing facilities. The study will identify facilities capable of generating additional hydroelectric power and estimate their potential. A report on the findings, conclusions, and recommendations must be submitted to Congress within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretaries of the Interior and the Army, in consultation with Federal power marketing administrations, will conduct a study to identify facilities capable of generating additional hydroelectric power. The report to Congress must include descriptions of activities, costs, and benefits related to producing new hydroelectric power. The report to Congress must include descriptions of activities, costs, and benefits related to producing new hydroelectric power, as well as the impact on various aspects such as irrigation, fish, wildlife, and water quality. Additionally, recommendations to increase hydroelectric power production and reduce costs at facilities under the Secretary's jurisdiction should be provided. SEC. 4. STUDY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INCREASED OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES IN HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECTS. The Secretaries of the Interior and the Army will study operational methods and water scheduling at hydroelectric power plants over 50 megawatts to optimize energy and capacity capabilities. They will identify measures to improve operational flexibility for optimization and submit a report within 18 months. Each Secretary will report on determinations and identifications related to hydroelectric power production's impact on various factors. They are also required to coordinate with Federal power marketing administrations to optimize the value of electric power produced by hydroelectric facilities."
