It introduced the budget resolution to coordinate budget decisions and set parameters for spending and revenue legislation. Congress enforces these parameters through points of order and allocations to committees. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established the budget resolution and enforcement mechanisms like points of order. Points of order are raised by Members to enforce prohibitions against certain legislation violating budget rules. This report focuses on the portion of the process stemming from the Congressional Budget Act. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established budget resolution and enforcement mechanisms, including points of order. These points of order prohibit certain actions or legislation inconsistent with budget requirements, as outlined in various measures and acts. Points of order in the Congressional Budget Act, as amended through the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, are permanent and not subject to expiration. Some points of order have limited applicability or have become moot due to expired limits they were meant to enforce. The freestanding point of order protecting the Social Security trust fund in the House is also permanent, while other points of order established under recent budget resolutions may have sunset provisions or limited application. The Budget Act's points of order apply to measures as a whole, including motions, amendments, or conference reports. When a point of order is sustained, the matter in question falls. Section 315 clarifies the application of points of order in the House, stating that a point of order against a bill \"as reported\" applies to the text made in order by the rule for amendment or passage. No waiver is needed if a substitute resolves the issue. The 111th Congress provision clarifies points of order under Title III of the Budget Act for measures considered under a special rule. Rule XXI, clause 8, specifies points of order for the form of a measure recommended by the reporting committee. In the Senate, Section 312(f) clarifies that a sustained point of order results in the measure being recommitted for further consideration. Section 312(d) and (e) of the 111th Congress provision allows the Senate to remedy issues that could provoke a point of order, ensuring that differences between House and Senate versions of a measure can be resolved. The Byrd Rule in the Budget Act applies to individual provisions in reconciliation bills or resolutions, allowing points of order to strike specific provisions if sustained. Points of order in the Senate can also target individual provisions rather than the entire measure, similar to Section 313(e) of the Budget Act. The Budget Act includes provisions for points of order against emergency spending designations, which can be waived in the Senate by a three-fifths vote. The Senate can waive the three-fifths requirement for certain points of order under the Budget Act by a vote of at least 60 Senators. This super-majority threshold was first established in 1985 and is currently set to expire in 2025. Points of order can also be waived by unanimous consent in the Senate. In the House, Budget Act points of order can be waived by unanimous consent or through the adoption of special rules. A waiver may protect a bill, specific provisions, or amendments from potential points of order. The House can grant waivers for amendments even if not granted for the underlying bill, including specific points of order or a \"blanket waiver\" to protect against any point of order."
