    "content": "President Clinton signed the FY2001 Department of Transportation (DOT) Appropriations Act into law on October 23, 2000, providing $57.978 billion for DOT, an increase of over 14% from FY2000 funding. The Act aligns with Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) and includes a provision to strengthen state drunk driver blood alcohol standards to 0.08%. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) can collect public comments on proposed hours of service rules but cannot take final action in FY2001. The FY2001 Act, signed by President Clinton, included additional appropriations for highway projects, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, and the Appalachian development highway system. It also provided funding for the Emergency Relief Federal Aid Highway Program and included a government-wide rescission of roughly $125 million from the DOT budget. Funding for the DOT budget comes from various sources, with the majority from dedicated transportation trust funds. The majority of DOT funding comes from transportation trust funds, including the highway trust fund, transit account, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund. Highway and transit funding make up the largest portion of DOT appropriations, accounting for 60% to 70% of federal transportation spending. Most programs are funded through contract authority linked to the highway trust fund, allowing for future project payments without immediate contracts. Under Title 23 U.S.C., authorized funds are automatically available each fiscal year for transportation projects without the need for appropriations legislation. Unlike other federal programs, transportation appropriations already have spending authority in place. Changes in transportation budget spending were previously made by combining budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations to control outlays. The limitation on obligations controls outlays to align with congressional budget agreements, giving appropriators flexibility in allocating funds for federal transportation activities. TEA-21 introduced new budget categories and statutory limitations on obligations, amending the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. TEA-21 amends the budget process by creating new budget categories for highway and mass transit, with statutory limitations on obligations from FY1999 to FY2003. It also introduces Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to redistribute excess trust fund revenues to states for highway programs. However, DOT requests in FY2000 and FY2001 proposed redirecting RABA funds to other initiatives, which were not adopted in the appropriations acts. The FY2000 and FY2001 DOT appropriations acts did not adopt the Administration's proposed redirection of RABA funds. TEA-21 establishes a discretionary spending guarantee for core highway and transit programs, with \"firewalls\" to prevent funds from being used for other purposes. Additional funds above the firewall level can be allocated through the annual appropriations process, changing the role of House and Senate committees in determining spending levels for highway and transit programs. The FY2000 and FY2001 Appropriations Acts changed the role of House and Senate appropriations committees in determining spending levels for highway and transit programs. The FY2000 Act redistributed funds among programs and added significant spending projects, while the FY2001 Act included $1.37 billion in \"miscellaneous highway project funds\" for earmarked projects and redirected funding between programs. The FY2000 and FY2001 Appropriations Acts changed the role of House and Senate appropriations committees in determining spending levels for highway and transit programs. The FY2000 Act redistributed funds among programs and added significant spending projects, while the FY2001 Act included $1.37 billion in \"miscellaneous highway project funds\" for earmarked projects and redirected funding between programs. FAIR21 (P.L. 106-181, signed April 5, 2000) guarantees FAA program spending, but the flexibility of appropriations committees is limited by TEA-21 firewalls, which restrict adjustments to DOT agency or program budgets. The concern for Coast Guard and Amtrak funding has lessened due to a government budget surplus. The FAIR21 guarantee for aviation spending relies on two point-of-order rules for the House and Senate, ensuring that all aviation budget resources are used and that FAA operations and maintenance are funded at authorized levels. This guarantee is considered weaker than TEA-21's guarantees for highway and transit programs. FAIR21 guarantees weaker than TEA-21 for highway and transit programs. Congress can waive points-of-order. Appropriators have some flexibility with FAA O&M funding. Supporters believe FAIR21 requires new spending on aviation programs. Transportation appropriators have control over Coast Guard, FRA, and smaller DOT agencies' spending. FY2001 Act provides increases for major DOT agencies except FRA budget. The FY2001 Act provides increases for major DOT agencies except for the FRA budget, which is funded slightly below its FY2000 level. Concerns arise for the Coast Guard due to lack of trust fund support and potential need for additional funding from military appropriations in the future. However, current surplus alleviates immediate budget worries. The FY2001 DOT appropriations debate was less contentious than last year's debate, with total funding substantially above the President's request and FY2000 levels. The budget surplus has abated concerns, leading to a less constrained budgetary environment. President Clinton signed the FY2001 DOT appropriations bill into law on October 23, 2000. The FY2001 DOT appropriations bill, signed into law on October 23, 2000, provided significant funding increases for various agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration. The Consolidated Appropriations Act included a government-wide rescission and additional DOT spending adjustments. The FY2001 DOT appropriations bill, signed into law on October 23, 2000, included significant funding increases for various agencies. The adjusted figures in the report are estimates due to official rescission adjustments for FY2001 in President Bush's FY2002 budget submission. The House and Senate appropriations bills were influenced by budget caps, leading to the passage of H.R. 4475. The conference agreement resolved policy issues reflected in differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The Senate version included language penalizing states for not enforcing a 0.08% blood alcohol limit. H.R. 4475 penalizes states for not adopting a 0.08% BAC law by reducing funding under federal highway programs. Penalties are phased in at a rate of 2% annually over four years. The Senate bill prohibits DOT from enforcing proposed hours of service regulations for commercial drivers in FY2001. FMCSA can collect public comments on proposed rules but cannot take final action during that fiscal year. The Senate bill included a provision that could have lowered AIP funding below the required level set by FAIR21, potentially shifting funds from the formula program to discretionary grants. The House version of H.R. 4475 restricted DOT spending on changing CAF\u00c9 standards, with the conference report also limiting any changes to the present standard. The conference agreement on H.R. 4475 includes additional appropriations for various highway projects, such as $1.37 billion for miscellaneous highways, $54.936 million for the Appalachian development highway system, $600 million for the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge replacement, and $720 million for the Emergency Relief Federal Aid Highway program. The agreement also allows for a new study of standards by the National Academy of Sciences. The conference agreement report language for H.R. 4475 earmarks specific dollar amounts for various projects under the control of the Federal Highway Administration, including the Federal Lands Program, Bridge Discretionary Program, Transportation and Community System Preservation Program, ferry boats and terminals, intelligent transportation systems, and National Corridor Planning and Development Program. Specific dollar amounts are also allocated for discretionary airport grants to high priority projects, transit capital investment grants, and other programs. Transit capital investment grants were earmarked in the agreement, with increased budget authority for specified projects. H.R. 4475 redirected RABA funds to core programs for states, with allocations for specific projects like the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge and Indian Roads. Total DOT funding more than doubled from FY1988 to FY2001. Table 2 shows Department of Transportation Appropriations from FY1988 to FY2001, including actual and enacted amounts, limitations on obligations, rescissions, and funding adjustments. The Coast Guard's increased responsibilities are also highlighted. The Coast Guard's funding for FY2001 was a major concern due to increased responsibilities for drug and illegal immigrant interdiction. The Administration requested $4.609 billion, representing a 15% increase from the previous year. The House approved $4.617 billion, slightly above the President's request, while the Senate approved $4.359 billion. The final enacted funding was $4.519 billion. In December 2000, the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act reduced Coast Guard funding to $4.511 billion. The budget request of $4.609 billion aimed to support activities against drug smuggling and fleet recapitalization. The House approved $3.192 billion, the Senate approved $3.040 billion. The conferees recommended a budget of $3.185 billion for the Coast Guard, which was reduced from the requested $3.192 billion. Funds for acquisition, construction, and improvement purposes were also allocated. Additionally, $414 million was recommended for research, test, and evaluation, with $17 million for environmental compliance and restoration activities. The Senate and conferees approved $21.3 million for the Coast Guard, $3 million more than FY2000 funds. The House had approved $19.7 million. For Coast Guard retirement, the budget sought $778 million, with the House and Senate approving it. The Administration requested $73 million for training and support of a Selected Reserve Force. The House and Senate approved $80.4 million, reduced to $80.2 million after a rescission. A key issue is the Coast Guard's management of replacing aging vessels and aircraft, with only $45 million requested for planning and analysis in FY2001. The Coast Guard requested about $45 million in FY2001 for planning and analysis of a replacement program, with anticipated purchases of nearly $10 billion over 20 years starting in FY2002. The General Accounting Office criticized the Coast Guard's handling of the program, and Congress required a comprehensive capital investment plan. The House FY2001 bill included language for a plan covering 2002-2006, with a rescission provision for non-compliance. The conferees included bill language but excluded the rescission provision. The Senate-passed bill aimed to withhold FY2001 planning funds until completion of a study. The Coast Guard planned to use new user fees for vessel recapitalization and infrastructure. The Administration proposed legislation for user fees on commercial cargo vessels and cruise ships, expecting to collect $212 million in FY2001 and $636 million annually. User fees for traditional Coast Guard services have been controversial. Congress passed FY2000 appropriations in P.L.106-69 (H.R. 2084) prohibiting the Coast Guard from implementing new user fees. The FY2001 DOT Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-346) allocated $725.6 million for FRA. H.R. 4475 included $521 million for Amtrak, rejecting the Administration's request for $468 million in RABA funding. The FRA FY2001 budget received a total of $756.6 million, which was later reduced to $755 million due to a government-wide rescission. Provisions allowing the use of CMAQ or STP funds for intercity rail passenger vehicles and facilities were eliminated during the House debate. In the Senate, there was discussion about using federal-aid highway funds for intercity passenger rail in FY2001. The Administration requested a $1.179 billion budget for FRA in FY2001, a 60% increase over FY2000. This increase was due to the Expanded Intercity Rail Passenger Service Program. There was a $50 million cut for Amtrak. The FRA primarily promotes and regulates railroad safety, with funds used for salaries, travel expenses, and safety monitoring. The FY2000 DOT Appropriations Act provides funding for FRA's safety and operations activities. The House specified $102.5 million, the Senate $99.4 million, and the enacted conference agreement provides $101.7 million. The last railroad safety reauthorization statute was enacted in 1994, and funding authority expired in FY1998. FRA's safety programs continue using existing authorities and annual appropriations. The FY2000 DOT Appropriations Act provides funding for FRA's safety and operations activities. The adequacy and effectiveness of FRA's grade-crossing activities are of interest, especially after the March 1999 crash in Bourbonnais, IL. FRA requested additional funding in its FY2001 budget to strengthen its grade crossing program, and the FY 2001 Act specifies $1.025 million for these activities. The FY 2001 Act specifies $1.025 million for FRA's safety program and education activities. The FRA conducts research on topics such as fatigue of railroad employees, technologies for controlling train movements, and track dynamics. The appropriations committees allocate funds for railroad R&D activities pertaining to safety. For FY2000, $22.5 million was allocated, and for FY2001, $25.3 million was allocated for railroad R&D. The conference agreement specifies $25.3 million for railroad R&D, including funding for High Speed Rail and Magnetic Levitation Transportation Technology Deployment Program. In FY2000, $27.1 million was allocated for the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program, with $22 million requested for FY2001. The House appropriated $22 million, the Senate $24.9 million, and the enacted agreement specifies $25.1 million for the high speed rail program. TEA-21 authorizes $20 million for the maglev program in FY2000 and $25 million in FY2001. Amtrak's FY2000 budget authority was $571 million compared to $609 million in FY1999. In FY1999, Amtrak had $1.1 billion available from the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 for new equipment and track improvements. The government provided $521 million for Amtrak in FY2001, but funding was reduced to just over $520 million due to a rescission. Federal financial operating assistance to Amtrak is prohibited after FY2002. GAO and the DOT Inspector General are not optimistic about Amtrak's ability to operate without federal assistance after FY2002. Congress created the Amtrak Reform Council in 1997 to address the future of intercity rail passenger service. The Amtrak Reform Council was created in 1997 to address the future of intercity rail passenger service. In its first annual report to Congress in January 2000, the Council highlighted Amtrak's stagnant ridership and the need for significant federal funds for new equipment and track improvements. The report also outlined issues the Council planned to study in 2000. The Amtrak Reform Council was established in 1997 to evaluate Amtrak's labor agreements and address the future of intercity rail passenger service. Federal funding is needed for new equipment and track upgrades, particularly on the Washington, DC to New York City route. The Council's budget authority increased from $450,000 in FY1999 to $750,000 in FY2000, with a request for $1 million in FY2001. The enacted figure for FY2001 was $750,000. The Amtrak Reform Council, established in 1997, assesses Amtrak's labor agreements, productivity, and ability to operate without federal assistance. If federal aid is needed after September 30, 2002, a reorganization plan must be submitted to Congress. The Administration proposed a $468 million grant program for intercity rail service funded by RABA funds. State matching funds were required for projects. The proposed funding for intercity rail projects required a 100% state match and had to provide public benefits exceeding costs. Funds were designated for equipment acquisition, infrastructure improvements, and planning. Maintenance expenses were excluded from funding use. No funding was allocated for FY2001, but a Senate amendment allowed states to use highway trust fund apportionments for capital expenses. The FY2001 Appropriations Act provided FHWA with $33.452 billion in budgetary resources. An amendment to allow states to use highway trust fund apportionments for intercity passenger rail service failed due to objections of legislating in an appropriations bill. Maintenance expenses were excluded from funding use. The FY2001 Appropriations Act allocated $33.452 billion to FHWA, with adjustments bringing the total to $33.425 billion. This represents a significant increase from FY2000, with additional funding mainly for earmarked highway projects outside of core TEA-21 programs. Notable increases include $1.37 billion for miscellaneous highway projects, $720 million for emergency relief, and $55 million for Appalachian development. The FY2001 Appropriations Act allocated $33.452 billion to FHWA, with adjustments bringing the total to $33.425 billion. This includes $720 million for emergency relief, $55 million for Appalachian development, and $600 million for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge reconstruction. The core FHWA spending also sees a significant increase, with the FY2001 limitation on obligations rising to almost $29.7 billion. Both House and Senate bills provided funding slightly above the Administration's proposal of $30.6 billion. The House and Senate bills closely tracked the Administration's proposal for FHWA funding, slightly above $30.6 billion. Both bills maintained an obligation funding level of $29.7 billion and ignored a request to redistribute FY2001 RABA funds. There was little controversy surrounding the FHWA budget, except for concerns over earmarking for specific programs. The Administration proposed a total FHWA budget of $30.358 billion for FY2001, representing a 5% increase from the previous year. The obligational limitation was set at $29.319 billion, with $1 billion for exempt programs. Core FHWA funding programs received significant increases under TEA-21 framework. Only $2.31 billion of RABA funds were assigned to highway programs, with $741 million transferred for non-highway activities within DOT agencies. The Administration proposed changes to the distribution of RABA funds within FHWA's jurisdiction for specific programs, such as Indian reservation roads and highway tax fuel evasion projects. This proposal was controversial and differed from previous redistribution attempts. The use of contract authority to fund proposed increases was also a concern. The Administration's proposal to potentially exceed TEA-21 funding levels was met with resistance from highway interest groups and members opposed to changing the framework. In FY2001, FHWA received $33.425 billion in total budgetary resources, continuing the growth from TEA-21. The FHWA funding saw a significant increase due to TEA-21 in 1998 and a budget surplus. Funding for FY2001 is almost $15 billion more than in FY1995. The FY2001 Act followed TEA-21 provisions, with additional funding outside core programs. RABA funds were redistributed to core highway programs from allocated funds for programs like Federal Lands Highway and Highway Beautification. The FY2000 and FY2001 Acts allocated funds to core highway programs and included specific projects and funding levels. The FY2000 Act introduced earmarking in the highway section after several years. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 4475 included a provision for a \"0.08% blood alcohol concentration\" law to receive highway trust funds. The Senate approach for a 0.08% BAC law has not been effective in encouraging states to adopt it, leading to a debate on federal pressure versus state autonomy in setting traffic safety laws. The FY2001 DOT Appropriations Act modifies the Senate provision by penalizing states that do not enforce the 0.08 BAC standard. The FY2001 DOT Appropriations Act penalizes states that do not enforce the 0.08 BAC standard by withholding portions of their federal aid highway funding. The TEA-21 Funding Framework continued existing highway and transit programs from its predecessor legislation. TEA-21, a refinement of ISTEA, includes new funding initiatives like the Border Infrastructure Program. Most funding is allocated to core programs like NHS, IM, STP, Bridge Replacement, and CMAQ, apportioned annually by formula. Another category of highway funding exists within firewalls, known as the \"exempt\" category. The \"exempt\" category of highway funding within firewalls includes additional annual authorization of minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief funds, not subject to annual obligation limitations. Other programs under the firewall include Federal Lands Highway Program, High Priority Projects, Appalachian Development Highway System roads, National Corridor Planning, and Border Infrastructure Program. TEA-21 links highway revenues to spending. The Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to evaluate annual revenues and spending in the highway account. Revenues determine program spending adjustments through the RABA formula. Funding for FHWA RD&T programs is proposed to increase from $437.2 million to $658.8 million in FY2001, primarily for advancing highway technologies. The FHWA requested increased funding for its Surface Transportation R&D program from $98 million in FY2000 to $138 million in FY2001. Additionally, the Administration requested $238 million for ITS deployment, which is $120 million above the amount specified in TEA-21. The ITS deployment program aims to improve the management and safety of surface transportation systems through advanced communication and information systems. The proposed additional funding would come from new contract authority added to the existing authority under TEA-21, requiring a legislative change to Title V. The FHWA requested increased funding for its Surface Transportation R&D program and ITS deployment. The conference agreement specified $437.2 million, with $98 million for research and $118 million for ITS deployment. Earmarking of funds for ITS deployment has been a concern, with some preferring competitive awards over designated allocations. The House and Senate-passed FY2001 appropriations bills included $6.3 billion for FTA, comparable to the TEA-21 level. The FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act reduced FTA funding by $14 million. The Administration proposed a similar funding level, with a difference in the use of $75 million from RABA for specific programs. Congress rejected the Administration's proposal. The transit appropriations under TEA-21 saw a significant increase from FY1999 to FY2001, reaching its highest funding level in FY2001. The $6.3 billion provided in FY2001 continued the impact of TEA-21 on transit spending, with increased authorized funding for transit projects in Chicago, Minneapolis, and the Dulles corridor. The FTA has two major transit programs: the Major Capital Investment Program and the Urbanized Area Formula Program, along with smaller formula and planning and research programs. The Major Capital Investment Program (Section 5309) includes new transit starts, fixed guideway modernization, and bus facilities. The FY2001 proposed funding was $2.65 billion, slightly higher than FY2000. Funds are allocated by FTA or earmarked by Congress. The Senate and House bills allocated $2.65 and $2.7 billion respectively, with a government-wide rescission reducing the program to $2.695 billion. The Administration's budget proposed 12 new rail transit starts for full funding. The FY2001 budget proposes 12 new rail transit starts for full funding grant agreements, amidst controversy over project selection due to limited funding. The Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) supports urbanized area capital and operating needs, including bus purchases, maintenance facilities, and operating assistance. The Administration requested $3.45 billion for FY2001, a slight increase from the previous year. The Administration requested $3.45 billion for FY2001 for the Section 5307 program, with funds apportioned based on population and transit service data. The House, Senate, and enacted versions of H.R. 4475 all provided around $3.3 billion for the program. Urbanized areas receive the majority of the funding, with specific formula set asides for different categories. TEA-21 authorized a new discretionary Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program with $100 million in funding, rejecting the use of $50 million from redistributed RABA funds. Operating assistance funding was eliminated for urbanized areas with 200,000 or more population, but preventivemaintenance is now eligible under an expanded capital grants formula program. Preventive maintenance is now eligible for operating assistance in urbanized areas under 200,000 population, including rural areas under 50,000 population. The conference agreement includes significant earmarking of capital investment grants, with specific amounts mentioned for bus and bus facilities. The curr_chunk discusses various reports related to transportation legislation and budget issues in the 106th Congress. It includes reports on the Airport Improvement Program, Surface Transportation Board reauthorization, Federal Traffic Safety Provisions, Transportation Trust Funds, and Coast Guard budget analysis. The FY2000 Budget analysis by Martin Lee, Coast Guard FY2001 Budget Issues, Amtrak Overview and Options, and Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Policies are discussed in various CRS reports.
