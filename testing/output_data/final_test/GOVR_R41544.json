    "content": "A free trade agreement is a deal between trading partners to reduce or eliminate tariffs and trade barriers. The US has free trade agreements with 17 countries across various regions. These agreements are approved by a majority vote in Congress and allow the President to negotiate tariff reductions for limited periods. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 allows the President to enter into trade agreements with approval from Congress. The U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) was signed in 2007 but has not yet been submitted to Congress for approval. The agreement will enter into force for the United States if certain conditions are met. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 allows the President to enter into trade agreements with approval from Congress, under specific conditions. These conditions include notifying Congress in advance, submitting necessary law changes, providing legal text of the agreement, and enacting the implementing bill into law. Trade agreements must also meet additional statutory requirements for expedited consideration. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows for expedited consideration of trade agreements to prevent filibuster or extensive amendments. The KORUS FTA was signed before the deadline, making it eligible for fast track procedures under TPA. The bill's eligibility for TPA may be complicated by the recently negotiated changes to the KORUS FTA, known as a \"supplementary deal.\" Signed in February 2011, it modifies commitments and adds new obligations for both the U.S. and South Korea, particularly regarding automotive duties. The \"exchange of letters\" between the United States and South Korea modifies time frames for eliminating U.S. duties on certain automotive goods and establishes a special auto safeguard mechanism. Other commitments include preventing undue delays in placing new technology vehicles on the market and providing a grace period for compliance with technical regulations. The United States and South Korea agreed to cooperate and consult on new fuel economy and motor vehicle emissions regulations instead of resorting to dispute settlement. The United States promised to extend L-visa validity for South Korean intracompany transferees, while South Korea agreed to consider certain U.S. vehicle imports compliant with its regulations. Unlike the exchange of letters, the agreed minutes are non-binding and separate each party's commitments into two documents. The United States and South Korea intended for the exchange of letters to encompass binding commitments, while the agreed minutes were not intended to be internationally binding. Trade agreements are typically treated as congressional-executive agreements, requiring approval by a majority vote of each house. The United States can fulfill its promise to increase L-visa validity for South Korean nationals without changing U.S. law. The United States must receive congressional approval for international agreements to enter into force and implement them domestically by amending relevant laws. Congressional approval is typically required for trade agreements, with fast track consideration conditioned on including an express approval provision. Newly negotiated changes to the KORUS FTA raise questions about approval provisions. The newly negotiated changes to the KORUS FTA raise questions about whether they can enter into force for the United States without congressional approval. The changes would need to be treated as an executive agreement or a self-executing agreement to bypass the need for congressional consent. The \"supplementary agreement\" for the KORUS FTA may not impact fast track consideration if it is self-executing. The decision on how to treat the changes will be made by the Executive and Congress, likely without interference from a U.S. court. This report focuses on fast track eligibility for the implementing bill, either incorporating the 2010 changes or treating them as part of the 2007 agreement. Fast track procedures ensure timely legislative action on trade agreements. Fast track procedures prevent filibusters and amendments that could stall implementing bills for trade agreements. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) mandates that such bills receive a vote in Congress without amendments and limited debate. The Trade Act of 2002 sets conditions for a bill's eligibility for fast track consideration. The President must submit the implementing bill to Congress for fast track consideration, which must include components approving a trade agreement, a statement of administrative action, and necessary changes to U.S. law. Questions have arisen regarding whether legislation for the KORUS FTA will meet these requirements. The KORUS FTA implementing bill must approve an agreement \"entered into\" before July 1, 2007, and any provisions must be \"necessary or appropriate\" for the 2007 agreement's implementation. The 2010 changes to the KORUS FTA were not approved before the fast track deadline set by the Trade Act of 2002. The Trade Act of 2002 allows for fast track procedures, but there is a distinction between the signed agreement and the final legal text submitted to Congress. Changes may be made to the original agreement without disqualifying it from fast track consideration. It is uncertain how Members will view the 2010 changes to the trade agreement. The \"supplementary deal\" may qualify as an executive agreement under the President's constitutional authority for foreign relations, potentially bypassing the need for congressional approval. The extent of executive authority related to foreign commerce remains unclear. The \"supplementary deal\" may qualify as an executive agreement under the President's constitutional authority for foreign relations, potentially bypassing the need for congressional approval. Congress has express constitutional authority related to foreign commerce, while the President has sole authority to enter into executive agreements. The 2010 changes may clarify the text of the agreement, making it amenable to treatment as an executive agreement if the original trade agreement receives congressional approval. The \"supplementary deal\" may be considered an executive agreement under the President's foreign relations authority, potentially avoiding the need for congressional approval. New U.S. commitments in the supplementary agreement may impact fast track procedures if they fall within Congress's constitutional powers. Close scrutiny is needed for provisions requiring new U.S. obligations or laws. Historical precedent exists for treating supplemental agreements as executive agreements after the expiration of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The George H. W. Bush Administration signed NAFTA before the expiration of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). President Clinton negotiated side agreements on labor and the environment with Mexico and Canada after the signing. The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) were signed in September 1993, after TPA had expired. The USTR released a letter stating that the NAAEC and NAALC were not \"trade agreements for purposes of fast track procedures\" but executive agreements. The President submitted these agreements to Congress along with NAFTA text for consideration, without seeking or receiving congressional approval. Senator Ted Stevens challenged this characterization in the Senate. Senator Ted Stevens expressed concerns about Congress allowing the Executive to have broad authority to negotiate nontrade agreements under fast track procedures, citing fears of an Executive making agreements against the best interests of the people. The NAFTA implementing bill included provisions authorizing such agreements. The NAFTA implementing bill included provisions authorizing U.S. participation in supplemental agreements, despite Senator Stevens' disapproval. Congress enacted the bill in its entirety, potentially indicating congressional approval of the NAAEC and NAALC. The KORUS FTA may grant the President greater authority than NAFTA to modify the agreement without congressional approval. NAFTA required Congress's approval for any modifications, while the KORUS FTA allows officials to make changes by consensus. This difference means that the US and Korea could implement changes to the KORUS FTA without congressional approval. The Executive may try to classify these changes as an executive agreement, bypassing the need for congressional approval. The KORUS FTA implementing bill must meet specific conditions for fast track consideration, including being necessary or appropriate to implement the 2007 agreement. The phrase \"necessary or appropriate\" is interpreted strictly, based on the Trade Act of 2002's legislative history. Congress's treatment of trade agreements under earlier TPA statutes is seen as a precedent for this interpretation. Some Members of Congress perceive earlier TPA statutes as precedent for interpreting the phrase \"necessary or appropriate\" in trade agreements. Questions arise when trade agreements are modified post-signing, with concerns about whether the modifications warrant fast track procedures. The Clinton Administration sought congressional authority to participate in NAFTA side agreements, sparking debate on the definition of \"necessary or appropriate.\" Senator Ted Stevens argued that including side agreements in the NAFTA implementation was not necessary or appropriate for fast track consideration. He stated that there was no legal authority for these agreements to be included under fast-track procedures. In response, Senator Baucus defended the President's broad constitutional authority to execute agreements and negotiate provisions related to trade laws. The debate highlighted differing views on the inclusion of side agreements in trade agreements. The debate over the inclusion of side agreements in trade agreements revolves around differing opinions on the interpretation of the \"necessary or appropriate\" clause in the Trade Act of 2002. The passage of the NAFTA implementing bill set a precedent for broad interpretations, supporting the argument that the KORUS FTA is eligible for fast track consideration. Fast track procedures are generally enacted into law instead of amending standing rules, with the statutory grant of TPA considered an exercise of rulemaking power. The Trade Act of 2002 grants Congress authority over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in implementing trade agreements. Congress can waive, suspend, or repeal fast track authority for legislation implementing the KORUS FTA. The Senate and House parliamentarians may be consulted before introducing the implementing bill. Members can challenge fast track procedures if the Executive fails to follow certain procedures or if the agreement does not meet specified objectives. If a bill is introduced without fast track consideration, a Member can object and the eligibility will be determined by procedural rules. The House parliamentarian guides the presiding officer in the House, and a similar process occurs in the Senate. The decision on fast track status can be appealed to the full body, and each chamber independently decides on eligibility. Senator Stevens argued against fast track for the NAFTA bill but did not raise a point of order. The eligibility of a bill for fast track consideration is determined by procedural rules, with objections raised by Members in either chamber. Amendments are not allowed for bills under fast track procedures. If a bill is deemed ineligible for fast track consideration, it will be considered under regular procedures, potentially leading to amendments or a vote. Fast track authority can still be granted to the bill by the chamber. The chamber could grant fast track authority to a bill even if it was deemed ineligible under the Trade Act of 2002. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement was enacted under regular procedures after fast track authorities expired in 1988. Congress may have treated the Jordan agreement with deference due to Jordan's role in the Middle East peace process. It is uncertain if the KORUS FTA will receive similar treatment. Congress must consent to the KORUS FTA for it to enter into force for the United States. To implement the KORUS FTA, Congress must approve the agreement and enact necessary legislative changes. The implementing bill will need to meet the requirements of the Trade Act of 2002 for fast track consideration. The implementation of the KORUS FTA agreement entered into in 2007 may face challenges in Congress due to the inclusion of changes from the 2010 supplementary deal in the implementing bill. This could potentially disqualify the bill from fast track consideration under the Trade Act of 2002. The NAFTA implementing bill in 2007 faced challenges in Congress due to modifications made after the expiration of TPA. Some Members argued that the side agreements were characterized as executive agreements, giving the Executive broad authority. Despite protests, Congress passed the bill in its entirety. The NAFTA implementing bill faced challenges in Congress in 2007, but was ultimately passed in its entirety. Concerns were raised about the use of fast track procedures, but no formal challenges were made. If objections are raised, the bill's eligibility for fast track consideration will be determined by the chamber. Congress retains authority over granting fast track consideration. Congress has authority to grant fast track consideration to the KORUS FTA implementing bill. Each chamber can waive, suspend, or repeal fast track authority for the legislation. They can also pass a resolution to make fast track procedures inapplicable if the bill is deemed deficient under the Trade Act of 2002."
