    "title": "SB 361",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4846.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require 36 hours of continuing education in relevant veterinary medicine courses for license renewal. The amended Business and Professions Code now requires 36 hours of continuing education for license renewal in relevant veterinary medicine courses. Continuing education providers include various organizations such as state veterinary medical associations, nonprofit annual conferences, educational organizations, local veterinary medical associations, and government agencies. Accredited providers by ACCME, AMA, and ADA are also recognized for continuing education. The board approves continuing education providers for veterinarians, including self-study courses like reading journals or watching videos. They may also approve other providers and recognize national approval bodies. The board can revoke approval for providers for good cause. Continuing education hours earned from approved providers between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2001, count towards a veterinarian's CE requirement. License renewal or reinstatement requires proof of compliance with CE requirements. False statements are subject to penalties. This rule applies to second and subsequent license renewals after January 1, 2002. The board has the right to audit applicants' records to verify completion of continuing education requirements. Applicants must keep records for four years and provide them for auditing if requested. Veterinarians must provide course details if questioned during the audit. To restore an inactive license, a veterinarian must complete 36 hours of continuing education within the last two years. Misrepresentation of compliance with this requirement is considered unprofessional conduct and may result in disciplinary action or a civil penalty. The board retains the authority to take disciplinary action against a licensee with an inactive license. The board may exempt veterinarians from continuing education requirements for health, military service, or undue hardship reasons. Waiver applications must be submitted on a provided form. Funding for this section may come from professional license and education provider fees, not exceeding administration costs. The board or its national approval agent will establish approval criteria for continuing education providers not listed in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b). A biennial application fee of up to $200 may be imposed. Licensed veterinarians renewing their license after January 1, 2018, must complete one credit hour of continuing education on antimicrobial drug use every four years. Each skilled nursing facility must adopt an antimicrobial stewardship policy by January 1, 2017, in line with guidelines from CDC, CMS, SHEA, or similar organizations. The policy should cover medically important antimicrobial drugs listed in FDA's Guidance for Industry #152. Skilled nursing facilities must comply with antimicrobial stewardship policy requirements, failure to do so may result in enforcement actions. No reimbursement is required for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts due to changes in penalties or definitions of crimes. This act is an urgency statute to protect Californians from antimicrobial-resistant infections, going into immediate effect for public peace, health, and safety."
