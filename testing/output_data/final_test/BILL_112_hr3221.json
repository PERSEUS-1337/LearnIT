    "content": "The Act titled \"Job Creation and Energy Efficiency Act\" includes a loan program for energy efficiency upgrades to existing buildings under the Building Retrofit Financing Program. The Act titled \"Job Creation and Energy Efficiency Act\" includes definitions for terms like credit support, efficiency obligation, and project related to financing energy efficiency projects. Eligible projects involve installing technologies to increase energy efficiency in buildings. The Secretary may provide credit support for eligible projects, including commercial, residential, industrial, government, and educational buildings that meet specified criteria. Guidelines for this credit support must be established within 180 days of the enactment of the section. The Secretary must establish guidelines for assessing energy savings, qualifying financing mechanisms, setting energy savings thresholds, and determining eligibility criteria for projects to receive credit support. These guidelines must be published in the Federal Register and allow for public comment. The Secretary determines eligibility criteria and lien priority requirements for credit support under this section, including mechanisms to preserve prior lien positions and remedies in case of default. The Secretary establishes eligibility criteria and lien priority requirements for credit support, including measures to limit financial risk in case of borrower default, such as credit subsidy fees and debt-to-income levels. The eligibility criteria for credit support include allowable thresholds for efficiency obligations relative to building debt, analysis of occupancy levels and rental income, and requirements for third-party contractors to guarantee energy savings from retrofit projects. The financing mechanisms qualified by the Secretary may include loans, power purchase agreements, and energy services agreements for retrofit projects. These mechanisms involve efficiency obligations tied to energy savings and protocols for measuring and verifying savings. Payments for the retrofit project are to be recovered equally by the Secretary and the retrofit. The Secretary may qualify various financing mechanisms for retrofit projects, such as loans, power purchase agreements, and energy services agreements. These mechanisms involve efficiency obligations tied to energy savings and protocols for measuring and verifying savings. The Secretary shall prioritize maximizing energy savings and establishing a clear application and approval process for credit support funding. The Secretary may issue credit support for projects that meet guidelines, including projects across States or regions and whole-building retrofits. There is a limit on the amount of credit support that can be issued for each project. The Secretary can also provide credit support for a portfolio of projects that are not geographically contiguous. To be eligible for credit support, applicants must submit an application with contractor experience criteria and energy savings expectations. The projects can be non-contiguous and include whole-building retrofits. The application for credit support must demonstrate energy savings using approved methodology and meet technical criteria outlined in program guidelines. Recipients must provide requested information to assess energy savings, including historical usage data and building work details. Permission to access information is also required. The Secretary will make a final determination on the application within 90 days, may request additional information, and can charge reasonable fees for credit support provided. Fees collected will be subject to specific regulations. The Secretary has the authority to delegate underwriting responsibilities. The Secretary may delegate underwriting activities to qualified entities. A status report must be submitted to Congress within 1 year, detailing program implementation, supported projects, funding mechanisms, expected energy savings, tracking efforts, and plans for improvement. The Secretary must submit an annual report estimating the percentage of American-made materials used in retrofit activities funded under this section. $15 billion is authorized for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, with no more than 1% for administrative costs."
