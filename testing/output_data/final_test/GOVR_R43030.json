    "content": "The U.S. Constitution assigns roles to the President and Senate in appointing government officials. The President nominates officers with Senate approval, but can make temporary recess appointments without Senate consent. This process has led to political conflicts between the branches, especially when the Senate feels the President is bypassing their role. The President can make recess appointments without Senate consent when facing obstruction in the appointment process. President Obama's recess appointments of officials to key positions highlighted the tensions between the branches. The Senate did not confirm the nominees, leading to the President's use of recess appointments. The President made recess appointments of officials to key positions due to Senate inaction, appointing all four officials to the CFPB and NLRB on January 4, 2012. The appointments were challenged in court, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit invalidating the appointments in Noel Canning v. National Labor Relations Board on January 25, 2013. The circuit court invalidated the recess appointments of NLRB Board Members, stating that recess appointments can only be made during a formal intersession recess and to fill vacancies that arose during that recess. This decision could impact the validity of previous actions by the NLRB and the President's appointment of Director Cordray, as well as the functioning of the CFPB in the future. The report provides a legal overview of the Recess Appointments Clause and analyzes the impact of the Noel Canning decision on the roles of the President and Congress in appointments. It also discusses the two methods of presidential appointments outlined in the Constitution. The President has the authority to nominate and appoint various government officials with the Senate's advice and consent. The Constitution allows for recess appointments to fill vacancies when the Senate is not in session. The Clause allows the President to make temporary appointments during a Senate recess without confirmation, as a supplement to the general appointment power. Hamilton explained this as an auxiliary method of appointment in cases where the general method was inadequate. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to make temporary appointments during Senate recess without confirmation. It grants the President the authority to fill vacancies that may arise during the Senate's recess. Despite some ambiguity, it is generally agreed that recess appointees have the same legal authority as Senate confirmed appointees. The Recess Appointments Clause grants the President the authority to make temporary appointments during Senate recess without confirmation. Recess appointees have the same legal authority as Senate confirmed appointees, and their commission expires at the conclusion of the Senate's \"next Session\" following the appointment. The timing of the appointment determines the length of service, with appointments during different sessions of Congress resulting in different terms. The Recess Appointments Clause raises questions about when vacancies must occur and what constitutes \"the Recess\" for the President's appointment authority. The duration of recesses, whether intersession or intrasession, also impacts the President's ability to make appointments. The Recess Appointments Clause raises questions about the President's appointment authority during recesses. The courts have rarely analyzed this clause, with only a few federal courts of appeals interpreting it broadly. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit discussed this issue in the 1962 case of United States v. Allocco. In United States v. Allocco, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld President Eisenhower's recess appointment of Judge Cashin, ruling that the Recess Appointments Clause allows filling vacancies that exist during a recess. The court rejected the argument that vacancies occurring while the Senate is in session cannot be filled by the President. The Second Circuit upheld President Eisenhower's recess appointment of Judge Cashin, stating that vacancies occurring while the Senate is in session can be filled by the President. This interpretation was supported by historical precedent and executive practice. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld President Carter's recess appointment of Judge Heen, following a similar challenge to recess appointments. President Carter appointed Judge Heen during an intersession recess after the Senate adjourned without holding a confirmation vote. The court agreed that vacancies occurring while the Senate is in session can be filled by the President, in line with historical precedent and executive practice. The Ninth Circuit court upheld President Carter's recess appointment of Judge Heen, stating that vacancies do not need to arise during a Senate recess to be filled by the President. The court adopted the \"happen to exist\" interpretation of the Clause, emphasizing the importance of allowing the President to fill vacancies at any time to keep the government running smoothly. This decision was supported by historical evidence and executive branch practices. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit interpreted the Recess Appointments Clause to allow the President to fill vacancies that exist during a recess, as seen in the appointment of William H. Pryor during a Senate intrasession recess. This interpretation aligns with previous court decisions and executive branch practices. The Eleventh Circuit Court ruled that the Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to make appointments during intrasession recesses of the Senate, not just intersession recesses. This decision was based on historical interpretations, executive actions, and legislative acquiescence. The Eleventh Circuit Court ruled that the Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to make appointments during intrasession recesses of the Senate, not just intersession recesses. The court emphasized the importance of enabling the President to fill vacancies for the proper functioning of the government, giving more weight to the duration of the Senate recess rather than whether it was intersession or intrasession. The court did not establish a minimum recess period required for the President's recess appointment power, but noted historical precedent of similar length recesses. Prior to Noel Canning, federal courts of appeals had different interpretations of the President's recess appointment authority, with some focusing on historical practice and congressional acquiescence. President Obama's recess appointments in Noel Canning were unique due to \"pro forma\" sessions. It is important to understand these facts before discussing the D.C. Circuit's decision. Before discussing the D.C. Circuit's decision in Noel Canning, it is necessary to detail the January 4 appointments made by President Obama. The Senate fell short of the 60-vote threshold needed for cloture on Richard Cordray's nomination as the first Director of the CFPB. The NLRB, responsible for investigating unfair labor practices, has faced difficulties in obtaining Senate confirmation for its board nominees. This has led to vacancies during the presidencies of both George W. Bush and Obama. The Board faced vacancies, operating with only two Members for over two years. President Obama nominated Terrence F. Flynn, Sharon Block, and Richard F. Griffin Jr. to prevent membership from dropping below the quorum. The Senate adopted a unanimous consent agreement to schedule \"pro forma\" sessions to maintain the quorum. The Senate adopted a unanimous consent agreement to schedule \"pro forma\" sessions to maintain the quorum and prevent the President from exercising his recess appointment powers. These sessions consist of a single Senator convening and adjourning the session without conducting any formal business. During the 112th Congress, the House actively prevented the Senate from entering an extended recess to block the President's recess appointment authority. This was done by refusing consent to a Senate adjournment, as requested by numerous House Members. None of the President's four nominees were confirmed. The President made recess appointments of Cordray, Block, Flynn, and Griffin after the Senate failed to confirm his nominees. The NLRB, with its new members, ruled against Noel Canning for violating labor laws. Noel Canning challenged the decision, claiming the Board lacked a quorum due to invalid appointments. The court held that the President's recess appointments to the Board were invalid, citing two justifications. First, \"the Recess\" refers to an intersession recess after a sine die adjournment. Second, recess appointments can only fill vacancies that arise during the intersession recess. The appointments and vacancies did not meet these criteria. The opinion favors a strict textualist interpretation of the Constitution. The D.C. Circuit court reevaluated the historical use of recess appointments and emphasized the importance of the phrase \"the Recess\" in the Constitution. They concluded that the President's authority for recess appointments only applies to intersession recesses of the Senate. The court relied on the natural meaning of the text as understood during the Constitution's ratification. The D.C. Circuit court reevaluated the historical use of recess appointments, emphasizing the significance of \"the Recess\" in the Constitution. They concluded that the President's authority for recess appointments is limited to intersession recesses of the Senate, based on the original meaning of the text during the Constitution's ratification. The D.C. Circuit court reevaluated the historical use of recess appointments, emphasizing the significance of \"the Recess\" in the Constitution. They concluded that the President's authority for recess appointments is limited to intersession recesses of the Senate, based on the original meaning of the text during the Constitution's ratification. The court found that the infrequency of intrasession recess appointments in the first 150 years of the Republic suggested an assumed absence of power to make such appointments. The D.C. Circuit court limited the President's recess appointment authority to intersession recesses of the Senate, based on the original meaning of the Constitution. They ruled that vacancies must arise during an intersession recess for the President to make recess appointments. The D.C. Circuit court restricted the President's recess appointment power to intersession recesses of the Senate, stating that vacancies must arise during such a recess for appointments to be valid. The court criticized previous decisions for relying on modern dictionaries and emphasized the need to interpret the Constitution based on 18th-century definitions. The D.C. Circuit court limited the President's recess appointment power to intersession recesses of the Senate, requiring vacancies to arise during such a recess for appointments to be valid. The court cited historical commentary and President Washington's practices to support its interpretation of the Constitution. The D.C. Circuit court limited the President's recess appointment power to intersession recesses of the Senate, requiring vacancies to arise during such a recess for appointments to be valid. The court held that an intersession recess can be identified by the sine die adjournment of the Senate, which signifies the formal end of a session. This practice dates back to the first Congress and is a means by which Congress ends a session. The D.C. Circuit court's decision in Noel Canning limited the President's recess appointment power to intersession recesses triggered by a sine die adjournment of the Senate. This means vacancies must arise during such a recess for appointments to be valid. The court clarified that when the Senate does not adjourn sine die, the previous session ends simultaneously with the start of the next session, thus restricting the President's recess authority. The Noel Canning court's decision limited the President's recess appointment power to vacancies that arise during the recess in which the appointment is made, differing from previous rulings. The discrepancies in interpretation may warrant Supreme Court review. The Noel Canning court's decision limited the President's recess appointment power to vacancies that arise during the recess in which the appointment is made, differing from previous rulings. The disagreements extend beyond the President's authority under the Recess Appointments Clause, with opinions fundamentally diverging on interpretive and practical issues. The D.C. Circuit employed a formalistic textualist approach, while other decisions arguably engaged in a more nuanced interpretation. The decisions in Allocco, Woodley, and Evans focused on the practical impact of a restrictive interpretation of the Clause on the President's ability to ensure continuity of government. They differed in their views on the basic purpose of the Clause, with Noel Canning viewing it as a limited exception to the Senate approval requirement. The importance of preventing \"executive paralysis\" or \"atrophy\" for smooth government functioning was emphasized. The purpose of the Clause is to enable the President to fill vacancies for the proper functioning of government when the Senate is unable to provide advice and consent. Inefficiencies can be addressed by Congress through holdover provisions or authorizing acting officers. The Second Circuit in Allocco supported this conclusion with an evaluation of historical practice. The Evans court found widespread acceptance of the practice of recess appointments since the early days of the Republic. They cited historical practice to support the President's ability to make intrasession recess appointments. In contrast, Noel Canning concluded that historical practice favored intersession appointments. The first intrasession appointment was not made until 1867. The court found that intrasession recess appointments were rare before 1947, with only three made prior to that year. The court emphasized the lack of such appointments in the early years of the Republic, questioning the validity of recent presidential exercise of this power. Noel Canning challenged the historical evidence used to support the President's ability to make recess appointments at any time. The courts are in conflict over the interpretation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503 regarding recess appointments made by Presidents Washington and Jefferson. This statute prohibits payment for services to individuals appointed during a recess to fill a vacancy that existed while the Senate was in session, with exceptions. Allocco, Woodley, and Evans cited this statute as implying congressional approval of the President's authority to fill vacancies that arise while the Senate is still in session. The courts have cited 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503 as implying congressional approval of the President's authority to fill vacancies that arise while the Senate is still in session. This is supported by cases such as Allocco, Woodley, and Evans, which referenced the statute in reasoning that the President's recess appointments are likely not unconstitutional. The D.C. Circuit's interpretation in Noel Canning questioned the constitutionality of the President's recess appointments, suggesting that the pay statute from 1940 sheds no light on the original understanding of the Constitution. This could impact the balance of power between the President and Congress in filling vacancies. The D.C. Circuit's interpretation in Noel Canning could shift power towards the Senate in appointing government officials, limiting presidential recess appointments. This would eliminate intrasession recess appointments and restrict filling vacancies that arose while the Senate was in session. The Noel Canning decision limits presidential recess appointments, strengthening the Senate's role in the appointment process and restricting the President's unilateral authority. This interpretation gives Congress control over triggering the President's recess appointment power in the future. The Senate's decision to adjourn sine die controls the President's authority to make recess appointments, as highlighted in the Noel Canning decision. This grants Congress power over triggering the President's recess appointment authority. The disagreement lies in how to distinguish when the Senate is in \"session\" or \"recess\" for the purpose of the President's recess appointment authority. The executive branch argues that the President has the power to determine when the Senate is in \"recess.\" The D.C. Circuit's evaluation in Noel Canning did not consider the duration of a recess or the Senate's ability to act on nominations when defining \"the Recess\" for the President's recess appointment authority. The court in Noel Canning focused on distinguishing between intersession and intrasession recesses for the President's recess appointment authority. It suggested that the President may make appointments during intersession recesses, even momentary ones, but not during multi-month intrasession recesses. For example, a three-month summer intrasession recess would not allow for recess appointments. Similarly, a properly scheduled extended intrasession recess at the end of a session would also not permit such appointments. The Senate could return on January 2 for a pro forma session, avoiding an intersession recess and preventing the President from making recess appointments. Congress may also structure fixed term offices to decrease vacancies during recesses. The Senate could prevent recess appointments by scheduling pro forma sessions, potentially undermining the President's appointment power and raising constitutional concerns. The D.C. Circuit's formalistic approach may not be swayed by arguments against this restrictive interpretation. The President's power for recess appointments may be hindered by the Senate's failure to act on nominations, leading to concerns about executive paralysis and obstructing the President's ability to fill vacancies for the proper functioning of the government. The Clause governing recess appointments establishes a delicate balance of power between branches, with ambiguity persisting due to political checks and balances rather than strict legal standards. Any judicial decision clarifying who determines if the Senate is in recess risks upsetting this balance. The balance of power between branches is delicate when it comes to recess appointments. Determining if the Senate is in recess could undermine the Senate's role in advising and consenting to appointments. The decision-making power could either weaken the separation of powers or prevent the President from making recess appointments. The President has little control over when the Senate enters recess but may influence the timing of executive branch vacancies. The President may influence the timing of executive branch vacancies by encouraging officers to resign during Senate recesses, creating vacancies that could be filled via recess appointments. The Noel Canning decision could impact the House's ability to influence the President's recess appointment authority. The House has prevented the Senate from taking a recess long enough to trigger the President's recess appointment authority by withholding consent to extended recesses. The executive branch has argued that a recess longer than 3 days is likely necessary for a recess appointment to be made. This perceived durational requirement has hindered the Senate from entering a recess of sufficient length without the House's consent. Noel Canning suggests that the President's recess appointment authority can be triggered regardless of the duration of the recess, as long as it is an intersession adjournment. This could weaken the House's ability to influence the President's appointments if the Senate breaks from tradition and adjourns without the House's consent. The Senate can unilaterally enter an intersession recess within three days of the next session without the House's consent, as per the Adjournments Clause. This action, although not common historically, could trigger the President's recess appointment power, as seen in Noel Canning."
