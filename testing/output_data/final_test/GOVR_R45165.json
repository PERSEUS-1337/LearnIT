    "content": "The farm bill is multi-year legislation that governs agricultural and food programs, reauthorized about every five years. The current 2014 farm bill contains 12 titles addressing various programs. The USDA implements most of the programs, focusing on commodity program payments authorized by Title I. Congress amends permanent laws through omnibus farm bills to address market conditions and budget. The Agricultural Act of 2014, known as the \"2014 farm bill,\" will expire on September 30, 2018. If the bill expires, farm programs would revert to permanent laws with higher commodity support levels, potentially causing disruptions in markets and global trading rules. This leads to pressure to enact a new farm bill to avoid these consequences. The 2014 farm bill is set to expire on September 30, 2018, leading to pressure to enact a new farm bill to avoid disruptions in markets and global trading rules. The House and Senate Committees on Agriculture are preparing successor legislation, focusing on support programs like PLC, ARC, and MAL for various commodities. Congress faces potential issues in addressing these programs. The report discusses potential issues for Congress related to the expiration of the farm bill and eligibility thresholds for commodity program payments. Federal support for basic agricultural commodities began in the 1930s and continues to this day. Dairy, livestock, tree crops, and sugar producers have separate programs under Title I. Federal support for farm incomes continues to this day, with supply controls being prominent for decades but replaced with direct income support payments in 1996. The 2014 farm bill repealed direct payments but continues payments to producers of \"covered crops\" when prices are low. Proponents argue that federal involvement is needed to stabilize farm incomes by shifting risks to the government. The 2014 farm bill introduced new programs PLC and ARC to replace previous commodity support payment programs. Critics argue that farm commodity programs waste taxpayer dollars and distort crop production, while proponents believe in maintaining the economic health of the farm sector to ensure adequate domestic supplies and global market competitiveness. The 2014 farm bill introduced new programs ARC and PLC for covered commodities like corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, and others. Producers can choose between ARC or PLC, with an option to participate in the MAL program for price or revenue protection. Base acres are used to calculate program payments. No fees for participation, but signup is required. The 2014 farm bill introduced ARC and PLC programs for covered commodities like corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, and others. Base acres are historical planted acreage on each farm, with percentages by commodity such as corn (39%), wheat (27%), and soybeans (22%). Farmers had the option to update individual crop base acres to match their actual crop mix during 2009-2012 to better align program payments with farm risk. The 2014 farm bill established ARC and PLC programs for covered commodities, with base acres calculated for each commodity. New landowners inherit base acreage and become eligible for farm programs. Reference prices and loan rates are used for commodity payments under ARC, PLC, and MAL. Some commodities are only eligible for MAL coverage. MAL payments are coupled to plantings, potentially impacting market prices, while ARC and PLC payments are decoupled income transfers. ARC and PLC payments are \"decoupled\" income transfers based on historical planted acreage, allowing producers to make market-based planting decisions. This aligns crop support policies with WTO rules and minimizes market distortion. Producers had a one-time choice between ARC and PLC at the start of the 2014 farm bill, with 77% choosing ARC and 23% selecting PLC out of over 240 million base acres. Under the recent farm policy changes, PLC payments are triggered when the national marketing-year average farm price for a covered commodity is below its reference price. The PLC payment amount is determined by the payment rate, historical program yield, and 85% of base acres enrolled in PLC. Additionally, generic base acres were available to participate on a coupled basis. Under the recent farm policy changes, PLC payments are triggered when the national marketing-year average farm price for a covered commodity is below its reference price. The PLC payment amount is determined by the payment rate, historical program yield, and 85% of base acres enrolled in PLC. ARC-CO provides coverage for revenue losses from the historical five-year moving average revenue at the county level. ARC-CO payments are issued when the actual county crop revenue is less than the ARC-CO revenue guarantee. ARC-CO payments are triggered when actual crop revenue is below the revenue guarantee, with payments based on the per-acre rate and 85% of enrolled base acres. ARC-IC provides whole-farm revenue loss coverage, with the guarantee equal to 86% of the individual benchmark guarantee. The ARC-IC program calculates actual revenue based on farm yield and crop prices, with payments capped at 10% of benchmark revenue. MAL offers financing for certain commodities and provides benefits if market prices fall below loan rates. MAL payments are tied to current production, with producers able to put harvested crops under a nonrecourse loan. The nonrecourse loan allows producers to use their crop as collateral, providing a price guarantee. Producers can choose to forfeit the crop and keep the loan if market prices are below the loan rate. They also have the option to repay the loan or reclaim the crop if market prices rise above the loan rate. Additionally, producers can benefit from loan repayment based on market conditions or request a loan deficiency payment if prices fall below the loan rate. The nonrecourse loan allows producers to use their crop as collateral, providing a price guarantee. Farmers may request a loan deficiency payment if the price is below the loan rate. Producers have options to repay the loan with commodity certificates, forfeit the crop to USDA, or keep gains from forfeiture. Payment limits apply, with a combined annual limit of $125,000 per person for most commodities, except peanuts which have a separate limit of $125,000 per person. Peanuts and other eligible crops have a combined limit of $250,000 per person. The 2014 farm bill established a $250,000 limit per person for ARC and PLC payments, with an income eligibility limit of $900,000 AGI. Generic base acres were created to allow cotton producers to receive payments, following a WTO ruling that deemed cotton ineligible. Producers with generic base acres must plant a covered commodity to qualify for ARC and PLC payments, unlike other base acres which are fully decoupled. In the 2014 farm bill, Congress introduced the Stacked Income Protection Program (STAX) for upland cotton producers as an alternative to ARC and PLC payments. STAX is a revenue insurance policy with an 80% federal premium subsidy rate and coverage for expected revenue losses. Producers can opt for a payment rate multiplier of 120% for increased protection per acre, with indemnity triggered by county-level revenue loss. STAX indemnity is triggered by a revenue loss at the county level, covering part of the deductible of an underlying crop insurance policy. It indemnifies losses in county revenue of 10-30% and is capped at the deductible level of the individual policy. The 2018 farm bill specified \"seed cotton\" as a covered commodity for PLC and ARC programs, and eliminated generic base acres. The 2018 farm bill eliminated generic base acres and specified \"seed cotton\" as a covered commodity for PLC and ARC programs. Producers had 90 days to reallocate their generic base acres to seed cotton, other program crops, or an unassigned category. If no covered commodities were planted from 2009-2016, generic base acres were allocated to \"unassigned crop base.\" If covered commodities were planted during that period, generic base acres were allocated between seed cotton and other program crops. The 2018 farm bill eliminated generic base acres and specified \"seed cotton\" as a covered commodity for PLC and ARC programs. Producers had 90 days to reallocate their generic base acres to seed cotton or other program crops. Any residual generic base acres are no longer eligible for program payments. PLC is the default for all base acres if no program election is made. Seed cotton base acres enrolled in PLC or ARC will be ineligible for the STAX beginning in 2019. The 2014 farm bill's PLC, ARC, and MAL programs cover the five crop years of 2014 through 2018. Participation in ARC and PLC varies by crop and region, with ARC-CO being more popular due to favorable price and revenue data. Program payments are funded through CCC, with total outlays exceeding $21 billion between 2014 and 2016, mainly for corn, soybeans, and wheat. Commodities like corn, soybeans, and wheat receive the majority of payments under ARC and PLC, with peanuts and rice having the highest support rate per acre. The Congressional Budget Office projects a shift in participation rates towards PLC due to a forecasted decline in commodity prices, making PLC more favorable over ARC. The Congressional Budget Office projects that ARC, PLC, and MAL payouts for the 2027 period will range between $4 billion and $6 billion annually, compared to $5 billion to $8 billion for crop years 2014-2016 under the 2014 farm bill. Congressional considerations for the next farm bill may include issues such as payment limits and program performance during periods of lower crop prices and reduced farm income. Several farm commodity programs authorized by the 2014 farm bill are set to expire in 2018, potentially reverting payments to permanent legislation from the 1930s and 1940s. Key issues for consideration include payment limits and income eligibility, with some provisions remaining in statute as \"permanent law\" from the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938 and the Agricultural Act of 1949. The upcoming farm bill discussions may address ARC, PLC, and MAL payments, with several bills in the 115th Congress addressing various aspects of farm commodity programs. The treatment of cotton under Title I was a significant issue in the 2014 farm bill. Legislation from the 1930s and 1940s, viewed as different from current policy, may impact payments to producers. The 2014 farm bill changed the treatment of cotton under Title I, making it ineligible for PLC or ARC payments. Cotton has two co-products, lint and seed, with cottonseed being used for oil and meal production. The bill also lowered the MAL loan rate and introduced STAX, along with temporary payment programs. The National Cotton Council played a role in advocating for these changes. After the 2014 farm bill made cotton ineligible for PLC or ARC payments, the National Cotton Council pushed for seed cotton to be included as a covered commodity. This was granted in the BBA, allowing seed cotton to be eligible for PLC and ARC programs starting in 2018. Despite this, concerns remain about potential WTO disputes. The ARC-CO payments are a concern for producers and commodity groups due to disparities in crop county yield data. Two bills in the 115th Congress aim to address these data issues. NASS survey data is used for ARC-CO payment calculations, with specific requirements for estimating county yields. Senator John Thune introduced the \"Commodity Program Improvement Act of 2017\" (S. 1259) to base ARC-CO payments on county payment rates. Senator Heidi Heitkamp introduced the \"ARC-CO Improvement Act\" (S. 1998) to use federal crop insurance data instead of NASS survey data for ARC-CO payment yield calculations. Eight farm commodity advocacy groups, including the American Soybean Association, support this proposal. Eligibility for farm payments requires being \"actively engaged\" in farming, as defined by making a significant contribution of capital, equipment, land, personal labor, or active management. The 2014 farm bill instructed USDA to define significant contribution of active personal management for farm payments eligibility. Regulations were issued on December 16, 2015, exempting entities of lineal family members. The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition advocates for further tightening the definition in the upcoming farm bill debate. The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition has advocated for stricter definitions of actively engaged in farming, especially for large operations. The American Farm Bureau Federation and other groups have proposed changes to include non-lineal family members in the definition for payment limit eligibility. Payment limits in farm bills have evolved since the 1970s, with the 2014 farm bill setting an annual cap of $125,000 per person. The 2014 farm bill established an annual payment cap of $125,000 per person for the PLC, ARC, and MAL programs, with a separate limit for peanuts. There are proposals to eliminate payment limits and the ARC and PLC programs, as well as to lower the AGI cap for eligibility for commodity program benefits in the President's FY2019 budget. The President's FY2019 budget proposes lowering the AGI cap for eligibility for commodity program payments to $500,000 from $900,000. Large farm groups and commodity associations oppose this change. The AGI limit is determined by averaging the AGI declared on federal tax forms for the three tax years prior. Previous farm bills have addressed the AGI limit using different approaches. The AGI limit for eligibility for commodity program payments has been re-established at $900,000 for individuals and double that amount for married couples filing separately. Producers with an AGI exceeding $900,000 are not eligible for benefits under certain agricultural programs."
