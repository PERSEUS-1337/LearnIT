    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard Deadline Harmonization Act of 2015\". The Congress acknowledges the reduction in ozone precursor emissions since 1980, leading to improved air quality. States are in the process of implementing 2008 ozone standards while facing the challenge of also implementing the 2015 ozone standards. The implementation of two national ambient air quality standards for ozone poses challenges for counties, as nonattainment or failure to meet deadlines can result in severe consequences. Harmonizing the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards implementation schedules is crucial to avoid burdening state resources and imposing sanctions on counties projected to achieve necessary air quality improvements. The implementation of ozone standards is crucial to avoid burdening state resources and imposing sanctions on counties. The Governor of each State must designate areas as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable for the 2015 ozone standards by October 26, 2024. The Administrator will finalize these designations by October 26, 2025, and States must submit implementation plans by October 26, 2026. Additionally, certain preconstruction permits are addressed. The 2015 ozone standards do not apply to preconstruction permit applications if they are deemed complete before the final designations are promulgated or if a public notice is published within 60 days after the final designations. This does not eliminate the requirement for installing best available control technology. The applicant must install the best available control technology and lowest achievable emissions rate technology, or limit the authority of State, local, or tribal permitting authorities to impose more stringent emissions requirements than Federal standards set by the EPA. SEC. 5 adjusts the review cycle under the Clean Air Act to ten-year intervals for all criteria air pollutants. The Administrator of the EPA is prohibited from completing any review or proposing revisions to ozone criteria and standards before October 26, 2025. SEC. 6 provides definitions. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"2008 ozone standards,\" \"2015 ozone standards,\" \"Administrator,\" \"best available control technology,\" \"lowest achievable emissions rate,\" and \"preconstruction permit.\" The term \"preconstruction permit\" refers to a permit required for the construction or modification of a major emitting facility or stationary source under the Clean Air Act. It includes permits issued by the EPA or a State, local, or tribal authority."
