    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Uniformed Services Medicare Subvention Demonstration Project Act\" and includes sections on definitions, establishment of a demonstration project, determination of reimbursement amounts, and reporting requirements. The Act defines a \"medicare-eligible covered military beneficiary\" as someone under chapter 55 of title 10, US Code, entitled to Medicare benefits and residing in a designated geographic area for the demonstration project. The \"TRICARE program\" refers to the managed health care program established by the Secretary of Defense under chapter 55 of title. The term \"demonstration project\" refers to the uniformed services medicare subvention demonstration project established under section 3. The term \"Secretaries\" means the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services acting jointly, except in section 6 where it refers to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services acting jointly. The establishment of a demonstration project under section 3 is referred to as the uniformed services medicare subvention demonstration project. The Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services will establish a demonstration project for the Department of Defense to receive reimbursement from the Medicare program for health care services provided to eligible military beneficiaries. The project will be conducted in up to five geographic areas over a three-year period starting in 1998, with enrollment being voluntary. Enrollment in the demonstration project for medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries is voluntary, with exceptions for emergencies. The Secretary of Defense will waive the TRICARE program enrollment fee for beneficiaries enrolled in the managed care option. The Secretary of Defense may modify TRICARE contracts for medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries in a demonstration project, including cost-sharing requirements. The project may expand to include fee-for-service options for healthcare services. The Secretaries determined that expanding the demonstration project for TRICARE contracts is feasible and advisable under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS. Reimbursement of Department of Defense under the demonstration project from the medicare program shall be made on the basis of payments under section 1876(a) of the Social Security Act. Payments will be made to the Department of Defense at a per capita rate equal to 93 percent of the applicable adjusted amount. The Secretary of Defense must maintain the Department of Defense health care efforts for medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries to prevent costs from being shifted to the medicare program. Reimbursement to the Department of Defense under the demonstration project will be at a per capita rate of 93 percent of the adjusted average per capita cost. The Secretaries estimate prior Department of Defense healthcare expenses for fiscal year 1997 for medicare-eligible military beneficiaries. The amount is adjusted for inflation, differences in actual expenses, and budget changes exceeding $100,000,000. The adjusted amount is divided for healthcare services for beneficiaries not in the demonstration project. The Secretaries establish monthly targets for the number of medicare-eligible military beneficiaries enrolled in the demonstration project. Annual Medicare payments to the Department of Defense for the project are capped at $65,000,000 to protect the Medicare program against increased costs. The purpose of this subsection is to protect the Medicare program from incurring additional costs related to providing healthcare services to Medicare-eligible military beneficiaries. If excess costs still occur, the Secretaries will take necessary steps to offset them, including suspending or terminating the demonstration project or adjusting payment rates. The Comptroller General will review and report on the costs of the TRICARE and Medicare programs annually during the demonstration project. Adjustments will be made to the project based on the review to correct any discrepancies between cost targets and actual spending. Annual reconciliation of payments will ensure that actual costs incurred by the Secretary of Defense for healthcare services are accounted for. The Secretary of Defense's actual costs for providing healthcare services to medicare-eligible military beneficiaries met the maintenance of effort requirements. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Secretaries must submit a report to Congress within specified timeframes, detailing the enrollment of medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries in the demonstration project, the impact of easier access to the military treatment system on medicare enrollment, and the primary payers for beneficiaries prior to enrollment. The report to Congress must include details on beneficiaries' previous enrollment in plans, cost-shifting among medical care programs, impact on military treatment system accessibility, management difficulties, and effects of the demonstration project. The report to Congress must include details on the effects of the demonstration project on military treatment facility readiness, Department of Defense medical readiness, budget implications, and the impact on prescription drug costs and accessibility for program beneficiaries."
