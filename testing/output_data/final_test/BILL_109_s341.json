    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial 1-Cent Coin Redesign Act\". It includes findings related to the redesign of the coin. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, demonstrated true courage during the Civil War, led efforts to free slaves, and had a generous heart. He rose to the Presidency through honesty, integrity, and commitment to the United States, ultimately sacrificing his life for the country he loved. Abraham Lincoln, born in Kentucky, grew up in Indiana, gained fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C. The \"Lincoln cent\" was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of his birth, with a design by Victor David Brenner. The Lincoln cent coin features designs emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life, including the original wheat-head design and the current Lincoln Memorial representation in Washington, D.C. This series was issued on the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth and the centennial of the coin's production. The Lincoln cent coin will be redesigned for 2009, featuring designs representing different periods of President Lincoln's life. In 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury will issue redesigned 1-cent coins with 4 different designs representing various aspects of Abraham Lincoln's life. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue 1-cent coins with 4 designs in 2009, with the number of coins for each design determined quarterly. Designs will be selected after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts, and review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. After 2009, 1-cent coins will feature a design symbolizing President Lincoln's role in preserving the United States. Numismatic pennies in 2009 will have the same metallic content as the 1909 penny. Congress supports reproducing the original Victor David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin in 2009."
