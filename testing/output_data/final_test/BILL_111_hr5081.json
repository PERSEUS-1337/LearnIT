    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Broadband for First Responders Act of 2010\". The Congress recognizes the critical need for a wireless public safety broadband network to enhance communication capabilities for first responders and public safety agencies, especially in times of emergencies like terrorist attacks and natural disasters. Many current systems lack broadband capabilities, hindering effective communication and response efforts. A wireless public safety broadband network is crucial for first responder interoperability and priority access across the United States. Allocating the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz spectrum bands to public safety agencies, known as the D Block, is essential to meet their spectrum needs and reduce operating costs. Regional flexibility is necessary to tailor communication systems to each area's specific requirements. The most cost-effective way to achieve nationwide interoperability in public safety communications is to leverage commercial infrastructure while meeting the mission-critical needs of public safety agencies. Standardized technologies from the commercial telecommunications sector offer improved capabilities, economies of scale, and rapid adoption of innovations. The Federal Communications Commission should encourage the use of existing or planned commercial infrastructure when it benefits public safety. SEC. 3. ALLOCATION AND ASSIGNMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY LICENSES. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to allocate spectrum bands for public safety broadband communications, specifically the bands of 758-763 megahertz and 788-793 megahertz. The FCC is required to assign these bands to public safety within 60 days of the Broadband for First Responders Act of 2010. Rules will be established for public safety broadband licensees. The FCC will allow public safety broadband licensees to authorize providers to build and operate a wireless broadband network in licensed spectrum to expedite deployment. The network must be fully interoperable with other public safety systems. The FCC will establish rules for public safety broadband systems to provide roaming, priority access, disaster survivability, and cybersecurity within 180 days of the Broadband for First Responders Act of 2010. The FCC will establish regulations for network-sharing agreements to allow shared use of public safety broadband spectrum by entities not defined as public safety services, while ensuring priority access for public safety services. This includes allowing emergency response providers to use the spectrum. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to define \"public safety broadband spectrum\" as specific electromagnetic frequencies allocated for public safety use. This includes frequencies between 758-768 MHz and 788-798 MHz, with additional frequencies designated by the Commission for public safety broadband use. SEC. 4. STANDARDS. The Federal Communications Commission, in consultation with various agencies, must develop interoperability requirements for public safety agencies within 180 days of the Act's enactment. These requirements aim to enable nationwide interoperability and roaming across different communication systems using public safety broadband spectrum. The specifications will establish standards considering the availability of technologies in the commercial marketplace. The Federal Communications Commission must establish interoperability requirements for public safety agencies to ensure nationwide communication across different systems. These requirements include the availability of technologies in the commercial marketplace, non-discriminatory licensing terms, evolving with technological developments, prioritization for public safety transmissions, security measures, and other relevant considerations."
