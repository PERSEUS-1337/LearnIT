    "content": "The \"Seabed Protection Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section highlights important information related to the act. The Congress finds that oceans cover more than 2/3 of Earth's surface, contain a diverse range of life forms, support human population with essential resources, and are negatively impacted by bottom trawling and other fishing practices affecting a large seabed area annually. The impact of bottom trawling and other fishing practices on the ocean environment results in a loss of biological diversity, affecting industries and people dependent on it. Recovery of the seabed from these effects is uncertain, with some areas potentially taking decades or centuries to fully recover. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. MORATORIUM.\" is a concise statement indicating the implementation of a moratorium. This follows a discussion on the negative impact of fishing practices on the ocean environment and the uncertainty of seabed recovery. The text chunk discusses the prohibition of bottom trawling and mobile fishing gear in specific marine areas until certain conditions are met, including completion of a study on the effects of these practices, determination of negligible impacts on biodiversity and fish stocks, and approval of fishery management plans. The marine areas described in the text prohibit bottom trawling and mobile fishing gear practices that threaten ecosystem sustainability. These areas include Heceta Banks off the coast of Oregon and Cordell Bank off the coast of central California. The marine protected areas in California include Gulf of the Farallones, Tanner and Cortez Banks, Punta Gorda, and Cape Blanco. Additionally, Florida Middle Grounds in the Gulf of Mexico and Dry Tortugas are also protected areas. The Dry Tortugas is a marine protected area located in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida. Other protected areas mentioned include Nantucket Shoals in Massachusetts, Jeffrey's Ledge, Tillies Bank, and Stellwagon Bank in the Gulf of Maine, Cashes Ledge in the Gulf of Maine, Stonewall Bank in Oregon, and Rogue River Reef in Oregon. The Secretary of Commerce may provide further descriptions for these areas. The Secretary of Commerce may further describe protected areas, and report annually on their recovery from bottom trawling. Limitations apply if state laws or fishery management plans are equally effective. Definitions include the term \"negligible.\" In this section, \"negligible\" means insufficient to diminish fish stocks' productivity or significantly reduce other marine life. \"Sustainability of ecosystems\" refers to maintaining fish stocks' productivity and other marine species abundances in areas not subject to bottom trawling. Areas not subject to bottom trawling and mobile fishing gear practices."
