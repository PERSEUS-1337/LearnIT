PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS. Section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include definitions for terms like assessment, Director, FEMA, and incident. This section also outlines the process for preliminary damage assessments. The text discusses the process for preliminary damage assessment in the event of a disaster or emergency, involving verification of information by the State to determine the need for federal assistance. The text outlines the process for a joint FEMA-State preliminary damage assessment following a disaster or emergency. Each State must appoint a damage assessment team with representatives from the Federal Government, State, and potentially local government to assess the type, extent, and location of damage. The State is responsible for coordinating participation in the assessment and ensuring timely notification of activities, while FEMA must determine the necessary representatives for the assessment. The State coordinates assessment participation and notifies activities, while FEMA designates an official to brief the assessment team and consult with State officials post-assessment. The State, in consultation with FEMA, may choose not to conduct an assessment in cases of severe incidents that do not require field damage assessments for supplemental Federal assistance. This waiver can also be applied in other appropriate situations as determined by the State and FEMA. Managerial response assessments can be conducted to determine unmet needs. SEC. 3. FRAUD.
