The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 amended reporting requirements to be quarterly instead of semi-annual. The Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act established requirements for individuals lobbying Congress to register and report to the House and Senate. The Lobbying Act of 1995 replaced the initial registration and disclosure provisions from the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. It required individuals lobbying Congress to register with the House and Senate, disclose activities, and make statements under oath. Fines and jail time were established for incorrect reporting, with registration thresholds set for lobbying activities. Individuals had to register if they contacted Congress about legislation and provide required information to the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate. The Lobbying Act of 1995 required lobbyists to register with the House and Senate, disclose their activities, and provide detailed information under oath. This included their name, business address, employer's information, payment details, expenses, and contributions received. Quarterly disclosure statements had to be filed, detailing money received and expended, persons paid, legislation influenced, and contributions received. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 repealed the Lobbying Act portion of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, providing specific thresholds and definitions of lobbying activities and lobbyists. The LDA aimed to strengthen public disclosure requirements for individuals or entities lobbying Congress, focusing on those whose \"principal purpose\" was direct lobbying. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 aimed to strengthen public disclosure requirements for lobbyists by replacing existing laws with a single statute. It streamlined disclosure requirements, mandated registration and regular reporting by professional lobbyists, and improved enforcement mechanisms. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 requires lobbyists to register within 45 days of making a lobbying contact if income or expenses related to lobbying activities do not exceed certain thresholds. Registration must include specific details about the lobbyist and their client. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 mandates lobbyists to register within 45 days of a lobbying contact if income or expenses do not exceed set thresholds. Registration entails details about the lobbyist, client, any contributing organizations, foreign entities with significant ownership, and general issue areas. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 requires lobbyists to register within 45 days of a lobbying contact if income or expenses do not exceed set thresholds. Registration includes details about the lobbyist, client, contributing organizations, foreign entities with significant ownership, and general issue areas. Registrants must also disclose any payments over $10,000 for lobbying activities, expected issue areas for lobbying, and names of employees acting as lobbyists. Once a lobbyist or lobbying firm is registered with the Clerk and the Secretary under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA), semi-annual reports must be filed within 45 days of the reporting period's end for each client. The report should include the registrant's name, client's name, any updates to initial registration information, and specific lobbying activities on behalf of the client, including issues and references to bill numbers or executive branch actions. The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires registered lobbyists to submit semi-annual reports detailing lobbying activities, including client information, contacts, and expenses. The Clerk and Secretary oversee the accuracy and completeness of these disclosures. The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires registered lobbyists to submit semi-annual reports detailing lobbying activities, including client information, contacts, and expenses. The Act also mandates the creation of a list of registered lobbyists, lobbying firms, and clients publicly available, a computerized filing system, public inspection of all filings, retention of registration and disclosure statements for at least six years, and notification of non-compliance to lobbyists or lobbying firms. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 further refined thresholds and definitions of lobbying activities, changed reporting frequency, added disclosures, and created new requirements. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA) made changes to the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) by adding new disclosure requirements, creating quarterly reporting periods instead of semi-annual, and shortening the deadline for submission to 20 days after the filing period ends. The Clerk and Secretary were required to make registration and disclosure forms available online for public inspection. The Lobbying Disclosure Act was amended to require quarterly reports on lobbying activities within 20 days after each quarterly period. The threshold for filing reports was lowered to $2,500 for income and $10,000 for expenses. The Lobbying Disclosure Act was amended to include a new semi-annual reporting requirement for campaign and presidential library contributions by lobbyists and lobbying firms. Reports are due within 30 days of the reporting period and must include detailed information on contributions made. The Lobbying Disclosure Act now requires lobbyists and lobbying firms to report campaign and presidential library contributions semi-annually. Reports must include details such as the date, recipient, and amount of funds contributed, as well as certifications regarding compliance with Senate and House rules on gifts and travel. The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires reporting of campaign and presidential library contributions semi-annually, including details of date, recipient, and amount. Lobbyists must comply with Senate and House rules on gifts and travel. The Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate collect registration and disclosure data since 1995. Analysis of registration and disclosure trends under the LDA and HLOGA amendments is possible using this data. Data from 2001-2007 and 2008-2010 show changes post-HLOGA amendments. Lobbyists and lobbying firms file registration and disclosure forms using a single computer-based system mandated by the LDA. The Clerk and the Secretary collect registration and disclosure data using different search engines. Data from the Clerk are preferred for analyzing lobbying registration and disclosure trends before and after the HLOGA amendments. This data allows for a systematic examination of the impact of the amendments on the lobbying community. Since 2001, almost 50,000 lobbyists and lobbying firms have filed registration and disclosure forms. Since 2001, nearly 50,000 individuals and firms have registered as lobbyists under the LDA. The number of new registrations varies annually, with more new registrations in the first session of Congress. Lobbyists and firms must also amend registration forms when changes occur. Figure 1 displays the total number of new registrants and registration amendments filed per year before and after the HLOGA amendments. The number of registration amendments under the HLOGA varied, with a peak in 2008 at 981 forms, decreasing to 884 in 2009, and returning to 587 in 2010. The fluctuations do not follow a specific pattern but seem to be influenced by lobbyists' need to adjust forms due to staff changes and new clients. The HLOGA amendments required electronic filing, although lobbyists could already file electronically since 2002. Since 2009, all registrations were filed electronically, with a significant increase in electronic filings starting in 2005. By 2007, 94.7% of lobbyists and lobbying firms were filing electronically, and this trend continued with 100% electronic filings in 2009 and 2010. The number of registration termination reports filed by lobbyists and lobbying firms increased annually from 2001 to 2010, except for slight declines in 2007 and 2010. The difference in terminations between mid-year and year-end reporting periods may be due to adjustments in clients and staff at the end of congressional sessions. The number of termination reports filed by lobbyists and lobbying firms increased annually from 2001 to 2010, with a trend towards more year-end terminations. Termination reports changed from semi-annual to quarterly under the HLGOA amendments, showing higher terminations in the fourth quarter. The number of termination reports filed by lobbyists and lobbying firms increased annually from 2001 to 2010, with a trend towards more year-end terminations. The difference in terminations in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 may exist because lobbyists and lobbying firms change clients and staff more frequently at the beginning and end of a Congress. The increase in registration terminations could reflect the change in administration from a Republican to a Democratic White House. Lobbyists and lobbying firms adjust staffing levels to reflect changes in administration priorities and policy under the LDA. The number of disclosure reports filed by lobbyists and lobbying firms has increased over the years, with a peak of 19,178 reports in 2007. The shift from semi-annual to quarterly reports began in 2008 under the HLOGA amendments. The increase in year-end reports may indicate heightened lobbying activity towards the end of a congressional session. The shift from semi-annual to quarterly disclosure reports began in 2008 under the HLOGA amendments. Figure 6 shows the volume of quarterly disclosure reports filed between 2008 and 2010, with fluctuations in the number of reports filed each quarter. The decline in filings in the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2010 appears incongruous with previous data, possibly due to the end of a Congress. The number of disclosures filed in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2010 may have decreased due to the end of a Congress, leading to reduced lobbying activity. The impact of the HLOGA on registration, termination, and disclosure of lobbyists and lobbying firms is mixed, with registration and termination trends continuing as before the amendments. Terminations increased in 2008 and 2009, particularly in congressional election years, followed by a slight decline the following year. The filing of disclosure statements has changed, requiring lobbyists and lobbying firms to report four times per year instead of twice. Data analysis shows a decline in disclosure reports for the fourth quarter in 2008 and 2010, indicating more lobbying activity in the first three quarters of the year. The 2008 and 2010 upticks in lobbying activity may be linked to the transition to a new presidential administration and Congress. Fourth quarter lobbying remains high, possibly due to the continuation of Congress's legislative agenda. Lobbying for provisions initiated in the 111th Congress continued through sessions. According to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 and Open Government Act of 2007, specific definitions apply to the registration and disclosure process."
