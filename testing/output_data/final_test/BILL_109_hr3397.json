    "content": "The Act titled \"General Aviation Security Act of 2005\" focuses on enhancing security measures at general aviation airports. The \"General Aviation Security Act of 2005\" amends Subchapter I of chapter 449 of title 49, United States Code, by adding a section on general aviation airport security. Definitions for general aviation airport, private-use airport, and public-use airport are provided. The General Aviation Security Act of 2005 defines a public-use airport as a general aviation airport open to the public without prior approval, except as required by law. The Act requires registration of private and public-use airports with the Secretary of Homeland Security within one year of enactment, with registrations valid for 3 years. The General Aviation Security Act of 2005 mandates the registration of public-use airports with the Secretary of Homeland Security, with registrations valid for 3 years. The registration forms must include airport addresses, contact information, security personnel details, a map of the airport, and any other required information. The registration of public-use airports with the Secretary of Homeland Security must be renewed every 3 years, accompanied by a written security plan. The Secretary may impose fees to cover registration costs. The Secretary requires airports to have a written security plan consistent with TSA guidelines, to be updated every 3 years with registration renewal. When developing a written security plan, airports must consider security enhancement recommendations from the most recent TSA guidelines for general aviation airports. The plan should address each recommendation and provide justifications for not adopting any suggestions that do not fit the airport's security characteristics. Airports should use self-assessment tools to determine which recommendations apply to their specific characteristics. Private and public-use airports must submit their security plan and updates to local law enforcement agencies. Private-use airports must also ensure all aircraft are double-locked. The security requirements for private-use airports include double-locking aircraft, locking hangars when not in use, and providing adequate fencing. Public-use airports must also verify passenger identities, maintain a log of transient aircraft for 5 years, and have a list of emergency contacts. Security measures for private-use airports include developing a list of emergency contacts, restricting access to aircraft keys, requiring government-issued identification for renting aircraft, posting security warning signs, and creating an emergency locator map for emergency response agencies. Private-use airports must provide emergency response and law enforcement agencies with updated maps of the airport layout within 60 days of any physical changes. Local law enforcement should be familiarized with the airport and consulted on security procedures. Confidentiality statements must be displayed on the required maps and security plans. The document emphasizes the importance of maintaining confidentiality of safety and security information obtained from airports. The Secretary and agencies receiving this information are prohibited from disclosing it if withholding is consistent with safety and security responsibilities. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the analysis of subchapter I of chapter 449 of title 49, United States Code. General aviation airport security is addressed in the document."
