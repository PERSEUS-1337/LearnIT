    "content": "The report focuses on FY2020 discretionary appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. Congress is determining funding levels and terms for agencies. Currently, agencies are receiving FY2019 level appropriations due to a lack of regular appropriations before the start of the fiscal year. President Trump sought $32.47 billion for agencies in the Interior bill for FY2020. The House and Senate included appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies in Division C of H.R. 3055 for FY2020. The total funding was $39.59 billion, with $2.25 billion allocated for wildfire suppression. President Trump had initially requested $32.47 billion for these agencies. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 2580 with a total of $38.11 billion, including $2.25 billion for wildfire suppression. The report compares appropriations for FY2019, President Trump's FY2020 request, House and Senate FY2020 appropriations. The FY2020 appropriations for selected agencies and issues of interest to Congress include the Bureau of Land Management, EPA, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, and more. Appropriations are complex, with budget justifications often being lengthy and containing various funding and programmatic changes for congressional consideration. The report does not provide detailed information at the account and subaccount levels or budgetary reorganizations for FY2020 appropriations. For specific details on agencies or programs, contact key policy staff or visit the CRS website for related reports on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations. The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill includes funding for agencies in three federal departments and related agencies. Title I funds Department of the Interior agencies, Title II funds EPA, and Title III funds 23 other agencies. The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill funds various agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, arts and cultural agencies like the Smithsonian Institution, and other organizations. Title III includes administrative provisions for some agencies, while Title IV provides guidance for agencies like the EPA. The Department of Interior's mission is to conserve natural resources, provide information on resources and hazards, and fulfill commitments to Native American communities. Eight DOI agencies and two other accounts are funded in the bill to carry out this mission. The Interior bill funds DOI agencies like the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manage millions of acres of public land for various uses including energy development and wildlife conservation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, along with other federal agencies, manages marine refuges, national monuments, and implements the Endangered Species Act. The National Park Service administers 80 million acres of federal land, with a mission to preserve resources and provide for public enjoyment. The U.S. Geological Survey provides information on geological resources, natural hazards, climate change, and energy resources. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management oversees offshore energy development in various regions. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement regulates resource development in the outer continental shelf, focusing on oil and gas permitting, facility inspections, environmental compliance, and oil spill response planning. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement works with states and tribes to reclaim abandoned coal mining sites and regulates active coal mining to minimize environmental impacts. Indian Affairs agencies provide services to federally recognized tribes and their members. The Bureau of Indian Education and Bureau of Indian Affairs provide various programs and services to tribes, including education, government operations, law enforcement, social programs, economic development, and environmental protection. The Environmental Protection Agency administers environmental statutes to protect human health and the environment, focusing on air quality, water quality, drinking water safety, pesticides, and toxic substances. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforces federal statutes on air and water quality, drinking water safety, pesticides, toxic substances, and waste management. EPA also provides grants to states and local governments for pollution control and oversees programs for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. The Interior bill funds 23 agencies, including the Forest Service managing 193 million acres of federal land. The Forest System, managed by the Department of Agriculture, oversees national forests, grasslands, and other areas in 43 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The Indian Health Service, under the Department of Health and Human Services, provides medical and environmental health services to 2.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a network of facilities and programs. The Smithsonian Institution consists of 19 museums, the National Zoo, and 9 research facilities funded by federal appropriations and a private trust. The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities support arts and humanities disciplines through grants. The National Endowment for the Humanities provides grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public programs. It also supports regional humanities centers and state humanities councils.

Figure 3 and Table 1 provide a detailed breakdown of the appropriations for each agency. The FY2020 appropriations for agencies in the Interior bill were $38.11 billion, including $2.25 billion for wildfire suppression. There are differences among the FY2019 enacted appropriations and the FY2020 funding requested by the President, passed by the House, and passed by the Senate. Selected agencies and programs are compared for FY2019 total funding with FY2020 levels requested by the Administration, approved by the House, and approved by the Senate.

The Senate-passed bill allocated $1.40 billion for BLM, a 4.0% increase over FY2019, with increased funding for programs within the Management of Lands and Resources account. The House did not support the budget restructuring for the Land Acquisition and Oregon and California Grant Lands accounts as proposed in the President's FY2020 request. The Senate-passed bill generally maintained funding levels for most accounts, with the largest increase of $35.0 million (43%) allocated for wild horse and burro management. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) received a total appropriation of $9.26 billion for FY2019, including emergency supplemental appropriations. However, the Administration's FY2020 request proposed a decrease of 32.8% to $6.22 billion for EPA funding. The Administration's FY2020 request for EPA funding was $6.22 billion, with lower funding for most accounts except for Buildings and Facilities. The House-passed bill allocated $9.53 billion for EPA in FY2020, an increase of 2.9% from FY2019 appropriations. Most accounts received additional funds, except for STAG and Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Program. The House-passed bill allocated $9.53 billion for EPA in FY2020, an increase of 2.9% from FY2019 appropriations. The Senate-passed bill contained $9.01 billion for EPA for FY2020, with some accounts remaining level, others increasing, and some decreasing. The Administration proposed a reduction in funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, including significant cuts to Construction and Land Acquisition accounts. The Resource Management account would also see an overall reduction, but with proposed increases for certain programs like the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Administration proposed eliminating discretionary appropriations for two FWS accounts - the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund and the National Wildlife Refuge Fund, citing \"higher priorities.\" The House-passed bill would reduce FWS funding by 0.5% relative to the FY2019 enacted appropriation, with Construction reduced as under the President's proposal. However, the measure would increase funding for Resource Management, ecological services, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, and Land Acquisition. The Senate-passed bill would reduce FWS funding by 1.8% from the FY2019 enacted level, with decreases in Construction, Land Acquisition, and the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. The Administration proposed changes in funding levels for various accounts within the Forest Service, including increased funding for Wildland Fire Management and decreased funding for State and Private Forestry, Forest and Rangeland Research, and the National Forest System. The overall proposed budget for the Forest Service for FY2020 is $7.09 billion, a 2.1% increase from FY2019. The Administration proposed changes in funding levels for various accounts within the Forest Service for FY2020. This includes increased funding for Wildland Fire Management and decreased funding for State and Private Forestry, Forest and Rangeland Research, and the National Forest System. The House-passed bill for FY2020 would provide an increase for the Forest Service of 10.1% over FY2019, with a new account for administrative support functions. The Senate-passed bill for FY2020 includes a new Forest Service Operations account with $953.8 million to cover certain costs of salaries and expenses, aiming to increase transparency and efficiency in agency spending. This represents a 7.6% increase over FY2019 funding levels. The Senate-passed bill for FY2020 includes a new Forest Service Operations account with $953.8 million to cover salaries and expenses, aiming to increase transparency and efficiency in agency spending. The bill reflects reductions for several FS accounts from FY2019 levels, with the Administration proposing funding the Bureau of Indian Education independently from the Bureau of Indian Affairs for FY2020. The Administration proposed a separate budget structure for the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) to improve learning outcomes and reduce overlapping functions with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The FY2020 budget request of $2.77 billion for both bureaus was 9.9% less than FY2019, with lower funding for many Indian programs but higher funding for self-governance compacts. Construction saw the largest decrease in funding. The House and Senate passed measures supporting the Administration's request to establish and fund the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) separately from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Both measures included overall increases in funding for Indian Affairs, with higher funding levels for tribal government, natural resources management, and public safety and justice programs. Construction, including educational facilities, saw significant funding increases in both measures. The Appropriations Committee supports separating the Bureau of Indian Education from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to improve education quality at BIE-funded schools. The bill includes a 1.6% increase in funding for Indian Affairs, with some programs receiving additional funds like contract support costs and self-governance compacts. The Indian Health Service would receive $5.91 billion in FY2020, a 1.8% increase from FY2019, with the largest increase for hospital and health clinics. The Administration's proposed budget for the Indian Health Service in FY2020 includes a significant increase in funding for hospital and health clinics, with a focus on initiatives to combat Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS. Other programs would see reductions, such as funding for health education and construction of healthcare facilities. Additionally, appropriations for community health representatives would be decreased to transition to a National Community Health Aide Program. Funding for contract support costs would remain stable. The House-passed bill for FY2020 included a 9.3% increase in funding for the Indian Health Service, with additional appropriations for clinical services, alcohol and substance abuse programs, urban Indian health services, and Indian health professions. The Indian Health Facilities account would also see a 9.7% increase, with a focus on construction of healthcare facilities. Funding for health education and community health would remain essentially level. The House bill for FY2020 maintained level funding for health education and community health representatives, with a $25.0 million allocation for an electronic health record system. The Senate-passed measure included a 4.1% increase in appropriations, with additional funds for clinical services, hospital and health clinics, and Indian Health Facilities. Funding for contract support costs remained stable, and $3.0 million was allocated for the electronic health record system. The LWCF has funded land acquisition for federal land management agencies and a matching grant program for outdoor recreation. In FY2019, $435.0 million was appropriated from the LWCF. However, for FY2020, the Administration did not seek discretionary appropriations for most programs funded by the LWCF. The Administration proposed a rescission of -$23.5 million for LWCF programs, citing higher priorities and a shift in funding for the state grant program. The House-passed bill contained $524.0 million in appropriations. The House-passed bill included $524.0 million in appropriations from the LWCF, a 20.4% increase over FY2019. The Senate-passed bill, with $29.0 million in rescissions, would provide about $436 million in total LWCF appropriations for FY2020. The Administration requested $2.74 billion for the National Park Service for FY2020, an 18.2% decrease from FY2019. The President proposed eliminating discretionary funding for some programs, including grants for National Heritage Areas, outdoor recreation grants to states, NPS acquisitions through LWCF, and the Centennial Challenge Program. The House and Senate approved relatively level funding for FY2020, with slight increases in both bills for certain programs like resource stewardship and park protection. Both House and Senate bills for FY2020 contained funding for Land Acquisition, grants for outdoor recreation, and NPS acquisitions. The President's FY2020 request included a reduction in the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program. The House and Senate bills also included funding for National Heritage Areas and the Centennial Challenge Program. For FY2020, the House and Senate bills would provide $500.0 million for PILT, compensating counties for nontaxable lands. The Administration requested $25.3 million for reorganization of DOI agencies, a 79.4% increase from FY2019. Funds would be used for transitioning to a new regional structure and integrating operations. The House-passed bill did not specify further details. The House and Senate bills for FY2020 did not specify funding for DOI reorganization. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding that did not align with the Department's reorganization plan. The Senate bill did not clarify the extent of funds allocated for DOI reorganization. The Smithsonian Institution would receive $978.3 million under the Administration's request for FY2020, a decrease of 6.2% from FY2019. However, most SI museums and research institutes would receive funding at or near the FY2019 level. The President's request for FY2020 includes a 0.9% increase in funding for most SI museums and research institutes, with additional funds (3.5%) allocated for facilities services. However, there is a proposed decrease (27.8%) in the Facilities Capital account for planning and design. Major revitalization projects for the National Air and Space Museum, National Zoo, and Hirshhorn Museum are included in the request. The House approved a 2.7% increase in funding for SI, with most museums and research institutes receiving funding at or above the FY2019 level. The House bill included a 29.4% increase for facilities services, with funding directed towards maintenance. There was a decrease of 27.8% for the Facilities Capital account. The Senate-passed bill included a 0.4% increase for SI museums and research institutes, and a 2.6% increase for facilities services. The Senate also allocated more funding for the revitalization of the National Air and Space Museum. The USGS would receive $983.5 million under the Administration's FY2020 request, a decrease of 21.9% relative to its total FY2019 appropriations. The Administration's FY2020 request for USGS is $983.5 million, a 21.9% decrease from FY2019. The proposed budget restructuring aims to consolidate programs and improve communication. The House approved a 1.8% reduction for USGS in FY2020, with decreases in some major activities and increases in others. The House Committee on Appropriations disagreed with the Administration's proposed budget restructuring for USGS, citing concerns about reduced transparency. The Senate passed a bill with a 3.9% decrease in funding for USGS compared to the previous year. The Senate's increase in funding for core science systems was mainly due to the inclusion of funding for national land imaging, previously under a different activity. The Administration proposed $6.05 billion in appropriations for FY2020. The Administration proposed $6.05 billion in appropriations for Wildland Fire Management (WFM) of DOI and FS for FY2020, including a discretionary cap adjustment of $2.25 billion for wildfire suppression. This would be a 15.4% increase over the total FY2019 enacted level for DOI and FS. Both the House and Senate passed bills included the $2.25 billion cap adjustment as requested by the President. Comparisons between FY2019 and FY2020 appropriations for Wildland Fire Management are difficult due to differences in funding allocations. The FY2020 House- and Senate-passed bills do not include certain administrative support functions for Wildland Fire Management that were in the FY2019 enacted level and the FY2020 President's request."
