    "content": "The \"Advance Directives Education Act of 2005\" includes sections on improving policies related to advance directives, increasing awareness of End-of-Life planning, conducting a study on a national advance directive registry, and implementing advance directives at State DMVs. Congress finds that 2,500,000 people die in the US annually, with 80% passing away in institutions due to chronic illnesses like cancer and heart disease. A study highlighted unmet needs for those dying in institutions, emphasizing the benefits of hospice care at home. The Supreme Court affirmed the right of competent adults to make end-of-life decisions in 1997. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the constitutional right of competent adults to refuse medical treatment and emphasized the use of advance directives to safeguard this right. Despite the Patient Self-Determination Act, only 15-20% of the general population have advance directives. Competent adults are encouraged to complete advance care plans to outline their healthcare decisions in case they become unable to communicate. The Act aims to improve access to information about health care options and legal rights near the end of life, promote advance care planning, and engage healthcare providers in disseminating information about advance directives like living wills and durable powers of attorney for healthcare.
