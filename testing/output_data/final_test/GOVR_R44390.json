    "content": "The focus on locally sourced foods and \"buy local\" campaigns have a long history, with state branding programs dating back to the 1930s. The USDA has also emphasized supporting the \"local farm economy\" through policy changes. Consumer interest in local foods has grown significantly in recent years, leading to increased demand and willingness to pay more for such products. Despite the popularity of the local foods market, there is no established. Local foods are popular but lack a clear definition. They are typically produced near where they are consumed, with a focus on geographic proximity or the distance the food travels. Local foods may also involve specific marketing channels and attributes desired by consumers, such as supporting small family farms or sustainable agriculture practices. The lack of a clear definition for local food raises questions about its use in addressing community needs and potential for fraud in the marketplace. Consumers often confuse \"local\" and \"organic\" foods, despite only a small percentage of organic products being directly marketed. Distance between production and consumption is one measure of local food, but there is no consensus on its definition. The definition of \"local\" food varies widely, with distances ranging from 25 to 350 miles in the US and about 31 miles in Canada. In the US, it applies to products transported less than 400 miles or within the state. State definitions often view \"local\" as grown within state borders, but it can also include a certain geographic region crossing state lines. Definitions depend on the state or region and whether the food is fresh or processed. The distance for local food varies depending on the state or region and whether the food is fresh or processed. Consumers often believe local food is sourced within 100 miles, even though this may not be true. Two US federal laws have different definitions of local food production based on geographic distance, requiring food to be sold within the state where it is produced to be considered local. The USDA loan program defines \"local food product\" as agricultural food raised, produced, and distributed within 400 miles or within the state. Food safety legislation exempts smaller producers if the consumer, restaurant, or retail establishment is within the same state or 275 miles from the farm. The European Commission defines \"local farming\" as producing agricultural products for sale in a reasonably close area. The term \"local food systems\" refers to the production, processing, trading, and consumption of food in a small geographical area. Consumers define \"local area\" as within a 20-100 km radius from the point of production. A survey shows that most consumers consider food \"local\" if produced within a 100-mile radius or within the same state. The term \"local food systems\" refers to the production, processing, trading, and consumption of food in a small geographical area. Consumers define \"local area\" as within a 20-100 km radius from the point of production. Most consumers consider \"local\" as produced within 50 miles, while some consider it within 100 miles. Federal guidelines for labeling food as \"locally grown\" are lacking, and states have taken on this responsibility. The USDA collects data on local agricultural products based on marketing channels used by farmers. Direct-to-consumer outlets include roadside stands, farmers' markets, and CSAs, while intermediated outlets include grocers and restaurants. In 2012, 144,530 farms sold $1.3 billion directly to consumers, accounting for 6.9% of all U.S. farms. Direct sales increased by 6% compared to 2007. In 2012, direct consumer sales increased by 8%, with an average value of $9,063 per farm. California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan accounted for one-third of all direct consumer sales. Farms in all U.S. states reported direct-to-consumer food sales. Leading states for direct-to-consumer marketing sales include California, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Oregon, Ohio, Washington, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and Texas. Products directly marketed to consumers include nursery and greenhouse products, fruits and vegetables, and livestock and dairy products. In 2012, nearly 95,000 farms in states like Texas, California, Kentucky, Missouri, and Oklahoma produced and sold value-added products, including beef jerky, fruit jams, floral arrangements, cider, and wine. Direct-to-consumer sales accounted for less than one-fifth of all local agricultural products marketed, with small farms making up the majority of direct sales. Three-fourths of farms selling directly to consumers had annual sales of less than $5,000 in 2012. In 2012, small farms with annual sales of less than $5,000 accounted for 11% of total sales, while farms with sales of more than $50,000 made up 3% of farms but 58% of total sales. Support for agriculture and the local economy is a key motivator for consumers buying local food products. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for fresh produce directly from a producer for various reasons: economic support for agriculture and the community (30%), perceived quality and safety (27%), relationship with land and environmental benefits (22%), and minimizing food miles and energy dependency (21%). Other attributes include support for local farms (36%), perceived nutritional and food safety benefits (26% and 22% respectively), and support for organic production practices (16%). Studies show that purchasing locally sourced foods helps local economies, provides a better assortment of products, offers healthier alternatives, improves the carbon footprint, and increases natural or organic production. Consumer support for local foods is crucial for small businesses facing marketing challenges. USDA reports barriers like capacity constraints, distribution systems, and lack of resources for capital and infrastructure. Producers also struggle with access to processing services, delivery procedures, and regulatory uncertainties. Consumer support for local foods is essential for small businesses facing marketing challenges, with barriers including capacity constraints, distribution systems, and lack of resources for capital and infrastructure. Challenges for beginning farmers include lack of capital, access to credit and land, but valuable programs like apprenticeships and CSAs can help. Attributes of local agricultural products may include production by small family farms, urban farms, or those using sustainable practices, driven by consumer desire to support local farmers and promote certain social or supply-chain characteristics. Consumer support for local foods is crucial for small businesses facing marketing challenges, with barriers such as capacity constraints and lack of resources. Attributes of local agricultural products include production by small family farms or those using sustainable practices. A 2015 national survey by the American Farmland Trust and the Farmers Market Coalition found that producers at farmers' markets prioritize integrated pest management, organic standards, and soil health practices. Consumer demand for local foods is influenced by factors like organic certification, soil health practices, and support for small and medium-sized farms. Consumers often prefer products from specific regions and value personal communication with farmers. Small farms rely more on direct-to-consumer marketing channels, while sustainable agriculture practices drive demand for local foods. The definition of \"local\" foods is debated among consumers and producers. The debate over what constitutes \"sustainable agriculture\" continues, with various definitions including profit, stewardship of land, and quality of life for farmers. Some definitions also focus on environmental health, economic profitability, and social equity. U.S. food companies are integrating sustainability into their supply chains, and there is advocacy for local food systems to address issues like lack of access to healthy foods in certain communities. Access to healthy foods in low-income or underserved communities, known as \"food deserts,\" refers to areas lacking affordable and nutritious food options. The CDC highlights the negative health outcomes, such as obesity and chronic disease, associated with limited access to fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat milk. More research is needed to understand how access influences consumer food choices. Research is needed to determine how access influences the types of foods consumers purchase and eat. Various policy options have been identified to address food deserts, including incentives for grocery stores, developing alternative retail outlets, improving transportation networks, increasing fresh food stocks, reducing food waste, and promoting local food production. Some studies question whether increasing access to food in food deserts changes dietary habits or obesity levels. In recent years, the demand for \"local\" foods has increased, leading to a rise in direct farm sales and marketing of locally grown foods in the U.S. Local food sales have grown significantly, with USDA estimating sales at $6.1 billion in 2012 from 164,000 farmers. This represents 8% of U.S. farms and 1.5% of total U.S. agricultural production. In 2008, local food sales were estimated at $4.8 billion from 107,200 farms, accounting for 5% of all U.S. farms. In 2012, local food sales in the U.S. reached $6.1 billion from 164,000 farmers, with direct-to-consumer sales accounting for 19% and intermediated marketing outlets for 55%. Small farms rely more on direct-to-consumer channels, with most local food farms making less than $75,000 in gross income per year. USDA plans to survey 28,000 farmers about local food production to supplement Census data. The \"Local Foods Survey\" would follow up on the 2012 Census and focus on farmers selling directly to consumers or retail outlets. This effort is in response to calls for more support for local food producers in the next farm bill. USDA supports local food producers, consumers, and markets in the next farm bill. They have expanded data collection on direct-to-market sales and CSAs. The agency's 2012 report, \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food,\" highlights their support for local food projects. Interest in local agricultural economies is growing, with nearly 80% of consumers showing demand for local foods. The demand for local foods is increasing, with surveys showing that a majority of consumers prefer locally sourced food and are willing to pay a premium for it. Local foods, including meats, seafood, and produce, are top menu trends for 2016. The National Grocers Association reports that the demand for local foods may now exceed that for organic foods. The demand for local foods is driven by growing marketplace demand. Large-scale retailers like Walmart and Whole Foods are increasing their offerings of locally sourced fruits and vegetables. Whole Foods supports local food production with low-interest loans to growers and a rating system based on growing practices. Advocates of local food systems cite benefits such as stable farm incomes, job creation, wealth retention, improved access to fresh produce, and enhanced accountability and choice. Buying directly from farmers offers various benefits such as improved access to fresh produce, enhanced accountability, reduced vulnerability to contamination, diversified and sustainable production, and reduced energy use. It also allows producers to retain more value-added costs, keeps money in the local community, and promotes healthier food choices. However, some claimed benefits have been disputed, including reduced productivity and inefficient use of resources. The USDA claims that local and regional food systems benefit U.S. states and congressional districts, with economic gains to the farm economy. Limited economic studies suggest that expanding local food systems can increase employment in communities. Economic studies indicate that expanding local food systems can boost employment and income in a community. However, it remains unclear if local food availability enhances diet quality or food security, or if localized production reduces overall energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Studies use input-output analysis to estimate economic multipliers, showing that fruit and vegetable farms with local sales create more jobs than those without. Farmers' markets also contribute to gains in farm sector output and state product. Local food systems have shown to boost employment and income in communities. Studies have found that local food sales create additional jobs on farms and in the economy. Various types of businesses are engaged in local food systems, including farms selling directly to consumers through farmers' markets, roadside stands, CSAs, on-farm stores, and other sales methods like Internet or mail order. Other forms of local food markets include community gardens, urban farms, community kitchens, and small-scale food processing. Local food systems encompass various types of businesses, including farms selling directly to consumers through farmers' markets, roadside stands, CSAs, on-farm stores, and other sales methods. Other forms of local operations include urban farms, community kitchens, small-scale food processing, and decentralized root cellars. Products sold through these outlets range from fresh foods to processed foods, non-edible products like nursery crops and wool, and may involve intermediaries like restaurants or grocery stores. Distribution and processing within these marketing channels may utilize food hubs, market aggregators, kitchen incubators, and mobile slaughter units. Farmers' markets are a type of direct farmer marketing, along with farm stands, CSAs, and direct sales to schools. The number of farmers' markets has been increasing, with over 8,100 operating in 2014. States with the most farmers' markets include California, New York, and Illinois. Total farmers' market sales exceed $1 billion per year, with products ranging from conventionally produced farm products to natural and locally labeled items. Farmers' markets offer a variety of products including vegetables, fruit, meat, poultry, eggs, and value-added items. The number of markets accepting SNAP benefits has increased, with participants redeeming nearly $18.8 million in 2014, up from $2.6 million in 2008. In 2014, SNAP participants redeemed nearly $18.8 million in food stamps at 5,175 farmers' markets. Projects like \"Double Up Food Bucks\" in Michigan and \"Health Bucks\" in New York City aim to increase low-income consumers' participation at farmers' markets and incentivize fruit and vegetable consumption. Rural areas have shown higher usage of these benefits compared to urban areas. Farm-to-school programs aim to increase fruit and vegetable consumption among students, support local farmers, provide nutrition education, and improve student nutrition. The National Farm to School Network connects schools and local farms to serve healthy meals, educate about agriculture, health, and nutrition, and support local farmers. The USDA's farm-to-school initiatives began in the late 1990s with pilot projects in California and Florida, expanding in the early 2000s. Congress supported these efforts through child nutrition legislation, including the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. By the 2011-2012 school year, over 40,000 schools participated in farm-to-school activities, reaching 23.5 million students. An estimated $385.8 million was spent on local food purchases. The USDA's farm-to-school initiatives have seen significant growth, with over 40,000 schools participating by the 2011-2012 school year. Nearly $385.8 million was spent on local food purchases through these programs. 20% of school districts have guidelines for purchasing locally grown produce, and 40 states have supportive policies in place. CSAs offer a direct link between consumers and farmers, allowing for the purchase of local, seasonal food. States with the highest participation in farm-to-school programs include North Carolina, Kentucky, Texas, Connecticut, Massachusetts, California, Florida, and Vermont. Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is a model where residents pledge support to a farm at the beginning of each year, covering costs and risks in exchange for shares of the farm's production. This model originated in Japan in the 1960s and became popular in Europe in the 1970s. In the United States, over 1,400 CSAs were operating in 2010, with the first one starting in 1985. By 2012, 12,617 farms were marketing products through CSAs, representing less than 1% of total farms in the country. In the United States, farms selling through CSAs make up less than 1% of all farming operations. Leading states for CSAs include California, Texas, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and New York. The American Community Garden Association defines community gardens as land gardened by a group of people, whether in urban, suburban, or rural areas, growing food or flowers. There are approximately 18,000 community gardens in the US, with about 2,100 dedicated to urban agriculture. In the United States, there are an estimated 18,000 community gardens, with about 2,100 recognized as People's Gardens under USDA's initiative. These gardens have donated around 3.9 million pounds of produce to local food banks. Additionally, the National Gardening Association estimates that 35% of U.S. households participated in food gardening in 2013, up from 2008. In the U.S., there has been a significant increase in urban households growing food, with a rise in food gardeners aged 18-34 and households with children. Around 3 million households now participate in community gardening, spending an average of $350 annually on their gardens. Community gardens are linking with urban farming efforts and addressing food access in low-income communities. The history of community gardens dates back over 100 years, including initiatives like \"Liberty Gardens\" and \"Victory Gardens\" during wartime. Despite initial concerns, these gardens have proven to be valuable resources. During World War II, the USDA encouraged home gardeners to plant food, leading to them producing 40% of the nation's produce by the end of the war. Today, market gardens also grow produce for sale or donation, contributing to the urban agriculture trend. Resources like SNAP benefits support households growing their own food, and school gardens, influenced by the Edible Schoolyard Project, are popular, with Alice Waters playing a key role. School gardens are integrated into educational curricula to provide nutrition and science education, teaching children about plants and healthy eating. Nonprofit organizations like FoodCorps support school gardens and nutrition education in limited-resource communities. USDA funds a pilot program for school gardens in high-poverty schools. Various groups also support education, youth empowerment programs, and urban agriculture initiatives in cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia. Various large cities are developing food policy task forces to address local food initiatives. USDA defines a regional food hub as a business managing the distribution of local food products from regional producers. Food hubs offer producer services, training, business management, and value-added product development. They also provide food safety training and liability insurance. Food hubs provide operational services such as aggregation, distribution, brokering, branding, and market development. They also offer community services like \"Buy Local\" campaigns, distribution to \"food deserts,\" food bank donations, health screening, cooking demonstrations, SNAP redemptions, educational programs, and youth and community employment opportunities. There are over 300 food hubs in the US, with clusters in the Midwest and Northeast, acting as aggregation points for food sales. Food hubs serve as aggregation points for raw fruits and vegetables from farmers, facilitating the scaling up of agricultural production and connecting farmers to consumers, wholesalers, retailers, and food-service buyers. They provide online directories, virtual marketplaces, and assistance for farm-to-school programs. Additionally, they offer educational services, technical assistance, and outreach to support agricultural entrepreneurship. A kitchen incubator is a business that provides food preparation facilities to help small start-ups or home-based businesses produce food products. It serves as a resource for new businesses that may not have the capital to invest in their own commercial kitchen, allowing them to rent shared space in a fully licensed facility to comply with food safety laws. A kitchen incubator is a licensed commercial kitchen that helps small food businesses comply with food safety laws. It caters to start-ups, caterers, bakers, street vendors, and specialty food makers. Additionally, a mobile slaughter unit is a self-contained USDA-inspected facility for small-scale meat producers to process meat locally. Mobile Slaughter Units (MSUs) are a response to the consolidation in the meat and poultry industries, providing USDA-inspected slaughter services to small producers in remote areas where traditional facilities are scarce. The first mobile USDA-inspected slaughter unit began operating in Washington State in the early 2000s. Urban farming involves growing food in various urban spaces, including private or public properties like vacant lots, rooftops, community gardens, and backyards. Urban agriculture encompasses growing food in urban spaces such as backyards, city lots, and community gardens, using hydroponic systems. It includes food crops, fruit trees, and grazing of livestock like honey bees and chickens. In the United States, urban agriculture has evolved from vacant lot cultivation to school and community gardens, city farming, and abandoned property reclamation. Operations can be managed by organizations or private enterprises to sell food at retail stores, farmers' markets, or directly to consumers and food processors. Urban agriculture has evolved to include large-scale innovative systems like vertical farms and aquaponic facilities, with examples such as Brooklyn's Grange Farm and Gotham Greens. Operations like Hantz Farms in Detroit and Growing Power in Milwaukee sell directly to consumers and food processors. Urban farming is diverse in systems and motivations, often produced and consumed in close proximity. Urban agriculture in cities involves various activities to achieve food security, income generation, community development, and environmental protection. Objectives include improving access to fresh food, transforming vacant urban property, and educating local residents. Major cities offer educational programs for urban agriculture, with motivations centered around community building, education, and food quality. Urban agriculture in cities is driven by community building, education, food quality, and sustainability. Challenges include city codes, zoning laws, land access, licensing, soil contamination, pollution, waste management, water access, marketing, financing, and more. Globally, 15-30% of food is grown in urban areas, with 60% of irrigated croplands near cities. Locally-produced foods could potentially meet 90% of the US food demand. Urban agriculture in cities has the potential to meet 90% of the national food demand, but some are skeptical due to limited urban land availability and concerns about profitability. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack mentioned USDA's support for urban farmers in 2015. No comprehensive nationwide study exists on the number of urban agriculture sites in the United States. Limited USDA data is available on farms in U.S. metropolitan areas, which accounted for 40% of all U.S. farms and agricultural production in 2007. Metropolitan farms focus on high-value crops like fruits and vegetables, livestock, and dairy products. In 2013, researchers from various universities announced efforts to conduct surveys on urban and peri-urban farms nationwide. Preliminary results are still being interpreted, with limited information available for specific states and localities. A 2012 study estimated 4,648 urban agriculture sites in Chicago, IL, with a production area of about 65 acres. Residential gardens are also included in urban agriculture sites. In Chicago, there were 4,648 urban agriculture sites covering 65 acres, with residential and single-plot gardens making up three-fourths of the total. Only 13% of the 1,236 community gardens were estimated to be producing food, indicating a focus on other services like education and community building. New York has over 700 farms and gardens across its five boroughs, while Greater Philadelphia's food system includes more than 45,000 farms within a 100-mile radius. The radius from Philadelphia extends to 70 counties in five states. Oakland has about 500 urban agriculture sites, Portland has about 300 sites, and Cleveland has 225 community gardens covering 56 acres. USDA data covers all U.S. farms, including urban and metro areas. Case studies highlight urban farms in various states and Puerto Rico. Several states and Puerto Rico have urban agriculture communities, with federal programs providing support for all U.S. farms and ranchers. The Obama Administration has also implemented initiatives to support local food systems. The Obama Administration has implemented departmental initiatives to support local food systems, including the \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" Initiative. Various USDA assistance programs are available to all U.S. farmers, covering a wide range of programs such as farmers' market programs, rural cooperative grants, and child nutrition programs. Funding for local and regional food systems has increased in recent years, with annual funding for selected grants and loans totaling $90 million. Additional funding is available through various federal programs, although the total amount is difficult to estimate precisely. For more detailed information on federal programs supporting local food systems, refer to CRS Report R43950. The Obama Administration has implemented initiatives like the \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" (KYF2) Initiative to support local food systems, leveraging existing USDA programs and promoting collaboration among staff. These initiatives aim to eliminate organizational barriers and enhance support for local and regional food systems. The USDA's initiatives aim to eliminate barriers and promote collaboration among staff to support local food systems. Despite challenges from Congress, expanded support and funding have been provided through farm bills. The impact of these programs depends on funding and implementation. The USDA aims to institutionalize the \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" Initiative as a permanent part of agency activities. Various programs supporting local and regional food systems are authorized through farm bills and child nutrition programs. Proposed legislation seeks to expand support for nontraditional and beginning farmers, nutrition, and food access. Omnibus farm bills govern U.S. agricultural and food programs, with periodic review and renewal every five years. The omnibus farm bill, such as the Agricultural Act of 2014, provides a comprehensive opportunity for policymakers to address agricultural and food issues. Various groups advocate for initiatives to support local and regional food systems and improve access to healthy foods. The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC) and other advocacy groups are pushing for reforms in the farm bill to increase support for new farmers, rural development, conservation, renewable energy, and new market development. Various organizations, including Feeding America and the Food Trust, are also advocating for improved access to healthy foods in schools and underserved communities. In 2014, states like California recommended farm bill changes to boost specialty crop production, improve public health, support organic agriculture, and revitalize local communities. Groups like the Food Trust promoted farmers' markets, farm-to-school programs, and initiatives to reduce food deserts. Child nutrition programs and WIC provide assistance under the National School Lunch Act and Child Nutrition Act. The National School Lunch Act and Child Nutrition Act support local foods, with additional funding from Section 32 of the 1935 act. Congress periodically reviews and reauthorizes these programs, with the most recent reauthorization being the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Some authorities from the last reauthorization expired in 2015, prompting consideration for reauthorization in the 114th Congress. Congress may also change farm policies to enhance support for local food systems and rural communities. Several bills introduced in previous Congresses aimed to enhance support for local food systems and rural communities. These bills proposed comprehensive changes to USDA programs in the farm bill, covering commodity support, crop insurance, farm credit, conservation, nutrition, rural development, research, and horticulture and livestock programs. Some provisions from these bills were included in the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill and other legislation introduced in past Congresses aimed to provide targeted support for non-traditional and beginning farmers, increase access to loans for small farmers, enhance nutrition, and improve food access. Other bills have focused on creating new USDA offices, promoting community-supported agriculture programs, and supporting community garden projects in urban and rural areas. Several bills have been introduced to improve access to nutritious foods in underserved communities, expand child nutrition programs, and support farmers' markets and community garden projects in urban and rural areas. Some bills aim to help schools purchase locally produced foods, while others provide grants and incentives for low-income families to buy fruits and vegetables. Additionally, there are proposals to allow farmers' markets and other farm-to-consumer venues to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. In February 2016, House Agriculture Committee subcommittees held hearings on production and access to locally produced foods, including direct to market farming and incentive programs for low-income families. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry also addressed local food system issues in March 2012. Various House and Senate farm bill briefings have covered topics related to local and regional food systems. Several states and cities have taken steps to improve access to nutritious foods in underserved communities. Several states and cities have enacted laws and policies affecting local food systems, including licensing, zoning, and public health requirements. Urban agriculture workgroups in various localities have issued region-specific recommendations available online. Most states have laws regarding \"cottage foods\" like baked goods and jams. These laws are not covered in the report focusing on federal programs supporting local and regional food systems. Many states allow producers to make foods like baked goods and jams in their homes under cottage food laws. Advocacy groups argue for broader, more equitable policies in the farm bill to support local food systems. The traditional farm subsidy programs are defended for ensuring access to abundant, safe, and affordable food supplies in the US. However, there are criticisms about the focus on selected commodities and calls to revamp farm programs due to concerns about effectiveness, cost, and compatibility with current economic objectives and global trading rules. Some researchers recommend public policy changes to reduce market barriers for local food production and support supply chain development. Congress members advocate for modifying farm policies to enhance support for local food systems and rural communities, aiming for broader and more equitable treatment across different production systems. Some argue for supporting local food systems to boost local economies and promote sustainable farming practices, while others believe it creates a competitive disadvantage for non-local producers. Congress debates extending farm bill support to local food producers, with concerns about traditional agricultural interests. Opposition to extending farm bill benefits to local food systems stems from concerns about limited financial resources for U.S. agricultural producers and the efficient use of natural resources. Criticisms include challenges to USDA's \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative and the perception that support for local foods primarily benefits affluent urban consumers. USDA's focus on local foods benefits urban consumers more than rural farmers."
