    "content": "The reclamation fee rates under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 have been amended to reduce the per ton fees. The Secretary will establish the fee rates by regulation after September 30, 2019 to ensure sufficient funds for required transfers. Section 402(h) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 is amended to allow the Secretary to transfer interest earned by the fund to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund. This amendment applies at the beginning of each fiscal year starting from October 1, 2004. The trustees of the Combined Benefit Fund estimate the amount expended from premium accounts for the fiscal year, minus the amount received in required health benefit premiums. A transfer is made to the United Mine Workers of America 1992 Benefit Plan based on a similar calculation. The 1992 Benefit Plan estimate will be expended for providing required benefits, minus the amount received in monthly premiums. A transfer is made to the multiemployer health benefit plan established after July 20, 1992. The parties established a benefit plan in 1992, with trustees estimating expenses for the next year minus income received. Adjustments are made annually based on actual expenses and income. The Secretary will adjust transfer amounts for the next fiscal year if they are more or less than required. Any interest not previously transferred to the Combined Benefit Fund will be used to offset expenses. The Secretary will adjust transfer amounts for the next fiscal year as needed. Any remaining interest will be used to offset expenses in the Combined Benefit Fund. The Secretary may transfer funds for the next fiscal year based on actuarial projections. Transfers are subject to contribution rates for the plan in question. The Secretary may transfer funds for the next fiscal year based on actuarial projections, subject to contribution rates no less than those in effect on the date of enactment."
