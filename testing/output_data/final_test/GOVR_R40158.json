    "content": "The NBER declared a recession in December 2008, which started in December 2007. Economic concerns arose due to housing market decline, leading to foreclosures. The crisis spread to banking, financial services, and auto manufacturers, worsened by high energy prices and unemployment. National unemployment reached 7.2% in December 2008, with states facing revenue cuts and considering Medicaid eligibility reductions. The recession declared in December 2008 was caused by a housing market decline leading to foreclosures, affecting banking, financial services, and auto manufacturers. States faced revenue cuts and considered reducing Medicaid eligibility. Policymakers took steps to prevent the crisis from spreading further, while Congress and the Obama Administration sought ways to stimulate economic activity. Various stimulus proposals have been considered to boost the economy, including infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and unemployment benefits. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included health components and Medicaid provisions. Legislation similar to H.R. 1, known as ARRA, was introduced in the Senate as S. 350 and underwent markup in the Committee on Finance. The Senate approved S.Amdt. 98 as a substitute for H.R. 1, with further amendments leading to the approval of S.Amdt. 570. Differences between H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 570 include variations in the temporary increase in the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) and its targeting towards states with rising unemployment rates. The temporary FMAP increase under H.R. 1 allows states to cover unemployed workers under Medicaid with 100% FMAP for medical services and administrative costs. H.R. 1 also extends Medicaid regulations moratoria and increases states' DSH allotments by 2.5% for FY2009 and FY2010. The enhanced DSH allotments in S.Amdt. 570 would only benefit low-DSH states, while higher DSH spending states would not receive the increased allotments. Additionally, S.Amdt. 570 includes provisions for Medicare Special Workload Agreements and Medicaid Indian Protections, such as exemptions for Indians from cost sharing and premiums. Managed care entities would need to meet certain conditions to receive Medicaid payments under S.Amdt. 570. The Senate amendment in S.Amdt. 570 includes provisions for extending work-related Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) and Qualified Individual (QI) programs through December 2010. It also appropriates funds for Medicaid integrity activities and tasks GAO with preparing a report on the effect of recessions on Medicaid. States would need to comply with Medicaid's prompt payment rules to receive recessionary FMAP increases under S.Amdt. 570. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, H.R. 1) aims to stimulate economic activity, create jobs, reduce taxes, invest in technology, and improve infrastructure. It includes provisions for temporary support such as additional unemployment benefits and Medicaid access. Indian protections and nursing home prompt pay requirements would sunset at the end of the recession period in December 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, H.R. 1) includes provisions for unemployment compensation benefits, Medicaid access, and financial assistance for purchasing health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Medicaid provisions in H.R. 1 would increase federal spending by $37 billion in FY2009 and $100.1 billion over the five-year period FY2009-2013. The House-approved version of ARRA includes Medicaid provisions such as temporary optional coverage for the unemployed and a temporary increase in Medicaid federal assistance. Title IV also includes Medicaid provisions related to health information technology. The Senate-approved version of ARRA, introduced in January 2009, included Medicaid provisions related to health technology. The bill was amended and approved by the Committee on Finance before being combined with another bill and approved by the full Senate in February 2009. Medicaid provisions in the Senate-approved ARRA included extensions of Transitional Medical Assistance and the Qualified Individual Program. The Senate-approved version of ARRA included Medicaid provisions such as extensions of Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) and the Qualified Individual (QI) Program, as well as premium and cost-sharing protections under Medicaid. It also addressed eligibility determinations, protection of Indian property from Medicaid estate recovery, rules for managed care entities with Indian enrollees, consultation on health care programs involving Indian health programs, application of prompt pay requirements to nursing facilities, and funding for Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) and Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) allotments. The GAO study and report on state needs during economic downturns estimated that S.Amdt. 570's provisions would increase federal spending by $28.6 billion over 10 years. Medicaid provisions alone would raise spending by $2.6 billion during the same period. Additionally, Title V's State Fiscal Relief provisions were projected to increase federal expenditures by $36 billion in FY2009 and $90 billion over the 10-year period from FY2009-2019. The report outlines Medicaid provisions in the House-passed version of ARRA, with a focus on temporary optional Medicaid coverage for the unemployed. States would have the option to extend Medicaid benefits to three categories of workers who lost their jobs involuntarily. The report will not be updated. The House-passed version of ARRA includes temporary optional Medicaid coverage for the unemployed, allowing states to extend benefits to three categories of workers who lost their jobs involuntarily since September 1, 2008. The HHS Secretary may define additional categories, and states would receive 100% FMAP for eligible individuals until January 1, 2011, along with matching funds for administrative activities related to this provision. The House-approved version of ARRA includes temporary optional Medicaid coverage for the unemployed, with estimated federal spending increases. CBO projected that this provision would lead to a $4.0 billion increase in FY2009 and $10.8 billion from FY2009-FY2014. Additionally, CBO estimated that 1.2 million more individuals would receive Medicaid benefits by the end of FY2009 under this provision. S.Amdt. 570 did not extend this coverage to the unemployed. The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most Medicaid service expenditures, based on a formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes. The FMAP ranges from a minimum of 50% to a maximum of 83% and is calculated annually. Exceptions to the FMAP formula exist for certain states and situations, such as the District of Columbia and territories with set FMAPs. Temporary increases in Medicaid FMAPs were provided under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. During a recession adjustment period from FY2009 to FY2011, the House proposal would increase all states' FMAP by 4.9 percentage points and provide additional increases for high unemployment states. Territories could choose between a 4.9 percentage point FMAP increase with a 10% spending cap increase or their regular FMAP with a 20% spending cap increase. States would be evaluated quarterly for additional unemployment-related FMAP increases. The additional unemployment-related FMAP increase is calculated based on a state's unemployment rate compared to its lowest rate. After the initial 4.9 percentage point increase, further reductions in the state share would result in additional FMAP increases. For example, a state with a regular FMAP of 50% could see a total FMAP increase to 57.90% through these adjustments. The criteria for additional unemployment-related FMAP increase is based on the state's unemployment rate compared to its lowest rate. Reductions in state share are determined by the percentage point increase in unemployment rate, with corresponding reductions in state share percentages. If a state qualifies for the increase and later experiences a decrease in unemployment rate, its reduction in state share cannot decrease until the fourth quarter of FY2010. Conversely, if the unemployment rate increases, the reduction in state share could increase. The temporary FMAP increase for Medicaid would only apply to Medicaid (excluding disproportionate share hospital payments) and a portion would apply to Title IV-E foster care and adoption assistance. States must maintain their Medicaid eligibility standards as of July 1, 2008, and are prohibited from depositing the additional federal funds into reserve funds. States must also ensure that local governments do not pay a larger percentage of nonfederal Medicaid expenditures than required on September 30, 2008. The Senate Finance version of the FMAP provision in the House-approved ARRA would increase federal spending on Medicaid by about $87 billion over five years. It includes a larger across-the-board increase of 7.6 percentage points and a smaller unemployment-related increase, as well as a 15.2% increase in spending caps for territories. The Senate Finance version of the FMAP provision in the House-approved ARRA includes criteria for state share reduction based on unemployment rate increases, with reductions ranging from 2.5% to 6.5%. The reduction could increase over time but not decrease until the last quarter of FY2010. Unlike the House-passed version, the Senate Finance version does not apply the temporary FMAP increase to certain expenditures. The Senate Finance version of the FMAP provision in the House-approved ARRA includes criteria for state share reduction based on unemployment rate increases, with reductions ranging from 2.5% to 6.5%. It would not apply the temporary FMAP increase to expenditures for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid due to an increase in a state's income eligibility standards above what was in effect on July 1, 2008. States not in compliance with prompt payment requirements for health care providers under Medicaid would not receive the temporary increase. CBO estimated that the FMAP provision in the Senate Finance version of ARRA would increase federal spending on Medicaid by $85.5 billion and on Title IV-E by about $1.2 billion over the five-year period from FY2009-FY2013. H.R. 1 . Sec. 5002 imposed moratoriums on certain Medicaid regulations issued during the 110th Congress until April 1, 2009. The regulations covered areas such as Graduate Medical Education, Cost Limit for Public Providers, Rehabilitation Services, and Outpatient Hospital Services. Most states receive Medicaid payments to support training new doctors in teaching programs. The proposed rule would have cut federal reimbursement for graduate medical education. The proposed rule aimed to eliminate federal reimbursement for graduate medical education and change how Medicaid upper payment limits for hospital services were calculated. It also sought to clarify the types of intergovernmental transfers allowable for financing a portion of Medicaid costs. The proposed rule aimed to limit Medicaid reimbursement for government-owned hospitals and institutional providers, clarify allowable intergovernmental transfers for Medicaid financing, and define rehabilitation services covered by Medicaid. The Medicaid case management regulation clarified and narrowed the definition of case management services under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Targeted case management (TCM) is for specific beneficiary groups or individuals in designated areas. Ambiguity about covered services has been addressed, and regulations were issued to guide states' claims for federal reimbursement. (For more details, see CRS Report RL34426, Medicaid Targeted Case Management (TCM)) Medicaid may cover health-related services required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for children with disabilities in public schools. CMS issued a regulation to restrict improper Medicaid payments for school-based administrative activities. Provider Taxes are used by states to finance their share of the Medicaid program. States collect funds from providers through taxes and pay them back as Medicaid payments, claiming federal matching funds. These funds can be used to raise provider payment rates, fund Medicaid program components, or for non-Medicaid purposes. Provider taxes must comply with federal laws and regulations, which can be ambiguous or changing. CMS issued a regulation to address issues related to provider taxes. CMS issued a regulation to address issues related to provider taxes and outpatient hospital services under Medicaid, including the definition and scope of Medicaid-covered outpatient hospital services. States use various reimbursement methods for services provided in outpatient hospital departments and clinics. The provision extends moratoriums on regulations related to Medicaid OPH and clinic services, including Graduate Medical Education, Cost Limit for Public Providers, Rehabilitative Services, Case Management, School-Based Services, and Provider Taxes, until July 1, 2009. It also prohibits the Health and Human Services Secretary from taking any action until after June 30, 2009. The House-approved version of ARRA extends moratoriums on regulations for Medicaid OPH facilities until July 1, 2009. It includes a provision for Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) to continue Medicaid benefits for low-income families facing coverage loss due to income changes. Federal spending would increase by $200 million in FY2009 and over the five-year period from FY2009-2013. The law requires four months of Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) for families losing Medicaid eligibility due to various reasons. Congress expanded work-related TMA to provide up to 12 months of coverage. Funding for these requirements has been extended multiple times, with the latest extension until June 30, 2009. The provision aims to extend work-related TMA through December 31, 2010, allowing states to opt for a 12-month eligibility period. The House-approved version of ARRA includes a provision for extending Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) for up to 12 months, with states having the option to waive certain requirements for eligibility. States would need to report enrollment and participation rates for adults and children under TMA, as well as data on children transitioning to other Medicaid categories or the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The estimated fiscal impact is a $1.3 billion increase over five years. Sec. 3101 of the House-approved version of ARRA includes an extension of Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) for up to 12 months, with a $1.3 billion increase in federal spending over the FY2009-FY2014 five-year period. Sec. 5004 provides protections for Indians under Medicaid and CHIP, ensuring no charges are imposed on Indians receiving Medicaid-coverable services directly from Indian health organizations. The provision in the House-approved version of ARRA extends Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) for up to 12 months with increased federal spending. It includes protections for Indians under Medicaid and CHIP, exempting them from enrollment fees, premiums, cost-sharing charges, and property considerations when receiving services from Indian health organizations. The provision in the House-approved version of ARRA extends Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) for up to 12 months with increased federal spending. It includes protections for Indians under Medicaid and CHIP, exempting them from enrollment fees, premiums, cost-sharing charges, and property considerations when receiving services from Indian health organizations. Additionally, the provision would prohibit consideration of certain classes of property for Medicaid eligibility of Indians and provide exemptions for estate recovery. S.Amdt. 570 and H.R. 1 provisions focus on premiums, cost-sharing protections under Medicaid, eligibility determinations, and consultation on Medicaid and CHIP. S.Amdt. 570 aligns with H.R. 1 but lacks a specified effective date. H.R. 1 emphasizes the establishment of a Tribal Technical Advisory Group (TTAG) within CMS, including representatives from UIOs and IHS. The Mandates Reform Act of 1995 exempts elected tribal officials from the Federal Advisory Committee Act for certain meetings with federal officials. States with Indian Health Providers (IHPs) or Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) must establish a process for obtaining advice on Medicaid law. This includes seeking advice before submitting state Medicaid plan amendments, waiver requests, or proposed demonstrations affecting Indians, IHPs, or UIOs. A medical care advisory panel may be appointed for consultation on Medicaid plans, including input from IHP and UIO designees. These consultation provisions also apply to SCHIP. The Mandates Reform Act of 1995 exempts elected tribal officials from the Federal Advisory Committee Act for certain meetings with federal officials. States with Indian Health Providers (IHPs) or Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) must establish a process for obtaining advice on Medicaid law, including seeking advice before submitting state Medicaid plan amendments, waiver requests, or proposed demonstrations affecting Indians, IHPs, or UIOs. A medical care advisory panel may be appointed for consultation on Medicaid plans, including input from IHP and UIO designees. These consultation provisions also apply to SCHIP. Additionally, the provision in the House-approved version of ARRA would require the Secretary to maintain a Tribal Technical Advisory Group (TTAG) within CMS for consultation on Medicaid, CHIP, and other health care programs funded under the Social Security Act involving Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations. The provision in S.Amdt. 570 requires the Secretary to maintain a Tribal Technical Advisory Group (TTAG) within CMS, including a representative of Urban Indian Health organizations. This representative would be exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act for certain meetings with federal officials. The impact on federal spending has not been estimated by the CBO. The provision in H.R. 1, Sec. 5006, temporarily increases states' FY2009 annual Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) allotments by 2.5% above the FY2009 levels. This adjustment continues into FY2010 and then returns to normal levels under current law. CBO estimated no impact on federal spending for this provision. The House-approved version of ARRA includes a temporary increase in DSH allotments, estimated to cost approximately $200 million in FY2009 and FY2010, and $500 million over FY2009-2013. This provision extends special DSH allotments for low-income states based on different criteria than the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. The provision in the House-approved version of ARRA includes a temporary increase in DSH allotments for low-income states based on different criteria than the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. The revised DSH allotments for FY2009-2013 would be adjusted based on specific percentages and criteria outlined in the provision. The Senate amendment DSH allotment provision would increase federal spending by $400 million over FY2009-2014. It also extends the Qualifying Individual (QI) program through December 2010, with specific funding limits. The QI program would be extended through December 2010 with funding limits of $412.5 million from January 1, 2010, to September 30, 2010, and $150 million from October 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010. The extension would increase federal spending by $550 million over FY2009-FY2014. Additionally, there is a provision regarding Medicaid managed care contracts with Indian health care providers. The provision requires Medicaid managed care entities to ensure sufficient access to services from Indian health care providers, pay them at negotiated rates or a minimum rate, make prompt payments, and adhere to Medicaid rules for all providers. States cannot waive payment consistency requirements. The provision ensures that Indian health care providers, specifically Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), receive fair payment for Medicaid managed care services. States must make up the difference if payments from managed care entities are below the state plan rate. This allows Indian Medicaid managed care entities to operate efficiently and maintain quality care. The provision allows Indian Medicaid managed care entities to restrict enrollment to Indians and specific tribes, similar to IHPs. It applies Medicaid sections to the SCHIP program and does not include managed care provisions in H.R. 1. CBO did not estimate the impact on federal spending. Application of Prompt Pay Requirements to Nursing Facilities under the SSA mandates payment within 30 days of claim receipt. States' Medicaid programs must reimburse 90% of claims within 30 days and process 99% within 90 days. States have extra time for inaccurate claims. No defined penalties for non-compliance. CBO estimates a $760 million increase in federal spending for FY2009. The proposed increase in federal spending under H.R. 1 is $760 million for FY2009 and approximately $290 million from FY2009-FY2014. The bill does not include a prompt pay requirement for nursing facilities. A provision in the bill states that all provisions related to health insurance assistance would sunset at the end of the recession period on December 31, 2010. S.Amdt. 570 applies prompt pay requirements to nursing facilities only during the recession period from April 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010. After January 1, 2011, Medicaid provisions would apply as if the amendment had not been enacted. Additionally, S.Amdt. 570 addresses the payment of Medicare liability to states for the Special Disability Workload Project. The agreement on payment amounts for the Medicare Special Disability Workload (SDW) project includes conditions such as states waiving the right to file civil actions for liability, releasing the federal government from further claims, and being ineligible for payment if involved in civil actions seeking reimbursement. The Secretary and SSA Commissioner would use federal data to determine payment amounts offered to states. The payment methodology for the Medicare Special Disability Workload (SDW) project includes factors like the number of eligible cases, non-federal share of Medicaid expenditures, and other relevant factors. States entering into an agreement with the Secretary would receive payments without the need to submit individual Medicaid claims. $3 billion would be appropriated for FY2009 for payments to states, with a cap of $3 billion. Payments would be provided within four months of ARRA enactment. The Medicare Special Disability Workload (SDW) provision under ARRA would increase federal spending by $3 billion in FY2009. H.R. 1 does not have a comparable provision. Additionally, $31.25 million is allocated to the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General to ensure proper expenditure of federal funds. The Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General receives $31.25 million to oversee federal fund expenditure during the recession period. S.Amdt. 570 includes a provision for a GAO study on state needs during economic downturns. The GAO would develop recommendations to address states' needs during economic recessions, including temporary increases in the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). Recommendations for modifying the national economic downturn assistance formula for Medicaid FMAP adjustments would be submitted to congressional committees by April 1, 2011. The GAO study will recommend adjustments to the FMAP during economic recessions to better reflect actual Medicaid costs incurred by states. Analysis includes the impact of recessions on states, such as declines in private health insurance coverage, state revenues, and growth of caseloads in public health benefit programs. CBO has not estimated the effect on federal spending, and H.R. 1 does not include a similar provision as S.Amdt. 570."
