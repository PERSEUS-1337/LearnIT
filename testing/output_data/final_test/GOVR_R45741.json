    "content": "In the United States, there are numerous memorials to individuals, groups, and events, with decisions on what to memorialize made by various entities including Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments, and private citizens. The Commemorative Works Act requires Congressional authorization for new memorials on federal land in the District of Columbia, while other laws, regulations, and policies govern commemoration decisions in different areas. The choice of a memorial's location is significant, as memorials are most meaningful when located in a place related to the individual, group, or event being commemorated. Examples include the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor and the Oklahoma City National Memorial at the site of the Murrah Building. Memorials at Gettysburg or Antietam National Battlefields also hold emotional significance for visitors. This report examines the federal involvement in memorials located outside of Washington, DC, with a focus on the role of agencies like NPS and GSA in maintaining these memorials. Unlike memorials within the District of Columbia, there is no systematic law governing the establishment of memorials outside the capital. The federal involvement in memorials outside Washington, DC varies in levels classified as \"high,\" \"medium,\" \"low,\" or \"none.\" Memorials with \"high\" federal involvement are typically located on federal land, receive federal funds, and are managed by federal agencies. Memorials with \"medium\" federal involvement may be on federal land without funding or on nonfederal land with federal assistance. Memorials outside Washington, DC have varying levels of federal involvement categorized as \"high,\" \"medium,\" \"low,\" or \"none.\" Memorials with \"low\" federal involvement receive statutory recognition from Congress but are not on federal land or affiliated with a federal agency. Memorials with no federal involvement receive no federal recognition and are built using nonfederal resources on nonfederal land. Some memorials are authorized by Congress to be on federal land and managed by federal agencies, primarily as units of the National Park System. Memorials can be established with federal involvement through congressional legislation or executive-branch designations. Agencies may also authorize plaques, markers, and structures on agency property to honor individuals, groups, or events. U.S. Army regulations allow for memorials to distinguished individuals with outstanding service records. National memorials can be established as units of the National Park System through an act of Congress. To establish a national memorial as a unit of the National Park System, an act of Congress is required. For example, in the 107th Congress, P.L. 107-226 established the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania to honor the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001. Legislation is needed to create a new NPS unit, but agency management policies allow the NPS director to approve commemorative names and placements. Management policies allow the NPS director to approve commemorative names and works within park units if specific criteria are met, including a \"compelling justification\" for the association with the park and a time lapse after the person's death or event's occurrence. Congress and executive-branch officials can also establish memorials on property administered by agencies other than NPS, such as the Department of Defense. These memorials are typically managed by the administering agency as part of its overall site management. For example, in 2015, Congress designated the Medicine Creek Treaty National Memorial, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as part of the Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in Washington state. In 2000, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to designate the Battle of Midway National Memorial in the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, also administered by FWS. Congress has established memorials on federal land financed by nonfederal entities or provided federal assistance to nonfederal entities for memorial management. NPS and other agencies, especially branches of the Department of Defense, support these commemorative works. Some sites designated by Congress, including national memorials, are affiliated areas of the National Park Service, receiving technical and financial assistance from NPS. Ownership and management of national memorials can be transferred to non-federal entities with assistance from the National Park Service (NPS). The NPS can enter into cooperative agreements with these entities for interpretive services. Some national memorials are designated as NPS affiliated areas, receiving technical and financial assistance. Congress may also provide funding or assistance to non-federally administered memorials. Congress may provide funding or assistance to non-federally administered memorials, such as granting money for preservation of specific ships like the USS Alabama and USS Intrepid. They may also authorize the establishment of memorials on federal land without funding, like the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument in Hawaii. The law prohibits the use of federal funds for the design, procurement, installation, or maintenance of certain memorials, such as the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. Nonfederal funds must be used for these purposes, with approval required from the relevant authorities. The National Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD is maintained by the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation without federal funds. Other federal-nonfederal partnerships exist, like the USS Oklahoma Memorial Foundation constructing a memorial on federal land with ongoing administration by the Secretary of the Interior. The Silent Heroes of the Cold War National Memorial in Nevada's Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest was dedicated by the U.S. Forest Service with private funding. Congress has designated nonfederal memorials as \"national memorials\" without federal affiliation. Some national memorials, like the National Distinguished Flying Cross Memorial in Riverside, CA, are designated by legislation as not part of the National Park System and do not receive federal funds. These memorials outside of Washington, DC, are not affiliated with the NPS or other federal agencies. Some national memorials outside of Washington, DC, are not federally funded or managed, and may not receive congressional recognition. These memorials are established and maintained by private entities, and do not receive federal support for maintenance or programming. Congress has established national memorials that are federally funded and managed, including units of the National Park System. There are also nonfederal memorials recognized by Congress without federal involvement. Additionally, various entities have established memorials with no federal connection, some titled as \"national memorials.\" The Commemorative Works Act governs the establishment of memorials on federal lands in the District of Columbia. Congress could establish a statutory definition of a \"national memorial\" to guide decision-making for new proposals outside the District of Columbia. Criteria similar to the Commemorative Works Act could be applied, limiting the number of memorial designations in a given time period. This would be similar to current limits on commemorative coins issued by the U.S. Mint. Creating systematic limitations for national memorials outside of Washington, DC, could potentially increase their value and allow for informed historical judgment. However, this may also limit the number of contemporary national memorial opportunities and reduce Congress's flexibility in decision-making. Alternatively, Congress could establish a program to identify nonfederal memorials deserving of national recognition. Such a program could potentially include provisions similar to those for the U.S. Civil Rights Network established by P.L. 115-104, requiring the Secretary of the Interior to review studies and identify federal and nonfederal sites related to the African American civil rights movement for potential inclusion. Congress could also consider providing grants to nonfederal entities for constructing and maintaining national memorials outside of Washington, DC, promoting public learning and memory. This program may face opposition for potentially diverting federal funds from higher priority uses. Congress may find current practices effective or decide to establish a program to identify nonfederal memorials deserving of national recognition. Congress could evaluate requests for national memorials outside Washington, DC on a case-by-case basis, considering the potential costs and benefits."
