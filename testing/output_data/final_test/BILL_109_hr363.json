    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Children and Teachers Act\" or the \"Keep Our PACT Act\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of children and education, highlighting the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the funding issues it faced. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ensures quality education for children with disabilities. The Congress committed to providing 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for special education students. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 funded the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act at $10.7 billion, only 19 percent of the national average, shortchanging 6.7 million children with disabilities. A promise made must be a promise kept. SEC. 3. FULL FUNDING OF THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT OF 2001. Funding is appropriated for fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008 for programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. For fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011, funding amounts are specified as the difference between the appropriated amounts for programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and specific dollar figures. Funds of $45,537,000,000 are allocated for programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. These funds must be used for the specified programs in the same ratio as other appropriated funds. SEC. 4. MANDATORY FUNDING OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates funding amounts for fiscal years 2006 to 2011, with subsequent years based on a formula. The amendment made by subsection (a) will be effective on October 1, 2005."
