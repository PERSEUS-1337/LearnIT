    "content": "Experimental biofuel pilot program. Experimental biofuel pilot program: Defines experimental biofuel crop as a crop produced for nonpetroleum fuel or lubricant with safeguards against spread as a noxious weed. The Corporation determines experimental biofuel crops as nonpetroleum fuel or lubricant with safeguards against spread as a noxious weed, without existing crop-specific insurance, and with yield data for at least 1 crop year. The term 'producer' refers to an individual involved in producing an experimental biofuel crop, such as camelina, on a farm and filing farming records with the Farm Service Agency. The Corporation, under a pilot program, offers crop insurance to producers of experimental biofuel crops. Expected market prices are determined based on reference crops, and actual production history is considered when determining coverage. Under the pilot program, the Corporation provides crop insurance to producers of experimental biofuel crops. Producers must submit yield information and agree to public disclosure. The program limits enrollment to 250 acres per producer. The Corporation's experimental biofuel pilot program limits enrollment to 250 acres per producer, 100,000 acres per State, and 500,000 total acres. The program's costs should not exceed $15,000,000 for fiscal years 2008 through 2012, with administrative costs capped at 10% of the budget. The experimental biofuel pilot program allows crop insurance coverage for biofuel crops. Funding for the program is limited to $15,000,000 for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act is amended to include an Experimental Biofuel Programs section, with funding limited to $15,000,000 for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act is amended to include an Experimental Biofuel Programs section, with funding limited to $15,000,000 for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. Definitions for 'experimental biofuel crop' and 'producer' are provided. A Loan and Loan Guarantee Program is established to provide loans and guarantees to producers of experimental biofuel crops for improving farm income and promoting a better balance between supply and demand. The Secretary may make grants to research facilities and institutions of higher education to study experimental biofuel crops for animal feed and research planting techniques. Funding transfers from the Treasury to the Secretary annually from 2007 to 2011. The Secretary is authorized to receive and use $10,000,000 annually for subsections (b) and (c) without further appropriation. The funds transferred shall remain available until expended."
