The proposed convolutional architecture, named \"nonlinear channels aggregation networks (NCAN)\", includes a new layer called \"nonlinear channels aggregation layer (NCAL)\". The functions of channels aggregation are theoretically motivated and empirically studied for their impact on convergence speed and classification accuracy. An efficient implementation of NCAL is developed, significantly improving its speed. Experimental results on UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmarks show the effectiveness of this approach.

Previous works include convolutional networks and linear channels aggregation methods. The text discusses the use of ConvNets for video classification, focusing on motion characteristics and linear channels aggregation. Various variants like temporal segment networks (TSN) are built on this concept, extending 2-D convolution to capture motions with an extra temporal dimension. The 3D operators conduct local linear aggregation on the space and channels level, capturing implicit relationships across channels. Most effective methods are built on these fundamental architectures for video classification algorithms.

The proposed nonlinear channels aggregation network introduces the nonlinear channels aggregation layer (NCAL) to simulate complex channel-level encodings. It leverages current units in standard CNNs to comply with channel relationships, utilizing 3D pooling and 3D convolution to achieve the goal of capturing global channels dependency. The response of CNN layers is represented by multiple features denoted as V = {V1, V2, ..., VK} and S = {S1, S2, ..., SK}. The spatial position response in feature maps is defined by vij(x, y, z) with height, width, and channels represented by h, w, and c. 3D operators like max pooling and convolution can learn partial correspondence between channels, reducing resolution. Pooling operators filter significant features in a space-channels cube without defining local correspondence between channels. The 3D convolution is a better encoding method compared to other local operators, as it preserves spatial and channel relationships simultaneously. Nonlinear channels aggregation networks are used for global channels aggregation representations in video sequences, enhancing convolutional features. Pooling is essential for computational feasibility during network training. To address limitations in linear and local channel representations, a nonlinear channels aggregation layer (NCAL) is proposed to capture complex relationships across multiple channels in CNN architecture without compromising the rest of the network. This approach aims to explicitly model nonlinear relationships for improved global channel-level representations. The nonlinear channels aggregation layer (NCAL) is designed to capture complex relationships across multiple channels in CNN architecture without affecting the rest of the network. It utilizes a unique yet global channel-level encoding for final classification, producing a compact feature maps group through channels aggregation equation. The NCAL implements a many-to-many mapping, aggregating each response by all features at the same spatial location to create a global yet compact representation without additional parameters. The dimensions of input and output remain constant. The NCAL layer maintains constant dimensions in input and output, allowing it to be easily integrated into ConvNet architectures. By multiplying representations with convolutional features, it avoids the vanishing gradient problem and enhances gradient flow in the network. This implementation enables transfer learning benefits for other tasks. The NCAL layer addresses the vanishing gradient problem by maintaining constant dimensions in input and output.

The NCAL method involves a qualitative analysis in forward and backward propagations, using a kernel function to rescale \u03b8 to a single-valued interval, preventing mapping mistakes that can confuse CNN and reduce recognition accuracy. The proposed kernel function of NCAL G rescales \u03b8 to a single-valued interval \u03b8 \u2208 ( 0, \u03c0 2 ) to enhance and aggregate features in the convolutional layer. The nonlinear channels aggregation layer captures global channels relationships, enlarges gradients in back-propagation, and prevents vanishing gradients. The analysis shows that later convolutional layers tend to have somewhat local representations, with channels corresponding to specific parts, leading to a different decomposition of discriminative features.
