    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that diabetes rates have significantly increased in the United States over the past 30 years, with one in nine adults affected. In California, an estimated 14 percent of adults have diabetes. Complications of diabetes include various health issues such as heart disease, nerve damage, and blindness. Diabetes costs California $24.5 billion annually in healthcare expenses and lost productivity. Hospital stays for diabetes patients cost $2,200 more than others, adding $1.6 billion to hospitalization costs each year. The prevalence of obesity in California has significantly increased over the past 30 years, with 60% of adults being overweight or obese. Obesity rates have nearly tripled since 1984, and if current trends continue, it is expected to reach 46.6% by 2030. Nearly 40% of children in California are overweight or obese, with rates tripling for adolescents and quadrupling for 6 to 11 year olds. Low-income and communities of color are disproportionately affected by this epidemic. Obesity increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, asthma, and certain types of cancer, with a high percentage of obese adults suffering from related conditions. The high medical costs of obesity amount to $147 billion nationally, with half covered by Medicare and Medicaid. There is a strong connection between obesity and the consumption of sugary beverages, leading to a 27% higher likelihood of being overweight or obese for California adults who drink one soda or more daily. According to nutrition experts, sweetened beverages like soft drinks, energy drinks, sweet teas, and sports drinks offer little nutritional value but contain high amounts of added sugars. A 20-ounce soda has about 17 teaspoons of sugar, exceeding the recommended daily intake of 5 to 9 teaspoons by the American Heart Association. Sugar-sweetened beverages are the main source of added sugars in the American diet, with the average person consuming 42 gallons per year, equivalent to 39 pounds of extra sugar annually. Over 50% of Americans drink one or more sugar-sweetened beverages daily. In California, 19% of 2-5 year olds, 32% of 6-11 year olds, and 65% of 12-17 year olds drink sugar-sweetened beverages daily. Disparities exist among races, with 74% of African American adolescents, 73% of Latinos, 63% of Asians, and 56% of whites consuming these beverages. Sugar-sweetened beverages contribute to excess caloric consumption as they do not satisfy hunger like solid food or protein-containing beverages. Drinking one or two sodas a day increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 26% and the likelihood of being overweight by 27% for adults and 55% for children. The curr_chunk discusses the positive relationship between sugar intake and dental caries, the risks associated with untreated dental caries, and the effectiveness of health warnings in reducing consumption of harmful products. It introduces the Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Safety Warning Act. The Legislature aims to protect consumers and promote informed purchasing decisions by requiring warnings about the harmful health effects of drinks with added sugars. Definitions for \"animal milk\" and \"beverage container\" are provided in this article. The curr_chunk defines terms related to sugar-sweetened beverages, including \"beverage dispensing machine,\" \"caloric sweetener,\" \"concentrate,\" and \"consumer.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to milk substitutes, natural fruit juice, and the Department of Public Health. The curr_chunk defines terms related to natural vegetable juice and the definition of a \"person\" in legal terms. The curr_chunk defines terms related to sugar-sweetened beverages, including the definitions of \"powder,\" \"sale,\" \"sealed beverage container,\" and \"sugar-sweetened beverage.\" It specifies that a sugar-sweetened beverage is a sweetened nonalcoholic beverage with added caloric sweeteners and containing 75 calories or more per 12 fluid ounces. The curr_chunk clarifies that \"sugar-sweetened beverage\" excludes certain beverages like 100% natural fruit or vegetable juice, dietary aids, infant formula, and beverages primarily made of animal milk or milk substitutes. (D) Any beverage whose main ingredient is animal milk or a milk substitute is excluded from the definition of a sugar-sweetened beverage. \"Syrup\" is defined as a sweetened liquid mixture used in making sugar-sweetened beverages. A warning label is required on sealed beverage containers for sugar-sweetened beverages sold in California. The State of California requires a safety warning on beverage containers with added sugars to warn against obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. The warning must be prominently displayed on the front of the container in bold type and capital letters, with specific font and size requirements based on the container size. The safety warning on beverage containers must meet specific font and size requirements based on the container size. For containers over 8 fluid ounces but less than 1 liter, the warning must be at least 2 millimeters in size with no more than 25 characters per inch. For containers of 1 liter or more, the warning must be at least 3 millimeters in size with no more than 12 characters per inch. If the warning is not directly printed on the container, it must be securely affixed. In California, a multipack of sugar-sweetened beverages must display a safety warning on at least two sides, as well as on each individual sealed container. Concentrates intended for retail sale in the state must also bear a safety warning on the front of the packaging. In California, a safety warning must be displayed on vending machines and beverage dispensing machines selling sugar-sweetened beverages. The warning should also be placed at the point-of-purchase for beverages filled by employees. The safety warning required in California for vending machines and beverage dispensing machines selling sugar-sweetened beverages must prominently display: \"STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAFETY WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay.\" The warning should be in bold type and on a contrasting background. Starting July 1, 2016, any violation of the vending machine safety warning law in California will result in a civil penalty ranging from $50 to $500. The penalty will be assessed according to specified procedures, and a person cannot be found in violation more than once during a single inspection visit. The Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Safety Warning Fund is created in the State Treasury with collected penalties allocated to the department for enforcement purposes. The department may develop new safety warning language for sugar-sweetened beverages if scientific information justifies it, and local ordinances can be implemented as long as they provide greater protection than state requirements. The provisions of this act are severable, meaning that if any part of the act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the other valid provisions."
