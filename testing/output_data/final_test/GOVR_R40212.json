    "content": "Federal investments in early childhood care and education come in various forms, spanning multiple federal agencies and congressional committee jurisdictions. These investments range from targeted to flexible funding streams, including grant programs and tax provisions. Programs like Head Start offer early childhood services exclusively, while others like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families provide broad-based funding for various uses. Each program has different policy goals, target populations, services, and rules, with some focusing on specific services or populations. While many programs target low-income families, some benefit middle- and upper-income families as well. In recent years, Congress and the Obama Administration have shown interest in early childhood issues, proposing new programs like Preschool for All. The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 authorized a new Preschool Development Grants program administered by HHS and ED. Several early childhood care and education programs are due for possible changes. Several early childhood care and education programs, including Head Start, mandatory child care funding, and the IDEA Part C early intervention program, are up for possible reauthorization in the 114th Congress. Congress may also be interested in recent reauthorizations such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Child Care and Development Block Grant. These laws represent the first comprehensive reauthorizations since 2002 and 1996, respectively. The report provides information on current and historical funding levels for these programs and tax provisions. The FY2017 Obama Administration's budget request for early childhood care and education programs and tax provisions is detailed in Table 1, with a seven-year funding history provided in Table 2. Program summaries are categorized into targeted programs, tax provisions for working families, and broad-based programs supporting early childhood care and education. Appendices provide additional information on unfunded programs and a list of abbreviations. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for early childhood care and education programs included significant increases in funding for Head Start, CCDBG, and the Preschool Development Grants program at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Other CRS reports are referenced for more detailed information on individual programs. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request included a new federal-state partnership program called \"Preschool for All\" to provide high-quality preschool for low- and moderate-income families. This program would incentivize state expansion of preschool for four-year-olds and other early childhood programs. Table 2 shows funding levels for early childhood care and education programs from FY2010 to FY2016. Some programs received funding for the first time, while others had their funding terminated. This section provides brief descriptions of current federally funded early childhood programs and tax provisions, divided into \"Targeted Programs\" and \"Tax Provisions\" sections. (Appendix A contains summaries of previously funded programs no longer receiving federal funding.) The \"Tax Provisions\" and \"Related Programs\" sections discuss support for child care expenses and early childhood education. Table 3 compares funding and eligibility rules for different programs. Head Start offers comprehensive services for low-income children to promote school readiness through various developmental services. Head Start provides educational, health, nutritional, and social services to low-income children. Eligibility is based on family income or receiving public assistance. The program serves children from birth to four years old, with Early Head Start for younger children. Funds are also reserved for Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships to meet program standards. Head Start is administered by HHS at the federal level, with funds awarded directly to local grantees for locally designed programs. Head Start is a program providing services to low-income children, funded by HHS and administered by local agencies. It was last reauthorized in 2007 and is due for possible reauthorization. The CCDBG Act of 1990 provides federal grant funding for child care subsidies, reauthorized through 2020. No state maintenance-of-effort requirements exist. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provides discretionary funds to states for child care expenses of low-income working families. Mandatory funding is authorized by the Social Security Act, subject to reauthorization. States must meet maintenance-of-effort and matching requirements to receive full allotments. CCDF funds are jointly administered by HHS and are used to subsidize child care for children under 13 in eligible families. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provides funds to states for child care expenses of low-income working families. Eligible families have a family income below 85% of the state median income. Child care services are provided on a sliding fee scale basis, with assistance through vouchers or certificates. States must use a portion of their funds to improve the quality and availability of child care. The MIECHV program supports home visiting services for families with young children in communities. The MIECHV program provides home visiting services for families with young children in communities with poor child health and other risk indicators. Home visits are conducted by trained professionals on a regular basis to offer support and guidance to caregivers and children. Funding for the program is administered jointly by HRSA and ACF at the federal level, primarily awarded to states and territories on a formula and competitive basis. The MIECHV program, established under the ACA, receives mandatory appropriations and funding was extended through FY2017. A PDG program, funded annually since FY2014, aims to expand access to high-quality preschool for low-income four-year-olds. The Preschool Development Grants program, initially funded from FY2014 to FY2016, did not have a standalone authorization but aimed to enhance preschool programs for low-income four-year-olds. The new PDG program, authorized under the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015, will be based at HHS and administered jointly with ED starting in FY2017. The new Preschool Development Grants (PDG) program aims to enhance high-quality preschool programs for low-income families. It focuses on improving coordination of early childhood programs and maximizing parental choice. The program includes Development Grants for states without state-funded preschool and Expansion Grants for states with existing capacity. Planning Grants will support statewide needs assessments and strategic plans. The Preschool Development Grants program includes Planning Grants for statewide needs assessments, strategic plans, family involvement, and quality improvement. Renewal Grants aim to improve program quality and expand access for eligible children. The term \"high-quality preschool program\" is defined in the Federal Register. The Every Student Succeeds Act prohibits HHS and ED from defining \"high-quality\" in the context of the PDG program. IDEA governs special education for children from birth through age 21, with funding going to school-age children and two state grant programs for young children: IDEA Part C for infants and toddlers with disabilities, and IDEA Part B Section 619 for preschool-aged children with disabilities. The Part C Infants and Families Program serves disabled children from birth through two years of age by providing early intervention services in natural environments tailored to the unique needs of the child and their family. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities in natural environments, including their homes. IDEA Part B offers services to school-aged children with disabilities starting at age three, with additional funding available through Section 619 Preschool Grants. All states have qualified for and received preschool grants under this program. The Part B state grants program for school-age children also applies to Section 619 preschool-aged children. CCAMPIS supports low-income parents in postsecondary education through campus-based child care services. The Bureau of Indian Education administers the FACE program for early childhood development services to Indian children under six. The FACE program provides services to Indian children under six and their parents, including parenting skills-building and preschool services. CACFP offers federal funds for meals in child care centers, afterschool programs, and Head Start centers, with subsidies based on family income. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides subsidies based on family income for child care centers, afterschool programs, and Head Start centers. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) is a non-refundable tax credit for employment-related expenses incurred for the care of a dependent child under age 13 or a disabled dependent or spouse. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) provides non-refundable tax credits based on expenses for child care, with a maximum credit rate of 35% for expenses up to $3,000 for one child and up to $6,000 for two or more children. The credit rate decreases as income increases, with a floor of 20% for taxpayers with incomes over $43,000. Taxpayers can exclude up to $5,000 of dependent care expenses under Section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code. Taxpayers can exclude up to $5,000 of dependent care expenses through an employer-provided dependent care assistance program (DCAP). This exclusion reduces taxable income, leading to a reduction in both income taxes and payroll taxes based on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, created in 1996, is a block grant administered by HHS to help states address childhood economic disadvantage. States use TANF funds for various benefits and services, including cash assistance, child care, and preschool programs. Since its inception, TANF has provided $16.5 billion annually in mandatory federal funding for various activities, including child care, preschool, and child welfare services. In FY2014, states spent $1.2 billion in federal funds and $2.5 billion in state funds on child care within TANF programs. States can transfer up to 30% of their TANF allotments to the CCDBG, with nearly $1.4 billion transferred in FY2014. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) is an annually appropriated entitlement to states, administered by HHS and authorized by Title XX, Subtitle A, of the Social Security Act. States have broad discretion over the use of SSBG funds for various social services activities. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) provides states with flexibility in using funds for social services activities, with no federal income eligibility requirements or service mandates. Annual appropriations have been at $1.7 billion since FY2002, with reductions due to sequestration. In FY2014, child welfare-related services, child care services, prevention and intervention services, and services for the disabled were the largest expenditures under SSBG. Approximately 11% of total expenditures went towards child care services. Title I, Part A of the ESEA is a federal education program that serves disadvantaged children through grants to local educational agencies. These grants can be used for supplementary educational services for low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. While most funds are used for school-age children, some can be allocated for preschool services, although data on preschool expenditures are not separately tracked. Previous estimates suggest that roughly 2% of Title I-A funds are used for preschool instruction, which would amount to around $298 million based on the FY2016 appropriation of $14.9 billion. The FY2016 Title I-A appropriation is $14.9 billion, with 2% amounting to $298 million. Preschoolers make up less than 3% of Title I-A beneficiaries annually. Title I-A was reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015. The Striving Readers program historically provided grants for literacy instruction in high-need schools under Title I-E of the ESEA. The Striving Readers program, funded under Title I-E of the ESEA, received $190 million in FY2016. It supports comprehensive literacy development from birth through grade 12, with 15% of funds reserved for children aged birth to five. The program is expected to be replaced by the new Comprehensive Literacy Development Grant program authorized by ESSA. The ESEA Title II-B program, authorized by ESSA, will provide competitive grants to state educational agencies. Funds must be allocated towards early literacy services for children from birth to age five, with the remaining divided between programs for grades K-5 and grades 6-12. States can reserve up to 5% for additional activities. The Promise Neighborhoods program offers grants to support communities in combating poverty and improving educational outcomes for children. The Promise Neighborhoods program, funded since FY2010, aims to support communities in improving educational outcomes by providing a continuum of services from early learning to college and career. The program covers various issues such as neighborhood health, safety, and access to technology. In FY2016, Promise Neighborhoods received $73 million in funding. The Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC) program received $73 million in funding in FY2016. Initially authorized under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the program was later amended to reserve a portion of funds for early childhood care and education. The Department of Education (ED) jointly administers this program with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC) grant program supported states in establishing statewide data systems, aligning high-quality standards, implementing early learning standards, improving the early childhood workforce, and measuring children's outcomes. ED reserved funds for RTT-ELC grants in FY2011-FY2013, with 20 states receiving grants. No new funding has been provided since FY2013. For more information, refer to CRS Report R44008. The 2015 ESEA reauthorization law eliminated the authorization for Even Start Family Literacy Programs, which integrated early childhood education, adult basic education, and parenting skills education. Even Start provided grants to states for local education agencies to serve children ages 0-7 and their parents with adult literacy instruction, early childhood education, and parent support. Even Start Family Literacy Programs, authorized in 1989, saw a decline in funding from $250 million in FY2002 to $66 million in FY2010. Evaluations showed limited effectiveness in improving learning outcomes. The 2015 ESEA reauthorization law also eliminated the Early Reading First program, which aimed to enhance school readiness for young children from low-income families through research-based strategies and professional development. The Early Reading First program aimed to enhance preschool children's verbal skills, phonological awareness, and pre-reading skills through research-based strategies and professional development. It received $113 million in funding from the FY2009 Omnibus bill but was not funded in FY2010. Instead, the Striving Readers program was expanded to focus on improving literacy skills from preschool through high school. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriation increased funding for Striving Readers to $250 million, with $37.5 million reserved for children ages 0-5. No funding has been requested for Early Reading First since FY2010, and no funds have been appropriated for this program since FY2009. The Department of Education provided competitive grants for early childhood educator professional development, with stable funding in FY2006 and FY2007. The Act Program, authorized by the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act, provided grants to enhance school readiness for children under five. Despite being authorized at $600 million, funding for the program was last received in FY2005 at $36 million."
