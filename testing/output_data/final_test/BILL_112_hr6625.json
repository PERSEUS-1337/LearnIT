The Act grants tribal jurisdiction over dating violence and domestic violence, defining dating violence as violence in a romantic or intimate relationship and domestic violence as violence by a spouse, intimate partner, or cohabitant. The Act grants tribal jurisdiction over dating violence and domestic violence, with definitions for dating violence and domestic violence provided. Additionally, the terms 'Indian country', 'participating tribe', and 'protection order' are defined within the Act. The Act defines terms such as 'special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction', 'spouse or intimate partner', and outlines the scope of protection orders issued by civil or criminal courts in response to complaints. The Act recognizes the power of participating tribes to exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over all persons, concurrent with federal and state jurisdiction. The Act allows participating tribes to exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over individuals in Indian country, except when both the victim and defendant are non-Indians. The Act allows participating tribes to exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over a defendant only if the defendant resides in or is employed in the Indian country of the participating tribe. A participating tribe can exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over a defendant who is a member of the tribe, a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner of a tribe member, or an Indian residing in the tribe's Indian country. This jurisdiction covers acts of domestic violence, dating violence, and violations of protection orders occurring within the tribe's Indian country. In a criminal proceeding, a participating tribe can exercise special domestic violence jurisdiction over a defendant who violates a protection order within the tribe's Indian country. The protection order must prohibit violent or threatening acts, harassment, sexual violence, contact, or communication with another person, be issued against the defendant, enforceable by the tribe, and consistent with federal law. The participating tribe must provide the defendant with all applicable rights under the Act, including the right to a trial by an impartial jury that reflects a fair cross-section of the community and does not exclude any distinctive group, as well as other rights necessary for the tribe to exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over the defendant. A person filing a habeas corpus petition in a US court under section 203 may request a stay of further detention by the participating tribe. The court can grant the stay if it believes the petition is likely to succeed and the petitioner is not a flight risk or a danger to others. An Indian tribe detaining a person must notify them of their rights. Defendants can petition for removal to a Federal district court. The Attorney General can provide grants to tribal governments to strengthen their criminal justice systems for domestic violence cases. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of providing various services and assistance in the criminal justice system, including information databases, prosecution, courts, probation, rehabilitation centers, victim services, and legal procedures. It also emphasizes the need for indigent criminal defendants to have access to licensed defense counsel in cases of domestic violence or dating crimes. The curr_chunk focuses on tribal jurisdiction over domestic violence and protection orders, ensuring proper procedures for criminal proceedings and rights for victims. Amounts allocated under this section are meant to supplement, not replace, other government funding for related activities. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 authorized for fiscal years 2013-2017 to support tribal criminal justice systems. A clerical amendment is made to the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968. Sec. 204 grants tribal jurisdiction over crimes of domestic violence. Sec. 3245 of title 18, United States Code, allows for the removal of criminal prosecutions brought under section 204 of the Indian Civil Rights Act. Defendants must file a notice of removal in the district court with a statement of grounds for removal. The defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence for the case to be removed. Defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a right guaranteed under the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 has been violated, tribal court failed to remedy it adequately, and the violation is prejudicial. Notice of removal for domestic violence prosecution must be filed within 30 days of arraignment or before trial, stating all grounds for removal. Failure to do so may result in dismissal. Failure to state grounds at the time of filing a notice of removal constitutes a waiver of those grounds. A second notice can only be filed for new grounds. The district court may grant relief for good cause. The filing of a notice of removal for domestic violence in a tribal court does not prevent further proceedings, but a conviction cannot be entered without remand. The district court must promptly examine the notice and may dismiss it if removal is not warranted. The court may order summary remand if removal is not permitted, otherwise an evidentiary hearing will be held promptly. If removal is allowed, the district court notifies the Tribal court to stop prosecution. If defendants are in custody, the district court issues a writ of habeas corpus for their transfer. The term 'domestic violence' is defined in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the United States Code.
