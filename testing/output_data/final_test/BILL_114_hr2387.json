Section 18(a) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is amended to address revocation, repeal, and applications for allotment. Any allotment application pending before the Department of the Interior is also addressed. Any allotment application pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, closed by the Department in the civil action `Shields v. United States' (698 F.2d 987 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied (104 S. Ct. 73 (1983)), shall be reopened and considered approved. SEC. 3. OPEN SEASON FOR CERTAIN ALASKA NATIVE VETERANS FOR ALLOTMENTS. Section 41 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is amended to allow eligible recipients to receive allotments of Federal land, not exceeding 160 acres, under certain conditions. Eligible recipients under subsection (b) may receive a Federal land allotment of up to 160 acres if they previously received an allotment of less than 160 acres before the promulgation of regulations. The filing deadline for an allotment is within 3 years for eligible recipients. Eligible recipients can receive a Federal land allotment of up to 160 acres within 3 years after the Secretary promulgates regulations. The land for allotments must be vacant, owned by the United States, or conveyed by the State of Alaska or a Native Corporation. Native Corporation can voluntarily relinquish land for allotment to the United States. If they do so, they can select equivalent Federal land to replace the relinquished land. Allotments cannot be selected from land within certain exclusions, such as the right-of-way of the TransAlaska Pipeline. A person eligible for an allotment can choose an alternative allotment from land within specified boundaries or contiguous to withdrawn land. In subsection (b), eligibility for an allotment is extended to veterans who served between August 5, 1964, and May 7, 1975, and heirs of deceased individuals eligible for an allotment under this section. In subsection (b), eligibility for an allotment is extended to veterans who served between August 5, 1964, and May 7, 1975, and heirs of deceased individuals eligible for an allotment under this section. An heir may apply for and receive an allotment on behalf of the estate of a deceased person. No person who received an allotment under a previous act may receive an allotment under this section, except for heirs applying on behalf of the estate or those who received an allotment before specific regulations were promulgated. The Alaska Native Veterans Land Allotment Equity Act extends eligibility for allotments to veterans who served between August 5, 1964, and May 7, 1975, and heirs of deceased individuals eligible for an allotment. The Act also specifies the approval process for allotment applications, with a deadline of December 31, 2020, for the Secretary to approve applications and issue certificates of allotment. The Secretary must notify interested parties of the right to contest or protest allotment applications within 90 days of receiving the application. If a contest or protest is initiated, the Secretary cannot issue the allotment. The Secretary cannot issue a certificate for an allotment until a final determination is made regarding any contest or protest. A person can reselect land if the originally selected land was chosen before the enactment of the Alaska Native Veterans Land Allotment Equity Act and was not conveyed to the person. Definitions for the term 'veteran' are provided for the purposes of this section. The term 'veteran' is defined as a person who served in the military and was discharged. The term 'Vietnam era' is defined as specified in title 38. The Secretary of the Interior must create final regulations within a year of this Act's enactment, in consultation with Alaska Native organizations, to implement the Act's amendments. The Secretary will work with these organizations to identify eligible individuals for allotments and will directly contact them to explain the application process."
