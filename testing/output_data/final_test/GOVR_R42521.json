    "content": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established in 1974 by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to protect the pension benefits of participants in private-sector defined benefit pension plans. PBGC does not insure plans of churches, governments, or defined contribution plans like \u00a7401(k)s. It is overseen by a director appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with the Secretary of Labor chairing its Board of Directors. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) runs two insurance programs for pension plans: single-employer and multiemployer. The single-employer program is larger, insuring 31.9 million participants in 23,400 plans in FY2013. PBGC maintains separate reserve funds for each program. There are no current proposals to change the premiums of the multiemployer program. Federal law states that the U.S. government is not liable for PBGC's debts. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is not liable for its debts. Congress is interested in PBGC's financial condition due to its role in retirement income security. PBGC may terminate pension plans voluntarily, in distress, or involuntarily. A standard termination of a pension plan occurs when there are enough assets to pay benefits, with the plan sponsor purchasing insurance annuities. PBGC's involvement is minimal, confirming requirements are met. A distress termination happens when there are insufficient assets to cover benefits, requiring proof of financial inability to support the plan. PBGC may also initiate a termination if minimum funding requirements are not met. In distress and involuntary terminations, PBGC becomes the trustee of the terminated plan and pays participants' benefits up to a statutory maximum amount. PBGC guarantees basic pension benefits but cannot pay annual benefits above a certain dollar amount, depending on various factors. The PBGC pays participants' benefits up to a maximum amount based on factors like age and form of payment. In 2006, 84% of participants received 100% of their benefits. The report also discusses PBGC's financial position, revenue sources, premiums for single-employer pension plans, and proposed changes to premium structures. The PBGC's single-employer program reported total assets of $83.2 billion at the end of FY2013, with $77.9 billion in investments. Total liabilities were $110.6 billion, resulting in a deficit of $27.4 billion. The program had deficits from FY1980 to FY1994, surpluses from FY1995 to FY2001, and deficits since FY2002. The funding ratio is a measure of a pension plan's financial health. The funding ratio of PBGC's single-employer program was 75.2% at the end of FY2013, indicating insufficient assets to cover all future benefit obligations. Despite having $83.2 billion in assets and paying $5.4 billion in benefits during FY2013, the deficit cannot continue without increased revenues or decreased benefit outlays. Private-sector DB pension plans have also had funding ratios below 100%, with economic weakness potentially leading to more plan terminations. The funding ratios of the 100 largest corporate DB plans dropped from 105.4% in 2007 to 75.5% in February 2012 due to new pension plan funding requirements, stock market decreases, and lower interest rates. Economic weakness could lead to more pension plan terminations, increasing the financial burden on PBGC. Since its creation in 1974, PBGC has become the trustee of 4,557 single-employer pension plans and paid $5.4 billion in benefits to 799,210 participants in FY2013. The deficit of PBGC increases with each pension plan it takes over, while the base for collecting premiums decreases due to terminations. The PBGC's deficit is growing due to the increasing number of terminated pension plans, leading to a decrease in premium collection. Some analysts believe that PBGC's accounting policies may overstate its deficit, particularly in how it discounts future benefit obligations. Suggestions have been made to use higher discount rates similar to those used by private-sector pension plans, but PBGC's director maintains that current accounting practices should be upheld. The PBGC's deficit could have been lowered to $20 billion in 2012 by discounting future benefit obligations using corporate bond rates. Policy analysts disagree on the appropriate rate for discounting pension plan liabilities. PBGC is self-financing and funded by premiums, pension plan assets, and investments. PBGC maintains three funds for the single-employer program, including on-budget revolving funds and a nonbudgetary trust fund. Changes to the revolving funds affect the federal budget deficit, while changes to the trust fund do not. The PBGC's revolving funds, funded by premiums and investments, do not impact the federal budget deficit. Benefit payments are made from these funds, which must be invested in U.S. government securities. The nonbudgetary trust fund, invested in equities and fixed-income securities, receives assets from pension plans trusteed by PBGC. Investment income from the trust fund is not part of the federal budget and is used to reimburse participant benefits. PBGC's premium income, totaling $2.9 billion in FY2013, accounts for 53.6% of benefits paid. Premiums are collected from pension plan sponsors and consist of flat-rate, variable-rate, and per-participant premiums. Changes to premium structure and amounts are authorized by Congress. In FY2013, PBGC collected $1.4 billion in flat-rate premiums and $1.6 billion in variable rate premiums from pension plan sponsors. Flat-rate premiums are $49 per participant, while variable-rate premiums are $14 per $1,000 of underfunding. Premium amounts are authorized by Congress and are indexed to increases in the national average wage index. In FY2013, PBGC collected $1.6 billion in variable rate premiums, with 41.7% of insured pension plans and 48.9% of participants paying this premium. Plans terminating under distress or PBGC-initiated terminations are liable for a $1,250 per participant per year termination premium for three years, totaling $137 million in FY2013. The termination premium, authorized in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, was made permanent by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. PBGC collected termination premiums in FY2013, with the termination premium reserved at 100% due to low collections. The flat-rate premium was established at $1.00 per participant initially and increased to $2.60 in 1978. Variable rate and termination premiums were introduced in 1988 and 2006 respectively. Premium adjustments have been made annually since 2007 based on the national average wage index. MAP-21 and P.L. 113-67 set premium rates for 2013 and 2014. Some policymakers suggest increasing PBGC premiums to match private market rates. Historical data shows deficits since 2002. Changes may be needed to prevent resource exhaustion and benefit cuts. In the 112th and 113th Congress, legislation increased PBGC premiums for DB plan sponsors without altering the structure of premiums. Recent policy proposals include giving PBGC authority to adjust premiums based on sponsor risks. The FY2013 Budget proposed giving PBGC Board the authority to set premiums starting in 2014, with a one-year study and public comment period. Premium increases would be gradually phased in, estimated to save $16 billion over 10 years. PBGC's director mentioned that current premiums are around 3.5 cents per hour for industrial workers, with increases being a small percentage of hourly wages. House FY2012 and FY2013 Budget Proposals did not assume the President's proposal but acknowledged the need for reform. The House FY2012 and FY2013 Budget Proposals did not assume the President's proposal but recognized the need for PBGC reform to prevent future taxpayer-funded bailouts. The President's plan included increasing flat-rate premiums gradually from $35 to $66 per participant per year by 2020, replacing the variable-rate premium with a risk-based premium. The proposal aimed to save $2.7 billion in the FY2012 budget resolution and $8.34 billion in the FY2013 budget resolution over 10 years. The proposal recommended a risk-based premium determined by factors such as plan assets, liabilities, and sponsor's financial condition. Premium increases would be minimized during weak economic conditions and reliance on credit agency ratings would be prohibited. Premium increases exceeding four times the 2010 premium would also be prohibited. The Debt Reduction Task Force, co-chaired by former Senator Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin, recommended increasing the flat-rate premium by 15% and the variable-rate premium based on the riskiness of pension plans' investment allocation. This proposal aims to address the yearly deficits in PBGC's single-employer program and renew focus on PBGC's financing and authorized premiums. Changes to PBGC's premium structure were discussed as part of pension plan funding reforms prompted by the termination of several large pension plans in the early 2000s. The top 10 largest companies with claims to PBGC had nine pension plan terminations from 2001 to 2005. Premium changes have advantages and disadvantages, but could pose challenges. Issues include the counter-cyclical nature of pension plan insurance, challenges for PBGC in assessing companies' financial health, and comparisons with other government insurance programs. Higher pension insurance premiums may lead some sponsors to freeze or terminate their DB pension plans. In response to pension plan terminations, changes to PBGC's premium structure were discussed. Companies may freeze or terminate their DB pension plans. A terminated plan requires the purchase of insurance annuities for participants. The flat-rate premium is favored for its simplicity in calculation and administration. This approach ensures prompt collection and accurate estimation of funds raised for the insurance program. The head tax for the insurance program is nominal and will only be in effect for a few years. Inequities in the early years will be smoothed out over time with a more risk-based premium structure. The flat-rate premium disadvantages plans with smaller per-participant benefits, favoring those with greater benefits. Pension plans with longer job tenure have larger benefit obligations. Pension plans with longer job tenure tend to have larger benefit obligations. The variable rate premium considers the amount of underfunding, with plans terminated with more underfunding increasing PBGC's deficit. Plans with equal underfunding can pose different risks based on the financial health of the plan sponsor. Weak sponsors are more likely to be terminated by PBGC compared to sponsors in good financial condition. PBGC determines financial health of plan sponsors for risk-based premium structure. Difficulty in assessing smaller firms' financial health due to lack of public information. Variable-rate and risk-based premiums increase during economic downturns. During economic downturns, variable-rate and risk-based premiums for pension plans may increase due to underfunding caused by declines in asset values and interest rates. Companies facing financial difficulties in recessions may struggle with higher insurance premiums. The President's Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction aims to minimize premium increases during economic downturns. PBGC is one of several government insurance programs, including federal crop insurance, federal flood insurance, and insurance for banking deposits. Insurance programs like the FDIC and NCUA provide coverage for banking deposits, with risk-based premiums based on the bank's assets. However, assessing the riskiness of non-financial companies for pension insurance may be more challenging due to the lack of standard measures. The riskiness of non-financial companies can be challenging to determine for pension insurance, as there is a lack of standard measures. Financial indicators like debt-to-assets ratio can help assess a company's financial health, but these ratios vary across industries. Judgment by PBGC may be necessary for final determinations."
