The Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to calculate weekly benefits based on earnings in the highest quarter of the disability base period. The chart shows different income ranges and corresponding benefit amounts. For disabilities starting between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 1991, weekly benefits are 55% of the highest quarter wages, not exceeding $266 or the maximum workers' compensation amount. If not a multiple of $1, it is rounded up. For disabilities starting between January 1, 1991, and January 1, 2000, weekly benefits are 55% of the highest quarter wages, not exceeding $336. If the amount exceeds $1,749.20, the benefit is calculated to the next higher dollar. For disabilities starting between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2018, weekly benefits are 55% of the highest quarter wages, not exceeding the maximum workers\u2019 compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount. If the benefit is not a multiple of one dollar, it is rounded up to the next dollar.

The weekly benefit amount for disabilities starting on or after January 1, 2018, but before January 1, 2022, is calculated based on the individual's wages during the quarter of their disability base period. If the wages are less than $929, the benefit is $50. If the wages are $929 or more but less than one-third of the state average quarterly wage, the benefit is 70% of the wages divided by 13, rounded up to the next dollar if necessary. The weekly benefit amount for disabilities is calculated based on the individual's wages during the quarter of their disability base period. The benefit amount is determined by either 23.3 percent of the state average weekly wage or 60 percent of the individual's highest quarter wages divided by 13, whichever is greater. The weekly benefit amount cannot exceed the maximum workers' compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount set by the Department of Industrial Relations.
