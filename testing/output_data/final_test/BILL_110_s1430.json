    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iran Sanctions Enabling Act\". Congress finds that the Genocide Convention defines genocide as the act of killing members of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group with the intent to destroy the targeted group. 133 member states of the United Nations have ratified the Genocide Convention, pledging to prosecute individuals who violate its prohibitions. On October 27, 2005, at the World Without Zionism Conference in Tehran, Iran, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called for Israel to be \"wiped off the map\" and made derogatory remarks about Israel. In December 2006, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1737, imposing sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program. Following Iran's non-compliance with Resolution 1737, the UN Security Council approved Resolution 1747 on March 24, 2007, tightening sanctions on Iran for its uranium-enrichment activities. There are signs of domestic discontent in Iran, and targeted financial measures could lead to a change in Iranian policy, impacting economic development in various sectors. Targeted financial measures are seen as a strong non-military tool to influence Iran. The UN Security Council approved Resolution 1747 in response to Iran's non-compliance with Resolution 1737, tightening sanctions on Iran for its uranium-enrichment activities. Targeted financial measures are considered strong non-military tools to influence Iran, discouraging its support for terrorism and nuclear weapons program. There is a growing interest among various entities to disassociate from companies supporting Iran's nuclear ambitions. Policy makers and fund managers may divest assets from entities operating in countries under international economic sanctions or having business relationships with sanctioned countries to avoid reputational or financial risks. SEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY IN UNITED STATES CAPITAL MARKETS. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other federal departments, must publish a list every 180 days of persons who have invested over $20,000,000 in Iran's energy sector, including details of the investment. The Secretary of the Treasury must notify persons 30 days before publishing a list of those who have invested in Iran's energy sector. If a person takes actions to divest from Iran within 60 days, they may be removed from the list. The Treasury can remove a person from the list if they divest from Iran's energy sector before the next publication. The Secretary of the Treasury will maintain and update the list on the department's website. The Treasury can remove a person from the list if they divest from Iran's energy sector before the next publication, as defined in section 14(9) of the Iran Sanctions Act. State and local governments have the authority to divest assets from companies invested in Iran's energy sector. State and local governments can divest assets from companies involved in Iran's energy sector, regardless of other laws. They can also prohibit investments in these companies, as outlined in the recent list published under specific sections. This authority applies to measures taken before or after the enactment of the Act. The term \"investment of the assets of the State or local government\" includes commitments or contributions of assets. The term \"assets\" in this context refers to public monies, including pension, retirement, annuity, or endowment funds controlled by State or local governments. Measures authorized by subsection (a) are not preempted by Federal laws, except when compliance with both the measure and Federal law is impossible. SAFE HARBOR FOR CHANGES OF INVESTMENT POLICIES BY MUTUAL FUNDS. The Investment Company Act of 1940 is amended to include a safe harbor provision for registered investment companies divesting from securities issued by companies on the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act list. No civil, criminal, or administrative action can be taken against them for avoiding such investments. SEC. 6. Safe harbor for fiduciaries divesting from Iran-related investments under ERISA. No breach of fiduciary duties for divesting plan assets from entities on Iran sanctions list. SEC. 7. Congress supports Thrift Savings Plan decisions. The Congress urges the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to offer a terror-free international investment option within the Thrift Savings Fund, excluding stocks of companies doing business in countries supporting terrorism. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is encouraged to provide a genocide-free international investment option similar to the terror-free option, excluding support for acts of international terrorism. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"Iran,\" \"energy sector,\" \"person,\" \"State,\" and \"State or local government.\" The definitions clarify the scope and entities included under each term. Entities covered under this Act include any State, agency, local government, and public institution of higher education. SEC. 9. SUNSET. The Act shall terminate 30 days after the President certifies that Iran has stopped supporting international terrorism and ceased pursuing nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The Government of Iran has retracted statements calling for the destruction of Israel."
