    "content": "The text discusses the relationship of the Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Program to existing laws and the requirement for environmental sciences review. An environmental sciences review panel will be established for the Outer Continental Shelf offshore Florida to assess available information for leasing, exploration, development, and production. If necessary, additional studies will be identified. The review panel established for the Outer Continental Shelf offshore Florida will identify additional studies needed, assess potential impacts of exploration and development, supervise peer reviews of proposed studies, and report findings and recommendations to the Secretary. The review panel for the Outer Continental Shelf offshore Florida includes representatives from various agencies and organizations, as well as scientists appointed by the Secretary of Commerce. Members receive compensation for travel while conducting official duties under the Act. Members of the review panel appointed under the Act may receive compensation for travel expenses. The Secretary of Commerce can determine their compensation rate, not exceeding the maximum rate for grade GS-18. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress after considering the panel's findings and recommendations. The Secretary must fulfill duties under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act regarding leasing and development, including explaining any differences with the review panel's findings. When deciding on leasing, the Secretary must consider the panel's recommendations and provide substantial evidence if there are disagreements. SEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.

No lease sale until 45 days after Congress receives a report. In the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, no exploration or development plans approved until after January 1, 2002. In the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area offshore Florida, studies to acquire information must be completed before any lease sale after January 1, 2002. The Secretary is required to cancel active leases in the area within 90 days of the enactment of this Act, with no exploration or development plans approved before the cancellation. The Act requires the cancellation of active leases in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area within 90 days of enactment, with compensation determined under specific sections of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

For the purposes of this Act, terms defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act have the same meaning as in that Act. References to specific Outer Continental Shelf planning areas are designated in the Department of the Interior Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas and Oil Resource Management Comprehensive Program 1992-1997 Proposal. The term \"adequate\" means complete enough for necessary decisions under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, with sufficient scientific quality for reliability and validity. The term \"National Research Council's report\" refers to the report on the adequacy of environmental information. The report titled \"The Adequacy of Environmental Information for Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Decisions: Florida and California\" was issued in 1989 by the Council's Committee to Review the Outer Continental Shelf Environmental Studies Program. It was supported by the President's Outer Continental Shelf Leasing and Development Task Force through Department of the Interior Contract No. 1435000130495. The term \"preleasing activities\" refers to activities conducted before a lease sale, excluding environmental, geologic, and geophysical tasks.
