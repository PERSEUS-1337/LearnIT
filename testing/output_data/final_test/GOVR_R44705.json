    "content": "The distribution of income in the United States has garnered significant attention from Congress and the public. There is a growing gap between top earners and those in the middle and bottom of the distribution. Policymakers and analysts are trying to understand the factors driving these trends and their impact on living standards and economic growth. This report examines recent income distribution trends, factors contributing to these patterns, and the potential link between inequality and economic growth. Data from various sources, including Census data, are used to analyze income distribution and mobility trends within different racial groups. The curr_chunk discusses income distribution trends within the U.S. population and different racial groups, using data from the World Wealth and Income Database and the OECD. It also examines the impacts of the 2007-2009 Great Recession on income distribution and mobility patterns. The complexity of describing the income distribution is highlighted, requiring meaningful choices. The complexity of income distribution analysis involves making choices about data sources, income definition, unit of analysis, and coverage. The report relies on Census Bureau and WID income data, which vary in these dimensions. There is no single indicator that captures all aspects of the distribution, with comparisons between top and bottom incomes providing different insights into the shape and pattern of change. The report focuses on income distribution analysis, using Census Bureau data and WID income data. It compares top and bottom incomes to understand the shape and pattern of change. The Gini coefficient is a summary measure used, but lower-tail inequality comparisons offer more detailed insights. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of U.S. household income in 2015. In 2015, median household income was $56,516 and mean household income was $79,263, showing a right-skewed distribution with more households on the left side. Figure 1 provides a snapshot of income distribution at that time, while Figure 2 shows changes in mean quintile household income over time. Mean household income increased for all quintiles from 1967 to 2015, with the top quintile experiencing the highest growth rate. Income inequality rose due to rapid growth in the top quintile, with annualized growth rates ranging from 0.5% to 1.3% across quintiles. Inequality increased among households in the lower 80% of the income distribution, with a widening income gap between the 4th quintile and the bottom quintile. Mean incomes are influenced by business cycles, with all quintiles experiencing income declines during recessions. Between 1967 and 1975, average income grew for all five quintiles except during recessions, with the bottom quintile experiencing rapid growth. From 1975 to 2000, income continued to grow for all quintiles, but the bottom quintile had the slowest growth rate. Overall income inequality increased markedly between 1975 and 2000. Overall income inequality increased markedly between 1975 and 2000, with slower income growth for the top two quintiles between 2000 and 2015. Incomes fell for the bottom three quintiles during this period, leading to a widening income distribution gap. Income inequality widened between 2000-2015, but at a slower rate than from 1975-2000. The distribution became less equal over time, with the top quintile experiencing faster income growth. After 2000, inequality continued to grow as incomes at the top increased modestly while shrinking for the bottom three quintiles. Income inequality widened between 2000-2015, with the top quintile experiencing faster income growth. Racial differences in household income distribution are highlighted, with black-headed households having a higher percentage with incomes under $50,000 in 2015. In 2015, income distribution among racial groups varied, with black-headed households having lower representation in higher income categories compared to Asian-headed households. White-headed households mirrored the overall distribution pattern. Asian-headed households were more evenly distributed across income groups and had higher shares in the top two income categories. The income distribution among Asian-headed households has been more volatile than other racial groups since 2002. Between 1967 and 2001, the income distribution among black, white, and Asian households shifted, with black-headed households decreasing in the lowest income category and increasing in higher categories. White-headed households moved from lower to higher income categories, while Asian-headed households saw a decline in the bottom two income categories and an increase in the top three categories between 1987 and 2001. Hispanic-headed households saw gains in the top income category from 3% in 1987 to 9% in 2001. Census classifies Hispanic as an ethnic origin, not a race, making direct income comparisons with other racial groups difficult. In 2015, Hispanic households were more concentrated in the lowest income category (under $50,000) compared to the overall U.S. population. Only 3% of Hispanic households had incomes of $200,000 or more, while 6% of all U.S. households were in this category. Non-Hispanic households had a similar income distribution to the overall population. Since 1972, the share of Hispanic-headed households in the under $50,000 income category has declined steadily, while shares in the top three income categories have increased. Income distribution trends have been driven by faster income growth in the top quintile, with gains further concentrated within that quintile. Analysis of income trends for the top 1% of the distribution is provided using estimates from the World Wealth and Income Database (WID), primarily constructed from IRS tax statistics. The IRS tax statistics represent the taxable incomes of individuals or couples required to file a federal income tax return. Income includes all sources reported on tax returns before deductions, excluding income taxes paid, credits received, and non-cash benefits. The WID data series analyzes the share of national income earned by the top 1% of tax filers from 1916 to 2015, considering income with and without realized capital gains. The analysis extends back to 1967, showing the U-shaped curve of top income shares over the last century. Income shares peaked in the 1920s, fell and stabilized for 50 years, then started climbing in the early 1980s. Top income shares respond to business cycles, falling during recessions and rising during expansions. Including realized capital gains increases the share of national income earned by the top 1% and its volatility over time. Average income per tax unit for select income groups within the top 1% from 1967 to 2015 is also plotted. The analysis shows a wide and growing income divide among the top earners, with rapid income growth for top income groups until 2000, followed by volatility and a downward trend. The \"Great Recession\" of 2007 to 2009 resulted in substantial income and job loss, with the economic recovery featuring. During and after the Great Recession, household incomes across all income levels fell. Mean income loss ranged from 1.7% to 4.2% during the recession, with continued declines during the recovery. Income growth was staggered, with top earners not reaching 2009 levels until 2013, while lower income groups took even longer to recover. Over the 2009-2015 period, income growth varied across quintiles, with the top four quintiles experiencing growth and the bottom quintile facing a 2.4% loss. The income distribution became less equal as lower quintiles saw losses, while the top two quintiles saw growth, especially the top 20%. Census data limitations include not capturing trends at the very top and excluding capital gains and losses, which were unevenly distributed. The financial crisis caused a significant loss in wealth, reducing capital gains income. WID data shows large income losses for all groups during the recession, ranging from 8% to 47%. The top income filers experienced relatively large gains in income during the recovery. During the recovery, tax filers at the top of the income distribution saw significant gains in mean income, ranging from 9%-49% for the top 10%. However, average income fell for tax units in the lower 90% and within the top 1% between 2007 and 2015. The Great Recession impacted the income distribution through effects on labor income and capital income. The Great Recession impacted the income distribution through effects on labor income and capital income. Labor income was affected by the increase in the unemployment rate, leading to stagnant real median wages for the employed. Unemployment disproportionately affected workers with lower educational attainment, putting downward pressure on wages. Asset prices rose faster than labor markets improved post-recession, affecting income distribution. The 2013 study found that inflation-adjusted hourly wages at different percentiles were still below 2007 levels post-Great Recession. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 led to a decline in asset prices and capital income, disproportionately affecting households at the top income distribution. Data from the Congressional Budget Office shows evidence of this impact. Capital income from 2007 to 2013 saw a decline of 40% to 47% across income quintiles, with the top quintile and top 1% experiencing larger drops due to their reliance on capital income. This volatility in capital income, coupled with rising income inequality, explains why the top 1% saw a bigger income drop during the 2007-2009 recession and a larger gain from 2009 to 2015. Income inequality has trended upward in most OECD countries since the 1980s or 1990s, driven by global forces. While inequality remained unchanged for the OECD as a whole after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, it continued to rise in countries like the United States. Domestic conditions also play a role in inequality trends, with the U.S. experiencing higher and earlier increases compared to other countries. Income inequality has been on the rise in the United States, surpassing all other OECD countries with similar income levels. Between 1967 and 2015, income inequality increased as households in the top quintiles saw faster income growth compared to others. This disparity may not mean that all households in the top quintiles experienced income growth, highlighting the complexity of income distribution within the country. Income mobility is the movement of households throughout the income distribution over time. It can be measured in short-term, longer-term, and intergenerational frames. Data shows that there is a relationship between one's current rank in the distribution and past rankings, with more mobility over longer periods of time. Overall, income mobility has not significantly decreased in recent decades. Analyses of government data sources show limited household and individual earnings mobility over short-term periods. In particular, households tend to remain in their income rank over one to five years, with 69% of bottom quintile households in 2004 remaining in the bottom quintile in 2007. Similarly, 68% of top quintile households in 2004 stayed in the top quintile in 2007. The study found that income mobility between 2004 and 2007 varied among different income groups. While the top quintile mostly consisted of the same households, middle quintiles showed more upward and downward mobility. Social Security Administration earnings data also showed similar short-term mobility patterns, with individuals tending to maintain their earnings rank from year to year. The study analyzed income mobility over various timeframes, finding that top earners had a high likelihood of staying in the top 1% over short periods but were more likely to move over longer periods. Overall earnings mobility decreased slightly over 5-year periods, especially among men. Social Security Administration data also showed mobility over 20-year periods, with some degree of immobility persisting. The study found that workers were more mobile over longer timeframes than shorter ones. Past earnings rank is a better predictor of future earnings in the short term. Overall earnings mobility has not deteriorated in recent decades. Another study on long-term income mobility among families showed some degree of mobility for each quintile, with less at the top and bottom of the distribution. Individuals exhibit different income mobility patterns over short-term (3-year) and longer-term (20-year) periods. Those in the top and bottom quintiles are more likely to maintain their ranks over time compared to the middle three quintiles. Analysis shows that a significant portion of individuals in the top 1 percent in 1987 remained in the top decile 20 years later. Parental income distribution can influence children's future rankings. Intergenerational income mobility in the United States is being studied by the Equality of Opportunity Project at Harvard University. Researchers gained access to tax records to analyze income distribution rankings of families from 1987-1998 and their children from 2000-2012. The Equality of Opportunity Project at Harvard University analyzed income distribution rankings of families from 1987-1998 and their children from 2000-2012. The study found that parents' past income ranking is related to a child's ranking in adulthood, with a correlation between 0.29 and 0.31. The relationship between child and parent ranks has remained consistent for individuals born between 1971 and 1982. Researchers agree that multiple factors have influenced income distribution trends since the mid-1970s, but there is less consensus on their relative importance. Factors affecting income distribution trends since the mid-1970s are reviewed, with a focus on labor income, capital income, and changing household composition. The importance of these factors varies over time, especially since real income stagnated after 2000. The report focuses on how factors like labor income, tax policy, and government payments impact income distribution. Labor income is a significant portion of total income for individuals and households, affecting the distribution across income quintiles. Changes in relative earnings and job availability for different wage workers can have a greater impact on the middle three income quintiles. Rapid growth in top incomes is a notable trend from 1967 to 2015, but not the only factor driving income inequality. Lower 80% of households also experienced increased inequality, with income losses among the bottom three quintiles since 2000. Factors affecting labor income distribution include changes in workers' productivity and bargaining power. Technological innovation has impacted labor earnings distribution patterns in recent decades, with gains mostly benefiting skilled, high-wage workers. Factors like minimum wage, collective bargaining, and global trading patterns have had significant effects on workers in the bottom half of the distribution. The use of personal computers and IT has improved worker performance and changed task organization, while technological progress has made automating certain tasks more cost-effective, affecting workers in production. Technological innovation has impacted labor earnings distribution patterns, benefiting skilled, high-wage workers. New technology raises productivity and value to employers, affecting workers differently based on their skill level. This is known as skill-biased technological change (SBTC) theory. According to SBTC theory, new technology increases productivity and value for highly-skilled workers by complementing their work and replacing routine tasks. This leads to increased labor demand and higher wages for skilled workers, while reducing the demand for middle- and low-skilled workers who perform routine tasks. Technological advancements have led to job loss for certain clerical and production workers due to automation and offshoring. Factors such as stagnant minimum wage growth and declining union membership have also impacted relative wages. The declining real minimum wage, not indexed to prices, has distributional consequences as it falls in real terms between legislated increases. Research on the 1980-2000 period shows that the declining minimum wage, especially in the 1980s, contributed to growing wage inequality, particularly for women. Some economists warn that increasing the minimum wage may lead to job losses or reduced hours for low-wage workers, impacting their total income. Union members tend to earn more than non-union members in the same industry due to stronger negotiating power. The decline in union membership rates from 1983-2015 has weakened workers' ability to negotiate for better wages and benefits, leading to a widening wage gap between high and middle-wage male workers. This decline in collective bargaining coverage has particularly affected industries like construction, transportation, and production jobs, where union membership historically has been high. Recent global trading patterns have shifted what the United States produces, impacting unionized workers, especially men. The specialization of production in international trade has led to uneven distribution of gains within countries, with workers in industries competing with imports being most affected. The long-term decline in U.S. manufacturing employment has prompted researchers to investigate the role of increased import penetration in this trend. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment is attributed to increased import penetration, particularly from China, leading to factory closings and job displacement for low- and middle-wage workers. This had lasting effects on labor income and job opportunities, especially for less-educated workers. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment is due to factors like technological changes and increased international trade, leading to job displacement for workers. This has also created opportunities for employment in other sectors as new trade patterns emerge. The impact of trade-induced production shifts on income distribution depends on the magnitude of expansion and types of workers hired. Over time, effects on displaced workers should diminish as the economy moves away from import-competing sectors. Immigration can alter wage distribution by changing employment and earnings patterns, especially with a significant influx of foreign-born workers. Immigration's impact on labor markets is a complex area of economic research. Studies show mixed results on how immigrant labor affects native workers' employment and wages. The wage distribution can be influenced by immigration through various channels, depending on how it impacts native workers' employment and wages. The impact of immigration on native workers' employment and wages is a complex area of economic research. Studies show mixed results on the distribution of wages, with most research not finding significant effects of immigration on native wage levels. Rising inequality in the long run is driven by significant growth in real income at the top of the distribution. In 2015, the top earners were different medical specialists and chief executives. A 2012 study found that nonfinancial executives, managers, and supervisors were the occupations of 31% of the top 1% of income earners in 2005. Between 1979 and 2005, top earners in executive and finance occupations saw the largest growth in their share of income. The top 1% earners in finance and real estate saw their share grow quickly, with the medical, legal, and financial industries having the most top earners. Various factors like skill-biased technological change, globalization, investment requirements, and regulatory relief drive income growth at the top. Some industries benefit from economies of scale, allowing top workers to increase productivity and wages. \"Winner takes all\" industries have positive network effects, leading to dominant firms. Technological change favors certain industries like IT firms. Compensation structures in successful firms may highly compensate top employees. Employees at successful firms are highly compensated, with evidence showing that these firms pay all employees more than similar ones, contributing to growing inequality. The economics of superstars is seen in industries like entertainment and sports, where consumers are willing to pay more for top performers. This phenomenon may also apply to other industries, with technology and globalization amplifying the superstar effect. Studies have raised doubts about competitive markets theory in describing pay-setting dynamics at the top of the income distribution. CEO influence over their own pay, through close relationships with boards, has been questioned, leading to rent seeking. Research on CEO pay and firm performance correlation has yielded varying results. Changes in compensation forms, such as stocks and bonuses, have contributed to income growth at the top. The use of stock options and other incentive-based pay has significantly increased total compensation, with some forms of compensation being four times higher in real terms. However, poorly targeted incentive-based pay can lead to unintended rises in compensation, especially in executive pay due to rent seeking. For example, options that retain value even if the company's stock price falls can result in high pay tied to unpredictable future stock prices. Increased use of stock options can lead to high pay tied to underestimated future stock price gains, especially in executive compensation. Startups may offer stock options to attract employees in cash-flow poor or winner-takes-all industries. Successful firms see compensation rise to induce acceptance of risky pay structures, contributing to income inequality. Social norms play a role in constraining income at the top of the distribution, with executives wanting to avoid backlash by keeping pay levels below certain thresholds. Cultural differences may explain why executives in the United States are paid more than in other advanced economies. Changes in social norms or complex pay schemes may help explain the growth in income at the top in recent decades. The share of workers covered by state licensing requirements has increased from 5% in the 1950s to 25% in 2008, leading to reduced competition and raised incomes at the top of the distribution in certain industries. Licensing requirements for professionals like lawyers, doctors, and dentists create barriers to entry, allowing them to capture economic rents. However, the impact on rising inequality is unclear. The distribution of income is primarily driven by labor income for most households, with factors affecting wages playing a key role. However, for the top income earners, capital income also plays a significant role. Capital income, including capital gains, makes up a larger portion of total income for the highest income quintiles, highlighting the importance of wealth distribution in shaping income distribution trends. The Federal Reserve conducts a Survey of Consumer Finances to gather data on financial asset holdings. The distribution of financial assets by income has become more unequal since 1989, with top deciles experiencing faster growth than lower quintiles. Median holdings are more imbalanced than mean holdings, with a significant difference between top and bottom distributions. Median values in 2013 were lower than in 1989, unlike mean values. In 2013, median values for financial assets were lower than in 1989 for the bottom two quintiles but slightly higher for the third quintile and significantly higher for the top two quintiles. 18% of families in the bottom quintile did not own any financial assets, compared to 2% or less in the top three quintiles. Wealth patterns diverged post-financial crisis, with the top decile seeing an increase in asset values while the bottom three quintiles experienced a decrease. The top decile held better performing assets than the rest of the distribution in 2013, leading to smaller asset holdings for the bottom 60% and more accumulation for the top 10%. This disparity could result in lower capital income for the bottom 60%. The distribution of capital income may also vary by quintile, with high-income households potentially earning higher rates of return on their assets. High-income households continue to have higher savings rates than low-income households, leading to increased wealth inequality and potential future income inequality. Changes in family composition, such as the rise of dual income families, have also influenced income distribution since 1967. The rise in dual income households has contributed to increased income inequality, with the percentage of families with two earners rising from 44% in 1975 to 59% in 2015. Female employment rates have also increased, particularly among higher income families. Assortative matching, where spouses have similar incomes or education levels, has further exacerbated income inequality. The increase in assortative matching has led to a rise in income inequality, with the Gini coefficient increasing from 0.34 to 0.43 or 0.44 in 2005. The growth of female single-headed families and the long-term increase in single-headed families have also contributed to household inequality. The median and mean income of families with a single female head of household was less than half that of married families in 2015. The share of families with a female head increased from 13% in 1975 to 19% in 2015, with 21% of the rise in inequality between 1979 and 2006 attributed to the decline in married couple households. The connection between GDP growth and national income does not determine income distribution. GDP growth increases the overall income pie, but how it is divided among households is a separate issue. The distribution of income does not necessarily change with GDP growth, as it only affects the size of the income pie. The division of the pie does not necessarily affect how quickly the pie grows. Historical data in the United States shows no consistent relationship between GDP growth and income inequality. Factors influencing growth are numerous, making it challenging to establish a direct link between inequality and GDP growth. Exploring connections between inequality and GDP growth requires sophisticated analysis beyond simple correlations. Two steps are needed: identifying theoretical channels linking them and using data and empirical methods to measure the relationship. Various transmission channels predict different effects of inequality on growth, with some suggesting higher inequality could lead to lower growth, particularly if it stems from unequal opportunities or barriers to advancement. Inequality, especially gender or racial inequality, could hinder growth by creating barriers to education, investment, and business opportunities. Lack of access to credit markets for low-income individuals could perpetuate inequality of opportunity. Poor governance and political instability associated with greater inequality can lead to negative effects on growth, such as rent-seeking behavior and undermining political institutions. Inequality, gender or racial, can hinder growth by creating barriers to education, investment, and business opportunities. Poor governance and political instability linked to inequality can lead to negative effects on growth, such as rent-seeking behavior and undermining political institutions. Civil war, corruption, and graft have negative effects on growth. Some researchers suggest that greater inequality may lead to pressure for redistributive policies that could lower growth. However, higher inequality could also increase incentives to work, acquire skills, innovate, and save, potentially boosting growth. Inequality may not directly impact growth, but factors associated with it, such as lack of income mobility, can have effects. High-income households saving more could spur growth. Policy focus on boosting growth may require addressing these underlying issues. The relationship between inequality and growth is discussed, with a focus on empirical evidence from cross-country studies. Different theoretical channels play varying roles in different countries, with political instability being an example. The relevance of these findings to individual countries, such as the United States, may vary. Studies have attempted to measure the relationship between inequality and growth, with varying conclusions. The effect of inequality on growth tends to be negative, especially in less developed countries and when wealth distribution is considered. Panel data mostly composed of developed countries show a less pronounced effect. Studies have attempted to measure the relationship between inequality and growth, with varying conclusions. In developed countries, regional dummies are added to growth regression, and income distribution is used instead of wealth distribution. The impact of inequality on growth becomes insignificant or even positive. Challenges exist in identifying the true relationship between growth and inequality, such as the direction of causation running in both directions. Economic growth can lead to a widening income distribution, as seen in the development of the integrated economy in the US in the 19th century. Inequality data quality varies among countries, affecting the measurement of inequality and its impact on growth. Different measures of inequality have varying policy implications. An OECD study highlighted the importance of the income gap between low-income households and the rest of the population for growth. There is no consensus among economists on which factors besides income inequality significantly impact a country's growth rate. Factors like corruption are challenging to measure directly, and data limitations affect the inclusion of explanatory variables in statistical analysis. Studies differ on which variables to include besides inequality. Studies vary on which explanatory variables to include besides inequality, with some including relatively few. Omitting an important variable that is correlated with inequality can lead to biased results, either overstating or understating inequality's impact on growth. Using a large sample of countries may help mitigate omitted variable bias, but controlling for country-specific or region-specific effects weakens the relationship between growth and inequality, indicating a significant shortcoming. Cross-country studies, while providing more variation and observations, can still suffer from a lack of data variation. Studies can suffer from a lack of variation in the data, affecting the meaningfulness of results in identifying causal relationships. Cross-country studies assume the effects of inequality on growth are consistent across countries, but this may not hold true due to institutional and structural differences. Studies highlight the potential impact of inequality on economic growth, noting that the relationship may vary between developed and developing countries. This distinction is crucial as the effects of inequality on growth may differ based on the country's economic status. Some studies suggest that inequality can hinder economic growth, especially in developing countries. There is a potential link between rising inequality and economic crises like the Great Depression and the Great Recession. Economists theorize that excessive inequality could lead to financial instability due to unsustainable credit bubbles. However, further research is needed to determine why inequality becomes destabilizing beyond a certain point."
