Regulatory reform is expected to be a key response to the economic downturn, with criminal prosecution playing a role in cases involving criminal intent. This report focuses on federal criminal provisions relevant to mortgage fraud prosecutions. Federal criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud, financial institutions fraud, false statements, money laundering, conspiracy, racketeering, and securities fraud, may encompass fraudulent activities in mortgage fraud cases. These statutes apply to individuals involved in high-level mortgage transactions and entities defined as financial institutions under federal law. Regulatory reform in response to economic downturns has increased congressional interest in criminal prosecution for mortgage fraud cases. Legislative proposals aim to expand federal statutory authority for mortgage fraud prosecutions, potentially amending existing laws to enhance liability for future crimes and deter fraud targeting vulnerable individuals in the current market. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA, S. 386) is being considered by Congress to address these issues. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA, S. 386) aims to expand federal criminal law authorities for combating mortgage fraud by authorizing funding for prosecution efforts and other measures. Mortgage fraud involves material misstatements, misrepresentations, or omissions made with intent to deceive in connection with a mortgage, with distinctions between fraud-for-housing and fraud-for-profit schemes. Fraud for housing involves false statements made to obtain a mortgage loan and is prosecuted at the state level. Fraud for profit schemes involve ongoing schemes like equity skimming, property flipping, mortgage-related identity theft, and foreclosure rescue scams. Fraud schemes in the housing market involve various tactics such as using straw borrowers to draw on home equity, foreclosure rescue scams that collect fees without providing assistance, and property flipping with inflated values through false appraisals. These schemes are interconnected with deficient mortgage lending, the collapse of the mortgage-backed securities market, and corporate fraud discussions. The discussion on mortgage fraud includes corporate and institutional fraud, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding. This broader approach ensures that activities related to financial institutions and securities fraud are not overlooked, as they can be interconnected with mortgage fraud schemes. Mortgage fraud involves various fraudulent activities, such as misstating the value of mortgage-backed securities, leading to the economic downturn. A Senate Judiciary Committee report highlights the relaxed lending standards that contributed to the crisis. Private mortgage brokers and lending businesses took over the housing market, operating without proper oversight and regulations. This led to an increase in fraudulently obtained mortgages, home loan scams, and other fraudulent activities, contributing to instability in the mortgage markets and financial breakdowns. The FBI Deputy Director highlighted how this behavior has negatively impacted the economy and homeowners. The financial crisis has exposed prevalent fraud schemes in the global financial system, leading to calls for increased mortgage fraud prosecutions. Federal prosecutors have sole authority for schemes defrauding federal regulatory agencies, while federal and state prosecutors share jurisdiction for other schemes. State prosecutors can also pursue fraud cases, including those involving federally regulated institutions. Since the financial crisis, federal prosecutors have been pursuing fraud cases involving institutions and industry insiders. Various federal regulatory agencies are involved in enforcing and supervising financial institutions, implementing regulatory reforms in response to congressional mandates. Regulatory agencies collaborate with the Justice Department in criminal investigations, with the discretion for federal criminal prosecution typically resting with the Justice Department. The Justice Department has focused on mortgage fraud investigations since the financial crisis, with over 2,000 active cases. \"Operation Malicious Mortgage\" in 2008 led to charges against 400 defendants for various fraud schemes. The Obama Administration announced a crackdown on foreclosure-rescue and mortgage loan modification fraud to protect homeowners. The role of mortgage fraud in the economic downturn has raised concerns about the need to expand federal criminal liability to cover actions aimed at defrauding private mortgage lending businesses. False statements and schemes targeting these institutions currently evade liability under existing federal fraud statutes. The statute criminalizing false statements on mortgage applications applies to frauds against private mortgage lending businesses. Proposals for expanded authorities focus on holding accountable mortgage brokers and others who took advantage of lax loan standards. Other federal fraud statutes, like the mail and wire fraud statutes, also allow for criminal liability in such cases. Additionally, penalties under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 have increased for mail and wire fraud offenses. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 increased penalties for mail and wire fraud, providing powerful prosecutorial tools. The Act also amended federal criminal statutes to expand liability for mortgage fraud, securities fraud, and financial institution fraud. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the definition of \"financial institution\" to include mortgage lending businesses and amended federal criminal statutes to increase penalties for various types of fraud, including mortgage fraud, securities fraud, and financial institution fraud. The House passed S. 386, amending federal criminal statutes to cover commodities like derivatives of mortgage-backed securities. The measure includes provisions from the Fight Fraud Act of 2009, expanding the definition of \"financial institution\" to include private mortgage lending businesses. The Obama Administration and some commentators support the measure for its potential return on investment in prosecutions. Multiple federal criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud, financial institutions fraud, false statements, and money laundering, are relevant in mortgage fraud prosecutions. Other criminal provisions and penalties from banking laws may also apply. Additionally, conspiracy and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations provisions can provide secondary bases for criminal liability. Federal courts determine specific sentences in individual cases after considering recommendations in the U.S. Sentencing guidelines. Federal prosecutors often rely on the mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71341 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a71343, to combat white-collar crimes due to their broad reach and effectiveness in addressing complex fraud cases. These statutes treat those who aid and abet a perpetrator as principals, making them punishable for the underlying offense. The mail and wire fraud statutes share identical elements and are interpreted similarly by federal courts, with communication through mail and wire (including internet) being common methods used in these crimes. The mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71341 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a71343, are interpreted similarly by federal courts. They both involve devising schemes to defraud and using mail or wire communication to execute the fraud. The wire fraud statute extends to transmissions through internet as well. The mail and wire fraud statutes involve using mail or telecommunications, including the internet, to commit fraud. Prosecutors have a low bar to prove the relevant act, focusing on the defendant's intent to defraud. Courts interpret \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" broadly, encompassing any dishonest method to deprive someone of value. The definition of \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" includes the deprivation of something of value through deceit or overreaching. Congress expanded this definition to cover schemes involving the intangible right of honest services. Prosecutions for mortgage fraud typically involve tangible property, while cases involving lenders may focus on the deprivation of \"honest services.\" The interpretation of this phrase varies among federal circuit courts. The mail and wire fraud statutes apply to fraudulent activities involving intangible property, with materiality being a necessary component. Fraudulent schemes do not need to be successful to be punishable. Financial institution crimes extend beyond banks to any financial institution, with the definition of \"financial institution\" being crucial in these cases. The definition of \"financial institution\" is crucial in financial institutions fraud cases, covering nine types of entities including insured depository institutions, credit unions, federal home loan banks, farm credit institutions, small business investment companies, and more. Mortgage lending entities are not currently included unless they fall within the specified categories. Criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71344 applies if a person knowingly executes a fraudulent scheme. The penalties for financial institution fraud include up to 30 years imprisonment and a $1 million fine for knowingly executing a scheme to defraud or obtain property. Federal prosecutors must prove knowledge and execution of the scheme. Determinations of an attempted or conducted execution of a scheme are fact-specific, considering factors like the scheme's goal, nature, benefits intended, interdependence of acts, and parties involved. The activity must involve a scheme or artifice intended to deceive for financial institution fraud. One of the two purpose prongs must be satisfied, with different elements required for each. Violations under both prongs can lead to separate convictions, with the second prong necessitating fraudulent representations and actual deprivation of property. Several federal statutes impose criminal penalties for such actions. Several federal statutes impose criminal liability for false statements, with the most commonly relied upon provision being 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001. This provision applies to false statements made in matters within the jurisdiction of the federal government. To establish criminal liability for false statements made to non-government entities, specific types of false statements must apply, such as falsifying or concealing information, making false statements, or using false documents. This provision is frequently used by federal prosecutors as a basis for criminal liability. The provision under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001 is a common basis for criminal liability for false statements to the government. The \"knowingly and willfully\" standard requires actual knowledge of falsity, but not awareness of transmission to a government agency. Prosecutors must prove false, material statements made within federal jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is broadly interpreted, even if unaware of federal authority. The false statement provisions applicable to mortgage fraud include possessing false papers with intent to defraud, making false statements on loan applications, producing false identification documents, and making unauthorized mortgage transactions. The provision criminalizing false statements on a loan or credit application, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71014, applies not only to an individual borrower's provision of false information on a loan application but also to the overvaluation of a property or security for the purpose of influencing a protected financial institution in any way. The false statements provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71014, applies to entities misrepresenting the value of mortgage-backed securities. Criminal liability requires a \"knowing\" mental state, accidental mistakes do not lead to liability. Defenses include the \"exculpatory no\" doctrine and an \"ambiguity\" defense. The \"ambiguity\" defense can be used to avoid criminal liability in certain situations where the question asked was truly ambiguous. Willful misapplication of an institution's money or property by its officers or employees, including in the context of mortgages, can lead to criminal charges. This may occur when a mortgage is given to an uncreditworthy borrower or lacks sufficient collateral. Criminal misapplication of a mortgage can lead to charges if given to an uncreditworthy borrower or lacks collateral. Consent from the bank with full knowledge can be a defense. Penalties include a fine of up to $1 million and 30 years imprisonment. Violation of federal regulations can also result in criminal penalties. Companies can face criminal penalties for violating regulations issued by the Federal Reserve Board, with fines up to $1 million per day of violation and imprisonment of up to one year. Violations of regulations on monetary transactions can result in penalties of up to five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. Harsher penalties may apply if the violation was committed to further a federal crime. Regulatory agencies determine the scope of liability under these regulations, providing flexibility but potentially leading to uncertainty. The approach of criminal provisions addresses responses to federal regulatory agencies' enforcement activities. One statute provides criminal fines and imprisonment for concealing assets from regulatory agencies or impeding their functions. Other provisions make it a crime to participate in the control of an insured depository institution without approval. The criminal provisions address responses to federal regulatory agencies' enforcement activities, including fines and imprisonment for concealing assets or impeding functions. It is also a crime to participate in controlling an insured depository institution without approval and to offer unauthorized loans or gratuities to federal examiners. Criminal penalties are imposed for unauthorized use of federal agency names to prevent misleading appearances of federal operation or support. The curr_chunk discusses criminal penalties for non-compliance with federal agencies' investigations and enforcement actions, including fines and imprisonment for obstructing examinations of financial institutions. Money laundering is also addressed under federal law. Money laundering provisions can lead to criminal liability in mortgage fraud cases if proceeds from unlawful activity are used in financial transactions. The law imposes penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment and fines up to $500,000 or twice the value of the funds involved for individuals or entities involved in such transactions. The federal statute imposes criminal liability for engaging in monetary transactions with criminally derived property over $10,000. Financial institutions can be prosecuted for money laundering, requiring approval from the Department of Justice's Criminal Division. Approval is also needed for cases involving money laundering and other financial crimes to ensure consistency and uniformity in prosecutions. Conspiracy is an independent basis for criminal liability under federal law, requiring approval before an indictment or complaint may be brought. Additional federal statutes provide penalties for conspiracy to commit crimes, serving as an alternative or supplemental basis for criminal liability. Maximum federal penalties for conspiracy typically include a fine or five years imprisonment. The Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) imposes criminal penalties for acquiring or conducting the affairs of an \"enterprise\" through a pattern of underlying crimes. RICO applies when two or more predicate offenses, such as mail or wire fraud, are involved. Penalties include imprisonment for up to 20 years or life. The Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) imposes criminal penalties for various offenses, including organizing a continuing financial crime enterprise and mortgage fraud. Penalties can include imprisonment for up to 20 years or life, and forfeiture of assets obtained through criminal activities. Additional provisions address violations affecting financial institutions and knowingly violating specific laws. The provision criminalizes various financial crimes such as accessing customer information by false pretenses, unauthorized participation in loan profits with intent to defraud, transferring securities or money obtained by fraud, and receiving kickbacks for loan procurement. Penalties include up to 30 years imprisonment and fines up to $1 million for receiving gifts to procure loans, and fines up to $10,000 and up to one year imprisonment for giving or accepting kickbacks for business referrals. The provision criminalizes various financial crimes such as giving or accepting kickbacks for business referrals related to federally related mortgage loans, splitting fees, and executing schemes to defraud the government. Penalties include fines and imprisonment for fraudulent behavior related to mortgage-backed securities. Penalties, including fines and up to 25 years imprisonment, apply in cases involving defrauding any person or obtaining money or property through false pretenses. This provision could lead to criminal liability in mortgage-backed security cases but may not cover derivative contracts. Concerns have been raised about increased federal criminalization of white-collar crimes, especially with the rising penalties for existing federal crimes. Congress may amend federal criminal statutes to address financial institutions fraud and false statements. Amend federal criminal statutes to broaden prosecutorial authority in mortgage-related criminal cases. Legislative proposals will be influenced by the response to the financial downturn. Renewed focus on revamping federal financial institution regulatory structure to ensure more entities are under federal supervision. Some finance entities would face federal supervision, with agencies like the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission implementing new regulations. These actions could expand federal authority in criminal prosecutions for mortgage fraud."
