    "title": "SB 144",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds and declares support for a special benefit assessment to fund levee improvement projects in the Sacramento region, including the Natomas Basin and Folsom Dam modifications for increased flood protection. Senate Bill 276 was passed in 2007 to modify state authorizations and continue the cost-sharing partnership for these projects. Since 2007, over $1 billion in federal, state, and local funds has been spent on flood control projects in Sacramento and Sutter counties, significantly enhancing protection against rare floods in urban areas. Since 2007, over $1 billion has been spent on flood control projects in Sacramento and Sutter counties, including raising and strengthening 18 miles of levees in the Natomas Basin with state assistance. The improvements exceed the scope of the Natomas Levee Improvement Project from 2007. The engineering report prepared by the Corps in 2010 outlines the steps for providing the Natomas Basin with 200-year flood protection. It was transmitted to Congress in December 2010 and adopted as part of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. The Legislature has decided to modify the 2007 state authorization for the Natomas Levee Improvement Project to align with the federal authorization without changing the cost-sharing arrangement. Section 12670.14 of the Water Code is amended to include projects in Sacramento and Sutter Counties at an estimated state cost. The project for flood control in the Natomas and North Sacramento areas was authorized by Congress in 1993, aligning with the Chief of Engineers' recommendations in the \"American River Watershed Investigation\" report. The flood control project along the American and Sacramento Rivers was authorized by Congress in 1996 and modified in subsequent acts to provide a 200-year level of flood protection in the Natomas Basin. The Natomas Basin flood control project was authorized by Congress in 1996 to provide 200-year flood protection. The Basin plan was adopted by Congress in 2014. The project to modify Folsom Dam was authorized by Congress in 1999 and further modified in 2007. The project for flood control, environmental restoration, and recreation along south Sacramento County streams was authorized by Congress in 1999. The Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency may provide assurances of local cooperation for the project in lieu of the Central Valley Flood Protection Board."
