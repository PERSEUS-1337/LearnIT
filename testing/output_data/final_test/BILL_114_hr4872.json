The \"Save for Success Act\" includes provisions for the American Opportunity Tax Credit Savings Credit, which allows eligible college savings contributions to be considered as qualified tuition and related expenses for an individual, with a contribution limit of $250 per year. The Act also outlines the phase-out process based on household income in relation to the poverty line for a family of a specific size. The term 'eligible college savings contribution' for an individual refers to excess contributions to qualified college savings accounts over distributions. A 'qualified college savings account' includes accounts under a qualified tuition program and state-established programs for college expenses. The text discusses the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for college tuition and educational expenses. It mentions a portion of the credit being refundable and a lifetime limitation on the credit amount allowed. The text introduces a pilot program for periodic payments of college expenses incurred by eligible students, jointly established by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education. The pilot program allows for payments of college expenses for eligible students, with the total amount capped at the allowable credit based on the taxpayer's income. The credit for a taxable year is reduced by payments made under the program for expenses that would otherwise qualify for the credit. The program established under this paragraph allows for voluntary participation by students and educational institutions, excluding taxable institutions. It applies to expenses for academic periods within a 5-year period starting 1 year after enactment, with payments not affecting financial aid eligibility. Payments under this program do not count as resources for financial aid calculations and should not reduce other forms of aid available to eligible students. Educational institutions must inform parents and students about the payment option without providing tax advice. The Secretary of the Treasury will handle reporting. The Secretaries of the Treasury and Education will submit annual reports to Congress on the program, along with any recommendations. A taxpayer awareness program will be established to inform the public about the American Opportunity Tax Credit. A taxpayer awareness program will be established to inform individuals about the availability of the American Opportunity Tax Credit through various means of communication, including displaying information on specified forms for reporting qualified tuition expenses. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, should take additional steps to promote awareness of the American Opportunity Tax Credit among students. This includes utilizing tools like the data retrieval tool and student aid report, providing information on the financial aid shopping sheet, incorporating the credit into the volunteer income tax assistance program, and raising awareness through the Federal TRIO program. The Opportunity Tax Credit in the Federal TRIO and GEAR UP programs, as outlined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2015."
