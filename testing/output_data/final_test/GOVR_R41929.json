President Obama's National Export Initiative aimed to double exports to $3.14 trillion by 2015 to create jobs. This initiative was launched during the global economic downturn, with high unemployment rates. Congress is interested in the effectiveness of federal export promotion efforts. The U.S. government has historically promoted exports through various agencies. President Obama's National Export Initiative aimed to double exports to $3.14 trillion by 2015 to create jobs. The introduction of the NEI has increased congressional interest in U.S. export promotion policy. Congress may exercise export promotion authority through oversight, authorization, and funding of federal export promotion programs. The 112th Congress may examine issues related to federal government efforts to expand U.S. exports. This report discusses U.S. export trends, federal export promotion efforts focusing on the NEI, and policy issues for Congress. Over the past few decades, U.S. trade in goods and services has generally grown, with imports growing faster than exports, leading to a trade imbalance. U.S. merchandise exports peaked in 2008 at $1.3 trillion before dropping to $1.1 trillion in 2009, then recovering in 2010. The U.S. has consistently had a trade deficit in goods, reaching a record $840 billion in 2006. In 2010, the U.S. had a negative merchandise trade balance of $647 billion. In 2010, U.S. services exports reached $546 billion, with a positive balance of $151 billion. Total exports of goods and services grew from $272 billion in 1980 to $1.84 trillion in 2008, dropping in 2009 but returning to 2008 levels in 2010. The NEI aims to double U.S. exports to $3.14 trillion by 2015. U.S. exports of goods and services doubled from $1.57 trillion in 2009 to $3.14 trillion in 2015, with annual growth rates of 15%. Analysts debate whether the U.S. is underperforming as a global exporter. Germany surpassed the U.S. as the world's largest merchandise exporter in 2003. China overtook the United States as the world's largest merchandise exporter in 2003. By 2009, China became the top exporter, surpassing the U.S. In terms of global exports of goods and services, the U.S. consistently led in commercial services, while China ranked second overall in 2009. The U.S. share of global exports peaked at 14.0% in 1998, declining to 9.4% by 2008 but exceeding 10% in 2009 and 2010. Despite being the largest exporter, the U.S. exports as a percent of GDP is relatively small compared to other countries. In comparison, Germany and China have higher percentages of exports as a percent of GDP. The U.S. share of global exports declined from 14.0% in 1998 to 9.4% in 2008, while China's rose from 14.2% to 34.9% during the same period. U.S. exports as a percent of GDP are small compared to other major exporters. Boosting exports can increase GDP, but it is not the only way. The U.S. has historically relied more on its domestic market for economic growth. The U.S. has historically focused on its domestic market for economic growth, unlike countries like Germany and China. Policymakers are now emphasizing exports to drive economic growth due to the economic downturn. Traditional trade statistics have limitations in accurately reflecting value-added in the global supply chain and trade imbalances between countries. Globalization has led to increased trade in intermediate goods, complicating accurate quantification of trade. Efforts are being made to enhance trade statistics by organizations like the World Trade Organization and government trade agencies. Traditional trade statistics, despite their limitations, continue to be used for analyzing trade trends. The United States has various federal agencies involved in export promotion efforts, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Export-Import Bank, and Small Business Administration. State and local agencies, as well as non-governmental agencies, also play a role in export promotion. Congressional mandates and executive branch actions guide these efforts. The National Export Initiative (NEI) is an Administration initiative aimed at doubling U.S. exports by 2015 to $3.14 trillion, to create and support U.S. jobs. It focuses on removing trade barriers, helping small businesses enter new export markets, providing financing assistance, and promoting export advocacy abroad. This initiative coordinates federal export promotion efforts to achieve the goal of doubling exports over the next 5 years. The NEI introduced a new level of coordination of federal export promotion activities through the President's Export Promotion Cabinet and reestablished the President's Export Council as the chief private-sector advisory committee on international trade. The NEI aims to improve advocacy and trade promotion for U.S. exporters, increase access to export financing, remove trade barriers, enforce trade rules, and promote global growth. The Export Promotion Cabinet submitted recommendations to the President on implementing the NEI, focusing on areas such as enhancing export assistance to SMEs, promoting federal resources for exports, and ensuring the effectiveness of trade missions and commercial advocacy efforts. The Export Promotion Cabinet submitted recommendations to the President on implementing the NEI, focusing on areas such as enhancing export assistance to SMEs, promoting federal resources for exports, and ensuring the effectiveness of trade missions and commercial advocacy efforts. The recommendations include strengthening interagency coordination, leveraging technology for exporters, utilizing state and local partnerships, and setting unified goals for TPCC member agencies to support the NEI's implementation. Agencies identified in the report may play a key role in implementing these recommendations. The 112th Congress may examine government export promotion activities, their goals, economic justifications, effectiveness measurement, and proposals for reorganizing federal agencies for better export promotion. Views vary on what constitutes government export promotion, with some defining it narrowly as direct assistance to expand overseas sales, while others see it as a broader activity. Export promotion can be seen as a broad activity that expands U.S. exports abroad through various programs and policies. This includes market intelligence, export counseling, and government information-gathering to help businesses enter foreign markets and understand export licensing needs. The services offered for export promotion include entry into export markets, export licensing needs, global standards, export finance strategies, business matchmaking, funding feasibility studies, and government export finance programs. Export promotion activities include loan, loan guarantee, and insurance programs for U.S. exporters, commercial diplomacy, and advocating for U.S. companies' interests in foreign markets. Free trade agreements are seen as effective tools to boost exports by opening up markets and reducing trade barriers. Expanding exports may involve participating in the World Trade Organization. The NEI focuses on expanding exports through trade negotiations and FTAs, while also addressing concerns about job loss. Foreign direct investment plays a significant role in supporting U.S. exports and production. Foreign direct investment (FDI) supports U.S. trade by accounting for a significant portion of exports and imports, employing millions of workers. Supporters advocate for bilateral investment treaties, while critics raise concerns about foreign companies exploiting lower standards abroad and national security risks. Exporters argue for changes to the export control system to enhance competitiveness. The export control system has evolved to focus more on nonproliferation and end users of controlled technology. Policy debates continue regarding unilateral controls on exports to China. U.S. businesses face significant losses due to counterfeiting and piracy in foreign countries. Some U.S. businesses face losses from counterfeiting and piracy in foreign countries. Efforts to strengthen international protection of intellectual property rights are seen as crucial for boosting exports and supporting U.S. jobs. Concerns exist about inadequate U.S. supply chain infrastructure hindering export growth, with ports focusing more on imports, causing shipping bottlenecks and raising costs for exporting goods. Congressional testimony highlights the need for new investments and improved operations at U.S. ports to support export growth. Global economic factors, such as growth, demand, and exchange rates, impact U.S. export levels. Export promotion policies aim to increase exports and support economic growth, employment, SMEs, specific industries, and geographic regions. Goals include leveling the playing field for U.S. exporters. Export promotion activities aim to boost U.S. exports, create jobs, and support economic recovery. Export-intensive jobs are higher-paying, with exports supporting over 10.3 million jobs in 2008. This number declined to 8.5 million in 2009 due to the global economic downturn. Exports of goods and services declined to 8.5 million in 2009 due to the global economic downturn, reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Efforts to promote U.S. exports are seen as a step towards rectifying global imbalances and achieving a sustainable global economic recovery. U.S. export promotion activities target firms of all sizes, various economic sectors, and foreign markets with specific objectives. Focus areas with high export potential include exports by SMEs and \"green\" exports of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services. SMEs face challenges in accessing market information, connecting with buyers, and securing export financing. Exports to emerging and developing economies, including infrastructure-related projects, are key opportunities for U.S. exporters. Federal export promotion activities target markets like China, Brazil, and India, as well as upcoming high-growth economies. The TPCC identified six countries and the Asia-Pacific region as \"next tier markets\" with high GDP growth rates. International trade policy objectives aim to access foreign markets and level the playing field for U.S. exporters. Export promotion programs target emerging and developing economies with high economic growth and rising middle classes. Export assistance, like preferential export financing, from the U.S. government can help U.S. firms compete globally and win lucrative contracts. Export promotion activities can also be used as leverage in international trade negotiations to reduce trade-distorting subsidies. Supporters of government export promotion may have conflicting priorities on how to assist firms. Some argue for government assistance to all firms regardless of size, while others advocate for focusing on helping small and medium enterprises lacking resources for exporting. There are differing views on whether federal programs should be neutral or promote specific types of exports like agricultural or energy-efficient goods. Additionally, opinions vary on whether export promotion should target all markets or focus on key emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India. There is also debate on whether export promotion efforts should be decentralized among different federal agencies. Some argue for government assistance to all firms regardless of size, while others advocate for focusing on helping small and medium enterprises lacking resources for exporting. There are differing views on whether federal programs should be neutral or promote specific types of exports like agricultural or energy-efficient goods. Additionally, opinions vary on whether export promotion should target all markets or focus on key emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India. Debate exists on whether export promotion efforts should be decentralized among different federal agencies, or centralized under one trade agency like the proposed Department of Trade. Critics question the feasibility of doubling exports in five years through the National Export Initiative (NEI) by focusing on SME or \"green\" exports, suggesting support for U.S. exports in general or exports by large companies instead. Economic justifications are given for supporting or opposing government export promotion programs and policies, with some advocating for free market efficiency in allocation. Economic theory suggests that free markets determine resource allocation efficiently based on supply and demand. Market failures can lead to inefficient allocation, necessitating government intervention to promote economic efficiency. Imperfect information, spillovers, and imperfect competition are cited as reasons for government export promotion programs. Debate centers on whether market failures have occurred and the effectiveness of such programs in maximizing living standards. Export promotion programs aim to correct market failures by directing resources efficiently towards boosting exports, improving living standards, and increasing output and employment. Supporters believe in the benefits of these policies, while opponents argue that they may interfere with market efficiency and favor certain firms over others. Export promotion programs are criticized for favoring certain firms, reducing efficiency, and lowering national living standards. Critics question why exporting firms receive assistance over others, suggesting that domestic demand stimulation may be more effective. Market failures need to be addressed to improve economic efficiency, with global macroeconomic policies, growth rates, trade policies, and exchange rates playing a significant role in determining U.S. trade exports. Foreign countries' export promotion programs also impact the economic debate on export promotion. Critics question the effectiveness of foreign countries' export promotion programs and their impact on U.S. exports. Some economists believe that these programs have little overall effect on U.S. exports, but certain policies may harm specific industries. Congressional debate on U.S. export promotion has intensified with the introduction of the NEI, with concerns about trade barriers and intellectual property rights overseas. Efforts to ensure foreign compliance with trade agreements and negotiation of new FTAs are seen as ways to boost U.S. exports. Some argue for addressing U.S. export barriers like export controls on dual-use products. Others suggest encouraging countries heavily reliant on exports to focus on increasing domestic consumption for future economic growth. The effectiveness of export promotion programs is often evaluated based on their direct impact on U.S. exports. The impact of federal export assistance on export and employment levels is often assessed through export promotion programs. However, measuring this impact can be challenging due to imprecise data and reliance on estimates from U.S. companies. Changes in exports and employment levels from federal export support are marginal, making it difficult to accurately measure the effects. Without relevant information on marginal changes, using industry average data for federal export promotion activities can lead to less precise estimates of impact on export and employment levels. Determining the opportunity cost of federal government export assistance is challenging as it draws resources from the economy that could be used for other purposes. It is also difficult to ascertain if sales of exports and resulting employment attributed to federal support would have occurred without it. For example, firms may have used private sector services and financing for exports if federal export financing was not available. The introduction of the NEI has raised questions about the effectiveness of federal export promotion efforts in boosting U.S. exports and supporting jobs. While federal government support may help increase exports and employment, various factors like domestic and global economic conditions play a significant role. It is challenging to determine the exact impact of federal export assistance on export values and employment levels. Other countries tend to have more consolidated export promotion efforts compared to the U.S. In 2011, President Obama called for reorganizing federal government agencies involved in trade and competitiveness to improve efficiency. This included a review by the Office of Management and Budget to identify areas of overlap, duplication, and potential cost savings. Congress has also debated proposals for reorganizing federal functions in these areas. Congress has debated proposals to reorganize the federal government's trade policy structure, including consolidating export-related programs under one agency for better coordination. Past initiatives aimed to eliminate duplicative functions and enhance export promotion efforts. The Center for American Progress proposed trade reorganization to create a Department of Business, Trade, and Technology by combining relevant agencies within the Department of Commerce with other trade- and business-focused agencies and offices. This would facilitate a more coherent, unified message on U.S. trade policy goals and priorities. Supporters argue that aligning agencies' work and reducing duplicative programs can lead to cost savings and better outcomes for the public. Critics, however, fear that such proposals could result in the creation of a large, costly federal bureaucracy and may not address the specific needs of certain exporters. Enacting major structural reforms to merge trade agencies may face political challenges due to jurisdictional issues among federal government agencies. Congressional committees may be reluctant to agree to changes that could impact their jurisdiction. Efforts to reorganize export functions could lead to turf battles among agencies, hindering interagency consensus. The 112th Congress may address U.S. export promotion policy through oversight hearings on the effectiveness of the NEI. In the 112th Congress, oversight hearings on the effectiveness of the NEI and the role of federal agencies in export promotion are being considered. Legislation related to export promotion issues, such as organizational structure and coordinating mechanisms among federal agencies, has been introduced. The proposed bill 2987 (Berman) aims to enhance federal export promotion efforts by requiring the TPCC to review agency budgets, involve U.S. exporters in strategic planning, empower the TPCC with necessary authority, assess overseas markets every five years, and improve diplomatic efforts to boost exports. H.R. 2988 (Berman) would require the Secretary of Commerce to establish a public directory for foreign buyers to identify U.S. manufacturers and service providers prepared to export clean and efficient energy and environmental products and services, establish a governmental database on foreign sales opportunities in these products, monitor and evaluate U.S. export promotion activities, and compare the effectiveness of these activities with other major trade competitors. H.R. 2072 and S. 1547 would reauthorize Ex-Im Bank through FY2015 with some differences in changes. H.R. 2762 would reauthorize OPIC through FY2015. Supporters of export promotion programs argue that imperfect information hinders U.S. firms from exporting efficiently. Some argue that imperfect information hinders firms from providing export services, such as export financing, due to perceived high risks. Government involvement in promoting exports is seen as efficient in collecting and disseminating information on foreign market trends and trade opportunities. Government involvement in promoting exports provides resources and information on market trends, trade opportunities, and guidelines for exporting. This assistance is especially beneficial for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that may not have the resources to obtain such information on their own. Additionally, government support can help firms respond efficiently to changes in the market, such as increased overseas demand for U.S. commodities. Another justification for government involvement is the potential spillover effects of certain products or technologies on the economy, including the development and diffusion of new technology, improved terms of trade, growth in related industries, increased productivity, and the creation of high-paying jobs. Government intervention in promoting exports, known as \"industrial policy,\" aims to boost exports of specific products and create high-paying jobs. This can involve tied aid to gain market share or promote strategic sectors. Proponents argue that government involvement is necessary for firms to produce critical products that may not be adequately valued in the market. Firms may be less motivated to develop new technology if the benefits to the economy outweigh the benefits obtained through market prices, leading to market failure, especially in high-tech products requiring significant R&D investment. Government intervention through industrial policy aims to help firms recoup investments in R&D by promoting key industries, particularly in high technology, to expand into foreign markets. This strategy is based on the assumption that increased foreign demand will lead to production growth, economies of scale, and efficiency gains. Government intervention through industrial policy aims to promote key industries, particularly in high technology, to expand into foreign markets. This can lead to production growth, economies of scale, and efficiency gains, resulting in the development of new products and innovations. The theory of strategic trade policy suggests that government influence can help determine which products will yield a comparative advantage for a nation's firms, impacting the economy's composition. A strategic trade policy aims to increase world market shares for certain industries by inducing foreign firms to reduce output or refrain from entering the market. This policy assumes that government intervention can lead to higher returns for domestic firms, surpassing the level of subsidies provided. A strategic trade policy aims to increase world market shares for certain industries by inducing foreign firms to reduce output or refrain from entering the market. Some experts suggest focusing on boosting exports of high-technology products to improve a nation's terms of trade and industrial competitiveness. The United States had a positive trade balance in advanced technology products in the 1990s but turned into a deficit in 2002. Experts believe that a focus on such products can enhance U.S. industrial competitiveness in the global marketplace. A successful strategic trade policy involves government intervention to identify and support strategic industries, leading to higher returns for early market entrants. Government assistance to domestic firms can induce foreign firms to exit the market, boosting U.S. industrial competitiveness globally. Government subsidies to domestic firms can lead foreign firms to exit the market or reduce production, increasing U.S. industrial competitiveness. Critics argue that market distortions from imperfect information do not justify government intervention in export promotion programs. Critics argue that government intervention in export promotion programs is unnecessary as U.S. firms are already meeting international market demands based on supply, demand, access to markets, and macroeconomic factors. They believe that export promotion programs will have little impact on firms' ability to sell products overseas. Critics also argue that there is no shortage of export financing or services, as prices are determined by market forces and competition would drive prices down if they were unusually high. Opponents argue that government export promotion programs hinder private-sector involvement by lowering demand and prices of export services. They question the benefits of strategic trade policies and doubt the state's ability to efficiently allocate economic resources compared to market forces. Many economists warn that government assistance to promote key industries may harm the economy by draining resources from other sectors, leading to inefficiency and lack of competitiveness. There is concern that political pressures, rather than economic factors, may influence industry selection, resulting in support for inefficient firms. This could also undermine international support for free trade, potentially leading to subsidy wars among nations. In the long run, subsidy wars among nations could result in economic distortions, reduced international trade, and declining world living standards. International trade rules from the WTO and OECD may help mitigate these risks."
