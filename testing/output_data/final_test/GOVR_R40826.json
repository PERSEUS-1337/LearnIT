    "content": "Congress has broad legislative authority to regulate individuals and businesses, but must avoid enacting bills of attainder, which legislatively determine guilt and punishment without judicial trial, to prevent encroachment on the judicial branch's power. There was controversy over bonuses paid to TARP-funded entities' employees. Proposed bills aimed to tax bonuses retroactively, with rates of 90% or an excise tax of 35%. Concerns were raised about potential bills of attainder targeting specific companies' employees. Congress passed legislation to limit federal funds to ACORN and its affiliates due to election law violations. The 2010 Continuing Appropriation Resolution and Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibited funds to ACORN, which was challenged in court but upheld by the Second Circuit. The Bill of Attainder Clause prohibits Congress from passing legislation that burdens specific individuals or groups without due process. This clause has been invoked successfully only five times in Supreme Court history, with courts generally hesitant to declare laws unconstitutional due to the presumption of legislative legitimacy. The prohibition on bills of attainder is rooted in separation of powers concerns, as it prevents the legislature from assuming judicial powers by pronouncing guilt without a fair trial. The legislature can pass bills of attainder, sentencing individuals without trial based on political necessity. This power is seen as despotic discretion, often driven by fears or suspicions. Bills of attainder historically punished political threats with death, while bills of pains and penalties imposed lesser punishments like banishment or loss of voting rights. The prohibition on bills of pains and penalties, a form of legislative punishment short of death, includes penalties such as banishment, deprivation of voting rights, exclusion from Parliament, or property confiscation. The courts determine if legislation is a bill of attainder based on specificity and punishment criteria, where identifiable individuals are affected and punishment is inflicted. Legislation meets specificity criteria by identifying individuals or groups, or based on past conduct. In United States v. Lovett, Congress passed legislation naming three government employees as subversive and withholding their salaries without a judicial trial. The Supreme Court ruled this as a punishment of named individuals, violating the prohibition on bills of attainder. It is a defense to establish that the statute is not intended to punish but to implement a legitimate regulatory scheme. This analysis may impact the specificity prong of the test. The Court in Nixon v. Administrator of General Services evaluated the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, which required former President Richard Nixon to turn over papers and tape recordings. Nixon argued it was a bill of attainder, but the Court found the statute constitutional despite its specificity. The Court in Nixon v. Administrator of General Services found the statute constitutional despite its specificity, as it served a valid regulatory purpose. The Court questioned whether the statute met the specificity prong of the test, suggesting that any level of specificity, even naming individuals, is acceptable if a rational, non-punitive basis for the legislation can be established. The Court in United States v. Brown invalidated a statute that made it a crime for former members of the Communist Party to serve in a labor union for five years after leaving the party. The Court focused on the fact that withdrawal from the party did not relieve the restriction, rather than on the inclusion of future party members. The Court's decision in United States v. Brown emphasized that withdrawal from the Communist Party did not lift the restriction on serving in a labor union for five years. The specificity requirement is not undermined by the potential addition of future members to the identified group, as long as those identified cannot withdraw. A per se finding of specificity may still fail if the group specified serves a regulatory purpose. The analysis would involve examining the connection between specificity and regulatory purpose, similar to the \"Functional Test.\" Legislation imposing burdensome consequences does not automatically make it an unconstitutional bill of attainder. The Court uses three tests to determine if legislation is \"punitive.\" The Supreme Court uses three tests to determine if legislation is \"punitive\": historical, functional, and motivational. Historically, punishments like capital punishment, fines, and property confiscation have been associated with bills of attainder. The courts are cautious about expanding the historical test further. The Second Circuit rejected the argument that denial of federal benefits is a form of punishment traditionally used by legislatures. The Supreme Court indicated that legislative burdens not traditionally associated with bills of attainder could still function as punishment. The severity of the burden imposed would determine if it serves a non-punitive legislative purpose. Legislative acts that inflict punishment without a judicial trial on named individuals or easily identifiable group members are considered bills of attainder and are prohibited by the Constitution. In United States v. Lovett, a statute prohibiting specified individuals from receiving federal salary was struck down as a bill of attainder, violating the Constitution. The statute targeted federal government employees deemed \"subversives\" by Congress, leading to a denial of financial benefits. The Court found that a statute barring certain individuals from federal employment was unconstitutional as it amounted to a bill of attainder. The legislation targeted individuals deemed \"subversives\" by Congress, preventing them from holding any government position indefinitely. Congressional proceedings surrounding the legislation included statements labeling the individuals as unfit for government roles and discussions of their guilt. The Court in Lovett held that the denial of federal employment rights was unconstitutional as a bill of attainder, citing previous cases where bans on specific professions were deemed punitive. Legislation targeting identifiable groups may be justified for regulatory purposes, but must be carefully analyzed for punitive intent. In Flemming v. Nestor, the Court upheld termination of Social Security benefits for deported individuals, stating that Congress had the authority to determine the purposes of the program. Judicial inquiries into Congressional motives are cautioned against, with a presumption of constitutionality for legislative enactments. The enactment in question in Flemming v. Nestor was part of the Social Security program, making punitive intent less clear. The duration of the burden imposed by legislation can be relevant in a bill of attainder analysis. For example, if the burden is short-term, Congress may have acted quickly with the expectation of more comprehensive legislation in the future. In SeaRiver Maritime Financial Holdings, Inc. v. Mineta, the Ninth Circuit suggested that quick resolution of regulatory concerns may require specific measures. The case involved the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, leading to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 which excluded the Exxon Valdez from operating in Prince William Sound. The Ninth Circuit found that the Oil Pollution Act excluded the Exxon Valdez for regulatory purposes, not punishment, as it aimed to protect the environment in Prince William Sound by establishing programs for spill recovery and monitoring. The Ninth Circuit found that the exclusion of the Exxon Valdez from Prince William Sound was consistent with the legislative purpose of the Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Demonstration Program, as it posed a greater risk due to its spill history. This case was compared to the Nixon case, where a similar exclusion was deemed not a bill of attainder. The Exxon Valdez case, like the Nixon case, involved legislative action to address specific situations. Congress passed legislation in both cases to prevent future incidents, such as oil spills or the loss of historical documents. The courts considered the need for quick legislative action and the establishment of a \"legitimate class of one\" in both cases. Additionally, the courts looked at the legislative history to determine if the legislation was punitive. The Court is cautious about relying solely on legislative history to determine punitive intent. It is unclear what information beyond legislative history should be considered. Extensive legislative history may indicate punitive intent, as seen in remarks made during the consideration of taxing employee bonuses of TARP recipients. Many remarks suggested a retrospective application based on moral concerns. Some comments in legislative history may suggest punitive intent, such as in bills targeting ACORN. However, the courts have found that a few remarks are not enough to prove punitive motivation. It can be challenging to determine when evidence of punitive intent in legislative history is sufficient to establish an unconstitutional bill of attainder."
