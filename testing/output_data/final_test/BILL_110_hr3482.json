    "content": "The \"Same Number Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. It introduces voice service number portability under section 715 of the Communications Act of 1934. The Same Number Act of 2007 mandates voice service providers to offer number portability, with standards set by the Commission within 270 days. Providers must port numbers efficiently and use a uniform process with minimal customer information required. The Commission sets standards for number portability, requiring providers to complete port requests promptly, prohibit deactivation for 48 hours post-port, and encourage automation. Flexibility is allowed for simple vs. complex ports, with waivers granted for unreasonable compliance costs. The Commission establishes timeframes for number portability and requires providers to report annually on their porting activity, including failed ports and explanations for delays. The Commission mandates annual reporting on number portability performance standards for voice service providers, with a sunset clause after 60 months. Additionally, the Commission is authorized to designate impartial entities for numbering administration. The Commission oversees telecommunications numbering to ensure equitable availability. It has exclusive jurisdiction over the North American Numbering Plan in the US. Costs for numbering administration are shared among providers. 9-1-1 is designated as the universal emergency telephone number. The Commission designates 9-1-1 as the universal emergency telephone number in the United States for reporting emergencies and requesting assistance, applicable to both wireline and wireless services.
