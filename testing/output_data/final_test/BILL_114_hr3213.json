    "content": "The \"Fixed Asset Relief Act of 2015\" may be cited as the short title. Bonus depreciation has been increased to 100 percent and made permanent. The \"Fixed Asset Relief Act of 2015\" increases bonus depreciation to 100 percent and makes it permanent for qualified property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term 'qualified property' excludes property eligible for the alternative depreciation system, with exceptions and special rules. Special rules apply to sale-leasebacks and syndication of property for depreciation purposes. If property is sold and leased back within 3 months of being placed in service, it is treated as placed in service on the date it is used under the leaseback. Syndication rules apply to property originally placed in service by the lessor and sold within 3 months. Syndication rules apply to property sold within 3 months, as long as the user remains the same. Coordination with section 280F for automobiles is also considered. In the case of a passenger automobile defined in section 280F(d)(5) as qualified property, the Secretary increases the limitation under section 280F(a)(1)(A)(i) by $8,000. This deduction affects the computation of any recapture amount under section 280F(b)(2) and includes an inflation adjustment for taxable years after 2015. The deduction for alternative minimum taxable income is determined by multiplying a dollar amount by the automobile price inflation adjustment for the calendar year, with rounding to the nearest multiple of $100 if necessary. The deduction for qualified property under section 167 is determined without adjustments under section 56. Effective after December 31, 2014."
