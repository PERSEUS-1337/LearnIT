The Act titled the \"Second Generation Biofuel Producer Tax Credit Act of 2009\" provides a credit for second generation biofuel producers based on the BTU content of the fuel. The applicable amount is determined by the ratio of the BTU content of the biofuel to ethanol. The Secretary will prescribe a table listing second generation biofuel types and their BTU content. For second generation biofuel that is alcohol, the applicable amount determined under clause (i) will be reduced by the alcohol credit amount. Expansion of Qualified Fuels includes amendments to section 40(b)(6)(E)(i) of the Code, specifying that qualified fuels must be derived solely from qualified feedstocks. Subparagraphs (F) and (G) are redesignated within section 40(b) to accommodate these changes. The Code is amended to redefine qualified feedstock as lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter available on a renewable basis, and cultivated algae, cyanobacteria, or lemna. Section 40 of the Code is updated to replace \"cellulosic biofuel\" with \"second generation biofuel\".
