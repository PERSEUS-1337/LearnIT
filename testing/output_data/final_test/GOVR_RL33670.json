    "content": "The terrorist attacks of September 11 led to restrictions on public access to government information for homeland security. Confidential business information from critical infrastructure owners is crucial for security efforts. New confidentiality protections were implemented to prevent disclosure of security-related information under FOIA. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Maritime Transportation Security Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act exempt certain security-related information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. These statutes are examples of FOIA exemption 3 statutes, prohibiting the disclosure of specific information. The protection of security-related information has evolved from various laws, regulations, and executive orders. This report does not cover classified national security information. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) applies to executive branch records, regulating disclosure of government information. Agencies must publish certain records in the Federal Register and make others available for public inspection. Most federal agency records can be requested under the FOIA, with exemptions for nine categories of information. Exemptions allow withholding of requested information, but if not exempt, records must be disclosed upon request. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires disclosure of non-exempt records, with agencies obligated to provide any segregable portion of a record after removing exempt material. Disputes over access to records can be reviewed in federal court, with agencies burdened to justify withholding. Executive Order 13392 aims to enhance FOIA operations and mandates specific reporting requirements for federal agencies. Order 13392 mandates federal agencies to improve FOIA operations and appoint Chief FOIA Officers. Exemption 4 of FOIA protects trade secrets and confidential commercial information. The D.C. Circuit established a two-part test for determining confidentiality of commercial information in National Parks and Conservation Association v. Morton. In 1992, the D.C. Circuit limited the scope of National Parks to cases involving FOIA requests for commercial or financial information required by the Government. The court set a new test for confidentiality of voluntarily submitted information, exempting it from disclosure if not customarily released to the public. Lower federal courts have applied this distinction, but it has not been widely adopted. The level of protection for vulnerability assessments or site security plans depends on whether submission is voluntary or required. The level of protection for commercial or financial information under exemption 4 depends on whether submission is voluntary or required. Separate confidentiality protections exist for security-related information under other federal statutes, such as the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) which require submission, while the Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) provides protections for voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure information. Regulations for sensitive security information under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) designate 16 categories of sensitive security information. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) designates 16 categories of sensitive security information, including information submitted voluntarily or pursuant to a requirement. These statutes fall under FOIA exemption 3, allowing agencies to withhold information prohibited by other federal statutes. Congress has the authority to define what information can be withheld under this exemption, recognizing that some situations do not fit the general mold of FOIA releases. Exemption 3 of FOIA allows Congress to designate certain documents as confidential, not the agency. To qualify for exemption 3 status, a separate federal statute must require nondisclosure without discretion or establish specific criteria for withholding. If the statute meets these criteria and the information falls within its scope, it is exempt from disclosure. The agency must demonstrate that a statute requires or authorizes withholding documents under exemption 3 of FOIA. The scope of the statute must be examined to determine if it qualifies as a withholding statute, with Chevron rule applying to resolve ambiguities. Substantial weight is given to an agency's claim of exemption 3 status. Exemption 3 of FOIA has two subparts. Subpart (A) requires an absolute mandate in the statute to withhold information. Subpart (B) allows agency discretion on whether to disclose or withhold information. The agency must show that the information falls under its statutory authority and that the statute mandates non-disclosure. Exemption 3 of FOIA has two subparts. Subpart (A) mandates withholding information, while subpart (B) allows agency discretion in disclosure. The statute must provide specific criteria for withholding to qualify under subpart (B), ensuring that the agency's discretion is limited by clear standards set by Congress. Congress has enacted exemption 3 statutes containing disclosure prohibitions specifically directed toward the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Agencies often rely on these statutes for withholding information without a judicial determination. The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 require agencies to list the exemption 3 statutes they rely on in their annual FOIA reports. Several exemption (b)(3) statutes are used by DHS components to withhold security-related information in their annual FOIA reports. These statutes include provisions for critical infrastructure information, maritime industry vulnerability assessments, maritime security plans, and transportation security activities. The Environmental Protection Agency also cites the Safe Drinking Water Act to withhold vulnerability assessments from community water systems. The U.S. Coast Guard administers exemption 3 statutes as well. The MTSA requires ports and facilities to perform vulnerability assessments and develop security plans. Information developed under this statute is not required to be disclosed to the public, covering facility security plans, vessel security plans, and port vulnerability assessments. The reach of this requirement can be broad, including chemical facilities located within ports. The ATSA transferred responsibility for protecting certain vital transportation security information to the TSA. Regulations prohibit disclosure of sensitive security information if it invades personal privacy, reveals trade secrets, or jeopardizes transportation safety. The SDWA, amended by the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, requires community water systems to conduct vulnerability assessments and submit them to the EPA. Information provided to the EPA for these assessments is exempt from disclosure under the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (CIIA) addresses how the Department of Homeland Security can obtain, use, and share critical infrastructure information to protect assets. It promotes information sharing between the private and public sectors while establishing limitations on disclosure. Key definitions include critical infrastructure information, covered federal agency, voluntary, and express statement. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (CIIA) defines critical infrastructure as systems and assets vital to the US, with information related to their security being protected. This information is not typically public and includes threats or attacks on these systems. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 defines critical infrastructure as systems vital to the US, with protected information related to security, including threats or attacks on these systems. It encompasses interference, compromise, or incapacitation of critical infrastructure by physical or computer-based attacks that violate laws, harm commerce, or threaten public health and safety. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems in the US, with protected information related to security, including threats or attacks. It covers interference, compromise, or incapacitation by physical or computer-based attacks that violate laws, harm commerce, or threaten public health and safety. The CIIA defines a covered federal agency as the Department of Homeland Security, with voluntary submission of critical infrastructure information to DHS. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems in the US, with protected information related to security, including threats or attacks. To obtain protection under the CIIA, submissions must be accompanied by an express statement of expectation of protection from disclosure. This can be done through a written marking on written information or records, or a written statement for oral information. Information excluded from protection includes filings with other regulatory bodies or used in licensing determinations. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 requires a written statement to be submitted within a reasonable time after oral communication. Section 214 of the CIIA provides protections for critical infrastructure information voluntarily shared with the Department of Homeland Security, ensuring against disclosure. Section 214(a)(1) of the Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) exempts critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to a covered Federal agency from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. This provision operates as a new \"Exemption 3 statute\" under FOIA, providing protections for critical infrastructure information shared for security purposes. Section 214(a)(1)(A) of the Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) mandates that critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to the DHS must not be disclosed under FOIA. Section 214(a)(1)(B) states that Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) is not subject to agency rules or judicial doctrine on ex parte communications. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs ex parte communications in agency proceedings, defining them as oral or written communications not on the public record without prior notice to all parties. APA's Section 556(e) emphasizes that formal agency adjudications should be based solely on the record evidence. The \"exclusiveness of record\" principle in agency proceedings ensures fairness by prohibiting ex parte communications. Any such communication must be disclosed and summarized on the public record according to Section 557(d)(1) of the APA. Section 214(a)(1)(C) of the CIIA prohibits the direct use of protected critical infrastructure information without written consent. This exclusion applies to civil actions but not to regulatory or enforcement actions by governmental entities. Public interest groups are concerned about the broad provision in Section 214(a)(1)(D) of the CIIA, which could shield owners and operators from liability under various laws. This section prohibits the unauthorized use or disclosure of critical infrastructure information by U.S. officers or employees, except for specific purposes such as investigation of criminal acts or disclosure to Congress. The President's signing statement on the Homeland Security Act of 2002 clarified that this provision does not impose any independent requirement. Section \u00a7 214(a)(1)(E) of the CIIA exempts critical infrastructure information from FOIA and prohibits its disclosure to state or local governments under their own laws, preempting state freedom of information laws. This provision aligns with the President's authority to withhold information that could harm foreign relations, national security, or the Executive's duties. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) protects critical infrastructure information from disclosure under state or local laws and prohibits its use for purposes other than protection or criminal investigations. It guards against waiving privileges like trade secret protection and exempts communication to DHS from the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The CIIA allows ISAOs to share information with DHS for critical infrastructure protection without being subject to FACA requirements. The CIIA allows ISAOs to share critical infrastructure information with DHS for protection without FACA requirements. Section 214(c) allows Federal entities to obtain this information separately and use it in any action. The CIIA does not restrict others from obtaining or using this information. Prior to this, critical infrastructure information would have likely fallen under exemption 4 of FOIA. The CIIA allows ISAOs to share critical infrastructure information with DHS without FACA requirements. Section 214(e) requires the Secretary of DHS to establish procedures for handling this information within 90 days. The Secretary must consult with the National Security Council and the Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish uniform procedures. Section 214(f) contains additional provisions. Section 214(f) of the CIIA makes it a criminal offense for any federal employee to disclose critical infrastructure information protected from disclosure without proper legal authorization. Violators may face fines, imprisonment up to 1 year, and removal from office under title 18 of the United States Code. The CIIA authorizes the federal government to issue advisories, alerts, and warnings about threats to critical infrastructure. The Act prohibits the disclosure of protected information by federal employees, with penalties including fines, imprisonment, and removal from office. The Department of Homeland Security has finalized procedures for handling protected information. The Department of Homeland Security issued a final rule for handling Protected Critical Infrastructure Information, effective September 1, 2006. This rule governs the procedures for receiving, storing, and using critical infrastructure information submitted voluntarily. It applies to federal agencies, government contractors, and other entities handling protected information under the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. The 1974 Security Act delegated transportation security authority to various DOT agencies, including the FAA, to prohibit disclosure of sensitive information to protect personal privacy, trade secrets, and air travel safety. FAA regulations established SSI as a category of protected information. After the 1974 Security Act delegated transportation security authority to DOT agencies, including the FAA, regulations established SSI as protected information related to airport and air carrier security programs. Post-9/11, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act created new security mandates and established the TSA under DOT, transferring aviation security responsibility to the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security, including protection of SSI. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) transferred SSI classification authority to TSA, expanding the categories of information that can be classified as SSI to include all modes of transportation. Initially, regulations simply transferred aviation security regulations, including SSI authority, from the FAA to TSA. The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security was given ultimate responsibility for carrying out the statute, with other DOT administrators overseeing different modes of transportation. In 2002, Congress enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, expanding the scope of SSI to include all modes of transportation. The MTSA requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a National Maritime Transportation Security Plan, identify vulnerable areas, and implement security plans for vessels and facilities to deter security incidents. The MTSA prohibits the disclosure of security plans and assessments to the public. Congress also transferred TSA's SSI classification authority to the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 required TSA to be maintained as a distinct entity within the Department under the Under Secretary for Border Transportation. This requirement expired in 2004. Other agencies like the Coast Guard and the Secret Service were also transferred as distinct entities to DHS, but without sunset provisions. The Act also amended TSA's authority to prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of certain security information. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 amended TSA's authority to prohibit disclosure of sensitive information, including personal privacy, trade secrets, and transportation security. It also prohibited the transfer of this authority to other government entities without authorization. The Act broadened the scope of sensitive security information (SSI) by aligning DOT's authority with TSA's, with the only difference being DOT's authority to protect transportation safety. Congress expanded the scope of SSI authority to include all transportation-related activities, such as air and maritime cargo, trucking, freight transport, and pipelines. TSA and DOT jointly issued revised SSI regulations in response to this expanded authority, incorporating the Homeland Security Act language and former SSI provisions. TSA expanded SSI regulations to cover maritime security information due to a lack of legal framework in the MTSA. This led to legal controversies and litigation since 2001. The legal controversies surrounding TSA baggage screeners have led to criminal and civil litigation in federal court, with concerns about the public disclosure of SSI. More than a dozen reported decisions involve procedural requirements for SSI use and disclosure, including two criminal prosecutions where the government withheld information citing SSI protection. The court decided a case involving SSI without addressing the statute or government claims to protection. Courts use various procedures for civil actions involving SSI, such as ex parte, in camera reviews. In Gordon v. F.B.I, the government resisted disclosing SSI information in a Freedom of Information Act suit. The District Court ordered the government to produce withheld evidence for review. The court ordered the government to review all withheld information and provide a detailed affidavit explaining the exemptions. The plaintiffs argued that TSA had not provided enough detail about the withheld information, but the court disagreed after reviewing the redacted SSI material. In another case, Jifry v. FAA, alien pilots had their airmen certificates revoked due to security risks. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the revocation of airmen certificates for alien pilots deemed security risks. The use of \"ex parte, in camera judicial review\" was considered sufficient procedural protection. SSI exemptions have been analyzed under the Freedom of Information Act, allowing for information withholding. The government must provide a \"Vaughn Index\" when responding to FOIA requests. The government is required to submit a Vaughn Index, describing withheld documents and reasons for exemption from disclosure. Courts have reviewed the sufficiency of explanations for SSI exemptions with mixed results. In one case, the court found the government's explanation for withholding a document lacking, stating that a more adequate description is needed to justify the exemption. In a case where the government withheld documents under exemption 3, the court ordered a more detailed Vaughn Index to justify the exemption. In another case, the court found that the government's revised Vaughn Index and supporting documents adequately established that the documents were properly withheld under exemption 3. Based on reported cases, the government's ability to withhold information under SSI depends on the adequacy of explanations provided through Vaughn Index and supporting documentation. Alternative procedures have been used, such as ordering recommended security procedures, filing redacted motions under seal, advising on appeals, and having TSA attorneys present at depositions to protect SSI."
