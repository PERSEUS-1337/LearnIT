    "content": "The increasing complexity and automation of flight control systems present challenges to federal policy on aircraft certification and pilot training. Pilot confusion with cockpit automation has been linked to accidents. Recent high-profile incidents led to the grounding of Boeing 737 Max aircraft worldwide, prompting inquiries into cockpit interface design, safety standards for aircraft systems, and certification processes. The certification process for new aircraft technologies involves fault detection, fault tolerance, and redundancy. Modern jet airliners heavily rely on automated features to assist pilots and prevent dangerous situations. Pilot confusion with cockpit automation has led to accidents, raising concerns about the evaluation and certification of new flight control system designs. The grounding of the Boeing 737 Max has sparked discussions on aircraft certification practices, pilot training standards, and aviation safety. The focus is on challenges in systems design, risk analysis, human-interface design, pilot training, and oversight of certification processes. These issues are now part of a global policy debate. The safety record of commercial airlines operating transport category airplanes is excellent, with low accident rates globally. The recent safety record of U.S. air carriers has shown significant improvement compared to the 1990s, which saw a higher number of accidents. The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 prioritized safety over promoting air commerce, established legal protections for safety reporting programs, and led to the creation of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security after the TWA flight 800 crash. The Gore Commission urged policymakers to make aviation safety a national priority and set a goal of reducing accidents by a factor of five within a decade. The Gore Commission recommended re-engineering the FAA's regulatory and certification programs to reduce accidents by a factor of five within a decade. This included establishing standards for safety improvement, developing certification tools for new technologies, emphasizing human factors and training, and creating standard safety databases. The Gore Commission recommended re-engineering FAA's regulatory and certification programs to reduce accidents. Commercial airline safety in the US improved post-report despite major accidents in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Notable accidents included American Airlines crash in 1999, Alaska Airlines crash in 2000, and American Airlines flight 587 crash in 2001. Commercial aviation safety data since 2002 show significant improvement compared to the 1990s. Commercial aviation safety data since 2002 has shown marked improvement, especially among major U.S. airlines. In the 2000s, regional airlines saw six accidents with passenger fatalities, mainly due to human factors affecting flight crews. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 was enacted following a fatal crash near Buffalo in 2009. The Extension Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-216) mandated new regulations for pilots, requiring 1,500 hours of total flight time to be a first officer and an additional 1,000 hours for captaincy. The legislation also directed improvements in airline training programs, flight time rules, and safety management. After a fatal crash in 2009, U.S. air carriers went over nine years without another passenger fatality until an incident in 2018. In 2018, a passenger was killed in a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 engine failure incident. Recent U.S. air carrier accidents have been linked to inflight turbulence. Low domestic air carrier accident rates have made it challenging to identify trends. Worldwide aviation safety metrics show improvements in commercial flight safety. Fatal accident rates for commercial airliners have significantly decreased globally, from 4.2 per million flights in 1977 to less than 0.4 per million flights in 2017. However, safety concerns persist in regions like Africa and the Asia-Pacific, where accident rates are more than five times the worldwide average. The Asia-Pacific region has the highest number of airline accidents and fatalities, with lax regulatory oversight and poor flight crew performance identified as primary contributors. Worldwide commercial airline safety has been scrutinized following high-profile crashes involving the Boeing 737 Max variant in 2018 and 2019. The grounding of the worldwide fleet of Boeing 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 raised concerns about FAA's certification process and aircraft type certification practices. Aviation safety experts acknowledge advancements in technology but also recognize that these advancements have been implicated in some aviation accidents. Flight control systems on aircraft analyze pilot inputs, aircraft states, and environmental factors to maneuver safely and efficiently. Autopilot or manual flying modes use displays like a flight director to achieve desired flight states. These systems enhance safety during flight. The complexity of modern cockpits can challenge pilots, leading to errors and confusion, especially in high-workload situations. Errors, if undetected or compounded, can result in serious incidents or accidents. Common causes of commercial jet accidents include loss of control in flight and controlled flight into terrain, often due to incomplete pilot awareness and human errors interacting with complex aircraft systems. Pilots need advanced training to understand complex aircraft systems, including fly-by-wire technology introduced by Airbus in the A320. Fly-by-wire systems use sensors to provide data to flight control computers, which then operate the flight controls. Fly-by-wire technology in aircraft connects computers to actuators for flight controls and displays for pilot information. Advantages include reduced weight from fewer mechanical parts, added redundancies through multiple sensors and flight computers, with triple redundancy common in systems. Flight data computers continuously monitor pilot inputs and aircraft sensor data, cross-checking for anomalies and incorporating flight control laws to simplify pilot training and ensure consistency in aircraft performance across different models. This design approach saves airlines time and money in pilot training for new aircraft. Fly-by-wire systems simplify pilot training by minimizing differences in aircraft control and protecting the aircraft within safe operational limits defined by its flight envelope. The flight envelope includes performance limitations and design capabilities related to aircraft attitude, airspeed, and aerodynamic loads. Logic in the flight control computer systems prevents maneuvers that could exceed these safe operational conditions. The flight envelope protection logic involves continuous monitoring of the aircraft's state with respect to factors like weight, center-of-gravity, airspeed, altitude, and winds. Flight control computers analyze data from various sensors such as airspeed sensors, angle-of-attack indicators, inertial units, gyroscopes, accelerometers, altimeters, and temperature sensors to ensure safe operation within the aircraft's flight envelope. Engine thrust, fuel flow, and other engine performance parameters are also monitored. The flight control computers monitor various engine performance parameters, aircraft configuration, and pilot inputs to control the airplane. Depending on whether the airplane is on autopilot or manually flown, the computers adjust settings like altitude, heading, airspeed, and climb/descent rates. The flight control computers provide information to guide pilots, with flight envelope protections overriding unsafe actions. In certain situations, protections may be disabled, giving pilots more direct control. Understanding these systems is crucial for safety in highly automated cockpits. The design of fly-by-wire systems and highly automated cockpits has raised concerns for over two decades. A study by the FAA in 1996 focused on interfaces between flight crews and automated aircraft systems, prompted by a crash in 1994 due to inadvertent activation of autothrottle during landing approach. The autothrottle software was not upgraded to disengage with certain manual inputs, causing confusion for pilots familiar with different systems. The FAA found that pilots often lacked understanding of automated systems, leading to issues with flight crew situation awareness. Recommendations were made for design, pilot training, and communication to improve safety. The FAA revised certification requirements for flight guidance systems in 2006, including quick disengagement controls for autopilot and autothrust functions. Automated systems must avoid unsafe speeds or attitudes, and controls must be labeled clearly to minimize errors. Flight crews must be trained in awareness, communication, and coordination for safety enhancements. The interface between pilots and automated flight guidance systems remains a critical issue in commercial aviation safety, despite efforts to address human factors. This issue was highlighted in the Air France flight 447 crash in 2009, where all 228 on board were killed. The wreckage was found at a depth of 13,000 feet, prompting a detailed investigation. The investigation into the Air France flight 447 crash found that icing on the airplane's pitot tubes caused airspeed measurement inconsistencies, leading to autopilot disconnection and flight control logic switching to an alternate law mode. The pilots' inappropriate control inputs destabilized the airplane, resulting in an aerodynamic stall that went undetected. Several factors contributed to the crew's failure to recover from the stall. Investigators identified factors contributing to the confusion and lack of response by the flight crew of Air France flight 447, including the absence of clear cockpit displays for airspeed inconsistencies, transient stall warnings, and difficulty in recognizing control law shifts. Aviation experts warned of the dangers of complex automated flight controls. In a separate incident on July 6, 2013, an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 descended below the visual approach path and crashed into a seawall at San Francisco International Airport, tearing the fuselage in two. The crash at San Francisco International Airport involved a Boeing 777 that descended short of the runway, resulting in fatalities and serious injuries. The NTSB determined that issues with the autopilot and autothrottle systems, along with inadequate training and documentation, contributed to the accident. The flight crew's interaction with the systems led to a situation where the autothrottle no longer controlled the airspeed. The NTSB made recommendations to improve flight crew understanding of the Boeing 777 autothrottle system after a crash involving a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport. The crash was attributed to issues with the autopilot and autothrottle systems, inadequate training, and documentation. The flight crew's interaction with the systems led to a situation where the autothrottle no longer controlled the airspeed. The angle-of-attack sensor discrepancies led to multiple nose-down trim commands during the accident flight, similar to the Ethiopian Airlines crash. The vertical stabilizer moved to a full nose-down position, causing the airplane to go into a steep dive. The left angle-of-attack sensor showed a high pitch, while the right sensor reported normal variations. The aircraft received automatic nose-down trim commands, leading to a steep descent. Following the Boeing 737 Max crashes, authorities grounded the planes for investigation. FAA announced anticipated design changes after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Boeing 737 Max aircraft faced design changes due to flight control system issues, leading to an emergency grounding by the FAA in March 2019. Concerns revolve around high angle-of-attack conditions and reliance on a single sensor for detection. Designers had to adapt due to larger engines, which could pitch the aircraft under certain conditions. Boeing introduced the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) to counteract pitch-up events caused by high engine power on the 737 Max aircraft. The system relies on angle-of-attack data from one sensor, leading to concerns after the Lion Air crash. The FAA issued an emergency directive for U.S. operators to address uncommanded pitch-down events. The MCAS system on the Boeing 737 Max was designed to address pitch-up events caused by high engine power, using angle-of-attack data from a single sensor. Following concerns after the Lion Air crash, the FAA expanded the airworthiness directive to address uncommanded pitch-down events triggered by erroneous high angle-of-attack indications. The MCAS control laws were separate from other flight control laws in the aircraft's air data computers, operating as a federated systems architecture with its own unique functions. The MCAS system on the Boeing 737 Max was designed to address pitch stability issues by using angle-of-attack data from sensors. It is suspected that the MCAS engaged due to faulty sensor data on both Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, causing the system to repeatedly command a nose-down pitch trim in response to erroneous nose-high attitude indications. The Boeing 737 Max grounding led to engineering work focusing on fixes to the MCAS system design. The redesigned system will now rely on two angle-of-attack sensors and perform additional checks for data reasonableness. All 737 Max aircraft will have angle-of-attack sensor disagree warnings to alert pilots of potential issues. The MCAS control logic is being revised to limit potential errors. The MCAS control logic is being revised to limit nose-down stabilizer trim commands on the Boeing 737 Max. The redesigned system will not reset after pilot inputs and will not trim the nose down to close to limits. Broader inquiries are being made into the certification process for the aircraft. The FAA is following a thorough process for returning the Boeing 737 Max to service. The FAA is working on lifting the prohibition order on the Boeing 737 Max after reviewing the MCAS software update. A technical advisory board is providing recommendations for certifying Boeing's changes. Regulators in other countries are also conducting independent reviews. In April 2019, a multinational Joint Authorities Technical Review was convened to evaluate the aircraft's automated flight control system certification. The Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) is assessing pilots' interaction with the Boeing 737 Max automated flight control systems. Representatives from various countries are participating in the review to enhance regulations and pilot training. The JATR's findings may help establish international consensus on the matter. Additionally, the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General is conducting an audit on the FAA's oversight of the Boeing 737 Max certification process. The Department of Justice has launched a criminal probe into the Boeing 737 Max certification process, expanding to include the Boeing 787 \"Dreamliner.\" The Boeing 787 fleet was grounded in 2013 due to in-flight fires and electrical problems. The grounding of the Boeing 787 in 2013 led to an NTSB investigation into lithium ion batteries and certification processes for new technologies on aircraft. NTSB issued safety recommendations to FAA and Boeing regarding pilot response to uncommanded flight control system events like MCAS activation on the 737 Max. The NTSB recommended that assessments of the 737 Max consider all cockpit alerts and indications for pilot recognition and response, urging changes in certification standards for cockpit designs. They also suggested developing evaluation tools to inform aircraft design certification on pilot response to safety-significant failure conditions, citing incidents like the Air France flight 447 crash and the Boeing 737 Max crashes caused by faulty sensor data. In the Air France flight 447 crash, faulty sensor data led to unreliable airspeed information due to iced-over pitot tubes. Researchers suggest using GPS sensor readings and computer models to detect anomalies in airspeed data. Advances in sensor fusion can improve sensor fault detection and flight control system recovery techniques. Automation-related aviation accidents have highlighted complex human-systems interaction issues. Research shows that piloting skills decline when flying highly automated aircraft. Studies have shown that pilots may struggle to understand and effectively operate automated features in the cockpit, leading to concerns about their ability to take over and safely maneuver the aircraft in case of automation failure. Different air carriers and pilots use various automated features and modes based on their operational needs and preferences. Some pilots choose to minimize automation to stay engaged and avoid boredom. In response to concerns about pilot proficiency with automated features in the cockpit, the FAA was directed to develop a process for verifying that air carrier flight crew training programs incorporate automated systems monitoring and manual flying skills. This was a result of a 2016 audit that found deficiencies in airline training and proficiency standards related to pilot monitoring capabilities. The Air Carrier Training Aviation Rulemaking Committee, established by FAA in response to NTSB recommendations after the Asiana Airlines flight 214 crash, has made recommendations for pilot training. FAA is incorporating these into airline training programs and considering rulemaking for cockpit interfaces and alerting systems. Aircraft type certification involves reviewing engineering data to certify compliance with regulatory requirements. The FAA Aircraft Certification Service is responsible for certifying new aircraft types and inspecting variants of existing types. This process includes extensive examinations, inspections, engineering tests, and flight tests to ensure safety standards are met before bringing new aircraft or technologies to market. To receive production certification for aircraft design, manufacturers must demonstrate the ability to reproduce the aircraft type reliably. After final assembly, each aircraft undergoes examinations, inspections, and tests to receive airworthiness certification before routine operations can begin. The FAA oversees airworthiness certification and addresses safety deficiencies through continued airworthiness processes involving manufacturers and operators. The FAA oversees aircraft type certification, approves fixes, and issues airworthiness directives for safety concerns. This process may involve hardware replacements or software updates. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency oversees type certification for EU member countries and other European countries. The FAA's Aircraft Certification Service has a staff of about 1,330 engineers and inspectors who oversee product development and airworthiness certification. The FAA oversees aircraft type certification and airworthiness, with a workforce including FAA designees, employees from aircraft organizations, and consultants. Type certificates are typically valid indefinitely, but can be voluntarily surrendered or revoked by the FAA. Technology advancements lead to updates in type-certified airplane designs. The FAA oversees aircraft type certification and airworthiness, with type certificates being updated or amended as technology advances. The FAA determines if a new type certificate or an amended one is needed based on the extent of proposed changes. The Flight Standards Service sets standards for aircraft operations and ensures operators meet them through aircraft evaluation groups. Flight standardization boards are part of these groups. Flight standardization boards are responsible for pilot training standards and requirements for specific aircraft, including type ratings and minimum training recommendations. They may develop Master Difference Requirements tables for variants of an aircraft type to evaluate differences training for pilots transitioning between aircraft. The FAA Advisory Circular 120-53B provides guidance for flight standardization boards on evaluating training requirements for pilots transitioning between similar aircraft types or variants. It sets standards for assessing pilot training programs, including resource and device needs, and encourages manufacturers to include common training elements. The FAA Advisory Circular 120-53B provides guidance for flight standardization boards on evaluating training requirements for pilots transitioning between similar aircraft types or variants, emphasizing the need for pilot understanding of differences and evaluation of operational differences among aircraft in a mixed fleet. The Boeing 737 flight standardization board issued a draft report in 2019 documenting findings on the MCAS system following the Boeing 737 Max grounding. The draft report from the Boeing 737 flight standardization board in 2019 recommended incorporating training on the MCAS system into ground training for pilots, including a description of its functionality, failure conditions, and crew alerting. Training could be computer-based and self-testing may be used for checking. No previous training on the MCAS system had been required by the FAA for Boeing 737 type-rated pilots. The draft report recommended incorporating MCAS system training for Boeing 737 pilots through computer-based instruction or exams. Canada's Transport Minister favored simulator training, but Canadian authorities have not decided on this requirement yet. This has led to speculation about differences between the US and Canada on Boeing 737 Max training. Air Canada is the only North American airline with a 737 Max simulator. Air Canada, the only North American airline with a 737 Max simulator, has already included MCAS scenarios in its training. The Boeing 737 flight standardization board report will be crucial for U.S. air carrier training programs on the 737 Max. Controversies over the grounding of the 737 Max have raised questions about whether other countries will follow FAA training recommendations or impose stricter requirements. The Boeing 737 Max flight standardization board faced controversy over FAA inspector qualifications, with the FAA defending the inspectors' qualifications. Industry advisory groups and standards organizations play a key role in setting industry norms for aircraft design and production certification. Industry advisory groups and standards organizations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and SAE, play a crucial role in setting industry norms for aircraft design and certification. ISO Technical Committee (TC) 20 is responsible for developing international standards for air and space vehicles. SAE International, formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, contributes expertise to ISO TC 20 on aircraft design. The Aerospace Council within SAE addresses various aspects of aircraft design, including avionics and flight controls. SAE Technical Committee S-7 focuses on flight deck design and aircraft handling qualities for transport category aircraft. The Forum for Aeronautical Software is another important industry group for modern aircraft design. The Forum for Aeronautical Software, formed under a partnership between RTCA and EUROCAE, has developed key guidance documents like DO-178C for aviation software development. DO-178C is recognized by FAA Advisory Circular 20-115D as acceptable guidance for meeting type certification requirements for airborne systems. Manufacturers can use alternative means of compliance, but most follow DO-178C or similar documents for certification. RTCA/EUROCAE guidance is a global industry standard for software development and certification in aviation. RTCA/EUROCAE guidance is a global industry standard for developing and certifying software for airborne systems. Companies provide input to FAA rulemaking through advisory groups like the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC), which includes representatives from various aviation stakeholders. The FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) includes representatives from various aviation stakeholders, such as public interest groups, manufacturers, airlines, pilots, and mechanics. FAA convenes rulemaking committees that must adhere to Administrative Procedures Act requirements. Congress supports increased utilization of FAA's delegation and designation authorities to engage design and manufacturing organizations in the aircraft certification process. The FAA relies on delegating certification functions to qualified individuals and entities due to limited resources. Legislative reviews have been sought to assess the efficiency and safety implications of these practices. Private individuals have been involved in aircraft certification processes since the 1920s. In the 1940s, programs were established to appoint designees for product certification approvals in the aviation industry. The FAA expanded this with the designated airworthiness representative (DAR) program in the 1980s, allowing individuals and organizations to perform airworthiness certification functions. These actions were taken under FAA's authority to delegate activities related to aircraft certification. The FAA has the authority to issue certificates to private individuals and organizations, who must adhere to FAA policies. Delegated entities can have their delegation rescinded at any time, and affected parties can petition for reconsideration. The FAA can review actions of delegated entities at any time and make changes if deemed necessary. The Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program, established in 2005, allows FAA to delegate certification functions to organizations like Boeing and Pratt and Whitney. The program changed how FAA oversees aircraft certification activities. The Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee recommended the establishment of Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) in 1998, allowing companies to perform delegated functions for the FAA. The ODA program has expanded over the years, with initiatives to improve and expand it based on recommendations from the certification process committee and mandates from the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted industry support for the ODA program in a 2015 statement. In 2017, the FAA successfully implemented its ODA action plan, expanded delegation under ODA, and developed a scorecard to measure outcomes. Congress expressed support for the ODA framework in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) directed FAA to improve the ODA program, building on reforms from the 2012 FAA reauthorization act. Following the Boeing 737 Max incidents, FAA certification oversight and the ODA program have faced scrutiny. Some view the ODA process as self-certification by manufacturers, but FAA officials disagree. In response to the 2012 law (P.L. 112-95), FAA established two aviation initiatives. The 2012 law (P.L. 112-95) mandated FAA to establish two aviation rulemaking committees to address certification processes and regulatory consistency. Recommendations included expanding delegation under ODA, updating certification regulations, and improving regulatory interpretations. The 2018 FAA act (P.L. 115-254) directed FAA to establish the Safety Oversight and Certification Advisory Committee for policy recommendations on aircraft certification and safety oversight. The 2012 law mandated FAA to establish aviation rulemaking committees for certification processes. The 2018 FAA act directed FAA to establish performance objectives for aircraft certification to increase transparency and accountability. Lawmakers have scrutinized FAA's delegation authorities and questioned aircraft manufacturing practices. The Safety is Not for Sale Act of 2019 aims to address these concerns. The Safety is Not for Sale Act of 2019, introduced by Senator Markey, would require aircraft manufacturers to include safety-enhancing equipment in new aircraft sold to U.S. air carriers at no extra cost. This equipment includes various systems to improve safety and crashworthiness. The legislation also mandates the FAA to establish performance standards for certain indicators and systems on airliners. The relationship between the FAA and manufacturers goes beyond certification functions and the ODA program. The relationship between aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and the FAA extends beyond certification functions and the ODA program. Manufacturers influence industry standards and regulatory changes through participation in committees. They also carry out certification functions on behalf of the FAA, offering their expertise to the safety regulation process. This industry \"self-regulation\" raises concerns about FAA oversight capabilities and resources. Under international air safety agreements, FAA and EASA play crucial roles in certifying passenger airliners worldwide. Boeing and Airbus dominate global sales of commercial jets, with FAA accepting EASA certification for Airbus aircraft and vice versa for U.S.-manufactured planes. The FAA and EASA cooperate on safety matters but may have differing views on safety design. After the Boeing 737 Max grounding, concerns were raised about the FAA's certification processes. FAA, EASA, and other aviation oversight entities have working arrangements for certification and safety oversight activities. FAA may require additional testing for modifications certified by EASA, negotiating details with EASA and the developer. The FAA and EASA may have differing views on safety design, especially in the context of the Boeing 737 Max controversy. Other aviation authorities could require additional design fixes and tests before allowing the resumption of Boeing 737 Max operations. The multinational JATR was created to establish international consensus on these issues, but differing opinions among major aviation safety organizations could impact future cooperation on aircraft certification activities. EASA has already called for an independent review of proposed design changes. EASA has called for an independent review of proposed design changes to the Boeing 737 Max, potentially creating uncertainty for aircraft manufacturers and operators. In the United States, pilots need an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certification, requiring 1,500 hours of flight time. Foreign airlines may hire pilots with little experience through ab initio programs, allowing them to start flying as first officers with around 250 hours of flight time. Questions about pilot experience, especially for first officers with limited flight time, are crucial for aircraft manufacturers to consider when designing cockpit interfaces and training programs for highly automated jet airplanes. The captain of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 had over 8,000 hours of flight experience, while the first officer had less than 400 hours. This raises concerns about how pilots, both experienced and inexperienced, handle non-normal conditions or emergencies and the amount of detailed systems information they should be provided with in such situations. The debate over providing pilots with detailed aircraft systems information has implications for cockpit automation development and pilot training. ICAO sets general training standards, but individual countries determine formal requirements for pilots. The demand for airline pilots in countries with growing air travel has led to some airlines hiring pilots with limited training. The rapid growth in air travel has led to some airlines hiring pilots with limited training and experience to operate passenger flights. International standards for pilot licenses require a minimum of 240 flight hours, much lower than the 1,500 hours required in the United States. The FAA has limited regulatory authority over foreign flight crews and defers to the country of aircraft registry for pilot experience requirements. The FAA has raised concerns about foreign pilots relying too much on cockpit automation and has recommended additional training to prepare them to operate aircraft manually in case of automation failure. In the 1990s, there were several fatal U.S. air carrier accidents, including runway collisions and crashes involving passenger flights. In the 1990s, there were multiple fatal U.S. air carrier accidents, including crashes of turboprops and jets on approach or taking off from various airports across the country. In the 1990s, there were multiple fatal U.S. air carrier accidents involving various aircraft types near different airports across the country. In the 1990s, there were fatal U.S. air carrier accidents involving different aircraft types near various airports across the country, including the crash of American Airlines flight 1420 in Little Rock, AR in June 1999."
