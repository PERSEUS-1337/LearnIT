    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Repeatedly Flooded Communities Preparation Act\" and focuses on community accountability for repetitively flooded areas. The \"Repeatedly Flooded Communities Preparation Act\" amends the National Flood Insurance Act to hold covered communities accountable for repeatedly damaged areas with a high number of repetitive loss structures. The \"Repeatedly Flooded Communities Preparation Act\" requires communities with more than $1,000 in total damages, at least 5 severe repetitive loss structures without mitigation activities, or public/private facilities receiving repair assistance to take action. The Emergency Assistance Act requires covered communities to determine areas with properties prone to flooding events, with defined terms for private nonprofit and public facilities, and severe repetitive loss structures. The Emergency Assistance Act mandates communities to identify flood-prone areas, assess risks, develop mitigation plans, submit them to the Administrator, implement the plans, and comply with relevant regulations. The Emergency Assistance Act requires communities to develop flood risk mitigation plans, which must be made available to the public. Covered communities can incorporate these plans into existing mitigation plans under specific sections of related legislation. The Administrator is tasked with providing data assistance to communities upon request for developing the required plans. The Administrator must provide covered communities with property address and claims data upon request. Mitigation grants may consider community compliance and efforts to address repeatedly flooded areas. The Administrator has the authority to issue sanctions through regulations. The Administrator can impose sanctions on covered communities that fail to comply with reducing flood risks to repeatedly damaged areas, including suspension from the national flood insurance program or probation. Notice must be given before imposing any sanctions. The Administrator can impose sanctions on covered communities for non-compliance with reducing flood risks, including suspension from the national flood insurance program or probation. Notice with recommendations for compliance must be provided before imposing sanctions, taking into account the community's available resources. The Administrator can impose sanctions on covered communities for non-compliance with reducing flood risks, including suspension from the national flood insurance program or probation. Reports to Congress on progress made by covered communities in implementing mitigation plans must be submitted every 2 years. The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must issue regulations within 1 year to implement plans for reducing flood risks in covered communities."
