This approach aims to be competitive with the best meta-learner in continual learning. The curr_chunk discusses the use of stochastic approximation algorithms for optimization in meta-learning, assuming smooth loss functions and strong convexity. The assumptions do not trivialize the meta-learning setting, even for linear regression. Theorem 1 provides conditions for the function evaluated after gradient updates. The curr_chunk discusses optimizing the function after gradient updates with specific step size conditions for smoothness and strong convexity. It highlights the effectiveness of first-order optimization methods in convex settings and the provable optimization of MAML-like objective functions. Additionally, it mentions the inherited regret bound for FTML in comparable settings with strongly convex losses. FTML update procedure with regret guarantee based on smoothness and strong convexity of the function. Multiple gradient steps in the inner loop are beneficial. The algorithm initializes a task buffer before proceeding. The overall algorithmic procedure involves initializing a task buffer and task-specific datasets for each new task. The gradient is iteratively computed and applied using data from all tasks seen so far. Experimental evaluation focuses on vision-based online learning problems, including modifications of MNIST, pose detection with synthetic images, and online image classification with CIFAR-100. The aim is to study the effectiveness of online meta-learning, specifically FTML. The study aims to evaluate online meta-learning (FTML) on multiple non-stationary learning problems and compare it with other algorithms like Train on everything (TOE), Train from scratch, and Joint training with fine-tuning. The evaluation is done on vision-based online learning tasks such as modifications of MNIST, pose detection, and online image classification with CIFAR-100. FTML is compared with TOE in terms of task performance and learning efficiency. TOE can reuse representations across tasks but may struggle with new tasks and negative transfer. FTML with fine-tuning is a natural online learning comparison. In a comparison with TOE, FTML with fine-tuning adapts to each task specifically and benefits from prior data. In a rainbow MNIST experiment, tasks involve classifying digits with different backgrounds, scales, and rotations. FTML outperforms baselines in efficiency and end performance, learning tasks more quickly with each new task. FTL outperforms TOE in task-specific adaptation but is still inferior to FTML. Training independent models is less efficient compared to models incorporating data from other tasks. A new experiment focuses on a 3D pose prediction problem using synthetic images of objects rendered on a table. The experiment using the MuJoCo physics engine involves selecting random 2D locations and azimuthal angles to place objects on a table. Mean-squared error loss functions are used with a proficiency threshold set at 0.05. Results show that meta-learning improves efficiency and performance on new tasks, solving many with only 10 datapoints. TOE outperforms independent task models, indicating effective use of previous data. Online meta-learning shows even better transfer can be achieved by optimizing for quick adaptation. In this paper, the authors introduced the online meta-learning problem statement, aiming to connect meta-learning and online learning. They proposed the FTML algorithm for online meta-learning, showing logarithmic regret. The algorithm was adapted to a practical variant, with experimental evaluations demonstrating its effectiveness. The proposed practical variant of the online meta-learning algorithm outperforms prior methods, with a focus on model agnostic meta-learning and regret-based online learning. Using few-shot learning as an example, the goal is to learn tasks with limited labeled data, emphasizing the broader scope of online learning and meta-learning formulations beyond supervised learning. The goal is to learn tasks with limited labeled data, using a predictive model with parameters w. Minimizing the average loss on the dataset D i is challenging due to its small size, but drawing upon multiple tasks from the family may improve performance, as seen in meta-learning literature. Meta-learning, also known as learning to learn, aims to bootstrap from a set of tasks to learn faster on a new task. Tasks are drawn from a fixed distribution, and datasets are made available to the agent. Meta-learning algorithms like MAML find an initial set of parameters that can be quickly updated to minimize the loss on a new test task with limited labeled data. MAML optimizes for few-shot generalization by solving an optimization problem at meta-training time. Stochastic optimization techniques are used to solve the problem, and at meta-test time, the solution is fine-tuned using the obtained gradient. Meta-learning methods aim to work in a continuous learning fashion and adapt to non-stationary task distributions. In the online learning setting, the learner sequentially decides on model parameters to minimize regret compared to a family of methods. In online learning, the goal is to design algorithms with minimal regret compared to the best fixed model. Follow the leader (FTL) algorithm updates parameters and shows strong performance guarantees. However, joint training approaches like FTL may not always learn effective models in few-shot supervised learning tasks. In online learning, algorithms aim to minimize regret compared to the best fixed model. To address issues with joint training approaches, an adaptive comparator class and low regret algorithms are needed, as seen in online meta-learning. Assumptions are made about loss functions and model parameters, including C2-smoothness and strong convexity. These assumptions are common in online learning, with examples like logistic regression and L2 regression. In online learning, algorithms aim to minimize regret compared to the best fixed model. Assumptions about loss functions and model parameters include C2-smoothness and strong convexity, common in logistic regression and L2 regression. Assumption 1.3 addresses higher order smoothness of functions in non-convex analysis. The performance difference between meta-learning and joint training is evident even with quadratic functions. The FTML algorithm is analyzed with a single step of gradient descent as in MAML. The main theorem states that if function f satisfies certain assumptions and is evaluated after a gradient update, it becomes convex with smoothness and strong convexity properties. The proof involves bounds and norms to show the convexity. If assumptions are met, the function satisfies the properties mentioned. The main theorem proves that the MAML optimization problem is convex, 9\u03b2/8-smooth, and \u00b5/8-strongly convex. This allows for effective optimization using first-order methods. Additionally, FTML now has similar regret guarantees as FTL in comparable settings. FTML update procedure (Eq. 2) is U t (w) = w \u2212 \u03b1\u2207f t (w) with \u03b1 \u2264 min{ 1 2\u03b2 , \u00b5 8\u03c1G }. FTML algorithm is identical to FTL on loss functions {f t } T t=1 with O( performance after 100 datapoints. FTML efficiently learns new tasks with forward transfer, demonstrated in an experimental evaluation using MNIST dataset. Different tasks created with transformed digits. FTML efficiently learns new tasks with forward transfer on the MNIST dataset. Tasks involve classifying digits with different backgrounds, scales, and rotations. FTML outperforms alternative approaches in efficiency and final performance, with learning curves showing quick adaptation to new tasks. In an experiment with 5-way classification tasks on CIFAR-100 dataset, it was observed that training independent models is less efficient compared to models that incorporate data from other tasks. The tasks involve classifying challenging RGB images with different class labels, and performance is measured using classification accuracy. FTML shows efficient task learning with fewer data points compared to models trained from scratch. Adapting all layers rather than just the last layer benefits FTML. Online meta-learning leads to faster learning with more tasks introduced, enabling transfer for faster learning and more effective performance. The results show that FTML learns more efficiently than independent models and a model with a shared feature space. This approach adapts the final layer parameters for each task, leading to faster learning with more tasks introduced. In a 3D pose prediction experiment, FTML outperforms independent models and a shared feature space model. Training from scratch shows good performance with 2000 datapoints, similar to FTML. However, the last layer variant of FTML struggles to achieve good performance on all tasks. The experiment involves predicting global position and orientation of objects in synthetic images using 50 object models from 9 classes.

In another experiment, meta-learning is shown to improve efficiency and performance on new tasks, with TOE outperforming training from scratch by effectively utilizing previous data from other tasks. Our work proposes using meta-learning in the context of online learning to optimize for quickly learning new tasks. Prior work suggests that task-specific fine-tuning can lead to overfitting if not explicitly trained for it. Most meta-learning algorithms assume tasks from a stationary distribution, but our approach aims to improve transfer learning by explicitly optimizing for new task learning. In this paper, a simple extension onto the MAML algorithm is introduced without mixtures over parameters, providing theoretical guarantees. The focus is on forward transfer and avoiding catastrophic forgetting by maintaining a buffer of all observed data. The goal is to understand the interplay between limited memory and catastrophic forgetting for variants of the FTML algorithm in future work. The focus is on forward transfer in a non-stationary learning setting with multiple tasks. The setting allows for more information transfer from previous tasks and the use of meta-learning techniques for few-shot learning. Online learning, similar to continual learning, deals with sequential tasks and FTL has good regret guarantees but is computationally expensive. In this work, the focus is on developing the FTML algorithm for forward transfer in a non-stationary learning setting with multiple tasks. The algorithm shows low regret compared to adaptive comparator classes. The study also explores dynamic regret and adaptive regret settings in online learning literature. The computational efficiency of FTML is left for future work. In contrast to prior work on adaptive regret, this study considers a different approach where both the learner and comparator have access to update procedures, allowing for the production of different models for different loss functions. Sublinear regret algorithms are derived without imposing restrictions on the model or loss function changes. In this study, sublinear regret algorithms were derived without restrictions on the sequence of loss functions, capturing the essence of continual lifelong learning and showing promising empirical results."
