    "content": "The \"Restore Agriculture Productivity Act of 1999\" includes provisions such as removing caps on loan rates, extending marketing loan terms, considering crops grown on eligible lands for conservation reserve, expanding enrollment authority, early release of certain acreage in conservation reserve, and reviewing laws prohibiting the sale of agricultural commodities to foreign countries. The \"Restore Agriculture Productivity Act of 1999\" includes provisions to remove caps on loan rates under the Agricultural Market Transition Act. The \"Restore Agriculture Productivity Act of 1999\" removes caps on loan rates for 1999-2002 crops under the Agricultural Market Transition Act and allows for retroactive adjustments to marketing assistance loans. Additionally, the Act extends the marketing loan term. The Agricultural Market Transition Act is amended to allow for extensions of marketing assistance loans for up to 6 months. Additionally, consideration is given to crops typically grown on lands eligible for enrollment in conservation reserve. Section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to allow the Secretary to consider the types of crops grown on eligible croplands for enrollment in the conservation reserve program. This aims to promote conservation objectives while also reducing excess capacity and improving commodity prices. Additionally, expanded enrollment authority is granted under the Conservation Reserve Program. SEC. 5 amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to allow the Secretary to enroll additional acreage in the conservation reserve program if funds are appropriated for that purpose. SEC. 6 introduces early release of certain acreage enrolled in the conservation reserve program. The Secretary may permit early release of lands from the conservation reserve to increase US production of agricultural commodities if foreign production is displacing US sales. The decision is based on information from the Foreign Agricultural Service. Notification to the public and Congress is required 30 days before releasing lands for agricultural production. The Secretary may allow early release of lands from the conservation reserve to boost US agricultural production if foreign production is impacting US sales. Lands can only be released if they were previously used for the commodity, enrolled using specific funds, the contract holder applies for release, and agrees to produce the commodity after release. The Secretary may allow early release of lands from the conservation reserve for boosting US agricultural production in response to foreign competition. Lands reserved for high-priority conservation practices are not eligible for early release. Additional terms and conditions may be required by the Secretary for the selection and use of released lands. SEC. 7. Review of federal laws and regulations prohibiting sale of agricultural commodities to foreign countries. The Congress believes that any law restricting the sale of agricultural commodities to foreign countries should only be maintained if it is crucial for national security. The President is required to conduct an annual study to determine if such restrictions are necessary for national security interests. The President must annually assess the impact of agricultural export restrictions on US agriculture, including the effects on markets, producer incomes, and the potential for foreign sanctions. The President, through the Secretary of Agriculture, will assess the impact of agricultural export restrictions on US agriculture and the reputation of US farmers as reliable suppliers. A report will be submitted to congressional committees annually. In this section, \"agricultural commodity\" is defined as per the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate."
