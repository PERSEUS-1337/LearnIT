    "content": "There is no information provided in the prev_chunk to assist with summarizing the curr_chunk. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology in the Department of Homeland Security will conduct an independent study on the health effects of backscatter x-ray machines at airline checkpoints. The study must be initiated within 90 days of the enactment of this Act, conducted by an independent laboratory selected by the Under Secretary, and consistent with standard radiological medical evaluations. The independent laboratory conducting the study on backscatter x-ray machines at airline checkpoints will use calibration testing equipment and dismantle the machines for evaluation. The study aims to determine accurate radiation emission readings during testing of x-ray machines, measure dose emitted per scan, assess failure rates and effects of machine use, use alternative testing methods for radiation exposure levels, and evaluate fail-safe mechanisms for optimal machine operation. The study aims to evaluate the health risks posed by backscatter x-ray machines to individuals, including frequent air travelers, by collecting data and ensuring replicable tests with peer review. The panel evaluating health risks from backscatter x-ray machines will consider individuals like frequent air travelers, TSA employees, flight crews, airport workers, and those more sensitive to radiation. They will review relevant literature and assess the technology's public health risks. The Under Secretary will submit progress reports to Congress on the study evaluating health risks from backscatter x-ray technology, with a final report due after the panel completes their evaluation. The Under Secretary will submit a report to Congress containing the results of the study and evaluation conducted under this subsection. The Transportation Security Administration must place signs at airline passenger checkpoints using backscatter x-ray machines, informing passengers of alternative screening options."
