    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Border Law Enforcement Enhancement Act\" and includes findings related to border security. The Congress finds that it is the Federal Government's obligation to secure the Nation's borders and prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs into the United States. Despite Border Patrol apprehending over 1,000,000 people annually, the number of unauthorized aliens has been increasing by approximately 500,000 each year. The southwest border sees 94% of migrant apprehensions, with an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens currently in the US. Additionally, the border region is a major corridor for drug shipments. Border communities face significant costs due to inadequate border security, with law enforcement and criminal justice expenses exceeding $89 million annually for Southwest border counties. In August 2005, New Mexico and Arizona declared states of emergency to address criminal activity along the Southwest border. The Federal Government provides assistance to cover costs related to border security. Border communities along the Southwest border face significant costs related to inadequate border security. While the Federal Government provides assistance for certain expenses, local law enforcement agencies along the border with Canada and Mexico must use their limited resources to combat various border-related crimes. Counties in the Southwest border region are among the poorest in the country and struggle to cover the additional costs associated with illegal activities. Border communities along the Southwest border face significant costs related to inadequate border security. Federal assistance is needed to help local law enforcement address challenges from illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-related crimes. The Border Relief Grant Program is established to provide federal assistance to border communities facing challenges from illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-related crimes. The Border Relief Grant Program provides federal grants to sheriffs' offices and police departments within 25 miles of the southern border for law enforcement operations to enforce criminal laws and protect lives and property. The Border Relief Grant Program provides federal grants to law enforcement agencies near the southern border to enforce laws, protect lives and property, transfer detained aliens to federal officials, and combat drug trafficking. Funds can be used for hiring, training, and equipping law enforcement officials. The Border Relief Grant Program provides federal grants to law enforcement agencies near the southern border for various purposes, including detaining and transporting aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States. Grant funds can also be used for constructing and operating detention facilities for unlawfully present aliens, with a limit of 20% for construction or renovation. Each eligible law enforcement agency can apply for the grant program. Each eligible law enforcement agency must submit an application to the Secretary of Homeland Security for a Border Relief Grant, describing the activities for which assistance is sought and providing necessary assurances for compliance with program requirements. Authorization of appropriations of $150,000,000 annually for the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out the Act. No authorization for State or local law enforcement to enforce Federal immigration law. Secretary of Homeland Security to issue regulations within 90 days of enactment."
