    "content": "In this Act, key terms are defined based on the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Act also outlines application procedures and infrastructure activities. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to specify that an application for construction authorization does not need to include information on surface facilities not necessary for initial operation of the repository. The Commission's consideration process is also revised. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to streamline the process for amending construction authorization to include handling spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. The Commission will use expedited procedures for such applications. The Commission will issue a final decision on granting permission for handling spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste within 1 year of application submission, with a possible 180-day extension. Infrastructure activities can be conducted before or after the decision. The Secretary can undertake necessary infrastructure activities before or after the Commission's final decision on construction authorization for the Yucca Mountain site, including safety upgrades, site preparation, and rail line construction. The Secretary can undertake infrastructure activities related to the Yucca Mountain site, including connecting it to the national rail network, constructing facilities for rail operations, electrical grids, utilities, communication facilities, access roads, and non-nuclear support facilities. Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 is required for these activities. The Secretary is not required to consider the need for action, alternative actions, or a no-action alternative if an environmental impact statement is needed for infrastructure activities. Other Federal agencies must also consider the potential environmental impact of infrastructure activities. When conducting infrastructure activities, Federal agencies should adopt an environmental impact statement or similar analysis to meet their responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act. Adoption of such a statement fulfills the agency's obligations without further action. The Federal agencies must adopt an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act for infrastructure activities, fulfilling their obligations without further action. The Commission cannot deny construction authorization or other actions related to the repository based on the Secretary's infrastructure activities. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to allow expedited authorizations for infrastructure activities related to the repository, outside the geologic repository operations area, without requiring a license from the Commission. Federal agencies must still comply with environmental impact statements for infrastructure activities. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to expedite authorizations for infrastructure activities related to the repository. Agencies failing to grant authorization within one year must submit a report to Congress. Actions related to infrastructure activities are deemed beneficial to the public interest and consistent with public convenience. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to expedite authorizations for infrastructure activities related to the repository, deemed beneficial to the public interest and consistent with public convenience. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to expedite authorizations for infrastructure activities related to the repository, deemed beneficial to the public interest and consistent with public convenience. Regulatory requirements are outlined in Section 3. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to exempt certain materials from federal, state, and local requirements if certified by the Commission. The Environmental Protection Agency is designated as the permitting agency for air quality regulations. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 exempts Federal facilities subject to it from new or existing air quality permits or requirements. States and local governments are also prohibited from issuing such permits affecting these facilities. SEC. 4. CONFIDENCE IN AVAILABILITY OF WASTE DISPOSAL: The Commission must assume there will be enough capacity to dispose of nuclear waste when considering new reactor construction."
