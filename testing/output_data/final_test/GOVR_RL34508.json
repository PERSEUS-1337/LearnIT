This report analyzes current trends in U.S. natural gas markets, including prices, consumption, production, imports, and infrastructure. The future outlook is based on official forecasts. Natural gas is a key energy source in the U.S., with growing market share in power generation. Domestic supply has been stable and even increased recently. New developments in Alaska may lead to a pipeline from the North Slope. Investment in pipeline and storage infrastructure continues. LNG imports reached a record high in 2007. Natural gas (LNG) imports hit a record level in 2007 despite low utilization rates. Weather and the economy impact natural gas prices. Congressional interest may focus on price volatility or supply issues. Industry pressure for access to public lands for exploration is expected to continue. Factors affecting market outcomes include weather, the economy, oil prices, and infrastructure development. Key developments in natural gas markets include growth in power generation consumption. The power generation sector used more natural gas than any other sector in 2007. The average spot price at Henry Hub increased 20% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Wellhead prices increased over 30% during the 2007-2008 heating season. Working gas storage dropped below five-year averages, indicating a potential decrease in supply slack. Record LNG imports were seen in the United States in 2007. The United States saw record LNG imports in 2007, with increased imports likely. Natural gas infrastructure development advanced in 2007, with more projects underway in 2008. Industrial natural gas use rebounded slightly. North America has an integrated continent-wide market influenced by demand, supply, and capacity. Prices are affected by various factors like weather, economic conditions, and alternative fuel prices. The U.S. natural gas market is a major component of the North American market, accounting for 81% of consumption and 69% of supply. Henry Hub in Louisiana is the key price point for North America. Basis differentials reflect the price difference between locations and Henry Hub, influenced by capacity availability for gas transportation. The North American natural gas market is tightly connected to the global gas marketplace through LNG trade. State regulators determine gas distribution costs and rates for different customer classes. Oil prices still impact U.S. natural gas prices, but the relationship is evolving. Key market elements include prices, consumption, and supply, with prices remaining stable from 2006 to 2007. Prices in the North American natural gas market remained fairly stable between 2006 and 2007, but saw an increase in early 2008. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that average spot prices at Henry Hub increased by about 6% during this period. Wellhead prices stayed stable in 2007, while citygate prices decreased slightly. LNG import prices also decreased from 2005 to 2006. Retail prices for U.S. residential consumers are not yet available for 2007. In 2007, LNG import prices decreased by 11.6% to $7.14 per mcf. U.S. residential natural gas prices averaged $13.01 per mcf, with a high of $16.65 in July, a 5.4% decrease from 2006. Commercial prices were $11.31 per mcf, down 5.7%. Industrial prices decreased by 4.6% to $7.58 per mcf. Natural gas for electric power use increased by 2.8% to $7.30 per mcf. U.S. natural gas consumption grew by 6.5% in 2007, with the power sector leading the growth. Residential consumption increased by 8.2%, while commercial and industrial sectors also saw modest increases. In 2007, U.S. natural gas consumption increased by 6.5%, with the power sector leading the growth. Domestic and imported supplies rose, with dry gas production increasing by 4.3% to 19,278 Bcf. The natural gas rig count has been trending upward since 2002, reaching approximately 1,500. The U.S. natural gas reserve base also recently increased. In 2007, U.S. consumers received 84% of their natural gas supply from domestic production, which has shifted to deep Gulf of Mexico and unconventional sources. Net imports increased by almost 10%, with LNG imports growing significantly. Industry pressure for increased gas leasing on federal lands is expected to continue. New U.S. LNG infrastructure came into service in early 2008. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved new LNG import facilities in early 2008. Natural gas prices may need to rise to attract LNG deliveries in the global market. EIA forecasts U.S. imports of 1,080 Bcf LNG for 2008, including regasified LNG from Mexico's Costa Azul terminal. A new LNG import facility in eastern Canada focused on exporting to the U.S. is expected to start in 2008. Trends in natural gas markets include decreased seasonal demand swings, increased gas-for-power use, a slight rise in industrial use, growing international LNG trade, and ongoing infrastructure development. Gas consumption in the United States is highly seasonal, with peaks in winter for residential and commercial use and peaks in summer for electric power generation. The seasonal patterns have led to a decrease in overall swings and a secondary peak in summer due to gas-for-power use. Despite calls for more storage, the decrease in seasonal swings means that less storage may be sufficient to meet annual cycling needs. Trading natural gas may require additional storage. In 2007, natural gas price volatility was higher in colder months. Electric power sector saw the largest increase in natural gas consumption, becoming the largest end-use sector. Winter electric generator use of natural gas increased by 14% between 2005/06. In 2007, industrial natural gas use increased by 2% over the previous year, possibly due to a decrease in prices for industrial users. LNG monthly imports in 2007 varied from 98.7 Bcf in April to 20.8 Bcf in December, with U.S. importers competing on the global LNG spot market. European natural gas prices were in the $10.20-$10.66 per million Btu range, while U.S. prices fluctuated above and below this range. Some import points could successfully compete in the global spot market for LNG, while others could not. In 2007, the North American natural gas industry added new infrastructure to handle excess capacity at existing LNG import facilities. While no new LNG facilities became operational in 2007, they are expected to start commercial operation in 2008. EIA forecasts a 1% increase in natural gas use for 2008, citing weather changes and economic conditions as factors. EIA forecasts record U.S. consumption of 23.4 trillion cf in 2009, with increased production in 2008 primarily from deepwater Gulf of Mexico and unconventional gas. LNG imports expected to decline by 14% from 2007. Natural gas prices at Henry Hub forecasted to increase by almost 20% in 2008. Long-term forecast predicts prices to decrease to $5.27 per mcf by 2020 before rising to $6.42 per mcf in 2030. Consumption expected to grow to 24.4 tcf in 2015, then decline to 23.4 tcf by 2030. EIA forecasts increased use of natural gas for power generation, with Alaska Natural Gas reaching lower-48 by 2020. Gradual reductions in natural gas prices depend on certain assumptions, including weather impacts on consumption. EIA incorporates NOAA weather forecasts in its projections. The correlation between natural gas and oil prices has changed as fuel switching capabilities have declined. In the past, price competition was most evident in the New York metropolitan area. Fuel switching kept natural gas prices lower than historical patterns during periods of increasing oil prices. The decline in fuel switching capabilities has shifted the correlation between natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas prices in New York were historically kept lower by fuel switching, but in 2007 they moved outside this range. Economic growth impacts natural gas demand, with industrial use most likely to be affected by changes in economic outlook for 2008. Since the end of 2007, significant developments have occurred in the natural gas markets, with price increases reported by the EIA in 2008. The average spot price at the wellhead rose over 30% during the 2007-2008 heating season to $8.06 per million Btu. Storage levels decreased below five-year averages, indicating a potential decrease in supply slack. The opening of the Rockies Express natural gas pipeline helped relieve transmission congestion in the Rocky Mountain production region. The wellhead price in the Rockies area increased from $4.82 per million Btu in November 2007 to $8.41 in March 2008, improving incentives for producers to find and develop new supplies. Progress was made on the natural gas pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska, with competing efforts by BP and ConocoPhillips for the Denali Alaska Gas Pipeline. In early April 2018, the Independence Trail pipeline serving the Independence Hub platform in the Gulf of Mexico was shut down for repairs that could last until mid-year. Independence Hub contributes nearly 1 billion cubic feet per day, about 10% of U.S. Gulf of Mexico production. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation stated that the natural gas supply outlook for the summer of 2008 is positive. Despite some energy system issues, the North American natural gas market has been functioning well. The market situation in 2007 has transitioned to tighter conditions in 2008. In 2008, gas-on-gas competition may decline, leading to intensified adverse effects of high oil prices. Seasonal consumption swings are decreasing due to increased gas-for-power use, improving natural gas pipeline efficiency. Construction of new pipeline and storage infrastructure aligns with supply and demand fundamentals. However, low capacity factors at existing LNG import facilities suggest U.S. LNG purchasing power may not be as competitive internationally as anticipated. Location of LNG facilities plays a crucial role in competitiveness. The competitiveness of natural gas is influenced by factors like weather and the economy. Future projects need to consider these factors to determine if prices will rise or fall."
