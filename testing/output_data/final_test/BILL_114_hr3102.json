It amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by adding a new section for risk-based screening of employees at airports. The Administrator must establish a risk-based screening model for airport employees within 180 days of the Act's enactment.

The Administrator must establish a risk-based screening model for airport employees within 180 days of the Act's enactment, considering factors like employee access to secure areas and reducing entry points. The Administrator must establish a risk-based screening model for airport employees within 180 days of the Act's enactment, considering factors like employee access to secure areas and reducing entry points. In consultation with airport operators, the Administration will create a randomization plan for screening at entry and exit points at airports to maximize the deterrent effect of screening efforts. Additionally, a review of disqualifying criminal offenses for aviation security will be conducted within the specified timeframe. Regulations will be reviewed to determine the appropriateness of offenses for denying airport employees unescorted access to Secure Identification Display Areas, considering the current aviation security threat environment, including terrorism insider threats. The review will assess the need to tailor disqualifying offenses to address these threats and evaluate the security benefits and challenges of identifying patterns of offenses. The Administrator will review regulations to assess the appropriateness of offenses for denying airport employees access to Secure Identification Display Areas, considering the current aviation security threat environment, including terrorism insider threats.

Individuals can have their names removed from the database if mistakenly entered. The Administrator will conduct a cost and feasibility study of airport employee entry and exit points at Category I, II, and X airports. This study includes requirements for secure doors, surveillance video recording, and advanced screening technologies like magnetometers and explosives detection canines. The study will analyze the costs of employee screening at airports that screen all employees entering secure areas. It will include costs of entry and exit points and compare costs based on whether the implementation was done by the Administration or airports. The Comptroller General of the United States will assess the quality and reliability of the study on employee screening costs at airports. A report will be submitted to relevant committees within 60 days of receiving the study.
