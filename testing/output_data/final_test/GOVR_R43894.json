    "content": "The report analyzes China's establishment of an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea in 2013, international responses, consequences, and implications for U.S. interests. The 113th Congress addressed this issue in resolutions, and the 114th Congress may further shape U.S. responses to China's ADIZ. The PRC's East China Sea ADIZ has implications for various issues and is influenced by U.S. responses. CRS reports cover topics such as maritime territorial disputes in East Asia, disputes involving China, U.S.-China relations, U.S.-China military contacts, and the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. The curr_chunk discusses the concept of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), which is an area of airspace where immediate identification and control of aircraft is required for national security. Many countries have established ADIZs, but there is no international consensus on their operations. ADIZs are typically located over waters near coastal nations and extend beyond territorial boundaries. In 1948, the U.S. Air Force designated offshore areas as \"active defense areas\" or \"defense zones.\" The U.S. Air Force established the first ADIZs in the world in 1950, designating various offshore areas as \"active defense areas\" or \"defense zones.\" Present-day U.S. ADIZs, including the contiguous U.S. ADIZ, Alaska ADIZ, Guam ADIZ, and Hawaii ADIZ, are located over water and have procedural requirements for flights operating within these areas. The ADIZ procedures apply to aircraft operating to, from, or within the United States through a designated ADIZ. Foreign aircraft, including military ones, can operate freely within American ADIZ areas as long as they do not intend to enter U.S. airspace. However, if authorized to operate in U.S. airspace, they must follow all ADIZ procedures, including having a two-way radio and radar beacon transponder. In an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), flights must file a flight plan, provide aircraft information, make position reports, and comply with security instructions. The ADIZ is jointly monitored by the U.S. and Canadian militaries, with enforcement by NORAD. American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is responsible for aerospace warning and control in North America. In the United States, FAA handles flight plans, while in Canada NAV CANADA provides air traffic services within the ADIZ. Several Asian countries, including Japan and South Korea, have established ADIZs over 20 years ago for civil air defense initiatives. The treatment of ADIZs in international law and policy debates is complex and contentious. The Chicago Convention, which governs international civil aviation, does not specifically address ADIZs but defines national sovereignty over airspace. Each nation has complete sovereignty over airspace above its recognized territories. The 1982 United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) establishes rules for territorial waters, including exclusive sovereignty within 12 nautical miles offshore, contiguous zones up to 24 nautical miles, and exclusive economic zones extending to 200 nautical miles. The United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) establishes exclusive economic zones (EEZs) up to 200 nautical miles offshore, allowing nations to control activities like fishing, mining, and oil exploration. While most nations enjoy freedoms of navigation and overflight in EEZs, the United States has not ratified UNCLOS. China, Brazil, and other coastal nations argue for rights to regulate military traffic in their EEZs, while the US asserts its military aircraft rights. China asserts control over international airspace above its EEZ, while the US disagrees and allows its military aircraft to transit through ADIZs without following procedural regulations. This disagreement led to a collision in April 2001 between a Chinese PLA fighter and a US Navy reconnaissance aircraft over the South China Sea, resulting in the death of the PLA pilot and the detention of the US Navy crew. The boundaries of established ADIZs extend beyond territorial seas, covering international waters and airspace. Nations have no legal basis to control aircraft movement in these areas, unlike in territorial seas where overflights require authorization. ICAO standards allow coastal nations to provide air traffic services in international airspace, including designated ADIZs, without distinguishing between domestic and international airspace. Nations harmonize air traffic procedures across all airspace, following bilateral and multilateral aviation agreements. ICAO has designated Flight Information Regions (FIRs) to determine air traffic services globally. Nations can choose to ignore ICAO standards for air traffic rules. There are no specific international standards for ADIZs, and some legal scholars question their legal basis. The Chicago Convention provides guidance on military engagement of civil aircraft, advising against the use of weapons and emphasizing the safety of passengers. It allows nations to intercept and force a civil aircraft to land if there are reasonable grounds to suspect a violation of international aviation agreements. The PRC announced the establishment of the \"East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone\" (ECS ADIZ) in 2013, extending over a large part of the East China Sea. This zone covers airspace over the Senkaku Islands, claimed by Japan, the PRC, and Taiwan, as well as airspace over a submerged rock claimed by the Republic of Korea. The Chicago Convention does not address interception of civilian aircraft outside sovereign airspace. The PRC announced the establishment of the \"East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone\" (ECS ADIZ) in 2013, covering airspace over the Senkaku Islands and a submerged rock claimed by the Republic of Korea. The rules for the ECS ADIZ require flight plan identification, radio identification, transponder identification, and logo identification, with warnings of defensive measures against non-cooperating aircraft. The PRC's announcement of the ECS ADIZ in 2013 was criticized for being sudden and lacking consideration of costs to its external engagements. The move was protested by the US, Japan, South Korea, and other countries. The announcement created uncertainty about implementation, with inconsistent statements from the MND spokesman. The PRC's establishment of the ECS ADIZ in 2013 was met with criticism for its suddenness and lack of consideration for external costs. Despite claims of safeguarding sovereignty and security, foreign airlines' normal flights in the ECS ADIZ were said not to be affected. The PLA defended its actions, citing the right to set up an ADIZ based on foreign precedents. In January 2014, a PLA Air Force general acknowledged public misunderstanding regarding the enforcement of regulations in the ECS ADIZ. The ECS ADIZ regulations were proposed by the PLA and to be implemented by the PLA, reflecting a top-level decision by Xi Jinping. Experts presented justifications in official media, indicating advance preparation. The MND announced the ECS ADIZ in a high-level statement, consistent with a top-level decision. The PLA Navy's newspaper published an article stating that the ECS ADIZ is a major decision of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military. Since Xi Jinping's formal ascension to power in 2012-2013, the PRC has been asserting its claims in the East and South China Seas through coordinated actions. Xi Jinping leads a Maritime Security Leading Small Group and a top-level report in 2012 called for China to become a maritime power. The PRC issued a 2012 White Paper focusing on maritime resources and the armed forces. Since Xi Jinping's formal ascension to power in 2012-2013, the PRC has been asserting its claims in the East and South China Seas through coordinated actions. The PRC's 2012 White Paper focused on maritime resources and the armed forces, with a new emphasis on maritime disputes and a willingness to use force to safeguard territory. Xi Jinping called for building China's \"maritime power\" comprehensively in various fields. PLA actions in the ECS ADIZ have generally followed international norms, with a few exceptions. In late 2013 and early 2014, there were few incidents of foreign aircraft not complying with identification requirements. However, in mid-2014, PLA Air Force aircraft flew close to Japanese surveillance aircraft multiple times. U.S. Commanders stated that PLA intercepts in the ECS ADIZ were generally professional. The PLA has monitored U.S. and Japanese military aircraft in the ECS ADIZ but has shown restraint in enforcement. Concerns of forceful administration of the zone were not realized in late 2013 and early 2014. For example, the PLA did not respond to U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers flying through the ECS ADIZ in November 2013. In November 2013, U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers flew through the PRC's ECS ADIZ without informing Beijing. Japan and South Korea also flew military aircraft in the zone without notifying PRC authorities. The PLA later patrolled the zone and detected U.S. and Japanese military aircraft but did not take any actions. The U.S. Pacific Command Commander stated that there was no significant change in military interactions with the PLA, and the PLA assured commercial airlines that normal flights would not be affected. The PRC assured commercial airlines that normal flights of foreign airlines would not be affected despite warnings in the ECS ADIZ rules. Possible reasons for the PRC's restraint in enforcing the ADIZ regulations include surprise at B-52 flights, inadequate operational preparedness, lack of delegated authority, centralized control issues, and insufficient capabilities for monitoring the ECS ADIZ. General Mark Welsh stated in December 2013 that the PLA has the capability to operate in the East China Sea. A US Air Force assessment found that China may not maintain a constant presence with fighters, but will use ground-based radar to monitor the ECS ADIZ. The PLA will manage the ADIZ with shared responsibility among coastal units, command posts in the Nanjing Military Region, and centralized commands in Beijing. The PRC may be pursuing a strategy to alter the status quo in its favor while avoiding backlash. Foreign Minister Wang Yi assured respect for US interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The PRC aims to advance its position in the Asia-Pacific region by asserting a maximalist stance with the ECS ADIZ, then appearing to back down while maintaining incremental gains. This strategy involves projecting a calm image and justifying the ADIZ as a \"reasonable\" step. In case of any accidents or crises, Beijing could shift blame to other nations. The PLA's actions in the initial phase of the ADIZ declaration were not aggressive, but some view it as part of the PRC's incremental military actions to enhance its national interests. Chinese incremental military actions since 2005 have raised tensions with Japan, including fighter jet intercepts in 2014. The PRC defended these actions as legitimate enforcement of the ECS ADIZ, with sensitivity possibly heightened by Chinese-Russian military exercises. A prior incident in 2013 involved PLA fighters scrambling after Japanese surveillance of a PLA Air Force aircraft. Japan sent F-15 fighters to observe a PLA Air Force Y-8 early warning aircraft flying over oil and gas fields in the East China Sea. The PRC's ECS ADIZ announcement raised questions about its political symbolism or strategic military intentions. The PLA Air Force had already implemented early-warning mechanisms and air traffic control measures in the region before the announcement. The PLA had previously scrambled fighters to intercept foreign aircraft, including U.S. reconnaissance aircraft. The PLA scrambled fighters to intercept foreign aircraft, including U.S. reconnaissance aircraft. The ECS ADIZ announcement may be a symbolic political statement. The PRC leadership could have proclaimed the ECS ADIZ for political reasons to ease internal pressure. The PRC has taken assertive actions to advance its territorial claims, especially against Japan. The ECS ADIZ announcement in 2012 to early 2013 did not spark nationalistic, violent protests in China. Chinese leaders may have used the formal ECS ADIZ to increase PLA readiness and promote joint operations. The PLA Air Force and Navy were put on constant alert to safeguard the ECS ADIZ. The PLA has been urged to enhance realistic training for combat and develop stronger capabilities, including in maritime actions. The ECS ADIZ announcement in 2013 was seen as part of China's legal assertion of EEZ claims and could have been intended to provoke Japan. The PRC's administration of its ECS ADIZ has targeted Japanese aircraft, possibly in response to Japan's establishment of an ADIZ in 1969. Japan has not taken actions in the contested airspace drawing international criticism. The PRC may have announced the ECS ADIZ to achieve parity with Japan and other countries. The PRC's interest in setting up its own ADIZ in the ECS region has led to encounters with Japanese ASDF fighters. Japan scrambled fighters 415 times in response to PRC aircraft from April 2013 to April 2014. The ECS ADIZ may have been established for political-strategic significance and to showcase the PLA Air Force's strength. The lack of consultation with other countries aligns with the PRC's stance as a major power safeguarding its rights. The ECS ADIZ was possibly declared by the PLA to object to U.S. reconnaissance flights, allowing them to track the planes legally. The U.S. military maintains its flights are in international airspace. Defense Secretary Hagel called the announcement destabilizing, reaffirming the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty's application to the Senkaku Islands. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed concern over the unilateral action attempting to change the status quo in the East China Sea. The United States opposes China's attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea by implementing its ADIZ procedures on foreign aircraft. Secretary Kerry urged China to exercise restraint and not take action against aircraft that do not comply. The White House called China's announcement escalatory and provocative, increasing tensions in the region. U.S. concerns focus on the way China set up its ECS ADIZ. China's establishment of the East China Sea (ECS) Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) was seen as provocative and escalatory, increasing tensions in the region. The overlap with other ADIZs raised the potential for accidents. The US received minimal notice before the announcement, leading to military exercises and flights into the ECS ADIZ without informing China. The US military continued its operations in the Senkakus area without filing flight plans or registering frequencies, showing support for Japan and non-compliance with China's ECS ADIZ. In response to China's establishment of the ECS ADIZ, the US conducted military exercises and flights into the zone without informing China. The State Department expects U.S. carriers to follow foreign NOTAMs for international operations but does not accept China's requirements for the ECS ADIZ. There are mixed reactions to this stance, with some seeing it as a diplomatic solution that prioritizes aviation safety. China appreciates the U.S.'s cooperation but accuses Japan of non-compliance. China accuses Japan of \"maliciously hyping\" the issue and urges them to correct their mistakes regarding airline compliance with Chinese requirements. The US statement on NOTAMs supports joint cooperation for flight safety and the legitimacy of the ECS ADIZ. Japan and South Korea initially advised their airlines against complying with China's rules, but South Korea later advised compliance. Representative J. Randy Forbes raised concerns about conflicting guidance from the State Department and FAA regarding US airline compliance with China's procedures. The US Vice President expressed concerns about the ECS ADIZ procedures, stating that it could put the US at odds with Japan and lacks policy coordination. He emphasized the need for China to lower tensions and avoid enforcement that could lead to a crisis. The US Vice President expressed concerns about the ECS ADIZ procedures, emphasizing the need for China to lower tensions and establish communication with Japan and other neighbors. Defense Secretary Hagel noted efforts towards a stronger US-PRC military relationship and called for calm among China, Japan, and South Korea. General Dempsey highlighted the destabilizing requirement for all aircraft entering the ADIZ to report to China. Senate Foreign Relations Committee members criticized the unilateral declaration of the ECS ADIZ as provocative. The US criticized China's unilateral declaration of an ECS ADIZ as provocative and reinforcing a perception of coercion over rule of law. Despite the criticism, high-level bilateral meetings proceeded as planned, focusing on cooperation without mentioning the ECS ADIZ. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns co-chaired an interim Strategic Security Dialogue in Beijing, emphasizing the need to avoid unilateral actions in territorial disputes. The US defense official stated that China's ECS ADIZ does not challenge US national security interests. Japanese leaders criticized China's ADIZ announcement as dangerous and one-sided, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stating it would not affect Japan. Japan took actions to defy Chinese administration of the ADIZ, including ordering its airlines to ignore Chinese requests for identification. Japan also submitted a proposal to the ICAO to examine the impact of China's actions on international order and safety. Japan defied Chinese administration of the ADIZ by ordering its airlines to ignore Chinese requests for identification. The Abe Cabinet approved new defense guidelines emphasizing defense against Chinese incursions. Japan's parliament passed a resolution labeling the ECS ADIZ a violation of international law and called for China to withdraw it immediately. Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida indicated Tokyo's intention to gain international support for freedom of flight above the high seas. Japan has not adjusted its defense posture in response to the ECS ADIZ, but continues to intercept foreign military aircraft. The US and Japan have increased reconnaissance activities in the East China Sea to monitor Chinese practices. The US has praised Japan's restraint in the situation and reaffirmed the strength of their alliance. The US has praised Japan's restraint in the East China Sea situation and reaffirmed their alliance commitment. Vice President Biden expressed concern over China's actions and the US Senate passed a resolution supporting Japan. However, differences arose in guidance to commercial aviation, causing anxieties in Tokyo about US-Japan unity. Some Japanese praised US B-52 bombers training flight through Chinese ADIZ but worried about US appearing to accede to China on airline guidance. US actions related to Senkaku/Diaoyu islands closely scrutinized in Japan for signs of support for Japan or China, causing anxieties about potential abandonment by US. Concerns that US denunciation of China may embolden Japan to further destabilize East China Sea. Some worry US actions may inadvertently support China's claim to administer the islands. Analysts are concerned that certain U.S. actions may support China's claim to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, potentially weakening the U.S. commitment to its treaty obligations with Japan. The U.S. does not take a stance on the islands' sovereignty, so Japan's administration is crucial for the treaty commitment. China's creation of an ADIZ could be aimed at bolstering its claim to the islands. The ADIZ was created by China to strengthen its claim to the disputed islets, potentially affecting the U.S. defense obligation to Japan. The U.S. inserted a resolution in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act reaffirming its acknowledgment of Japan's administration over the Senkaku Islands. Obama Administration officials have also made similar statements to support Japan's sovereignty. Following China's ADIZ announcement, U.S. officials have reaffirmed their defense commitment to Japan and its territories. The U.S. military used a small islet in the Senkaku/Diaoyu as a bombing range, raising complexities in its stance on sovereignty. South Korea expressed displeasure with China's ADIZ but not as strongly as Japan. Reports suggest the U.S. military may have control over the islet. South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se expressed concerns about the air defense identification zone, stating it complicates regional situations. South Korea requested China to adjust its ADIZ to avoid overlap with Korean airspace, but China refused. South Korea then expanded its own ADIZ to include areas overlapping with Japanese and Chinese zones. The ROK military increased patrols in the ADIZ and flew a patrol aircraft through the zone without notifying China. This decision showed a mix of consideration and parochialism. The South Korean ADIZ respects freedom of overflight and consulted with the US, China, and Japan before expanding. Chinese and Japanese officials reacted calmly, but South Korea's response to China may have legitimized Beijing's claims. The overlapping ADIZ areas could increase the risk of incidents. The ECS ADIZ episode temporarily strained China-South Korea relations, while improving China-ROK ties in 2014. Seoul's separate accommodation with Beijing raised concerns about strategic alignment, sparking disputes over a submerged rock in the Yellow Sea. The submerged rock in the Yellow Sea, known as Socotra Rock by the United States, Ieodo by South Korea, and Suyan Rock by China, is a point of contention between China and South Korea within their EEZs. South Korea has maintained an ocean research station on the rock since 2003. The new Chinese ADIZ includes airspace over Socotra Rock, previously within the Japanese ADIZ but now part of the expanded Korean ADIZ. Taiwan declared sovereignty over the Diaoyutai Islands and emphasized peaceful dialogue to resolve disputes. Taiwan emphasizes peaceful dialogue to resolve disputes in line with President Ma Ying-jeou's \"East China Sea Peace Initiative\" of August 2012. Taiwan's military will use peaceful principles and adopt appropriate measures regarding the overlap between the PRC and Taiwan ADIZs. Taiwan is \"gravely concerned\" and will maintain close contact with all sides to maintain peace and stability. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged a stronger protest against the PRC's directive. Taiwan's legislators issued a joint statement urging the Ma Administration to lodge a strong protest. Taiwan's Legislative Yuan urged the Ma Administration to protest the PRC's ECS ADIZ. In 2010, Taiwan strongly protested Japan's expansion of its ADIZ over Yonaguni Island. Taiwan's military will continue patrols in its ADIZ. The PLA Air Force and Taiwan's Air Force have a tacit understanding not to cross the median line in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan protested and scrambled fighters in response to PLA aircraft flying through its ADIZ, even when not heading towards Taiwan. This has implications for U.S. policy and potential conflict escalation. China's ECS ADIZ poses a strategic challenge to the United States and may increase the risk of military conflict due to overlapping airspace administration. A small-scale clash could escalate into a larger conflict between modern militaries, especially in the absence of mutual trust. Beijing aims to \"break\" Tokyo's ADIZ, which could lead to potential confrontations between military aircraft. The incidents in May and June 2014 between Chinese and Japanese aircraft illustrate the potential for a spark to ignite a larger conflict. The presence of unmanned aerial vehicles in the disputed airspace could also lead to conflict. The PLA flew a UAV near the Senkaku Islands, prompting Japan to scramble fighters. Japan considered shooting down foreign UAVs that intrude its airspace, which China warned would be an act of war. China justifies its actions in the East China Sea based on self-defense and sovereignty, without signaling deterrence. Previous threats from China have included the use of force to resolve conflicts, such as against Taiwan in the 1990s. The PRC's ECS ADIZ does not seem intended to provoke conflict with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, or the United States, based on past warnings from Chinese leaders about necessary measures to prevent Taiwan's independence. Experts predict that China may use its military capabilities coercively to influence disputes with Japan without resorting to full-scale military conflict. The creation of the ECS ADIZ by China is seen as a deliberate move to raise tensions and seek concessions from other countries. Chinese strategists believe they can control escalation while shaping perceptions and seeking compromises. The ECS ADIZ is viewed as a measure to protect peace and stability in the region. Since September 2012, China has increasingly used military assets to assert control in the East China Sea, including patrols by navy ships and aircraft, scrambling of fighters, and establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). Beijing justifies these actions as necessary for defense. China's actions in the East China Sea, including the establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), have raised tensions with Japan and the United States. The PRC's motives for escalating tensions are unclear, but some speculate it could be to provoke Japan, undermine U.S. alliances, or hint at U.S.-China cooperation. The concept of a \"G-2\" between the U.S. and China worries other countries wary of China's growing influence. In late 2013, the PRC blamed Japan for tensions and lack of dialogue, and in March 2014, they did not agree to a Japanese proposal for a maritime liaison mechanism. In March 2014, the PRC did not agree to a Japanese proposal for a maritime liaison mechanism to avoid tension escalation. China eventually agreed in September to resume talks with Japan on a communication mechanism, including a hotline between defense officials. The ECS ADIZ designation seemed to focus on China's goals vis-\u00e0-vis Japan, with Chinese commentators referencing Japan's ADIZ. The face-to-face meeting of Prime Minister Abe and President Xi in November 2014 may provide momentum to the talks. The PLA's newspaper criticized Japan for concerns about the ECS ADIZ and the purchase of disputed islets, stating that the demarcation had to include the Diaoyu Islands. Official PRC media argued that the ECS ADIZ announcement initiated a struggle with Japan over air control in the East China Sea. Chinese media harshly criticized Japan's reaction but appreciated the US's neutral stance. The PRC's objective may be focused on rival claims with Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu/Diaoyutai Islands. The ECS ADIZ is a means for China to press Japan into negotiations over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, potentially undermining Japan's administration and the U.S.-Japan defense treaty. China's actions in the East and South China Sea aim to change the status quo and discredit Japan. The ECS ADIZ announcement by China aims to discredit Japan and challenge its sovereignty over the disputed islands, potentially leading to broader economic, military, and political rivalry on the world stage. This competition extends beyond the territorial dispute and could escalate if Japan makes concessions. The emergence of China as a major power has led to competition with Japan, with debates over whether China accepts the current international order or seeks to redefine it. The creation of the ECS ADIZ suggests China is asserting its own rules. Beijing refutes claims of upending the international order, citing compliance with PRC regulations by other countries. The PRC MND reported controlling almost 800 flights of foreign military aircraft in the ECS ADIZ and receiving flight plans from 56 airlines. China questions some aspects of the international order, particularly U.S. military involvement. Beijing questions the relevance of U.S. military alliances in Asia, considering it an outdated concept in international relations. The Director of National Intelligence predicts China will continue its proactive approach to maritime disputes, particularly with Japan over the Senkaku Islands. The PRC is trying to counterbalance U.S. influence and sow doubts about the U.S. strategic rebalance to Asia. The ECS ADIZ is seen as changing international rules and testing U.S. international influence. Michael Green questions if the Obama Administration sees it as a Japan-China problem or a longer-term test of wills with Beijing. Green argues that the ECS ADIZ is part of Beijing's attempt to assert greater control over the East and South China Seas. China is challenging the regional status quo in the East and South China Seas through gradual, low-intensity efforts to pressure other states into accepting revisions favorable to Beijing. There is no formal declaration of a Chinese \"Monroe Doctrine\" or fiery speeches denouncing the existing order. China's actions in the East and South China Seas aim to assert sovereignty and establish dominance in the region, challenging the U.S.-led maritime system through military warnings and legal assertions. This behavior has been compared to 19th-century spheres of influence, raising concerns about China's commitment to a transparent regional operating system. China is using a \"power and law approach\" to increase its jurisdictional control over the \"near seas\" through tactics like the ECS ADIZ. This has legal implications for the United States and international rules. The PRC's coercion tactics, including the ECS ADIZ, impact U.S.-PRC strategic competition. Some believe China's challenge may be limited to Asia, subtly challenging access to the global commons without broadly overturning the international order. The PRC's strategy involves \"selective access denial\" rather than complete denial of access to Asian seas and skies, challenging the U.S. to defend seemingly trivial areas. The announcement of the ECS ADIZ highlighted limitations in U.S.-PRC military contacts, with no detailed plan discussed during a meeting in Honolulu. After Admiral Mark Ferguson's visit to the PRC in November 2013, Defense Secretary Hagel acknowledged the lack of communication regarding the PRC's plan to establish an ADIZ. Efforts were made towards developing a stronger military-to-military relationship with the PLA to manage tensions and reduce risks to stability. The PRC's approach to the United States and U.S. allies includes options related to the ECS ADIZ, with Beijing considering establishing other ADIZs in the future. This poses a challenge beyond the island dispute with Japan. The MND spokesperson reiterated China's potential future steps of announcing ADIZs for the South China Sea, Tonkin Gulf, and Yellow Sea. Concerns arise about the need for international talks with Beijing and U.S. strategy to discourage new ADIZs. The PLA may face challenges in implementing an ADIZ over the South China Sea. The PLA may need to enhance radar capabilities to support an ADIZ over the South China Sea, especially in the southern region. Limited PLA Air Force projection power over the area may be improved with artificial islands for airfields. An aircraft carrier could help address the issue of fighter endurance during patrols. In December 2013, China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, conducted testing and training in the South China Sea. The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency stated that China's aircraft carrier will need an operational fixed-wing air regiment to reach its full potential. Announcing an ADIZ in the South China Sea could create political tensions for China and lead to a more coordinated approach by ASEAN countries. In early 2014, the PRC denied rumors of a \"South China Sea ADIZ\" and stated that China does not feel threatened by Southeast Asian countries. The PRC MND spokesperson mentioned that the decision to establish an ADIZ depends on factors like air threats and overall security environment, expressing confidence in their relationship with South China Sea countries. China's establishment of the ECS ADIZ could challenge Japan's control of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands by flying aircraft into disputed airspace, landing UAVs, or sending Coast Guard or Navy ships. Beijing's decisions on ADIZs will be based on perceived costs and benefits, potentially portraying reactions as provocations to advance control. China's establishment of the ECS ADIZ could challenge Japan's control of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Observers believe that China incurred costs by tarnishing its international image and undermining engagements with various countries. Defense Secretary Hagel and Singapore's Minister of Defense discussed China's ECS ADIZ announcement. Japan and ASEAN leaders agreed to enhance cooperation in ensuring freedom of overflight and civil aviation safety. Southeast Asian leaders were commended for their prudence in response to the situation. Some commentaries called for a strong, sustained U.S. stance to oppose China's ECS ADIZ, to bolster U.S. leadership in a coordinated approach among allies and partners. The Washington Post and The New York Times urged opposition to China's actions, emphasizing the need to stand up for freedom of navigation and support allies like Japan. Observers noted that China's declaration of the ECS ADIZ raises concerns about its intentions in the region. Some officials emphasize the importance of dialogue to reduce tensions with Beijing over the East China Sea (ECS) ADIZ declaration. Concerns exist about sending unwanted signals to Beijing if provocations are accepted without penalty. Possible congressional actions may include legislation and oversight focusing on addressing the ECS ADIZ, U.S. military contacts with the PLA, and strengthening alliances with Japan. In early December, Vice President Biden urged China to lower tensions, avoid enforcing the ADIZ in the East China Sea, and establish communication channels with Japan to prevent accidents or escalation. Assistant Secretary of State Russel highlighted the immediate need for practical measures. At a U.S.-PRC summit in Beijing in November 2014, Presidents Obama and Xi announced two memoranda of understanding (MOUs) as military-to-military confidence-building measures: an MOU on the Notification of Major Military Activities and an MOU on the Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters. The MOU on Rules of Behavior commits both sides to follow established international laws and rules, rather than concluding new, binding, bilateral rules or agreements. The U.S. and China issued an annex on surface-to-surface encounters at sea, but did not complete one for air-to-air encounters. The MOU aims to prevent unplanned, dangerous encounters in the air and at sea, reflecting mutual interest in aviation safety and security. However, some analysts believe the MOU does not address fundamental differences in international law interpretations between the two countries. Further dialogues may be needed to address intentional provocative encounters in the past. Some analysts suggest that quiet diplomacy may be more effective than public defiance in dealing with China's announcement of the ECS ADIZ. The United States and Japan have been pursuing a diplomatic approach, being aware of Beijing's sensitivity to public emphasis on certain issues. National Security Advisor Susan Rice also highlighted U.S. efforts in a speech before the announcement. National Security Advisor Susan Rice addressed U.S. concerns about maritime disputes in Asia but did not mention the U.S.-Japan defense treaty covering the Senkaku Islands. Congress may urge the Obama Administration to clarify issues regarding China's ECS ADIZ, including flight plans for U.S. airlines. S.Res. 412 calls on China to refrain from implementing the ECS ADIZ, reaffirming U.S. support for freedom of navigation in the Asia-Pacific region. The House of Representatives passed H.Res. 714, stating opposition to China's declared ECS ADIZ and calling for China to refrain from similar actions in the Asia-Pacific region. Congress could urge coordinated response with allies and increase military exercises in the region. The United States and its allies may increase military exercises in the region, urge China to consult with other countries before announcing future ADIZs, and oppose any additional ADIZs by China. The Obama Administration took a more proactive stance on maritime disputes after China's ECS ADIZ announcement. In mid-December 2013, Secretary of State Kerry visited Hanoi and Manila, expressing concerns about China's ADIZ announcement in the East China Sea and warning against similar actions in the South China Sea. The US State Department stated that an ADIZ by China in the South China Sea would be seen as provocative and raise tensions. Assistant Secretary of State Russel called China's ADIZ announcement in the East China Sea a provocative and unilateral act. The Senkakus are under Japan's administration, and unilateral attempts to change the status quo raise tensions without strengthening territorial claims under international law. The US does not recognize China's East China Sea ADIZ and will not change its operations in the region. China should refrain from implementing the ADIZ or similar actions elsewhere. The US strongly opposes any PRC attempt to set up an ADIZ in the South China Sea, warning of potential military deployment changes in response. The Obama Administration's heightened concern about China's challenges to access in international airspace and waters may require the deployment of more U.S. military aircraft to Northeast Asia or Southeast Asia. Congress could consider options to support U.S. statements, including requesting reports on U.S. flights through the ECS ADIZ and preparations for aggressive interceptions of U.S. aircraft. The U.S. military conducts Freedom of Navigation operations to challenge excessive maritime claims. The military conducts Freedom of Navigation operations to challenge excessive maritime claims and preserve rights under international law. The United States may reinforce its response to China with air and naval patrols in the East China Sea, in cooperation with allies. Some scholars suggest bilateral accommodation to avoid an adversarial relationship with China, while others recommend reassuring Beijing. Some scholars recommend reassuring Beijing by informing them in advance of U.S. military transits and avoiding B-52 bomber flights in the East China Sea. Congress oversees military engagement with China and adherence to relevant laws like the National Defense Authorization Act and Arms Export Control Act. U.S. defense officials aim to enhance communication with China. U.S. defense officials seek to improve communication with the PLA regarding the ECS ADIZ and other issues. General Welsh and Admiral Locklear view engagement as beneficial for preventing misunderstandings and promoting peace. Some suggest reducing military exchanges, while others propose lifting restrictions on contacts with China's military. The PRC's designation of the ECS ADIZ raises questions about the effectiveness of U.S. responses in maritime disputes and calls for a review of policy. Congressional calls for a clearer strategy in the Asia-Pacific region are reflected in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015, which instructs the Secretary of Defense to prioritize U.S. defense interests and assess A2/AD strategies in the region. Congressional oversight may focus on the development of a comprehensive strategy. Congressional oversight is needed for the development of an inter-agency strategy for the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, as mandated by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2014. Efforts could include testing crisis-management mechanisms with allies and partners to assess if the PRC seeks stable ties and de-escalation of tension. In 2008, the U.S. Defense Department established a direct defense hotline with the PLA to build confidence. Vice President Biden emphasized the need for China and Japan to establish mechanisms to lower tensions after the ECS ADIZ announcement. Talks between the PRC and Japan to set up a hotline were suspended in 2012 due to tension over the Senkaku Islands, but negotiations resumed in 2014 after a meeting between Prime Minister Abe and President Xi. If negotiating new agreements is challenging, focus could be on implementing existing agreements or resuming previous dialogues. Some experts question the utility of hotlines for China and Japan due to PLA reluctance in crises. Japan and South Korea have a notification pact since 1995 to avoid accidental confrontations and build confidence. This agreement could be a practical way for East Asia. The establishment of a notification pact between East Asian countries could help manage overlapping ADIZs and prevent unnecessary military scrambles. However, it is unlikely that Japan and China would agree to reciprocal notification of military flights in each other's ADIZ. The United States may adjust its alliance relationship with Japan in response to the PRC's ECS ADIZ, potentially through new military practices or defense cooperation guidelines. President Obama affirmed the U.S. stance on the Senkaku Islands before his 2014 trip to Japan. The U.S. supports Japan's administration of the Senkaku Islands under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security. U.S. officials may clarify the application of the treaty to the islands and surrounding airspace. The ongoing revision of the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Guidelines could provide further clarity on security cooperation in the East China Sea. The U.S. may consider recognizing Japanese sovereignty over the Senkaku islands to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and provide clarity in the East China Sea. Trilateral defense coordination among the U.S., Japan, and South Korea could deter provocative actions from China and North Korea. Policy makers should assess Beijing's intentions before deciding on future actions, including potential referral to the International Court of Justice for dispute resolution. The U.S. may consider recognizing Japanese sovereignty over the Senkaku islands to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and provide clarity in the East China Sea. U.S. officials raise concerns about the need for a rules-based international regime for the South and East China Seas, including the potential establishment of another ADIZ by China. There are forums available to arbitrate maritime territorial disputes, but the principles governing ADIZs have not been defined in international law. ICAO, under the 1944 Chicago Convention, develops international standards for aviation and could be the appropriate authority for concerns regarding ADIZ establishment. The United States or any other member nation could propose an ICAO standard for ADIZs to prevent conflict and promote predictability. This could involve working with other nations to reach a consensus agreement on ADIZs, although U.S. accession to such an agreement may require changes in ADIZ practices. The United States and Japan sought ICAO involvement in resolving the dispute over China's ADIZ, questioning a country's right to control commercial aircraft outside its airspace. The ECS ADIZ extends beyond Chinese-controlled FIRs, prompting objections from the United States and Japan. Opposing China's establishment of or procedural requirements for civil aircraft in its ECS ADIZ could lead to filing a formal complaint before ICAO under Article 84 of the Chicago Convention. This process aims to settle differences among member countries regarding ADIZs, which are not formally recognized under international civil aviation law. The outcome of such a complaint could impact the global recognition of ADIZs, including long-established ones like those of the United States. Key issues for international debate on ADIZs may include boundaries beyond territorial airspace, procedures for transiting aircraft, and potential conflicts in overlapping ADIZ areas. The People's Republic of China's actions regarding the East China Sea (ECS) Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) and its decisions on designating other ADIZs will shape perceptions of China and influence narratives on its rise to power. How China handles any new ADIZ will reflect its attitudes towards neighboring countries and international norms. US policy towards China will be influenced by Beijing's actions in its maritime periphery, including the ADIZ issue and the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island dispute.

US policy towards China will be influenced by Beijing's actions in its maritime periphery, including the ADIZ issue and the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island dispute. The decision to designate the ECS ADIZ in late 2013 may suggest Beijing's goals were coercive rather than defensive. The Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China issued aircraft identification rules for the ECS ADIZ on November 23, 2013. Aircraft flying in the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone must provide flight plan, radio, transponder, and logo identification to the relevant authorities. Aircraft in the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone must display nationality and registration logo. They must follow instructions from the administrative organ or face defensive measures. The Ministry of National Defense of China is responsible for enforcing these rules, effective November 23, 2013."
