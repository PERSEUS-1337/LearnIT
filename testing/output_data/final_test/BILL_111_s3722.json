Congress finds that under President Mugabe's rule, Zimbabwe's economy deteriorated significantly due to a controversial farmland redistribution program that caused chaos and displaced hundreds of thousands of farmers. In 2005, President Mugabe implemented Operation Murambatsvina, bulldozing homes and businesses, displacing 700,000 people. The majority of Zimbabweans live on less than one dollar a day, with a 95% unemployment rate. 3 million people have migrated to neighboring countries due to economic hardships caused by Mugabe's regime. Presidential elections were held on March 29, 2008. Presidential elections in Zimbabwe were held on March 29, 2008, between President Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Tsvangirai won 47.8% of the vote, leading to a run-off on June 27, 2008. President Mugabe refused to relinquish power, leading to a crackdown on opposition parties. 400 members of the Movement for Democratic Change were killed during the campaign. Tsvangirai eventually dropped out of the race. Tsvangirai dropped out of the run-off race due to violence, seeking refuge in the Embassy of the Netherlands. Pressure from the Southern African Development Community and the United States led to a power-sharing agreement called the Global Political Agreement, signed on September 15, 2008. The Parliament of Zimbabwe amended the Constitution to allow for a power-sharing government. Mugabe remained President, Tsvangirai became Prime Minister, and Biti was appointed Minister of Finance. Biti's economic policies, including adopting foreign currencies, led to a significant reduction in inflation rates. During Biti's tenure as Minister of Finance, Zimbabwe's GDP improved from -14.4% in 2008 to 3.7% in 2009. Government employees' salaries were reinstated, allowing essential services like healthcare and education to resume. The country's economy and citizens' well-being have seen significant progress since Tsvangirai and the Movement for Democratic Change gained power-sharing authority. The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 imposed sanctions on the Mugabe regime. The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 imposed sanctions on the Mugabe regime and members of the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front. Section 4(c) directs the United States Executive Director to oppose any financial support to the Government of Zimbabwe. The sanctions burdening the power-sharing government in Zimbabwe must be repealed to restore the economy and aid the transition to democracy. The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001, which imposed sanctions on the Mugabe regime, is repealed. This will help restore the economy and aid the transition to democracy in Zimbabwe."
