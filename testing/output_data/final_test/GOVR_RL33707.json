    "content": "Growing populations and changing values have increased demands on water supplies and river systems, leading to conflicts in water use and management, especially in the rapidly growing West. The debate over western water resources focuses on how to best plan for and manage the limited resource, with some advocating for enhancing water supplies through new projects and others emphasizing conservation and efficient use of existing supplies. In 1992, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish a federal water reclamation, recycling, and reuse program in the West to address growing challenges in water management. This program aimed to investigate opportunities for water reclamation and reuse, construct facilities for wastewater treatment, and conduct research on desalting for wastewater reclamation. The Title XVI program, established in 1992, focuses on water reclamation, recycling, and reuse in the West. Legislative proposals for authorizing projects have increased, but Administration support has waned due to budgetary and feasibility concerns. The Title XVI program, established in 1992, focuses on water reclamation, recycling, and reuse in the West. The Administration requests funding only for projects with prior funding, leading to frustration and confusion over the program's future and the role of the Bureau of Reclamation. Congressional authorization for new projects has been limited, causing delays in project funding. The Title XVI program, established in 1992, focuses on water reclamation, recycling, and reuse in the West. The Administration requests funding only for projects with prior funding, leading to frustration and confusion over the program's future. Congressional authorization for new projects has been limited, causing delays in project funding. This has resulted in a backlog of sparsely funded and unfunded projects, raising questions about the program's future. The Title XVI program, established in 1992 by the Department of the Interior, focuses on reclamation and reuse of wastewater and impaired waters. It was initiated in response to a six-year drought in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly affecting California and the Southwest. The program involves appraisal investigations to identify opportunities for water reclamation and feasibility studies in collaboration with federal, state, regional, and local authorities. The Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-575) addressed conflicts regarding water deliveries in the Central Valley Project. Title XVI authorized water reuse projects in Arizona and California, including a study for Southern California. In 1991, Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan announced a \"Comprehensive Water Reuse Initiative\" for Southern California to increase water supplies, reduce dependency on imports, restore ground-water reserves, and meet environmental water needs. The program aimed to provide 2 million acre-feet of reclaimed water annually. However, the Southern California study and other reuse projects under Title XVI faced challenges due to a policy shift reducing Administration support for the program. The Administration's decreased support for the Title XVI program, stemming from the FY2004 Reclamation budget evaluation, has created uncertainty for ongoing studies, frustrating project sponsors. The program is the sole federal initiative offering financial and technical aid for water reclamation and reuse facilities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lack established, funded programs for water reuse projects. Some authorized Corps activities received funding in FY2003, totaling $110.5 million. $110.5 million has been authorized for Corps water reuse activities, with $22.6 million appropriated as of FY2005. Water reuse projects may receive funding from Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Fund programs. Congress has authorized 33 Title XVI projects for water reuse. Reclamation has undertaken planning, design, and engineering activities for 21 out of 33 Title XVI projects, with nearly half of the projects concentrated in Southern California. Amendments in 1996 authorized 18 new projects and set new program guidance, with federal funding limited to 25% of total project costs and no more than $20 million per project. Reclamation has completed funding obligations for three projects, with federal funding nearly complete for six others. Total federal funding through 2006 is estimated at $324.5 million. The federal Title XVI funding through 2006 is estimated to be $324.5 million, with a remaining total federal contribution of $354 million for all authorized projects. Non-federal Title XVI investment is estimated at $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2004. Title XVI funding for FY2006 is $25.6 million, with a budget request of $10.1 million for FY2007 for program administration and eight projects. Congress typically includes funding for more projects than requested by the Administration. Figure 1 shows authorized Title XVI projects in traditional reclamation states overlain on DOI's \"hot-spots\" illustration. Thirty Title XVI projects have been authorized. Title XVI projects are prevalent in 17 reclamation states, with 30 projects authorized for construction in eight traditional reclamation states. More than two-thirds of the projects have received some Title XVI funding. The total federal funding through 2006 is estimated at $324.5 million, with a remaining federal contribution of $354 million for all authorized projects. Non-federal investment in Title XVI projects is estimated at $1.1 billion. Reclamation estimates a total maximum design capacity of Title XVI projects funded to date of 747,558 acre-feet of water annually. In 2002, OMB reviewed the Title XVI program using the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) and found weaknesses in linking federal funding to outcomes and long-term planning. The program is described as an \"earmark-driven grant program for local projects\" without a competitive grant process. The Title XVI program assists Southern California in reducing reliance on Colorado River water. The PART review suggests scaling back the program as it is not a core function of Reclamation. Despite budget requests being significantly lower, Congress appropriated higher amounts for FY2004, FY2005, and FY2006. The Administration's request for FY2007 is 40% of the enacted level. The Administration's request for FY2007 is $10.1 million, which is 40% of the enacted level for FY2006. OMB's PART review raises policy issues regarding congressional and Administration priorities, as well as the federal role in water supply development for municipal and industrial uses. The debate over the federal role in water supply development, specifically for municipal and industrial purposes, is a central policy issue for Title XVI projects. There is confusion over how to manage differing opinions on this topic, as the most recent congressional policy on these projects is nearly half a century old. Discussions also focus on the need for coordination of federal water activities to ensure efficient use of resources. The debate over the federal role in water supply development, particularly for municipal and industrial purposes, is a key policy issue for Title XVI projects. Congress is grappling with whether supporting these projects aligns with the appropriate federal role, given that historically, federal involvement in water supply has been secondary to state and local governments. The federal role in municipal and industrial (M&I) water supply development has historically been secondary to state and local governments. However, Congress has authorized the Department of the Interior to participate in constructing water supply projects for small and rural communities, as well as water reclamation and reuse projects under Title XVI. Despite this, congressional policy established in the Water Supply Act of 1958 has not been re-articulated regarding the federal role in M&I water supply development. The federal role in M&I water supply development has been a topic of discussion since the 1958 Water Supply Act. Congress is concerned about the implementation of the Title XVI program and its impact on water reuse projects. Recent questions have arisen due to issues with project evaluation, authorization processes, and program funding. Criticism of Title XVI implementation has led to discussions about the program's future and comparisons to other federal water assistance programs. The EPA and USDA administer revolving loan funds for water projects with criteria, regulations, and competitive processes. Congress appropriates money annually for these programs, and funding is allocated based on eligibility criteria. Stakeholders have differing views on program scope and project assistance targeting. The Title XVI program does not have legislatively mandated development criteria or competitive grant processes for projects. Evaluation processes are established, but there are no clear decision-making criteria or project ranking included in the current authority. The Title XVI program lacks specific project ranking or eligibility criteria in its current authority. Reclamation's guidelines for project development provide evaluation and feasibility criteria but are not binding or official rules. The evaluation process requires projects to pass an appraisal. Reclamation's Title XVI program requires projects to pass appraisal and feasibility phases before receiving a recommendation from the Secretary. Positive recommendations are sent to Congress for construction approval. However, many project authorizations bypass this process due to lack of agency support or initiation of studies. Feasibility studies are seen as more suitable for traditional, large, multi-purpose projects. Some argue that feasibility studies are more appropriate for traditional, large projects, not smaller locally financed ones. The process is seen as cumbersome and costly for the amount of federal assistance sought. Few entities have completed feasibility studies meeting Reclamation's approval in recent years, leading to confusion and frustration. Reclamation will not support legislative proposals for projects without a thorough feasibility review. Funding for Title XVI projects has been controversial due to differences in priorities between Congress and the Administration. The budget request for the last three years has been significantly less than the enacted appropriation. The Administration's request for FY2007 is 40% less than the previous year. Each project receives appropriations separately in Reclamation's budget. The Title XVI program receives appropriations separately in Reclamation's budget. Questions arise about the need for new guidance to address funding issues and controversy over project authorizations. The Title XVI program aims to address funding issues and controversy over project authorizations by establishing ranking criteria. Growing pressure on water supplies in the West is expected to increase demand for federal assistance, leading to concerns from Congress, the Administration, and stakeholders. This could result in a growing list of pending legislative proposals and projects competing for limited appropriations and support. The 109th Congress is faced with deciding the future of the Title XVI program, which has a backlog of unfunded projects and pending authorizations. Questions about the federal role in water reclamation and scarcity in the West need to be addressed, along with exploring alternative solutions and prioritizing federal resources. The 109th Congress is tasked with determining the future of the Title XVI program, which faces a backlog of unfunded projects. Questions about the federal role in water reclamation and scarcity in the West must be answered, along with prioritizing federal resources and exploring alternative solutions. The future of the Title XVI program is being debated in the 109th Congress, with questions about its use in drought-proofing communities and slowing pressure on agricultural water supplies. Oversight hearings have been held, and comprehensive bills have been introduced to amend Title XVI. Stakeholders include proponents of new and unfunded projects, the Administration, congressional sponsors, and traditional Reclamation stakeholders. The Title XVI program is under debate in the 109th Congress, with concerns about funding diversion from non-Title XVI projects. Proposed bills aim to streamline the evaluation process and clarify program activities. The Administration supports the legislation with suggested adjustments for program improvement. The Administration supported adjustments to legislation for prioritizing project assessment and authorization based on areas of greatest need and project worthiness. They suggested focusing on program and project eligibility and ranking criteria to help prioritize projects. Ranking criteria would address alleviating water conflicts or shortages and adding water supply in crisis areas. Other stakeholder priorities may also be considered. The Water 2025 program aims to address stakeholder priorities such as drought resilience and innovative technologies. S. 3639 outlines factors for project review but does not use them as decision-making criteria. Funding issues could be addressed through economic prioritization or new eligibility criteria. Federal water projects often require economic analysis to justify investment. Federal water resource projects are evaluated using \"Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water Resource Projects\" (P&Gs), focusing on National Economic Development (NED) benefits. Reclamation guidelines do not use the P&Gs for Title XVI projects due to their local scope, requiring an assessment of \"economic feasibility\" compared to other alternatives. Other federal agencies, like the Federal Transit Administration, also require economic analyses through alternatives analysis for project evaluation. The Clean Water Act directs the EPA Administrator to publish guidelines for evaluation methods, including cost-effectiveness, for projects receiving federal financial assistance. Relevant guidelines are published at 40 CFR 35, Subpart E, Appendix. Other legislative options for addressing Title XVI implementation issues include dismantling or phasing out the program. The Title XVI program faces implementation issues and various legislative options are being considered, such as dismantling the program or strengthening it. Administrative options include strengthening agency guidelines and developing formal rules. The program is at a crossroad due to growing demands on water resources, and different solutions are being explored to define the federal role in water reclamation and reuse. Different stakeholders have varying opinions on the broad policy, program criteria, project evaluation, and funding issues of the Title XVI program. Congress and the Administration have options to address implementation issues, with differing priorities on program development and appropriations. The challenge for Congress lies in balancing these divergent views to move forward effectively. Title XVI has been amended multiple times since 1992, with a total of 33 authorized projects. Reclamation has deemed 12 projects as inactive due to lack of funding. Active projects are yielding an estimated 121,678 acre-feet of water annually, expected to increase to 163,243 acre-feet by the end of FY2006. Actual water yield may be slightly less than the design capacity. Based on total design capacity, actual water yield may be slightly less. Most inactive projects have not received Title XVI funding, but some have received funding from EPA or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Six inactive projects are progressing with local funding. Interviews with seven project managers revealed that three projects have started construction, with one already complete and another expected to finish in 2006. Three projects are in various stages of planning and permitting. Six of the seven projects interviewed by CRS are moving forward with local funding, while the seventh project for the City of Tracy is no longer being pursued. Project sponsors are seeking alternative funding, with some more successful than others. Most project managers expressed a desire for engagement with Reclamation and felt that federal funding would help progress their projects. Some projects have started working with Reclamation in the early stages but have not received recent assistance. Total costs for Title XVI projects authorized before 1996 ranged from $152 million. In 1996, the Title XVI program's authorization was amended to limit the federal share to $20 million per project, resulting in smaller post-1996 projects ranging from $10 million to $280 million. The three costliest projects authorized before 1996 ranged from $152 million to $690 million, with 25% of total costs eligible for Title XVI funding."
