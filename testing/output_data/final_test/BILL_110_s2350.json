    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Glaucoma Screening Act of 2007\". Congress finds that glaucoma is a significant health issue in the United States, with many individuals unaware they have the condition. It is the leading cause of blindness among African-Americans and Hispanics, more common in African-Americans than Caucasians, and results in millions of physician visits annually. The cost of glaucoma to the government is estimated to be over $1.5 billion yearly, with poor vision also impacting Medicare costs significantly. Medicare covers glaucoma screenings for high-risk groups including individuals with diabetes, a family history of glaucoma, African-Americans 50 years and older, and Hispanics 65 years and older. Despite coverage since 1998, less than 45 percent of diabetic beneficiaries have had an eye exam. The amendment expands Medicare coverage of glaucoma screenings to include Hispanics over 49 years old who are at high risk for glaucoma. Additionally, a grant program is established to provide screenings for high-risk individuals. Effective January 1, 2008. The Secretary will establish a grant program for eligible entities to provide glaucoma screenings to high-risk individuals. Eligible entities must be located in the US, Puerto Rico, or a US territory, and dedicated to screening for eye diseases. Grant funds must be used for mobile screening units. The entity will use mobile screening units to test for glaucoma and other eye diseases, targeting high-risk populations. Partnerships with Federally-qualified health centers will increase awareness and provide screenings for high-risk individuals, those with a family history of glaucoma, and individuals with diabetes. Grants will be provided to medical residency training programs for students to conduct screenings for high-risk individuals. The entity will use mobile screening units to test for glaucoma and other eye diseases in high-risk populations. Partnerships with Federally-qualified health centers will increase awareness and provide screenings for individuals at high risk, including those with a family history of glaucoma and diabetes. Grants will be given to approved medical residency training programs for students to conduct screenings for high-risk individuals. The term \"individuals determined to be at high risk for glaucoma\" refers to those identified by the Secretary as high-risk for glaucoma. Screening for glaucoma is defined as per the Social Security Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is referred to as the Secretary. $10,000,000 is authorized for grants for the first 5 fiscal years after the Act's enactment."
