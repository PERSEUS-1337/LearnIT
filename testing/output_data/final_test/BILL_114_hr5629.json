Congress finds that the New River originates in Mexicali, Mexico, flows into the United States through Calexico, passes through the Imperial Valley, and drains into the Salton Sea. The river faces significant water pollution issues due to agricultural runoff, raw sewage, pesticides, and industrial discharges from both Mexico and the Imperial Valley. In the 1980s, the New River became known as one of the most polluted rivers in the US, posing health hazards to local populations in Calexico and Mexicali. In 1992, a sanitation strategy was established for the river's water quality problems at the international boundary, with two immediate repair projects funded by both countries. In the late 1990s, the US and Mexico invested $100 million to build wastewater treatment plants, chlorinating New River water and reforesting along Rio Hardy. Additionally, a 10-year effort addressed the pollution source by funding a new sewage treatment plant in Mexicali and developing a site plan for the river on the US side. In 2009, California mandated the creation of a strategic plan to improve water quality in the New River and develop a river parkway for public use. Flows in the river at the US-Mexico border have decreased by 40% in the last decade due to various factors, including reduced agricultural runoff and wastewater discharge. Ongoing conservation efforts at the New River require increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The strategic plan for the New River aims to improve water quality and create a river parkway. Efforts include installing a trash screen, pump station, aeration devices, disinfection facility, and managed wetlands to increase efficiency and cost-effectiveness. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as \"New River,\" \"Administrator,\" \"program,\" \"restoration and protection,\" and \"Mexican.\" The California New River Restoration Program is established. The Administrator shall establish the \"California New River restoration program\" within 180 days of this Act. The program will involve collaboration with various management entities to identify and implement restoration and protection activities for the New River. The Administrator will establish the \"California New River restoration program\" within 180 days of this Act, which will involve collaboration with management entities to implement science-based restoration and protection activities. The program will adopt a River-wide strategy targeting cost-effective projects with measurable results and maximizing conservation outcomes without increasing Federal full-time equivalent employees. Grants and technical assistance will be provided in accordance with section 5, and coordination with heads of Federal agencies will be ensured. The \"California New River restoration program\" will involve collaboration with various entities, including the Administrator of General Services, the Governor of California, and other public agencies. The program aims to coordinate restoration and protection activities for the New River in both the United States and Mexico. The California New River restoration program aims to sustain and enhance fish and wildlife habitat, improve water quality, manage water for flood mitigation, enhance public access and recreation, and facilitate strategic planning for the New River. The California New River restoration program aims to enhance natural systems and habitats, engage the public through outreach and education, increase scientific capacity, and provide technical assistance for restoration and protection activities related to the New River. The California New River restoration program focuses on enhancing natural systems and habitats, engaging the public through outreach and education, increasing scientific capacity, and providing technical assistance for restoration and protection activities. The Administrator will provide grants and technical assistance to various entities in the US and Mexico to achieve program goals. Criteria will be developed to ensure activities align with program purposes and priorities. The Federal share of project costs will not exceed 55 percent. The Administrator may partner with organizations like the North American Development Bank to manage grant implementation. The selected organization will receive advance payments for each fiscal year to carry out the program. The Administrator partners with organizations to manage grant implementation, receiving advance payments for each fiscal year to invest and administer the program in support of public-private partnerships. The Administrator partners with organizations to manage grant implementation and receives advance payments for each fiscal year. The SEC. 6 of the Act requires the Administrator to submit annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the Act, including project descriptions, goals, and status updates."
