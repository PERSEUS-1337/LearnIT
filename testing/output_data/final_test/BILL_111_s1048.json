Research shows a strong link between diet and health, with diet-related diseases starting early in life. Increased caloric intake is a key factor in the rise of obesity in the US, with Americans consuming 200 more calories per day between 1977 and 1996. Two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese, along with 34% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19. Obesity increases the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Over the past 2 decades, there has been a significant increase in meals eaten outside the home, leading to higher caloric intake and obesity. Studies show that children consume almost twice as many calories when eating at a restaurant compared to at home. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for health problems. The annual cost of obesity in the US is $123 billion, with half paid through Medicare and Medicaid. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the US. Heart disease also leads to significant economic impact, costing $156.4 billion in healthcare and lost productivity in 2008. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease, including stroke. The proportion of adults with high blood pressure increases with age. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires food manufacturers to provide information on their products. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-535) mandates nutrition information on packaged foods, leading to healthier diets and influencing food purchase decisions. Mandatory labeling has prompted reformulation of products, benefiting public health. The reformulation of packaged foods, including the removal of trans fat and introduction of nutritionally-improved products, is driven by the need for consumers to have access to nutritional information to manage their health and reduce the risk of diseases like heart disease and diabetes. This is similar to the requirement for companies to provide information on fuel-efficiency of automobiles and care instructions for clothing. Several studies show that consumers struggle to limit calorie intake at restaurants due to limited nutrition information available. Portion sizes in fast food and chain restaurants have increased since the 1970s. Various health organizations recommend increased access to nutritional information to promote healthier choices. The American Medical Association recommends increased availability of nutrition information for foods prepared away from home. Menu labeling policies have been introduced in over 30 states and localities, including California, New York City, Portland, Seattle, and Philadelphia. SEC. 3. Nutrition labeling required for standard menu items at chain restaurants and food sold from vending machines. Nutrition labeling requirements for standard menu items at chain restaurants and vending machines are outlined in Section 403(q)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

The FDA requires restaurants and retail food establishments with 20 or more locations to provide nutrition information on menus, including calorie counts and limits for calories, saturated fat, and sodium. They must also display calorie information for self-service and displayed food items. Additionally, the Secretary will establish standards for labeling menu items with different flavors or combinations as a single item, such as soft drinks, ice cream, and children's meals. The FDA may require regulations for including nutrition information on menu items at restaurants and retail food establishments to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Certain food items like condiments, daily specials, and custom orders are exempt from this requirement. Vending machines are also subject to specific labeling requirements. Vending machine operators with 20 or more machines must display calorie information near each food item or selection button. The article discusses voluntary provision of nutrition information by restaurants and vending machine operators, allowing them to provide additional nutrition information if it complies with labeling requirements. This clause does not prevent establishments not required to disclose nutrition information from doing so voluntarily. The clause allows for voluntary disclosure of nutrition information by restaurants and vending machine operators, in compliance with labeling requirements. State or local regulations may require additional nutrition information beyond what is mandated. Regulations for this provision must be proposed within one year. The Secretary must propose regulations within one year for voluntary nutrition information disclosure by restaurants and vending machine operators, allowing for variations in serving sizes and food preparation. Progress reports must be submitted quarterly to relevant committees. The regulations under section 403A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are amended to include a labeling requirement under section 403(q)(5)(H)."
