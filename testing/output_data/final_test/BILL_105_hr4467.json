    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Open Space Protection Act of 1998\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. Congress established the Land and Water Conservation Fund in 1965 to reinvest revenue from nonrenewable resources into public land resources. The Fund has created millions of acres of parkland and thousands of state and local parks, making it a successful American initiative. The demand for open spaces and recreation has increased significantly. Combined estimates from various government agencies show a $7 billion backlog for land acquisition needs, including conserving wetlands, watersheds, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. Urban sprawl and loss of open space are major concerns, with insufficient funding to address these needs. Conservation of natural and cultural treasures is crucial for preserving America's heritage of open space and outdoor recreation. The demand for outdoor recreation, including mountain biking, backpacking, kayaking, and birdwatching, has increased significantly. There is a need for more parks and open space to meet this demand. Youth soccer's popularity has led to a high demand for new playing fields. The rise in athletic participation among women and girls is also increasing the need for access to local parks and recreation facilities. The purpose of this Act is to provide secure funding for Federal land acquisition and support State, local, and urban conservation needs. Conservation measures are crucial to protect the nation's wildlands and habitats, ensuring healthy and safe communities for American families. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 and the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 provide matching grants for State, local, and urban conservation and recreation needs. SEC. 3. SECURE FUNDING. Section 3 of the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 is amended to include a special rule for appropriations from the Fund, totaling $900,000,000 for specific purposes, including Federal and State financial assistance. The Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 is amended to allocate $900,000,000 for State purposes, with a minimum of 50% directed to local governments for natural areas and recreational spaces. Additionally, $150,000,000 is designated for grants through the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program, and $50,000,000 for land acquisition under the American Battlefield Protection Program until fiscal year 2004. The Battlefield Protection Program allocates $50,000,000 for the restoration and acquisition of historical and cultural sites within various government agencies. The President specifies the purposes for fund usage in the annual budget submission. The President requires the Department of the Interior and Agriculture to prepare priority lists for the expenditure of federal funds for land acquisition, considering potential impacts and availability of necessary information. The Secretaries must consider factors deemed appropriate for timely completion of the acquisition. SEC. 4. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO STATES. Section 6 of the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 is amended to treat the District of Columbia and Indian/Alaska Native Village Corporations as one State for fund allocation. Subsection (e)(1) is amended to remove incidental costs, and subsection (e)(2) is amended to allow funds for public safety enhancement. Subsection (f)(5) is amended to require approval for property conversion only if no alternative exists. Any conversion must satisfy conditions to assure substitution of other conservation and recreation properties of equal value and usefulness, in accordance with the State Plan for Conservation and Recreation. Wetland areas proposed for acquisition as replacement property shall be considered equivalent in usefulness. The Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 is being amended. The Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 is being amended to include definitions for 'development grants' and 'acquisition grants' as matching capital grants for local governments to cover costs of development, construction, and purchasing new parkland for public conservation and recreation. Section 1004(j) is amended to include the District of Columbia. Section 1005(a) now states that eligibility for assistance is based on need as determined by the Secretary, including political subdivisions in Metropolitan, Primary, or Consolidated Statistical Areas, cities with a population of 50,000 or more, and counties with a population of 250,000 or more. Section 1006(a) is amended to focus on innovation, development, or acquisition purposes. Grantees must ensure public conservation and recreation opportunities at assisted areas and facilities. Section 1010 of the Act is amended to focus on innovation, development, or acquisition projects at assisted areas and facilities. Section 1010 of the Act states that any property acquired or improved under this title cannot be converted to other uses without approval from the Secretary, except in specific circumstances. The Secretary must ensure that any conversion meets certain conditions to substitute with conservation and recreation properties of equal value and usefulness. Section 1014 is repealed."
