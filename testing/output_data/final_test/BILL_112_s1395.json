    "content": "The \"WAIVE Act\" is the short title of the legislation. The Act includes findings in Section 2. Congress findings show that as of July 15, 2011, 1,471 one-year waivers were approved by the Department of Health and Human Services, covering 3,200,000 Americans, with half being union members. A report by the Government Accountability Office was released on June 14, 2011. The Government Accountability Office report revealed that millions of Americans sought waivers from the health care law's annual benefit limit mandate to avoid significant premium increases. The Department of Health and Human Services granted waivers to unions, employers, and insurers facing projected premium hikes of 10 percent or more. The health care law's new coverage mandates are causing premiums to increase, threatening private insurance options. Independent analysis shows premiums will rise by $2,100 per year for families, contradicting promises of cost reductions. The Department of Health and Human Services plans to terminate arbitrary annual benefit limits. The Department of Health and Human Services will end its annual benefit limit waiver policy on September 22, 2011. New businesses starting after this date will not be able to request waivers, potentially impacting their ability to provide health insurance coverage to employees. SEC. 3. INDIVIDUAL PPACA WAIVERS. An individual can request a waiver from certain requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by submitting an application to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The application must include the specific provisions for which the waiver is sought and a brief explanation of how compliance would reduce access to benefits. The Secretary will issue waivers within 30 days of receiving the application, and guidance will be provided to individuals on how to apply for and receive a waiver under this section."
