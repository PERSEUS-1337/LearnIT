    "content": "The Act may be referred to as the \"Eliminating Health Disparities Act of 2017.\" It amends Title XIX of the Social Security Act to include a Health Disparities Elimination Program State Plan Option. Beginning fiscal year 2018, a State can establish a Health Disparities Elimination Program to reduce health disparities among targeted populations in communities served by qualified community health systems. The State can provide incentive payments to these systems for approved initiatives through a State plan amendment submitted to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary approves State plan amendments for the Health Disparities Elimination Program, including goals, action plan requirements, eligibility criteria, and methodology for incentive payments to qualified community health systems. The State requires a qualified community health system to submit an action plan for an initiative that identifies the target population, evidence-based projects, and implementation period. The initiative aims to reduce health disparities for specific populations by setting targets, benchmarks, and measures for evaluating effectiveness. Priority is given to selecting qualified community health systems for participation in the initiative under a State plan amendment. Initial incentive payments may be provided to support startup costs. To establish an initiative under a State plan amendment, priority is given to health systems that have submitted action plans with evidence-based interventions to reduce health disparities, demonstrate high impact potential, prior experience in reducing disparities, and a long-term commitment to target populations. The State may approve an action plan for up to 5 years to strengthen health systems addressing health disparities, requiring a report on effectiveness at the end of the period. A State can extend a health system initiative with a new action plan if it has been effective, based on a report submitted to the Secretary. The State must submit annual progress reports on the Health Disparities Elimination Program and a comprehensive evaluation every 5 years. The Health Disparities Elimination Program of the State must undergo an evaluation every 5 years to assess its effectiveness in meeting goals and describe its activities. The evaluations will be published on the CMS website. Funding for State allocations under the Health Disparities Elimination Program includes an annual appropriation of one half of one percent of the Federal share of expenditures on State plans. The allocated funds are deposited into an incentive payment fund and remain available until expended. The Secretary allocates funds to each State based on their total expenditures under the State plan compared to all States' total expenditures. Unused funds by the State are subject to the Secretary's determination. If the Secretary determines that a State does not have an approved State plan amendment, their allocation will be treated as unused and reallocated to qualifying States. In the fiscal year, unused allocations are reallocated to States based on their total expenditures under the State plan. Allocations to qualifying States remain available until expended. A qualifying State is defined as one with an approved State plan amendment and an agreement with qualified community health system initiatives. The Secretary shall pay each qualifying State with an approved State plan amendment from its allocation under subparagraph (C) if measurable progress towards meeting the State's goals is determined. The State will receive incentive payments for approved initiatives, totaling 90% of the amount expended in each quarter. These payments are not considered as payment for healthcare services and do not count towards payment limits for providers under the State plan. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as 'health disparity', 'qualified community health system', 'State', and 'target population'. The curr_chunk states that health care access and quality should not be limited by the source of coverage."
