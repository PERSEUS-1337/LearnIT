    "content": "The U.S. Census Bureau collects national survey data on child support by interviewing single-parent families to assess noncustodial parents' payment performance. The Child Support Supplement survey has evolved since 1978, with data comparable only back to 1993. Information was initially collected from custodial mothers, but from 1991, custodial fathers were also included. The report presents data on custodial parents from 2013. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, enacted in 1975, aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents and help families remain self-sufficient. Administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), the program is funded by general revenues and operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program provides various services for children, including parent location, paternity establishment, child support order establishment and modification, payment collection and distribution, and medical child support enforcement. In FY2013, the program collected $28.0 billion in child support payments and served 15.6 million cases, handling at least 50% of all child support cases nationwide. In 2013, 83% of custodial parents were mothers. 48% were white, 25% were black, and 23% were Hispanic. 16% were married, 33% were divorced, and 38% were never married. 13% did not have a high school diploma, while almost 20% had at least a bachelor's degree. 50% worked full-time year-round, 29% had family income below poverty, and nearly 43% received some type of public assistance. Child support indicators showed a decrease in awards, entitlement, and actual payments from 1993 to 2013. Child support payments decreased from 1993 to 2013. The percentage of custodial parents receiving the full amount owed increased by almost 24%, with 46% receiving full payment in 2013. In 2013, 49% of custodial parents were awarded child support, with 74% of those due receiving at least one payment. The average child support payment in 2013 was $3,953, 6.5% higher than in 1993. 68% of the $32.9 billion in child support due was actually paid in 2013. In 2013, 68% of the $32.9 billion in aggregate child support due was actually paid. Over the 21-year period from 1993 to 2013, aggregate child support due fluctuated, starting at $38.0 billion in 1993, peaking at $46.9 billion in 2003, and dropping to $32.9 billion in 2013. Despite factors like sex, race, marital status, and education influencing child support orders, award rates remain lower than receipt rates. Female custodial parents were 1.7 times more likely to be awarded child support in 2013 compared to male counterparts. In 2013, 37% of black custodial parents and 56% of white custodial parents were awarded child support. However, 65% of black custodial parents and 79% of white custodial parents actually received child support payments. Similarly, 42% of never-married parents were awarded child support, but almost 68% of them received payments. Additionally, 38% of custodial parents without a high school diploma were awarded child support, while almost 62% of them received payments. In 2013, custodial parents who were owed child support actually received payments. The receipt rates were higher than award rates for all categories of custodial parents, including those with incomes below the poverty level, working full-time year-round, and receiving public assistance. For example, 45% of custodial parents below the poverty level were awarded child support, and nearly 66% of them received payments. Similarly, 49% of custodial parents working full-time year-round were awarded child support, and almost 77% of them received payments. Additionally, 47% of custodial parents receiving public assistance were awarded child support, and nearly 67% of them received payments. In 2013, custodial parents who were divorced or white (non-Hispanic) were most likely to be awarded child support. Custodial parents with an associate's degree were the most likely to receive child support payments. The average yearly child support payment received was $5,333, with $5,181 for mothers and $6,526 for fathers, representing 14% of the custodial parent's yearly income. In 2013, child support payments made up a significant portion of custodial parents' income, ranging from 9% to 49% depending on various factors. Additionally, 54% of custodial parents with child support awards also received health insurance coverage, with the noncustodial parent providing coverage in over half of the cases. In 2013, 3.5 million noncustodial parents provided health insurance for their children, representing 26.1% of children under 21 living with a custodial parent."
