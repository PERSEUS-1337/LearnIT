The Secretaries will develop a program to support state fisheries management programs, including data collection, law enforcement, habitat conservation, research, and fishery management planning. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for fishing in the exclusive economic zone of an Atlantic Ocean fishery covered by an interstate fishery management plan. Regulations may be prescribed to govern fishing in the exclusive economic zone to support the implementation of interstate fishery management plans. Federal fishery management plans supersede regulations issued for the same fishery. Enforcement will follow Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act provisions. The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act provisions apply to regulations prescribed for fishing in the exclusive economic zone, covering prohibited acts, penalties, and enforcement.

STATE NONCOMPLIANCE WITH INTERSTATE FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLANS. The Commission determines State compliance with interstate fishery management plans and notifies Secretaries of noncompliance within 10 days. Specific actions for compliance are outlined, and monitoring continues after a determination is made. The Commission monitors State compliance with fishery management plans and notifies Secretaries of noncompliance. If a State has implemented all specified actions, the Commission will notify the Secretaries that the State is in compliance. SEC. 5. SECRETARIAL ACTION. Within 30 days of receiving a notification from the Commission, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, reviews the Commission's determination of noncompliance by a State regarding an interstate fishery management plan. The Secretary assesses if the State failed to implement necessary measures for conservation, and if the plan was prepared under required standards. The Secretary considers State comments and Commission input when determining noncompliance with an interstate fishery management plan. If a State fails to implement the plan, a fishing moratorium is declared within 6 months. The Secretary terminates a fishing moratorium when a State complies with an interstate fishery management plan. Regulations will be prescribed for implementing the Act, including the possession and use of fish from aquaculture operations and the retention of fish caught incidentally in fisheries directed towards menhaden. During a moratorium, fishing for a species subject to the moratorium is prohibited within state waters. It is also prohibited to land, attempt to land, or possess fish caught in violation of the moratorium or the Act. During a moratorium, it is prohibited to land any fish subject to the moratorium within a State, regardless of where it was caught. Additionally, it is illegal to refuse authorized officers to conduct searches or inspections related to enforcing the Act. The Act prohibits interfering with authorized officers conducting searches or inspections, resisting lawful arrest for violations, possessing fish taken unlawfully, and obstructing the apprehension of offenders. Violators may face civil penalties under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Civil and criminal penalties, including forfeiture of vessels and fish, apply to individuals violating the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act allows for the disposal of seized fish under court order or regulation. A moratorium declared under the Act is enforced by the Secretaries and the Coast Guard, who may collaborate with other federal or state agencies for enforcement. SEC. 6. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
