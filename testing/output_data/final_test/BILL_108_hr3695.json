    "content": "The \"Military Base Security Act\" may be cited as the short title. There is a pilot and demonstration program for military installations in New Jersey. The Secretary of Defense will develop a pilot program in New Jersey and other selected states to enhance security, quality, and efficiency of defense contractors on military installations. Goals include minimizing national security risks from illegal contract workers. The Department of Defense must ensure effective background checks for contract employees on military installations to prevent security risks. Contractors with reliable staffing plans will have greater contracting opportunities for defense projects. The Department of Defense requires contract employees on military installations to be lawful residents or authorized to work in the US. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with reviewing and improving security clearance procedures for access to military installations. The Department of Defense and its contractors must enhance security clearance policies. They should use the social security number verification service to detect false identification documents. Collaboration with federal, state, and local agencies is necessary to prosecute the use of fraudulent documents by contract employees. The Secretary of Defense will impose sanctions on employers violating immigration laws with false identification documents by contract employees on military installations. The Secretary will also review and analyze reforms for national implementation. Additionally, the Secretary will review existing policies for contracting and procurement procedures for military installations. The Secretary of Defense will expand the use of competitive proposals for construction services on military installations and implement reforms to improve contractor reliability and efficiency. This includes allocating significant weight to workforce quality in contract solicitations. The Secretary of Defense will allocate credit to reliable workforce security programs offered by contractors and subcontractors, which go beyond minimum security requirements to promote security on military installations. Additionally, contract solicitations will require significant weight to be given to effective project staffing plans provided by contractors and subcontractors. The Secretary of Defense will implement a pilot and demonstration program within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. Reporting requirements include submitting progress reports to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives for monitoring and evaluation. The pilot and demonstration program must submit an initial report within 90 days of operation, biannual reports detailing progress, and a final report within 2 years. The term \"military installation\" refers to various types of military facilities. A military installation is a facility under the Department of Defense's jurisdiction, located in certain areas, excluding civil works or flood control projects."
