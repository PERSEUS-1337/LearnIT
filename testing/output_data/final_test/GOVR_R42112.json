    "content": "The Internet has become a key part of the American economy, but it also leads to copyright and trademark infringement issues. Nearly 24% of global Internet traffic is infringing, impacting industries supported by intellectual property laws. Piracy of movies, music, software, and counterfeit goods like clothing and electronics harm the economy. The extent of the problem is challenging to measure accurately, but it is considered a serious issue. The PROTECT IP Act and SOPA are legislative responses to foreign websites trafficking in copyrighted content and counterfeit goods. These bills aim to hold foreign websites and domestic sites accountable for piracy and counterfeiting by creating new obligations for U.S.-based domain name servers, Internet advertisers, search engines, and financial transaction providers. There has been considerable public debate on these bills. The PROTECT IP Act and SOPA aim to combat piracy and counterfeiting by holding foreign and domestic websites accountable. The Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN Act) has been introduced as an alternative to address concerns about the proposed changes. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) introduced a \"safe harbor\" immunity for service providers to limit liability for copyright infringement. The DMCA provides safe harbor immunity for service providers, limiting liability for copyright infringement. Service providers must cooperate with copyright owners to address infringing activities by customers. The safe harbors correspond to four functional operations, including transitory digital network communications and storage of information at the direction of users. One common condition is the requirement to remove infringing material upon proper notification by the copyright owner. The DMCA requires service providers to remove infringing material upon proper notification to qualify for safe harbor immunity. Section 512(f) provides damages for misrepresentation of infringement, protecting service providers from false claims. The DMCA's safe harbor provisions do not provide absolute immunity from legal liability for copyright infringement. Service providers may be liable for limited injunctive relief, such as restraining access to infringing activity and blocking access to specific online locations. The DMCA allows for limited injunctive relief, including blocking access to specific online locations outside the US and restraining access to infringing material or activity on a service provider's system. This is in addition to the safe harbor provisions that do not provide absolute immunity from legal liability for copyright infringement. The DMCA allows for limited injunctive relief, including blocking access to specific online locations and restraining access to infringing material. Safe harbor provisions are crucial for online intermediaries to provide services without the risk of copyright liability. There are calls to expand the DMCA to include notice and takedown provisions for trademark infringement and other illegal activities like spam and fraud. The PRO-IP Act strengthened forfeiture provisions for criminal copyright infringement and trademark counterfeiting. The Department of Justice and ICE are using civil forfeiture to seize domain names of websites involved in selling counterfeit goods and pirated materials. ICE seized 350 domain names associated with Internet piracy in \"Operation In Our Sites\" between June 2010 and November 2011. 116 of these domains have been forfeited to the U.S. government after presenting evidence of criminal trademark violations or copyright infringement to obtain seizure warrants from federal judges. The ICE Director explained the process for challenging judicially authorized seizure warrants for seized property, including filing a petition and attending a hearing in federal court. Website owners can also demand return of the property through law enforcement or file a challenge directly with the agency. Factors are considered before deciding which domain names to seize. The ICE considers various factors before deciding which domain names to seize, such as website popularity, profitability, commercial nature, impact on piracy, and jurisdiction limitations. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act provides remedies against domain name abuses, including protection against trademark dilution and anticybersquatting measures for individuals. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) allows trademark owners to file lawsuits against domain name registrants for trademark dilution. If the domain name is found to be identical or confusingly similar to a distinctive or famous mark, or infringes upon certain protected names or insignias, the court can order the domain name to be forfeited, canceled, or transferred to the trademark owner. ACPA also allows in rem actions against infringing domain names when personal jurisdiction is not possible. Individuals can sue cybersquatters who profit from registering and selling domain names. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) prohibits gambling-related businesses from accepting certain payments for unlawful Internet gambling, with penalties including fines up to $250,000 or $500,000 for organizations, imprisonment up to five years, or both. The Act aims to cut off revenue to illegal online gambling operations. The UIGEA prohibits gambling-related businesses from accepting certain payments for unlawful Internet gambling, with penalties including fines up to $250,000 or $500,000 for organizations, imprisonment up to five years, or both. The Act also allows for civil proceedings to enjoin prohibited transactions and requires designated payment systems to block or prevent restricted transactions. The UIGEA prohibits certain payment systems from facilitating restricted transactions for Internet gambling, including ACH, card systems, check collection systems, money transmitting business, and wire transfer systems. Participants in these systems must establish policies to prevent such transactions. Some Members of Congress have criticized the UIGEA. Some Members of Congress criticized UIGEA for being ineffective at stopping Internet gambling. The Ryan Haight Act was passed to regulate rogue Internet pharmacies selling illegal drugs online. It mandates specific information on pharmacy websites and registration with the DEA. The Ryan Haight Act requires valid prescriptions for controlled substances online, enhancing penalties for illegal distribution. It has reduced illegal Internet pharmacies. Senator Leahy introduced the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported COICA to the Senate without a public hearing. In the 112th Congress, a hearing was held on intellectual property theft and rogue websites. Senator Leahy introduced the PROTECT IP Act, which was later placed on hold by Senator Wyden. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on intellectual property law enforcement efforts, including testimony from ICE and other agencies. Senator Leahy filed a report, and Senator Reid presented a cloture motion on the PROTECT IP Act. Senator Wyden expressed intent to filibuster the bill. Representative Lamar Smith introduced the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House Judiciary Committee. The House Judiciary Committee held hearings on the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in November and December 2011. The committee considered 60 amendments to the bill but postponed completion due to scheduling issues. The White House responded to a petition urging a veto of SOPA in January 2012, stating support for legislation that addresses online piracy. The House supported online piracy legislation that combats piracy originating outside the US, but the White House opposed any laws that limit freedom of expression or increase cybersecurity risks. Websites like Wikipedia, Reddit, and Mozilla protested the PROTECT IP Act and SOPA, leading to decreased support from Congress members. Senator Reid postponed a cloture vote on the PROTECT IP Act due to recent events. Senator Reid postponed the cloture vote for the PROTECT IP Act, hoping for a compromise between supporters and opponents. Chairman Smith also delayed consideration of SOPA until a solution is agreed upon. S. 968 targets Internet sites dedicated to infringing activities. The PROTECT IP Act targets websites engaged in infringing activities, including the sale of counterfeit goods. It allows the Attorney General to take legal action against those operating such sites, even if they are located outside the United States. The Attorney General can take legal action against a nondomestic domain name used by an Internet site dedicated to infringing activities. A federal court can issue orders against the domain name if it is used in the U.S. to harm U.S. intellectual property rights holders. Law enforcement officers can serve court orders to operators of non-authoritative domain name servers to cease infringing activities. The PROTECT IP Act allows the Attorney General to take legal action against third parties, such as Internet service providers, financial transaction providers, internet advertising services, and search engines, to prevent access to seized domain names and infringing activities. The PROTECT IP Act allows for injunctive relief against third parties failing to comply with obligations related to infringing activities on Internet sites. Plaintiffs can sue domain name registrants or site owners/operators for civil injunctive relief, regardless of their location. This provision grants intellectual property rights holders a new private right of action. The PROTECT IP Act grants a new private right of action to intellectual property rights holders against Internet sites dedicated to infringing activities. Federal courts can issue injunctive relief against domain names used by such sites if they harm U.S. intellectual property rights holders. The qualifying plaintiff can serve a cease and desist order to entities responsible for financial transactions. The PROTECT IP Act requires financial transaction providers and internet advertising services to prevent transactions and advertising for infringing Internet sites. Failure to comply can result in injunctive relief, with a possible defense for lack of technical means. Federal courts will govern the issuance of court orders. Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs how federal courts may issue injunctive relief in actions involving the Attorney General and domestic or nondomestic parties. The rule requires notice to the adverse party before issuing a preliminary injunction, and allows for a temporary restraining order without notice in certain circumstances. Prior to the issuance of a preliminary injunction, the party targeted is entitled to notice and a hearing. An ex parte temporary restraining order can be granted without notice if stringent requirements are met. The Attorney General must provide notice of alleged violations under S. 968 to the domain name registrant or Internet site owner. The PROTECT IP Act imposes a similar notice requirement on the plaintiff. Any party bound by a court order can file a motion to modify, suspend, or vacate the order. The PROTECT IP Act allows for parties to file a motion with the court to modify, suspend, or vacate an order if the Internet site associated with the domain name is no longer dedicated to infringing activities or if the interests of justice require it. Financial transaction providers and Internet advertising services are immune from liability for taking action against infringing Internet sites in good faith. S. 968 provides immunity for refusing services to infringing Internet sites that sell counterfeit prescription medicine. The PROTECT IP Act allows for parties to file a motion with the court to modify, suspend, or vacate an order if the Internet site associated with the domain name is no longer dedicated to infringing activities. Financial transaction providers and Internet advertising services may refuse to provide services to Internet sites selling counterfeit prescription medicine. The PROTECT IP Act requires reports to Congress regarding its effectiveness and impact on Internet technologies from various government entities. SOPA contains two titles: Combating Online Piracy and Additional Enhancements to Combat Intellectual Property Theft. The second savings clause in SOPA clarifies that it does not affect copyright infringement liability under the Copyright Act. The severability clause states that if any provision of the act is deemed unconstitutional, other provisions remain unaffected. SOPA allows the Attorney General to take action against Internet sites classified as \"foreign infringing sites\" based on specific criteria. The Attorney General can take legal action against Internet sites involved in criminal trademark and copyright infringement under SOPA. This includes seizing foreign infringing sites or their domain names through in personam or in rem actions. Federal district courts can issue restraining orders or injunctions in such cases. The Attorney General can take legal action against foreign infringing sites under SOPA, including ordering the registrant or owner to cease activity. A court-approved process server can serve cease and desist orders to third parties, requiring them to prevent access to the infringing site. Service providers must take measures to block access to the site as quickly as possible. Internet search engines, payment network providers, and service providers must take technically feasible measures within 5 days of receiving a court order to prevent access to foreign infringing sites. Internet advertising services must take measures to prevent providing advertisements to foreign infringing sites within 5 days of receiving a court order. \"SOPA authorizes the Attorney General to bring an action for injunctive relief against any party that fails to comply with court-ordered obligations related to foreign infringing sites. Defendants can establish an affirmative defense if they cannot comply without incurring unreasonable economic burden. The Attorney General can also take action against entities providing products or services designed to circumvent measures taken by parties under the court order.\" \"SOPA allows for private right of action by qualifying plaintiffs against Internet sites dedicated to theft of U.S. property. Qualifying plaintiffs are intellectual property right holders harmed by such sites. SOPA defines a dedicated site as one primarily designed for offering goods or services that engage in theft of U.S. property.\" The SOPA legislation allows for private right of action against websites engaged in copyright infringement, circumvention of copyright protection systems, or selling counterfeit goods. It also authorizes written notifications to payment network providers and Internet advertising services. The SOPA legislation allows for written notifications to payment network providers and Internet advertising services regarding websites dedicated to the theft of U.S. property. Notifications must include specific facts supporting the claim, information about the site, and a statement establishing the provider's involvement with the site. The SOPA legislation requires payment network providers and Internet advertising services to take action against websites infringing on intellectual property rights. They must implement measures to prevent payment transactions or ads related to the infringing site within 5 days of receiving a notification. The site owner can respond with a counter notification. SOPA allows for a \"counter notification\" to be sent to the payment network provider or Internet advertising service, stating that the site does not meet the criteria of being dedicated to theft of U.S. property. Liability is imposed for knowingly misrepresenting a site or failing to comply with obligations. If a counter notification is filed or obligations are not met, a plaintiff can take legal action against the domain name registrant. SOPA authorizes federal district courts to issue orders against the registrant/owner of an Internet site dedicated to theft of U.S. property. A qualifying plaintiff can serve a cease and desist order on payment network providers and Internet advertising services. SOPA requires entities to comply with court orders related to online piracy. Failure to comply may result in monetary sanctions. Entities can defend themselves by proving they lack the technical means to comply without economic burden. Courts must follow Rule 65 of the FRCP when deciding on injunctive relief in actions against domestic or nondomestic parties. Rule 65 of the FRCP requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before issuing a preliminary injunction, but allows for an ex parte temporary restraining order in certain circumstances. SOPA allows for ex parte temporary restraining orders without notice to the adverse party if stringent requirements are met. The Attorney General must notify the alleged violator before proceeding under the act. Immunity is provided to third parties complying with court orders, and those affected can request modifications or relief from the court. SOPA grants immunity to certain third parties who take action against foreign infringing sites or sites dedicated to theft of U.S. property. This immunity applies to service providers, payment network providers, Internet advertising services, Internet search engines, domain name registries, and registrars. SOPA grants immunity to third parties like service providers, advertisers, and search engines who stop providing services to internet sites endangering public health by selling prescription medicine without a valid prescription or distributing adulterated medicine. It also mandates a study on enforcement effectiveness and the need for amendments to adapt to emerging technologies. SOPA requires the IPEC to identify and analyze notorious foreign infringers causing harm to intellectual property rights in the US, including their access to capital markets and potential prohibition from raising capital in the US. Section 201 of SOPA would amend criminal copyright statutes to provide additional penalties for unlawful public performances of copyrighted works over the Internet, including streaming. It authorizes prison sentences for those who willfully stream copyrighted material for commercial advantage or financial gain, as well as penalties for non-commercial public performances exceeding $1,000 in value. Section 202 of SOPA would amend criminal statutes to include penalties for trafficking counterfeit drugs, with severe penalties for harm caused to military or law enforcement personnel. Section 203 of SOPA increases penalties for theft of trade secrets benefiting foreign governments, with prison time raised to 20 years and fines from $500,000 to $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. Organizations face fines of $10,000,000 or 3 times the value of the stolen secret. Section 204 of SOPA directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and potentially amend sentencing guidelines for intellectual property offenses. Section 205 directs the Secretary of State and Secretary of Commerce to prioritize protecting U.S. intellectual property rights in foreign countries. The PROTECT IP Act and SOPA have raised concerns from various groups regarding the definitions used to describe infringing activity on Internet sites. These concerns have been addressed by supporters of the legislation, including intellectual property rights holders, labor unions, and businesses. The PROTECT IP Act and SOPA have raised concerns about potential impacts on legitimate speech protected by the First Amendment. Critics fear that the legislation could give copyright owners broad censorship powers and lack sufficient legal process. Eric Schmidt of Google warned that domain name blocking could set a dangerous precedent for online suppression of speech. Supporters of the legislation argue that existing copyright protections apply to the Internet and injunctions are a valid way to address copyright violations. The Register of Copyrights believes shutting down infringing websites does not violate the First Amendment, but caution is needed to avoid suppressing noninfringing expression. Concerns exist that restricting the global Internet could lead to censorship by non-democratic regimes. Supporters of the legislation argue that injunctions are a valid way to address copyright violations on the Internet, with caution needed to avoid suppressing noninfringing expression. They believe that the legislation provides sufficient procedural protections based on Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Opponents of the legislation have raised concerns that the bills may affect the integrity of the Internet, claiming that DNS blocking could impact reliability, security, and performance. They argue that domain name blocking is ineffective as sites can still be accessed through their IP addresses. The legislation could potentially undermine the integrity of the Web's architecture by incentivizing rogue operators to bypass domain names and use IP addresses instead. DNS filtering requirements conflict with DNS Security Extensions, hindering cybersecurity goals and innovation. Supporters of the legislation argue that DNS blocking provisions are crucial in combating foreign sites that infringe American intellectual property rights. They believe that taking down these sites is essential to prevent the destruction of content owners' ability to finance future content production. The Justice Department and rights holders face limitations in legal recourse against websites targeting American consumers and stealing American-owned intellectual property. Supporters argue that site blocking technology has no adverse impact on the Internet and that DNS filtering and DNSSEC can be compatible. Opponents fear that new enforcement mechanisms could be used to stifle Internet innovation and protect outdated business models. Technology companies are concerned that proposed legislation will lead to overwhelming lawsuits from content owners, increasing costs for consumers. They argue that the process will become a one-sided litigation machine. Proponents of the legislation argue that online infringement is rampant and law enforcement lacks resources to deter infringing activities. The proposed legislation aims to address online infringement, but technology companies argue it may lead to overwhelming lawsuits and increased costs for consumers. They point out that content owners lack the power to block domain names or websites under the bill. In contrast, the Attorney General has broader enforcement tools, including the ability to serve court orders on DNS operators, service providers, and search engines to prevent access to infringing websites. This provides more flexibility to the Attorney General than to copyright owners, which is seen as a sound policy choice at this time. The Department of Justice has experience fighting online infringers, will use resources carefully, must exercise prosecutorial discretion in bringing actions, and must plead its case to the court and obtain a court-issued order before proceeding. The legislation puts limited tools in the hands of copyright owners, giving the Attorney General sole authority to seek orders against search engines and Internet service providers. Section 512(m) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act explains that service providers seeking safe harbor from liability are not required to monitor their service. Critics of SOPA argue that the legislation could erode safe harbor protections for Internet companies under the DMCA by defining an \"Internet site dedicated to theft of U.S. property\" in a way that could impact companies hosting user-generated content websites like YouTube. SOPA creates uncertainty for Internet companies regarding their safe harbor protections under the DMCA, potentially deterring investment in new ventures. Critics argue that the legislation could impact companies hosting user-generated content websites like YouTube. Supporters of SOPA argue that the legislation's notification process is more effective than the DMCA's \"notice and takedown\" procedure, especially against foreign rogue sites and trademark infringement. They believe that SOPA's consequences for false claims, such as cutting off funds to websites, are necessary to combat online infringement. Supporters of SOPA argue that service providers have an incentive to remove infringing content to preserve their safe harbor from liability. Internet advertisers and payment processors may not comply with bad faith notices under SOPA as it could impact their revenue. Some supporters believe that strong copyright law promotes innovation and disagree that SOPA will hinder investment in new technology ventures. The Internet has seen significant growth and innovation since the enactment of DMCA, the NET Act, and the Grokster decision. House Judiciary Chairman Lamar Smith introduced a manager's amendment to SOPA, aligning it more closely with the PROTECT IP ACT. The amendment includes additional savings clauses to clarify that service providers are not required to monitor activity on their network or impair the security of the domain name system. The SOPA amendment removes the non-judicial \"written notification procedure\" for rights holders, leaving only one private enforcement mechanism requiring court authorization. It revises definitions to focus on foreign Internet sites, excluding domestic websites from the act's provisions. The SOPA amendment removes the requirement for criminal trademark and copyright infringement for foreign infringing sites. It changes the definition of an \"Internet site dedicated to theft of U.S. property\" to require commercial advantage or financial gain. The PROTECT IP Act revises the definition of a website engaging in infringement, removing language about deliberate actions to avoid confirming infringement. It introduces a new section stating that relief and obligations will be confined to a specifically identified portion of an Internet site found to be infringing or dedicated to theft of U.S. property. The manager's amendment to the PROTECT IP Act removes SOPA's requirement for service providers to prevent domain names from resolving to IP addresses and allows them to take the least burdensome measures to block access to infringing sites. It also eliminates the 5-day time limit for third parties to take action against infringement. The manager's amendment to the PROTECT IP Act removes SOPA's requirement for service providers to prevent domain names from resolving to IP addresses and allows them to take the least burdensome measures to block access to infringing sites. Senator Wyden introduced the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN Act) as an alternative to PROTECT IP Act and SOPA, with a similar version introduced in the House. The OPEN Act aims to address unfair competition and acts related to digital trade. The International Trade Commission (ITC) enforces Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which prohibits unfair competition and intellectual property rights violations in the importation of products into the United States. The ITC can order U.S. Customs and Border Protection to stop imports and issue cease and desist orders against violators. The majority of cases involve patent infringement, and the proposed OPEN Act would amend the Tariff Act to address unfair trade practices. The OPEN Act proposes to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 by adding a new section 337A, targeting unfair trade practices related to copyright and trademark infringement on certain internet sites. It defines \"infringing activity\" as copyright infringement, circumvention of copyright protection systems, or sale of counterfeit goods. An \"Internet site dedicated to infringing activity\" is described as a foreign site targeting U.S. residents with a primary purpose of engaging in infringing activities. The OPEN Act proposes to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 by adding a new section 337A, targeting unfair trade practices related to copyright and trademark infringement on certain internet sites. It defines \"infringing activity\" as copyright infringement, circumvention of copyright protection systems, or sale of counterfeit goods. An \"Internet site dedicated to infringing activity\" is described as a foreign site targeting U.S. residents with a primary purpose of engaging in infringing activities. The Act provides exclusions for Internet sites that comply with DMCA notice and takedown requests, qualify for DMCA safe harbor, or distribute non-infringing content and goods. The ITC would have the authority to determine violations and investigate only websites with nondomestic domain names. The OPEN Act empowers the ITC to investigate copyright and trademark infringement on foreign websites targeting U.S. residents. The ITC can act on its own or upon receiving a complaint from a rights holder. Owners of infringed copyrights or trademarks can file a complaint with the ITC, which must terminate investigations if the site operator consents to U.S. jurisdiction. The OPEN Act empowers the ITC to investigate copyright and trademark infringement on foreign websites targeting U.S. residents. The complainant must notify the registrant of the domain name and any financial transaction provider or Internet advertising company involved. The ITC determines if the website is in violation of section 337A, with final determinations appealable to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The President can disapprove ITC determinations for policy reasons within 60 days. The OPEN Act allows the President to disapprove any ITC determination \"for policy reasons\" within 60 days. It permits electronic submission of information, hearings, and testimony to lower costs. The ITC can issue orders against infringing Internet sites after determining violations of section 337A. The OPEN Act allows the ITC to issue temporary cease and desist orders against Internet sites found in violation of section 337A, following procedures similar to rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The ITC chairperson must give the site owner/operator an opportunity to be heard before issuing such an order. The ITC chairperson may issue a temporary cease and desist order against Internet sites in violation of section 337A, with a maximum duration of 14 days. The order can be extended for additional 14-day periods for good cause or with consent. A bond may be required from the complainant to discourage frivolous petitions, which could be forfeited if the site is later found not in violation. The ITC may allow the complainant to serve a cease and desist order on financial transaction providers or Internet advertising services if they are providing services to an Internet site subject to such an order. These third parties must take prompt measures to prevent payment transactions or serving advertisements to the site. The OPEN Act provides immunity from civil actions for compliance efforts. The Attorney General can seek injunctive relief against those failing to comply with a cease and desist order. The OPEN Act allows for injunctive relief against those who fail to comply with a cease and desist order. It also grants immunity to financial transaction providers and Internet advertising services for refusing to provide services to websites selling prescription medication without a valid prescription. The OPEN Act grants immunity to various service providers and allows the ITC to appoint section 337 judges with legal experience to preside over investigations related to online piracy and counterfeiting. The OPEN Act focuses on addressing online piracy and counterfeiting internationally through the International Trade Commission. It does not involve Internet service providers or search engines, avoiding domain name system filtering. Unlike the PROTECT IP Act and SOPA, the OPEN Act only applies to foreign websites, not domestic ones. Additionally, it does not allow rights holders to take legal action in federal courts against rogue websites; they must seek relief through the ITC."
