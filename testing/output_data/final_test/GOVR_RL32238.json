    "content": "The Bush Administration prioritized defense transformation for the Department of Defense (DOD) early on, which influenced debates on U.S. defense policy. While still mentioned in administration documents, defense transformation is less prominent now than in the past. This report focuses on DOD-wide perspectives on defense transformation. The term defense transformation gained popularity among military officials and analysts in the late. Defense transformation, popular among military officials and analysts in the late 1990s, involves large-scale, discontinuous changes in military weapons, organization, and concepts of operations prompted by technology advancements or new security challenges. Advocates emphasize that it differs from incremental modernization efforts, focusing on disruptive forms of change in both weapons and systems, as well as organization and operational concepts. Defense transformation involves significant changes in military weapons, organization, and concepts of operations. Changes in organization and concepts of operation can be as important as changes in weapons and systems in bringing about transformation. DOD defines transformation as a process that shapes military competition through new combinations of concepts, capabilities, people, and organizations to sustain our strategic position and promote peace and stability. Transformation is a continuous process with no end point. Transformation is a continuous process that anticipates and creates the future, dealing with the co-evolution of concepts, processes, organizations, and technology. It aims to sustain U.S. competitive advantage in warfare by creating new competitive areas, competencies, and leveraging new sources of power. The Administration's view of transformation has evolved to emphasize it as a continuing process rather than one with an endpoint, making changes in combat forces, warfighting doctrine, training, personnel management, logistics, and worldwide basing arrangements. The Administration's definition of transformation includes changes in DOD business policies, practices, and procedures to streamline operations and reduce costs. It also involves moving new weapon technologies from the laboratory to the field more quickly. Observers equate transformation with making U.S. forces more mobile, agile, and lethal through unmanned vehicles, advanced technologies, and special operations forces. Others see transformation as network-centric warfare and the technologies needed to implement it. Some definitions of transformation in the military include making forces more expeditionary, improving specific capabilities, and modernizing weapons. The concept is also related to Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) from the early 1990s. The term Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) emerged in the early 1990s to describe major changes in warfare. It is distinguished from transformation, which involves adapting military weapons, concepts, and organization in response to an RMA. The Department of Defense has released various documents outlining defense transformation plans. The Administration's vision for defense transformation, outlined in the Planning Guidance of April 2003, emphasizes irregular warfare, catastrophic security threats, and disruptive events. It calls for a shift away from massed forces and attrition-style warfare towards joint operations, NCW, and effects-based operations. The Administration's vision for defense transformation includes a shift towards joint operations, NCW, effects-based operations, and precision application of firepower. It also involves changes in training practices, personnel management, logistics operations, and energy requirements to streamline practices and accelerate the fielding of new weapons. The Department of Defense's transformation effort focuses on achieving six critical operational goals and consists of four essential pillars. These goals include protecting bases, projecting forces in anti-access environments, denying enemy sanctuary, leveraging information technology, assuring information systems, and enhancing space capabilities. The transformation effort aims to shift the balance of U.S. forces and broaden capabilities. The Department of Defense's transformation effort aims to shift the balance of U.S. forces and broaden capabilities through four military transformation pillars: strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. intelligence advantages, concept development and experimentation, and developing transformational capabilities. The first pillar focuses on joint operations, the second on intelligence advantages. The Department of Defense's transformation effort involves four pillars: joint operations, intelligence advantages, concept development, and transformational capabilities. The third pillar focuses on experimenting with new warfare approaches and capabilities through war gaming and simulations to address emerging challenges. The fourth pillar requires strong mechanisms to implement results from experimentation and develop transformational capabilities to support Joint Operating Concepts. The Department of Defense is transforming its approach to meet new strategic challenges, shifting from peacetime to wartime urgency, predictable to uncertain environments, and single-focused to complex threats. This includes tailored deterrence for rogue powers and decentralized network threats from non-state enemies. The Department of Defense is transitioning from traditional deterrence to tailored deterrence for various threats, emphasizing proactive measures, shaping the future, capabilities-based planning, rapid adaptive planning, and a focus on effects rather than kinetics. This transformation involves moving from static defense to expeditionary operations, combat-ready units, and battle-hardened forces, with a shift towards more powerful operational capabilities. The Department of Defense is transitioning from traditional deterrence to tailored deterrence for various threats, emphasizing proactive measures, shaping the future, capabilities-based planning, rapid adaptive planning, and a focus on effects rather than kinetics. This transformation involves moving from static defense to expeditionary operations, combat-ready units, and battle-hardened forces, with a shift towards more powerful operational capabilities. Additionally, the shift includes changes from major conventional combat operations to multiple irregular, asymmetric operations, from massing forces to massing effects, and from single Service acquisition systems to joint portfolio management. The Department of Defense is transitioning to a more integrated and dynamic approach, focusing on tailored deterrence and proactive measures. This includes reorganizing the Army into modular, brigade-sized forces for easier deployment. The shift involves moving from static defense to expeditionary operations, combat-ready units, and a focus on building partner capabilities. Additionally, there is a move towards tracking outputs rather than inputs, and utilizing interagency approaches for solutions. The Air Force and Navy are undergoing transformation plans to improve expeditionary capabilities, utilize new technologies, and enhance joint operations. Key elements include reorganizing for expeditionary missions, operating in littoral waters, and implementing NCW and unmanned vehicles. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) was created by DOD in October 2001 to implement transformation plans, with a small staff and budget. OFT issued guidance, reviewed transformation plans, generated ideas, and supported transformation efforts within DOD. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) was led by retired Navy Vice Admiral Arthur K. Cebrowski from 2001 to 2005, who advocated for defense transformation. After Cebrowski's departure, the office was dissolved in 2006, with its functions transferred to other DOD offices. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) led by retired Navy Vice Admiral Arthur K. Cebrowski from 2001 to 2005 advocated for defense transformation. After Cebrowski's departure, the office was dissolved in 2006, with its research and development projects transferred to DOD's Director for Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E), and its operation and maintenance activities transferred to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. The Defense Department's decision in August 2006 to close OFT left many wondering about the fate of its programs and track record of innovation. DOD folded most of OFT into a reorganized policy office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, but the role of the new office is still being finalized. Terry Pudas, former acting director of OFT, now serves as acting deputy assistant secretary of Defense for forces transformation and resources in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy. The decision to move OFT inside OSD's policy structure was seen as both beneficial and challenging. While former OFT employees are now more directly involved in policy development, they spend a significant amount of time in meetings rather than focusing on new initiatives. Pudas' new office, housing 20 staff members, focuses on collaborating with other offices and overseeing policy concerns of Joint Forces and Transportation commands. The former OFT's unique character has been lost, with a shift towards project funding and technology concept development activities now under Defense research and engineering. Proximity to policy-making doesn't guarantee increased influence, according to Garstka. DOD has embraced network-centric operations, applying OFT's framework to various case studies. Projects and research funding from OFT were transferred to the Office of the Director for Defense Research and Engineering. The Operational Experimentation Division will house these projects as they reach the demonstration phase. The DOD is transitioning projects from the Office of Force Transformation to new, higher-risk initiatives to ensure fiscal sustainability. They are focusing on balancing investments in information technology with other capabilities to improve usability. The US Joint Forces Command has been designated as the military's primary transformation laboratory to drive innovation. The US Joint Forces Command is designated as the military's primary transformation laboratory, focusing on joint concept development, experimentation, training, interoperability, and integration to enhance combatant commanders' capabilities in implementing the president's strategy. It develops operational concepts, tests them through experimentation, educates joint leaders, and recommends joint solutions to better integrate warfighting capabilities. USJFCOM plays a crucial role in addressing joint warfighter interoperability issues by developing and prioritizing solutions. They work closely with combatant commanders, services, and government agencies to identify and resolve deficiencies. The Administration has also revised acquisition regulations to reduce costs and acquisition cycle time, with a focus on evolutionary acquisition with spiral development (EA/SD). The Department of Defense (DOD) has adopted evolutionary acquisition with spiral development (EA/SD) as its new preferred acquisition strategy to be more responsive to rapid changes in threats, technology, and warfighter needs. Calculating the potential cost of defense transformation is complex due to differing opinions on what qualifies as transformational changes and the expenses involved in developing new weapons and equipment. Implementing transformational changes in organization can cost money, but these costs might be offset by reduced recurring costs. Staging expensive exercises to explore new warfighting concepts can be balanced by curtailing older concept development exercises. Transformation is seen as a continuous process, making cost calculations snapshots rather than final figures. Transformation goes beyond program lists, involving innovative ideas, concepts, and organizations. Some analysts advocate defense transformation as a cost-neutral or cost-reducing proposition, emphasizing that it offers a less-expensive strategy for addressing future security challenges compared to incremental changes. Increasing the defense budget could hinder transformation by giving officials a false sense of security. The Administration aims to incorporate private-sector practices in DOD operations to run more efficiently and generate savings for transformation. Transformation should focus on making new choices and using a different logic, rather than just increasing the defense budget. Transformation in the military involves making better choices and changes in organization and operations, rather than just increasing the budget. There is debate over which weapons and systems are truly transformational, with different experts having varying opinions. Supporters of weapon procurement programs argue for their systems to be seen as transformational, rather than labeled as \"legacy\" and outdated. The military transformation involves making strategic changes in organization and operations, rather than just increasing the budget. Various weapons and systems have been labeled as transformational, including C4ISR systems, missile defense, unmanned vehicles, and special operations forces. Some observers consider certain weapons as non-transformational or legacy. The Administration's transformation plans may impact U.S. defense spending and the defense industrial base. Transformational programs could see increased spending, while non-transformational or legacy programs may receive less funding. The Administration's transformation plan could lead to increased DOD spending for large-scale systems integration work, which is necessary to connect military weapons and systems into functioning \"systems of systems.\" Some defense firms, especially larger ones, are enhancing their capabilities for this work. Implementing the plan may shift revenues within diversified contractors without major impact on the bottom line, but individual units within these firms could be more affected. Some defense firms, especially larger ones, are enhancing their capabilities for large-scale systems integration work as part of the Administration's transformation plan. This could lead to a shift in DOD spending towards firms that specialize in certain defense goods or services, potentially impacting revenues and employment levels. The plan may also encourage non-traditional DOD contractors to start doing business with the Department. The Department of Defense (DOD) is encouraging non-traditional contractors to do business with them to maximize the use of civilian sector technologies. They are working towards a transformed force capable of effective combined operations with other countries' military forces. U.S. transformation objectives should shape and complement foreign military developments for international military cooperation. There are concerns that U.S. defense transformation could widen the gap between U.S. and foreign military capabilities. The transformation of U.S. forces may reduce compatibility with allied forces, leading to decreased coalition effectiveness and increased risks of friendly-fire incidents. The ability of U.S. forces to participate in combined operations with foreign military forces depends on decisions made by foreign governments, such as investing in compatible networking technologies for Network-Centric Warfare (NCW). Investing in networking technologies for Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) is crucial for maintaining interoperability between U.S. forces and foreign military forces. Without compatible technologies, combined operations may be in name only, with foreign forces relegated to marginal functions. Decision-making by U.S. and foreign leaders to align concepts of operations and conduct combined exercises is essential for improving future interoperability. The importance of coordinating exercises and concepts of operations for effective combined operations and interoperability is highlighted. Countries like the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden are mentioned for their accelerated efforts in network-centric operations. Countries like Sweden and Singapore, along with organizations such as Allied Command Transformation and NATO Reaction Force, are leading the way in defense transformation. Congress has also played a significant role in promoting jointness within the Department of Defense through legislation like the Goldwater-Nichols Act. In 1986, Congress passed legislation to strengthen the position of Special Operations Forces (SOF) by establishing the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) as a new unified command. This action can be seen as an early example of defense transformation, which has become a key element in enhancing special operations forces. The authorization act (P.L. 106-398) set goals for unmanned vehicles in the military, aiming for one-third of aircraft and ground combat vehicles to be unmanned by certain deadlines. An oversight issue for Congress is how the Department of Defense (DOD) will prioritize transformation under new leadership, with Robert Gates taking over from Donald Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld was a key advocate for DOD's transformation plans, while Gates has a background in intelligence rather than defense. Prior to becoming Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld focused on intelligence rather than defense. He advocated for a smaller, high-tech military force. However, under new Defense Secretary Robert Gates, the emphasis on defense transformation has taken a backseat to immediate military needs and budget challenges. Gates is prioritizing understanding the world over transformation efforts. Under Rumsfeld's leadership, the military aimed for transformation but faced opposition due to decisions like relying more on special forces and cutting weapon systems. Despite his reputation for dismissing military advice, Rumsfeld is also recognized for bringing corporate reform to the Defense Department. Under Rumsfeld's leadership, he improved the Defense Department's financial controls and made unpopular changes to the civilian workforce. Supporters credit him with tough decisions, military transformation, cutting outdated weapons systems, advancing missile defense, and reorganizing the Army for adaptability. Critics disagreed with cutting Army divisions and allowing strong-willed deputies to influence military decisions. Critics of Rumsfeld accuse him of disregarding warnings and creating a military prison at Guantanamo Bay. However, supporters argue that he accelerated the military's transformation towards a more agile and capable force. Mr. Rumsfeld's \"transformation\" program at the Pentagon focused on missile defense and space-based systems. He clashed with Army leadership over their reliance on heavy forces. Despite mixed success, he revamped the military base system worldwide. He played a role in selecting generals for the Iraq war, pushing them to shape their recommendations. Mr. Rumsfeld's transformation program at the Pentagon had mixed success. He overhauled the military base system worldwide and promoted greater cooperation among military services. However, few major weapons programs were canceled, and the military's structure and spending remained largely unchanged. Transformation was more promise than reality under his leadership. During Rumsfeld's tenure as Secretary of Defense, certain elements of DOD's transformation vision were debated, including network-centric warfare, force size, Army transformation, air power vs. ground forces balance, special operations forces, reserve forces, and ballistic missile defense. Positive steps were taken to implement a strategy for transforming U.S. military capabilities, but Iraq's denial of time hindered progress. The U.S. military has taken positive steps to transform its capabilities but lacks clear leadership and accountability. Responsibility for transformation is spread among various DOD organizations without overarching leadership. An informal group discusses transformation issues but lacks formal authority. Key practices for successful transformation include clear leadership, accountability, and crosscutting implementation teams. In recent testimony on DOD's business transformation, it was highlighted that accountability for performance and the use of crosscutting implementation teams are crucial for success. DOD lacks clear leadership and accountability for transformation, with responsibility spread among various organizations without overarching leadership. DOD officials believe existing informal mechanisms can implement needed changes, but without clear leadership and formal implementation, resolving competing priorities may be challenging. DOD may struggle with resolving competing priorities, directing resources effectively, and ensuring progress amid changes in senior personnel. Informal mechanisms lack transparency and assurance to Congress on resource allocation. While DOD's strategy for military transformation is a good start, it lacks results-oriented management tools to aid in implementation and focus on achieving results. The initial transformation goals set in 2001 have not been revised to reflect new joint concepts, hindering the development of performance goals and measures. DOD faces challenges in developing tools for transformation due to concurrent development of joint concepts and acquisition plans. Without results-oriented tools, it will be difficult to measure progress and transparency in investments. Concerns exist about the focus, realism, and scripting of experiments and exercises for transformational warfighting ideas. To ensure successful transformation, Congress should address questions related to tests and exercises. DOD officials emphasize the need to foster a culture of innovation, which involves creating receptiveness to new ideas, protecting innovators, and avoiding a \"zero-defect\" approach. Challenges include resistance to change, reluctance to adopt external ideas, and senior officers adhering to traditional practices. The 2002 survey of U.S. military officers showed mixed evidence on the creation of a culture of innovation. Transformation in the military is complex and difficult to measure progress. Congress may need better tools to assess the Department of Defense's progress in implementing transformation, including organizing budget documents to support the concept of transformation. The text discusses the need for better organization and content of budget documents to support DOD transformation efforts. It questions if Congress receives detailed information on transformation progress and suggests the use of metrics to measure military capability and assess DOD's success in implementing transformation. Some observers are concerned that the term \"transformation\" has become an empty slogan due to its frequent use by the Administration. The Administration's use of the term \"transformation\" as a rhetorical tool for justifying various proposals for DOD raised concerns about minimal debate and tying the concept to the war on terrorism. This was highlighted by the \"Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act of 2003,\" which included significant changes to DOD policies and reporting requirements. The Administration's use of the term \"transformation\" to justify DOD proposals raised concerns about potential misuse and lack of clarity. Key oversight questions for Congress include whether the term was overused, if distinctions were made between transformational and non-transformational proposals, and if it was used to distract from detailed oversight. The proposed FY2008 defense budget was submitted to Congress in early February 2008, potentially to distract Congress from conducting detailed oversight on DOD's proposed budgets or keep Congress off balance during oversight of DOD activities."
