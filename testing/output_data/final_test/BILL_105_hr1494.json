    "content": "The \"Apprehension of Tainted Money Act of 1997\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 introduces special rules for the treatment of contributions to be returned to donors by political committees under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Section 323 of the Act requires political committees to transfer contributions over $500 intended for return to the Commission for handling. The Commission will assess the circumstances of the return to determine if any violations have occurred. Additionally, the Commission is mandated to establish an escrow account for these contributions. The Commission is required to establish a single interest-bearing escrow account for contributions over $500 transferred from political committees. Upon receiving the amounts, the Commission will deposit them in the account and notify the Attorney General. Any interest earned will cover administrative costs, with the remaining interest deposited in the Treasury's general fund. The Commission or the Attorney General may require contributions in the escrow account to cover fines, penalties, and investigation costs under the Act, Title 18, or the Internal Revenue Code. The Commission will return a contribution from the escrow account if it is not under investigation, will not be used for fines or penalties, or if the necessary amounts have been withdrawn. The Commission will return contributions from the escrow account if no investigation has been pursued within 120 days. The amendment applies to contributions returned after the enactment date, regardless of regulatory issuance by the Federal Election Commission or Attorney General. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE FOR REGULATIONS. The Federal Election Commission and the Attorney General must issue final regulations for section 323 of the Federal Election Campaign Act within 30 days of this Act's enactment."
