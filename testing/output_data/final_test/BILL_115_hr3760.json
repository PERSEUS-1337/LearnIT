    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2017\". Congress acknowledges the historical attempts to regulate usurious interest rates in America, including the 2006 Federal 36-percent annualized usury cap for servicemembers. Despite efforts to curb predatory lending, high-cost lending persists in all 50 States due to loopholes in State laws and the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap, leading consumers to pay billions annually on high-cost overdraft loans. The cost of high-cost lending to consumers is significant, with approximately $7 billion on payday loans, $3.8 billion on car title loans, and undisclosed amounts on online installment loans. Consumers pay exorbitant interest rates, such as 400% annually for payday loans, 300% for car title loans, and up to 17,000% for overdraft loans. A national maximum interest rate is needed to combat predatory lending, along with promoting alternatives like small dollar loans with minimal fees and affordable repayment plans. SEC. 140B. MAXIMUM RATES OF INTEREST. SEC. 140B prohibits creditors from extending credit to consumers if the fee and interest rate exceed 36 percent. The term 'fee and interest rate' includes all charges related to credit extension, such as numerical periodic rates, annual fees, cash advance fees, and membership fees. The text discusses various fees related to credit extension, including cash advance fees, membership fees, late fees, overdraft fees, and credit insurance premiums. These fees are subject to rules defined by the Bureau. The text discusses credit obligation fees, excluding certain fees from the finance charge if they meet specific criteria. The creditor may extend credit for 12 months with a minimum amount of $300, charge a late fee of up to $20 per late payment or per month, and impose a fee of up to $15 for insufficient funds. Adjustments for inflation may be made by the Bureau. The Bureau may adjust tolerances for inflation to protect consumers and prevent circumvention of the 36-percent fee and interest rate limit. For open end credit plans, fees and interest rates are calculated monthly based on the sum of charges over the past year divided by the average daily balance. The Bureau adjusts inflation tolerances to protect consumers and prevent circumvention of the 36-percent fee and interest rate limit for open end credit plans. Fees and interest rates are calculated based on charges over the past year divided by the average daily balance, with specific methods outlined for credit plans open less than 1 year. The Bureau may adjust calculations to protect consumers and prevent circumvention of the 36-percent fee and interest rate limit. The term 'creditor' is defined as in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. No exemptions are allowed for disclosure requirements. Additional disclosure requirements apply to credit other than open end credit plans. The Bureau may prescribe regulations for disclosure of fees and interest rates in open end credit plans. State laws providing greater consumer protection than this section are not preempted. Any payment compensating a creditor in violation of this section is null and void, and the creditor must return all funds to the consumer promptly. The section outlines penalties for violations related to debt collection, including imprisonment and fines. State attorneys general can enforce this section in court. The section allows state attorneys general to enforce penalties for debt collection violations in court within 3 years from the date of the violation. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to require disclosure of fee and interest rate for open end credit plans under section 140B."
