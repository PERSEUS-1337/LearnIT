CEDAW focuses on women's rights and has been ratified by 189 countries. The U.S. is the only nation to have signed but not ratified CEDAW. President Jimmy Carter submitted it to the Senate in 1980, but it has not been considered for ratification. Other countries not party to CEDAW include Iran, Palau, Somalia, Sudan, and Tonga. The U.S. has debated ratifying the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) since 1979. President Jimmy Carter submitted it to the Senate in 1980, but it has not been considered for ratification. The Obama Administration and Secretary of State John Kerry have expressed support for CEDAW, while opponents fear it may undermine national sovereignty. The U.S. has debated ratifying the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) since 1979. Supporters argue it is a valuable mechanism for fighting women's discrimination worldwide, while opponents fear it may undermine national sovereignty. The report addresses CEDAW's background, objectives, and structure, as well as issues raised in the U.S. ratification debate. The CEDAW Committee recommendations focus on women's role in society, equal access to education and healthcare. Prior to CEDAW's adoption in 1979, U.N. member states had already adopted treaties addressing women's rights. The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women was drafted by the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women and adopted in 1979, calling for the elimination of discrimination against women in all areas of life. The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) aims to ensure equality for women in various aspects of life, including legal status, political participation, employment, education, healthcare, and family structure. It calls for the principle of equality of men and women to be embodied in national laws and for the elimination of discrimination based on sex. The Convention specifically addresses equal pay, rural women's rights, and the freedom to choose marriage. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was established in 1982 to monitor the implementation of the Convention. It consists of 23 independent experts elected by States Parties for a four-year term, with a focus on equitable geographic distribution. The majority of members are women with high moral standing and competence, representing different civilizations and legal systems. The Committee is led by a Chairperson, three Vice Chairpersons, and a rapporteur. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is led by a Chairperson, three Vice Chairpersons, and a rapporteur, elected by Committee members. The Chairperson directs discussions, represents the Convention at international events, and reports annually to the U.N. General Assembly. The Committee meets twice a year in Geneva, is one of seven U.N. human rights treaty bodies, and reviews national CEDAW implementation reports. States Parties must submit reports every four years. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) requires states parties to submit reports every four years after ratification or accession. The Committee engages in dialogue with reporting countries, makes nonbinding general recommendations, and has issued over 30 recommendations since 1986. An Optional Protocol to strengthen the Convention was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on October 6, 1999, and has been ratified by 106 countries. The Protocol entered into force in December 2000 and has been ratified by 106 countries. It includes a \"communications procedure\" for complaints and an \"inquiry procedure\" for exploring abuses of women's rights. Successive U.S. Administrations and Members of Congress have supported the Convention's goal of eliminating discrimination against women, but there is disagreement on its effectiveness. The Obama Administration has expressed support for the Convention. The Obama Administration has expressed support for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stating that ratification will be a priority. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer also supported U.S. ratification of CEDAW, emphasizing its importance in promoting and defending women's rights worldwide. The Obama Administration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed strong support for the ratification of CEDAW to promote women's rights globally. President Carter signed the Convention in 1980, but subsequent administrations did not support ratification until the Clinton Administration in 1994. The Clinton Administration supported CEDAW ratification in 1994, sending a treaty package to the Senate with proposed reservations. The SFRC reported the Convention favorably, but it never came to a full Senate vote due to opposition from some Senators. The reservations addressed issues like \"private conduct,\" \"combat assignments,\" and \"comparable worth.\" The Clinton Administration submitted three understandings regarding the CEDAW treaty, addressing issues such as combat positions, comparable worth, and paid maternity leave. These understandings clarified that the US would fulfill its obligations in a manner consistent with federal roles, not accept restrictions on freedom of speech, and have the discretion to determine health and family planning services. The Clinton Administration proposed declarations for the CEDAW treaty, including a \"non-self-executing\" provision and a \"dispute settlement\" provision. The Bush Administration supported the goal of eradicating discrimination against women globally but had concerns with the Convention, outlined in 2002 during SFRC hearings. Then-Secretary of State Colin Powell raised concerns about the vagueness of the text and the CEDAW Committee's record. The Bush Administration raised concerns about the vagueness of the CEDAW text and the CEDAW Committee's recommendations, citing controversial interpretations that were contrary to American law and sensibilities. They emphasized the need to ensure the Convention would not conflict with U.S. laws and highlighted issues with the 1994 proposed declarations. The Bush Administration raised concerns about the CEDAW Convention conflicting with U.S. laws and urged the SFRC to delay voting until a legal review was complete. The Convention has been pending in the SFRC for over 30 years, with hearings held in 1988, 1990, and 1994, but no final vote in the full Senate. The incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jesse Helms, blocked further consideration of CEDAW in the 104th Congress due to concerns about its impact on U.S. sovereignty and laws related to abortion and family planning. In June 2002, the SFRC held hearings on U.S. ratification of CEDAW, and on July 30, 2002, the committee approved the Convention with reservations, understandings, and declarations, including those recommended by the Clinton Administration in 1994 and additional understandings, one of which clarified that the Convention does not create any right to abortion. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law held a public hearing on U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in November 2010. The House of Representatives has also shown interest in CEDAW. The House of Representatives has shown interest in CEDAW, with Representative Carolyn Maloney introducing a resolution urging Senate ratification. Policy decisions and concerns about national sovereignty play a role in the debate over U.S. ratification of CEDAW. Opponents fear it would undermine U.S. sovereignty by favoring international law over constitutional law. Many critics are concerned that ratifying the CEDAW Convention would give the Committee authority over U.S. government and private citizens on issues like abortion and prostitution. Advocates argue that ratification would not affect national sovereignty, as the U.S. could make reservations and require implementing legislation. Advocates argue that implementing CEDAW would not interfere with U.S. laws or citizens' private lives. The Committee relies on countries to fulfill obligations and lacks enforcement power. Senator Biden proposed an understanding that the Committee cannot compel States Parties to follow recommendations. Supporters and opponents debate CEDAW's effectiveness in addressing women's rights internationally. Opponents of CEDAW question its effectiveness in improving women's rights globally, citing concerns that it may not address the issue effectively and could even be used as a cover for ongoing atrocities in countries that have ratified it. Supporters argue that CEDAW provides a formal mechanism to raise awareness of women's issues on a national and international level, especially in developing countries. Studies and research on CEDAW's implementation are used to support this position. Studies and research have shown that some countries like Brazil and Colombia have incorporated CEDAW provisions into their national constitutions. The First CEDAW Impact Study highlighted the effectiveness of CEDAW at the national level, with examples such as Turkey citing CEDAW in court cases and Nepal forming a taskforce to review laws inconsistent with the Convention. In Saudi Arabia, CEDAW is being used to draft new laws. In Saudi Arabia, CEDAW is being used to draft a new law allowing women lawyers to try family cases in court. In the Philippines, the Magna Carta of Women was introduced in 2009, heavily relying on CEDAW provisions. In Costa Rica, the Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that the Legislative Assembly President had not named a proportionate number of women to the Assembly's committees, violating the constitution and CEDAW. In Zambia, the High Court ruled in 1997 that the Intercontinental Hotel discriminated against women for not allowing them to enter unaccompanied by a male companion. Despite progress, supporters continue to push for gender equality. In Saudi Arabia, CEDAW is being used to draft a new law allowing women lawyers to try family cases in court.

In Zambia, the High Court ruled in 1997 that the Intercontinental Hotel discriminated against women for not allowing them to enter unaccompanied by a male companion. Despite progress, supporters continue to push for gender equality. However, challenges remain in fully implementing CEDAW, with barriers such as alienation of national governments from civil society, lack of government support, difficulty in implementing gender-integrated policies, and lack of public awareness. The effectiveness of CEDAW is largely dependent on the political will of governments, and concerns have been raised about reservations filed by States Parties that may undermine the treaty's intent and effectiveness. Many States Parties filed reservations to certain provisions of CEDAW, citing compatibility issues with Islamic Shari'a law or values. Some countries objected to these reservations, arguing they conflict with the Convention's purpose. Despite concerns, proponents believe the benefits of CEDAW's widespread ratification outweigh drawbacks of imposed conditions. Supporters of CEDAW argue that widespread ratification, including withdrawals of reservations by countries like the Bahamas, France, Germany, and Ireland, outweighs drawbacks. They believe U.S. ratification would enhance credibility internationally and strengthen advocacy for women's rights globally. Nonratification could hinder the U.S.'s ability to combat discrimination against women and advocate for women's rights abroad. The United States' failure to ratify CEDAW is seen as a hindrance in combating discrimination against women and advocating for women's rights globally. Supporters argue that ratification would enhance international credibility and provide additional platforms to address human rights issues. Critics argue that U.S. ratification of CEDAW is unnecessary as the country is already a leader in promoting women's rights and that the treaty is more suited for countries with lesser human rights records. They also believe that current U.S. laws and policies on gender discrimination demonstrate the country's commitment to women's equality. Opponents of CEDAW argue that U.S. ratification is unnecessary and could lead to unfounded political criticisms. They are concerned about potential impacts on U.S. privacy laws and traditional family roles. They believe improvements in women's rights in other countries should be made by their respective governments. Critics of CEDAW are concerned about provisions that could undermine traditional family roles by promoting gender equality and shared responsibility in child-rearing. They argue that the treaty imposes predetermined values on governments, families, and individuals, regardless of national laws or personal beliefs. Some argue that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is criticized for disregarding established moral and ethical principles, discriminating against traditional families and diverse cultures. Proponents of CEDAW argue that it does not require redefining gender roles or family structures, leaving it to governments to decide appropriate actions based on domestic laws. They also point to Article 5 addressing gender stereotypes and violence against women. Some critics argue that CEDAW is criticized for disregarding moral and ethical principles, discriminating against traditional families and cultures. Concerns include the impact on women's roles as mothers and caregivers, with opponents citing the Committee's recommendation to Belarus in 2000 as evidence of redefining traditional roles. Supporters argue that CEDAW does not require redefining gender roles or family structures, leaving it to governments to decide appropriate actions based on domestic laws. Supporters argue that the CEDAW Committee was not criticizing Mother's Day but responding to Belarus's celebration of the holiday as the only solution to women's issues. Critics fear that U.S. ratification of CEDAW may undermine parental rights, particularly concerning Article 16(d) which could give the Committee authority over U.S. children's best interests. Proponents argue that CEDAW supports parental roles in child-rearing and does not infringe on parental rights due to constitutional limitations on government interference in private matters. Concerns led to a \"private conduct\" reservation in 1994 to ensure the U.S. only regulates private conduct as mandated by law. Some CEDAW supporters object to the proposed reservation, arguing that it implies a lack of political commitment by the United States and suggests that the treaty is only applicable in other countries. The debate also revolves around whether the Convention takes a stance on abortion or is abortion neutral, with supporters pointing out that the word \"abortion\" is not mentioned in the text. The Clinton Administration declared the treaty abortion neutral in 1994. Additionally, supporters highlight that countries with regulated or illegal abortion, such as Burkina Faso, Colombia, and Ireland, have ratified the Convention. Opponents of U.S. ratification of CEDAW argue that certain parts of the Convention text could potentially undermine current U.S. abortion laws. They specifically point to Article 12(1) and Article 16(1)(e) as areas of concern, suggesting that the language in these articles could lead to changes in state abortion policies. Opponents of U.S. ratification of CEDAW argue that certain parts of the Convention text could potentially undermine current U.S. abortion laws. They suggest that the language in Article 16(1)(e) could lead to the abolishment of state parental notification laws, require federal funding for abortions, or obligate the U.S. government to promote and provide access to abortion. Supporters of CEDAW emphasize that States Parties have the discretion to determine appropriate measures based on their domestic laws and policies. Malta and Monaco have explicitly stated in their reservations that they do not interpret Article 16(1)(e) as imposing or forcing the legalization of abortion in their respective countries. The CEDAW Committee's recommendations on abortion are a contentious issue in the U.S. ratification debate. Critics argue that the Committee's General Recommendation 24 suggests support for abortion, despite it not being mentioned in the CEDAW text. They point to the recommendation to amend legislation criminalizing abortion and criticize the Committee for seemingly encouraging abortion in individual countries. The CEDAW Committee's recommendations on abortion have sparked controversy, with critics opposing suggestions to decriminalize or legalize abortion and to limit conscientious objector policies in individual countries. Some fear that the Committee's interpretation of CEDAW could be used to challenge abortion laws globally, citing instances like the Constitutional Court of Colombia's 2006 decision influenced by CEDAW. The CEDAW Committee recommends that abortion should not be considered a crime in certain circumstances, but critics fear this could challenge global abortion laws. The Committee relies on States Parties to fulfill treaty obligations and has expressed opposition to abortion as a method of family planning in some countries. Inadequate access to family planning leads to abortion being used as a method of birth control. The Committee aims to reduce abortion rates through education and family planning. Recommendations on abortion are made in specific circumstances, such as high abortion rates, reliance on abortion for family planning, or unsafe and illegal abortions causing high mortality rates. In 2002, the SFRC, chaired by former Senator Joseph Biden, held hearings on CEDAW ratification and reported the Convention favorably with several RUDs. The committee reported the Convention favorably with several RUDs, including the \"Helms understanding\" proposed by Senator Jesse Helms to clarify no right to abortion. Pro-life advocates supported this compromise to alleviate concerns about CEDAW affecting U.S. abortion laws. Pro-choice groups saw it as a way to increase chances of U.S. ratification for the benefit of women domestically and abroad. Some women's groups supporting ratification opposed the understanding, fearing it would promote abortion. Some opposed the Helms understanding in the CEDAW as it could be seen as abortion neutral, potentially legitimizing anti-abortion efforts. Pro-life opponents were divided on its impact on U.S. abortion laws, with some satisfied and others concerned. Suggestions were made to address abortion as a \"reservation\" rather than an \"understanding\" in the Convention. Some opponents of the Helms understanding in the CEDAW fear it could legitimize anti-abortion efforts. Concerns include potential impact on U.S. abortion laws and references to family planning in the Convention text, raising worries about mandatory sex education in schools. Some fear that the CEDAW could require the U.S. government to provide family planning materials or contraceptives, and interpret references to family planning as including abortion. There are concerns that the U.S. government may be obligated to pay for family planning services, including abortion, under certain articles of the CEDAW. The CEDAW calls for access to health care facilities and family planning services for rural women. Supporters argue that governments have the discretion to define access to family planning. In 1994, the Clinton Administration proposed an understanding that States Parties can determine their own health care policies under Article 12. The United States interprets Article 12 of CEDAW as allowing States Parties to decide on appropriate health care services for family planning, pregnancy, and post-natal care. The Senate may consider other treaties during the 114th Congress, such as the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) have sparked debates in the U.S. over concerns about sovereignty and potential impacts on laws and policies. The Senate has not yet considered ratifying the CRC, which focuses on children's rights, but it could do so at any time as the treaty has been submitted. Presidential support and possible conditions on ratification typically precede Senate consideration. The Senate has considered various international treaties like the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Convention Against Torture, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Options for Senate action on the treaties include continuing to take no action, giving advice and consent without recommendations, or giving consent subject to proposed reservations, understandings, and declarations. The Senate may approve treaties with reservations, understandings, and declarations (RUDs) proposed by previous Administrations or the current Administration. If more than one-third of Senators vote against ratification, the treaty is rejected. The Senate may also request the Convention be withdrawn without action. Issues in the CEDAW ratification debate include its impact on citizens' conduct and U.S. laws. Article 6 of CEDAW requires States Parties to take measures to suppress all forms of trafficking. The CEDAW Committee recommends measures to suppress all forms of trafficking and exploitation of women, which some critics argue could lead to the decriminalization or legalization of prostitution. Supporters believe regulating prostitution could help protect victims and reduce levels of prostitution. Opponents of CEDAW argue that its definition of discrimination against women is too broad and could interfere in private lives. Critics fear an increase in frivolous lawsuits. Supporters believe CEDAW would not undermine U.S. laws if a non-self-executing declaration is filed. Opponents of CEDAW raise concerns about its broad definition of discrimination against women and potential interference in private lives. Some critics worry about an increase in frivolous lawsuits, while supporters argue that CEDAW would not undermine U.S. laws if a non-self-executing declaration is filed. Some critics are concerned about provisions in CEDAW that could impact education, including potential gender re-education in schools. Supporters argue that the goal is to ensure equal access to education for both genders. Some opponents of CEDAW fear it could lead to legalizing same-sex marriage due to its definition of discrimination against women. However, others argue that CEDAW focuses on addressing discrimination against women specifically. The United States signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1980. There were multiple public hearings and discussions held regarding the treaty, with various reservations, understandings, and declarations made. The treaty was reported with minority views and re-referred under Senate rules on multiple occasions. Sources: Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, CRS.
