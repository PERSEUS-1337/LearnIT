    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Improvement Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges the increasing demand for natural gas in North America and highlights the importance of Alaska gas as a domestic energy source to reduce reliance on overseas supplies. Additionally, military installations in Alaska play a crucial role in projecting power in the Pacific region. The Fairbanks North Star Borough, suffering from a thermal inversion trapping pollutants, has been declared a nonattainment zone by the EPA for failing to reduce particulate matter emissions. The Fairbanks North Star Borough, declared a nonattainment zone by the EPA, would benefit from affordable clean-burning natural gas to improve air quality. The proposed Alaska natural gas transportation project would likely pass through Atigun Pass, a strategically important route due to its connection to the North Slope oil fields. Atigun Pass, with its high altitude and location on the Continental Divide, is crucial for the operation of the Dalton Highway and the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The preferred route for a natural gas pipeline from the Alaska North Slope is through Atigun Pass due to space constraints and construction difficulties. It is important for all proponents to agree on a single project to avoid duplication of expenses and serve Alaskans and North American consumers. Facilitating economic transportation of natural gas in Alaska through a defined project is in the national interest. The national interest is served by defining the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Project. The Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 2004 is amended to define the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Project as a pipeline system carrying gas to the Alaska-Canada border, including related facilities under Commission jurisdiction. The Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 2004 is amended to include an integrated segment of the system subject to Commission jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act, regardless of when it is proposed or constructed."
