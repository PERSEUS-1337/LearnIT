    "content": "The nation's future relies on children developing into productive adults, making them a valuable resource. Congress and society have a moral obligation to promote children's well-being. Public policies can impact children's development, with parents and family life playing a crucial role in their well-being and future success. The family unit, particularly parents, plays a crucial role in children's social, emotional, and cognitive development. Changes in family structure, such as divorce or single parenthood, can impact children's well-being. Approximately 50% of children under 18 have experienced living without their biological fathers. In 2011, 23.6% of U.S. children lived in families headed by single mothers. Research shows that children raised in single-mother families are more likely to face challenges such as poor academic performance, emotional and behavioral issues, early parenthood, and poverty. The report discusses data on child poverty, male employment, education, and incarceration, as well as federal programs aimed at addressing these issues through support for noncustodial fathers. The report discusses federal programs that provide economic assistance, family support, and job training to eligible noncustodial fathers. These programs aim to prevent teen pregnancy and help disadvantaged youth transition to adulthood. The report suggests public policy approaches, such as expanding economic assistance programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit, to improve the lives of low-income noncustodial fathers and their children. Public policy research and programs focus on noncustodial fathers, providing economic assistance through programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Strategies are implemented to prevent unpaid child support build-up. The negative outcomes of single-parent families are attributed to low income and poor parent-child relationships. Welfare reform initiatives targeted low-income families, especially single mothers, to improve outcomes for children. During the welfare reform era, public policy initiatives required low-income mothers to work and provided support. While welfare-to-work efforts reduced welfare rolls and increased work among single mothers, families remained poor. The poverty rate for children has increased since 1969, partly due to the rise in single-parent families. To address poverty in single-parent families, involving fathers (noncustodial parents) is crucial. Policymakers and the public agree on the importance of this approach. Federal welfare programs have often overlooked the role of fathers in children's lives, as well as other systems like employment and the criminal justice system. While some cases of father involvement may be harmful, studies show that active and nurturing fathering is beneficial for children's development. Research suggests that involved, nurturing fathers contribute to better verbal skills, intellectual functioning, and academic achievement in adolescents. Girls with respectful fathers are less likely to engage in unhealthy relationships. Children with involved fathers are emotionally secure, confident to explore, have better social connections, and exhibit self-control and pro-social behavior. According to sociologist Dr. David Popenoe, involved fathers bring positive benefits to their children that no other person is as likely to bring. The financial and emotional commitment of fathers to their children is crucial for child well-being. The issues raised by father absence span a wide spectrum of social policy domains including income support, employment, housing, and the criminal justice system. In recent years, while there has been an increase in labor force participation among women, labor force participation among men has actually declined. Incarceration rates for men, especially low-income men, have risen considerably. Efforts to support low-income fathers in playing a positive role in their children's lives face challenges due to their precarious financial situations and complicated living arrangements. Data on noncustodial fathers is scarce, as major household surveys do not capture this information. The Urban Institute's National Survey of American Families provides a recent snapshot of noncustodial fathers, focusing on the economic and social context affecting their ability to support their children. Child poverty rates remain high, with 21.9% of children living in poverty in 2011. This report does not provide specific characteristics of noncustodial fathers but discusses general trends impacting men in society. In 2011, child poverty rates were high, with 21.9% of children living in poverty. Poverty rates varied by family setting, with a 48% rate for children in female-headed families and 11% for children in families headed by a married couple. Female-headed families have historically been the focus of policies due to high rates of poverty among them. The cash welfare rolls were mainly single-parent families until recently, with a focus on reducing welfare rolls to combat disadvantage and save money. Child poverty rates improved in the 1960s but increased in the 1970s and sharply rose in 1979. Poverty among children in female-headed families declined until 1979, fluctuating around 20% in the 1980s. The 1990s saw significant policy changes affecting families with children, including the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and welfare reform laws aimed at reducing dependency. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 created the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to provide health coverage for the children of the working poor. The policy changes in the 1990s led to a decline in cash welfare rolls and an increase in employment among single mothers. Child poverty rates also decreased significantly during this time, with the poverty rate for children in female-headed families falling from 53.7% in 1993 to 39.3% in 2001. Despite these improvements, the child poverty rate in 2000 was still higher than in 1969, reaching 16.2%. During the 2000s, child poverty rates increased again, even before the recession in 2007. The rise was due to more children living in single female-headed families, which increased from 9% in 1959 to 24% in 1995. This trend continued in the 2001-2009 period, with a steep rise in children born to unmarried mothers. In 2009, the proportion of children born to unmarried mothers peaked at 41.0%, slightly decreasing to 40.7% in 2011. About 58% of children lived with both married biological parents in March 2012, while over 40% lived in other family situations. Some fathers are not living with their biological children but with children from other relationships, known as multiple partner fertility. Noncustodial and surrogate fathers have a significant role in children's lives, but little is known about them due to minimal official contact with federal programs. Factors influencing a father's involvement with his children have evolved over the past three decades. Changes in the labor market and criminal justice policies have led to lower employment and wages for men, along with increased incarceration rates. Men living apart from their biological children have not been a focus of policies to assist economically disadvantaged fathers. Increasing noncustodial fathers' involvement with their children could have financial and nonfinancial benefits, but faces challenges due to economic and social trends. Earnings of full-time workers are a key indicator of workforce success, with men and women's median annual earnings from 1960 to 2011 shown in Figure 4. The median annual earnings for men working full-time, full-year peaked in 1973, with fluctuations since then. In 2011, men's earnings were 4.8% lower than in 1973, reaching a low point in 1996. Women's median wages increased from 1973 to the early 2000s but have fluctuated since 2002. Earnings for men varied by education status. From 2002 to 2011, men's earnings varied by education level. Men with college degrees saw an increase in inflation-adjusted earnings, with those holding advanced degrees earning over $100,000 annually since 1996. However, men without a high school diploma experienced a substantial decrease in earnings, with an average of $24,413 in 2010, 20% lower than in 1978. Men with a high school diploma also saw a decline in earnings, 11% lower in 2010 compared to 1978. The employment rates for men and women from 1948 to 2012 show a decline for men and an increase for women, with men starting at over 80% and women at around 30%. By 2007, men's employment rate dropped to 69.8% while women's rose to 56.6%. The recession caused further declines, with men at 63.7% and women at 53.1% by 2010. The employment rate for men declined to 63.7% by 2010, a decrease of 6.1 percentage points, while women's rate dropped to 53.1% in 2012, a decrease of 3.5 percentage points. Factors contributing to the decline in men's employment rate include aging population, retirements, and early retirements. Employment rates for prime-aged men and young men also decreased. In 1948, over 90% of prime-aged men were employed, but this fell to the 80% range before the 2007 recession. Employment rates also declined for younger age groups. Employment rates for younger groups, including teens and young adults, declined from the mid-50% range to just above 30% and from around 80% to 72% in 2007, respectively. This decline partially reflects increases in school enrollment among these age groups. Unemployment rates among teens and young men tend to be high, with the recession that began in December 2007 disproportionately affecting young men. The Great Recession, starting in December 2007, disproportionately impacted men with the highest unemployment rate of 10.5% in 2010. Men's unemployment rate exceeded women's by 2.2 percentage points in 2009 and 1.9 points in 2010. By 2012, the gap narrowed to 0.3 points. Incarceration also affected men's labor market participation and their children's lives. In 2010, 1.6 million persons, mostly men, were imprisoned in federal or state facilities in the United States. The incarceration rates have been increasing, especially for men, with a significant rise starting in the late 1970s. By 2010, 943 per 100,000 men were incarcerated, posing challenges for financial and social support for their children. The incarceration rate for men in the United States increased significantly post-1975, reaching 943 per 100,000 in 2010. For women, the rate also rose but remained much lower at 67 per 100,000 in 2010. African American families have been disproportionately affected by social and economic conditions, with high rates of poverty and father absence, especially among children. The economic disadvantage and father absence rates among African American children in 2012 persist despite some improvements in social indicators for African American men. African American men still lag behind white and Hispanic men in various measures, although their educational attainment has increased over the years. In 1965, only 25% of African American men aged 25 and older had completed high school, compared to 50% of white men. Despite progress, a higher percentage of African American men still lack a high school diploma compared to white men. The lack of high school diploma among African American men is higher compared to white men, with 16% of African American men aged 25 and older lacking a high school diploma. This group also earns less on average than other men without a high school diploma. African American male youth aged 18 to 24 are less likely to have a high school diploma compared to their white counterparts. Employment rates for African American men without a high school diploma are also lower. The employment rates for African American men without a high school diploma have declined over the past three decades. In 1989, the rate was 54.9%, dropping to 40.8% in 2000. By 2012, less than 1 in 4 African American men aged 16 to 24 without a high school diploma were employed. The employment rates for young African American men without a high school diploma have declined over the past three decades. In 2012, less than 1 in 4 African American men aged 16 to 24 without a high school diploma were employed. Additionally, African American men have a high incarceration rate compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Social policies have focused on single mothers, but noncustodial fathers, many of whom are low-income, could benefit from supportive policies. Low-income, disadvantaged men could benefit from social policies across various domains such as economic assistance, family support, and human capital programs. These programs aim to prevent teen pregnancy, support disadvantaged youth, and help individuals become self-sufficient members of their communities. The aid and services from social programs can help low-income men overcome economic and emotional barriers, making them productive members of society through job training, employment opportunities, educational support, and counseling. Economic assistance supplements the income of poor families. Noncustodial parents have historically been ineligible for assistance due to not living with their children. The Social Security Act of 1935 provided support for these programs. The Social Security Act of 1935 provided federal funding for low-income assistance programs, including mothers' pensions. These programs aimed to support children by releasing mothers from the wage-earning role to provide necessary care and guardianship. Additionally, the Act established social insurance programs for old age and temporary unemployment benefits. The Social Security Act of 1935 established need-tested cash benefits for the aged and families with children, excluding non-aged, able-bodied adult men from the program. The program initially named Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) aimed to provide aid to families with children. The program initially named Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) aimed to provide aid to families with children, which was later renamed Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1962. Federal funds were initially only provided to aid families with a single mother or an incapacitated father, but in 1961, states were given the option to aid families with two able-bodied parents if one parent was unemployed. AFDC generally restricted aid to single-parent families, causing concern among policymakers about incentivizing family breakup. New need-tested benefit programs in the 1960s and 1970s did not have the same restrictions. The Food Stamp program, now known as SNAP, provided aid without regard to family structure in the 1960s and 1970s. The Family Support Act of 1988 mandated aid for families with two parents, one unemployed. The EITC, created in 1975, did not restrict benefits to single-parent families but required a child in the tax unit. Major changes in aid in the mid-1990s included expansions of the EITC and increased funding for subsidized child care. In the mid-1990s, there were expansions of the EITC, increased funding for subsidized child care, and the establishment of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The 1996 welfare reform law replaced AFDC with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, giving states more flexibility in designing cash assistance programs. The 1996 welfare reform law replaced AFDC with TANF, which included work standards and time limits for adult recipients. The ABAWD rule restricted food stamps for able-bodied adults without dependents. Cash welfare spending declined, while EITC and food stamp programs grew, becoming major sources of cash aid for low-income families. Eligibility restrictions were lifted for families where the father lives with his children, allowing them to receive work supports like EITC and SNAP benefits. Noncustodial fathers may face barriers in accessing economic assistance programs like TANF, EITC, and SNAP. One major issue is the financial incentives for noncustodial parents to live with their children, as tax policies may create a \"marriage penalty\" where couples are better off financially living apart. The financial incentives for noncustodial parents to live with their children can be affected by tax policies, creating a \"marriage penalty.\" Need-tested programs may reduce benefits if a noncustodial parent's income exceeds eligibility thresholds, even if it doesn't necessarily improve the family's economic well-being. Child support payments can also impact eligibility for need-tested aid if considered as countable income. The TANF block grant provides states with funding for various benefits and services to help families with children facing economic disadvantage. It includes cash assistance, short-term aid, and tax credits for low-income families. States receive a set block grant amount of $16.5 billion annually since 1996, which they can use to achieve their goals. TANF requires states to contribute a minimum amount annually, totaling $10.4 billion nationwide. Families receiving assistance must have a dependent child under age 18 or 18 if still in school. Most states have removed restrictions on aiding two-parent families. States can include noncustodial parents as part of the \"family\" for eligibility. Under TANF, states determine eligibility for cash assistance based on income levels. Monthly benefits for a family of three in 2010 ranged from half of poverty-level income in Alaska and California to 11% in Mississippi. Cash benefits come with requirements, including a 60-month limit for adult recipients and cooperation with child support for custodial parents. Under TANF, custodial parents must cooperate with child support enforcement and assign child support to the state. Families with an adult recipient are subject to work requirements, including state-defined activities and sanctions for noncompliance. In 2011, TANF cash welfare totaled $9.6 billion, serving only a small fraction of poor families with children. States can use TANF funds for various activities beyond cash assistance, with few restrictions. For example, New York used TANF funds for a noncustodial Earned Income Tax Credit. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) began in 1975 as a temporary program to return a portion of the Social Security tax paid by lower-income taxpayers, and was made permanent in 1978. It has expanded several times since then, with a major expansion in 1993 to \"make work pay\" more than welfare. This expansion included extending the EITC to tax filers without children, although the credit for filers with children is much larger. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is available to those with low earnings, with the bulk of aid going to families with qualifying children. In 2009, EITC credits totaled $59.2 billion. For tax filers without qualifying children, credits totaled under $1.4 billion. The maximum credit varies based on the number of qualifying children, with the highest credits going to filers with two or more qualifying children. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) provides aid to low-earning families, with the majority of assistance going to those with qualifying children. For childless filers, eligibility is limited to those with very low earnings, with ineligibility once income exceeds $13,980. Single parents earning more than double the minimum wage remain eligible for the EITC. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, offers support to low-income families for purchasing food, reaching a large number of households and individuals. In FY2012, $74.6 billion in benefits were distributed to 46.6 million individuals in 22.3 million households, with federal funds covering 100% of SNAP benefit costs. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides support to low-income households regardless of family type. Benefits are determined by federal law and are uniform nationally. In FY2013, the maximum monthly SNAP benefit is $200 for a single person and $526 for a family of three. Most SNAP households include elderly, disabled, or children, with only 24% consisting of nonelderly, able-bodied adults. The ABAWD rule, established in the 1996 welfare reform law, affects able-bodied individuals. The 1996 welfare reform law established the ABAWD rule for able-bodied noncustodial parents without children, setting a 3-month time limit for those aged 18 to 50 who do not work or work less than 20 hours per week. Waivers can be applied for areas with high unemployment. Federal programs like Child Support Enforcement, Healthy Marriage, and Responsible Fatherhood aim to provide support to families. The Child Support Enforcement program collects child support payments from noncustodial parents to help with childrearing costs and promote better relations between parents. The Access and Visitation program offers activities like mediation and counseling. The Healthy Marriage program supports counseling and education for healthy relationships, especially for low-income individuals. The Responsible Fatherhood program aims to increase fathers' involvement in their children's lives by focusing on financial and personal responsibility. Some initiatives help noncustodial parents improve parenting skills, while others discourage young men from becoming fathers until they are ready. The Child Support Enforcement program, established in 1975, helps secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents to promote family stability and self-sufficiency. Child support payments through the CSE program enable noncustodial parents to fulfill their financial responsibility to their children. The program provides various services including locating absent parents, establishing paternity, and enforcing child support orders. All 50 states and four jurisdictions operate CSE programs administered by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement. The CSE program, under the Department of Health and Human Services, shares costs with states at a 66% federal and 34% state rate. States receive incentive payments to run effective CSE programs, with funds required to be reinvested. Child support collected for non-welfare families goes directly to them, while for TANF-receiving families, it reimburses the state and federal governments. This setup may discourage child support payment as it may not directly benefit the children. The rules for child support distribution can be complex, leading to little benefit for families receiving TANF. Payments collected are used to reimburse the state and federal government first, potentially discouraging child support payment. P.L. 109-171 helped states cover the costs of distributing child support payments. The federal government shares costs with states for child support pass-through and disregard policies, up to $100 per month for one child and $200 per month for two or more children. 22 states and the District of Columbia have this policy, while 28 states and territories do not. Payments are distributed to former TANF families first before reimbursement under the \"family-first\" policy. The \"family-first\" policy states that child support arrearages are reimbursed to the state and federal government before being paid to TANF families. Arrearages accrued before and during TANF benefits belong to the state and federal government, except for collections through the federal income tax refund offset program. If a family has never received TANF benefits, the child support payment goes directly to the custodial parent. In FY2011, 13% of the CSE caseload consisted of TANF families. In FY2011, the CSE program collected $27.3 billion in child support payments from noncustodial parents, serving 15.8 million child support cases. 93% of the collected amount went to families, while 6% went to state and federal governments. The program spent $5.7 billion in total expenditures, with an average collection of $5.12 for every $1 spent. Child support constitutes about 40% of income for poor families receiving it, aiding in their self-sufficiency. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program collected $27.3 billion in child support payments in FY2011, benefiting 15.8 million child support cases. Data shows that parents making regular child support payments have better family relationships. The program has the potential to impact more children and for longer periods compared to other federal programs. Census Bureau data reveals that 31% of custodial parents receive child support, among other benefits like food stamps and Medicaid. The CSE program may interact with parents and children for up to 30 years in cases of past-due child support. The CSE program has expanded its mission to provide more effective services and promote parental responsibility. In FY2011, there were 17.3 million children in the program, with roughly 14 million noncustodial fathers. States must implement child support enforcement tools to receive federal funds, including seeking orders for past-due support from noncustodial parents. The CSE program, mandated by the 1996 welfare reform law, aims to provide employment opportunities for noncustodial parents of children receiving TANF benefits to meet their child support obligations. Judges can remand nonpaying parents to a work program, with the mandate to participate, pay child support, or face jail. Compliance is monitored to ensure obligations are met. The CSE program aims to provide employment opportunities for noncustodial parents to meet child support obligations. Work programs are used to help parents find jobs or pay child support. Some states have specific programs for noncustodial parents, like the Texas Noncustodial Parent Choices Program. Compliance is monitored to ensure obligations are met. The noncustodial parent's right to visit with their children, known as visitation or child access, is separate from child support payments. Research suggests that fathers who pay child support are more likely to visit their children. The Parents' Fair Share (PFS) demonstration aimed to increase support payments, employment, and parental involvement but did not significantly increase visitation frequency or length. The Parents' Fair Share (PFS) program aimed to increase support payments, employment, and parental involvement. PFS was effective in increasing regular visits for noncustodial parents with low visitation rates. Increased access to children may lead to better compliance with child support orders, especially for unmarried fathers. Various factors like new relationships, time since parents lived together, drug use by fathers, and incarceration rates also impact parental involvement. Federal and state policymakers have promoted efforts to address child support and access for noncustodial fathers. The 1996 welfare reform law provided funding for access and visitation programs, including mediation, counseling, and visitation enforcement. States can receive grants from the federal CSE budget for these activities. Since FY1998, access and visitation services have been provided to over 500,000 noncustodial parents and their families across all states and territories. Services include parenting education, supervised visitation, mediation, and parenting plan assistance. In FY2008, states worked with 374 service providers to assist over 85,000 individuals, a significant increase from the program's first year. By FY2011, families receiving CSE services were owed $111.3 billion in child support arrearages, with only 7% ($7.7 billion) being collected. An Urban Institute study found that high debtors, who owed $30,000 or more in child support arrearages, were expected to pay a larger percentage of their income for current child support orders compared to non-debtors. The median child support order for high debtors was 55% of their income, while it was 13% for non-debtors and 22% for those who owed less than $30,000 in arrearages. Many noncustodial parents struggle to meet their child support obligations due to limited incomes and other financial obligations. The Urban Institute study found that high debtors, who owed $30,000 or more in child support arrearages, had older orders, multiple current support orders, lower payment rates, unknown addresses, and more interstate cases. States have flexibility in modifying child support orders, with federal law requiring a review every three years to prevent arrearages. Some suggest modifying laws for unemployed or incarcerated noncustodial parents. Some analysts argue for changing child support modification laws to be more sensitive to periods of incarceration, unemployment, or illness, as it is difficult for low-income noncustodial parents to meet payments in these situations. A significant number of inmates are parents, with many facing child support obligations upon release from prison. The Department of Justice and state agencies are developing programs to assist with successful re-entry for incarcerated parents. HHS is also providing funds for effective methods of working with ex-offenders and re-entry programs. CSE agencies should be concerned about ex-offenders and prisoner re-entry programs due to the high number of parents in the child support caseload with a criminal background, their children being recipients of public assistance, and the significant amount of child support arrears held by incarcerated or recently released obligors. Collaboration between state and federal prison officials and CSE officials could be mutually beneficial in maximizing resources and assisting inmates who are parents. Some analysts suggest that prisons and CSE programs should collaborate to improve re-entry programs for parents with child support obligations. Strategies include identifying parents with child support obligations in prison, encouraging them to include child support payments in post-release plans, and making inquiries about parental status during prison intake. The collaboration between prisons and child support enforcement (CSE) programs aims to assist inmates with child support obligations by providing information on modification options, encouraging contact with their children, and developing payment plans post-release. Suggestions include implementing automated data matches between corrections and CSE agencies and providing assistance with the modification process. The healthy marriage initiative, part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, aimed to strengthen marriage and reduce divorce rates to improve child well-being. Early initiatives focused on educating people on the importance of marriage and providing skills for a healthy marriage. Congress and the Clinton Administration expressed concerns about nonmarital childbearing during welfare reform, leading to TANF funds being used to achieve statutory goals. The TANF funds were used to achieve statutory goals, including promoting two-parent families and reducing dependence on government benefits through work, job preparation, and marriage. The George W. Bush Administration implemented healthy marriage initiatives targeting low-income individuals. President Bush clarified that the initiative was not about forcing marriage, trapping people in abusive relationships, or withdrawing support for single mothers. President Bush emphasized the importance of strong, two-parent families and marriage in promoting the well-being of children and society. He supported initiatives to strengthen families, provide childcare support, and encourage healthy marriages. Research shows that children raised in married households tend to fare better than those in other family structures. The Administration supports healthy marriage promotion initiatives to ensure children grow up in safe homes. P.L. 109-171 established grants for this purpose, funded at $100 million per year from FY2006 to FY2010. HHS awarded grants to 123 grantees in 2006 for research and demonstration projects. The HHS Office of Family Assistance awarded healthy marriage grants to 123 grantees for five-year contracts totaling $93 million in FY2009. Funding for healthy marriage promotion activities was extended through FY2012, with appropriations reduced from $100 million to $75 million in FY2011. The Healthy Marriage grant program received funding through March 2013 under P.L. 112-175. Activities include promoting marriage through advertising, education on social skills for couples, and addressing domestic violence concerns in grant applications. The Healthy Marriage grant program, funded through P.L. 112-175 until March 2013, focuses on providing programs to address domestic violence concerns. In 2006, the HHS Office of Family Assistance awarded grants to 123 grantees for implementing healthy marriage programs, totaling $93 million in FY2009. Grantees are required to evaluate their programs, with final results of scientific evaluations expected between 2011 and 2013. The final results of studies on healthy marriage projects serving Hispanic families are expected between 2011 and 2013. A 2008 report estimates that high rates of divorce and nonmarital childbearing cost U.S. taxpayers at least $112 billion per year in federal, state, and local costs, with $70.1 billion being federal costs. One study analyzed the impact of nonmarital childbearing on poverty, finding that increasing the share of children living with two parents could decrease the child poverty rate significantly. The DRA healthy marriage program grants are funded through the TANF title of the Social Security Act, but are not exclusively targeted. The healthy marriage grants are not exclusively for low-income clients, which diminishes the focus on promoting marriage as a poverty-reduction strategy. Critics caution against government support for programs that pressure individuals into marriage, citing issues like child-bride marriages and unhappy \"shotgun\" marriages. Some argue that marriage promotion programs may lead women to stay in abusive relationships and overlook the success of single parents. Supporters of healthy marriage programs believe in the benefits of long-lasting marriages based on financial alliances. They emphasize that promoting healthy marriages is not about forcing anyone into unwanted relationships or withdrawing support from single mothers. Marriage is seen as a way out of poverty for women, but concerns remain about the impact of such programs. Marriage is a proven path out of poverty for women, but concerns exist about the impact of healthy marriage promotion programs on survivors of domestic violence. Observers argue that these programs should address domestic violence effectively and focus on couples who are willing to marry, free from substance abuse and violence, and without children from previous relationships. Healthy marriage initiatives aim to educate couples on conflict resolution and sustaining loving long-term marriages. The Building Strong Families project is one of these programs. The Building Strong Families project, funded by HHS, aimed to support healthy marriage among unwed parents. However, the recent evaluation of the program's long-term impacts was not encouraging. The project provided relationship education and referrals to services for low-income couples, but the effectiveness in improving relationship communication and satisfaction was questioned. The 36-month impact evaluation of the Building Strong Families program found that it had no significant effect on the quality of couples' relationships, co-parenting, or family stability. It did, however, lead to modest reductions in children's behavior problems. Overall, the program did not yield better outcomes for participants compared to a control group. The 36-month impact study of the Building Strong Families program measured various factors in 5,000 couples randomly assigned to different groups. Qualitative research showed that some fathers in disadvantaged circumstances may distance themselves from their families due to feeling unable to meet expectations. The program did not significantly improve relationship quality but did reduce children's behavior problems. The Obama Administration found the Building Strong Families program lacking in improving stability for couples and children. They propose a new initiative for comprehensive support. Program implementation issues and low participation can lead to unfavorable outcomes in social program evaluations. Responsible fatherhood programs aim to involve men in their children's lives. Responsible fatherhood programs aim to promote financial and personal responsibility of noncustodial parents, increase fathers' involvement in their children's lives, and strengthen parenting skills. These programs also discourage young men from becoming fathers until they are ready for the responsibility. Many states, localities, private organizations, and nonprofit agencies have been operating responsible fatherhood programs since the early 1990s. Collaboration between responsible fatherhood programs and Child Support Enforcement agencies has been recognized as important, although forming connections was initially challenging. During the early years, forming connections between noncustodial parents and the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program was difficult due to tension. Noncustodial parents felt undervalued by the CSE system focusing solely on financial support. Responsible fatherhood programs aimed to educate parents on CSE goals and duties, encouraging proactive interaction. Representative Nancy Johnson emphasized the need to support children beyond financial assistance, recognizing the challenges faced by low-income fathers. During the early years, forming connections between noncustodial parents and the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program was difficult due to tension. Responsible fatherhood programs aimed to educate parents on CSE goals and duties, encouraging proactive interaction. Representative Nancy Johnson emphasized the need to support children beyond financial assistance, recognizing the challenges faced by low-income fathers. Mothers on welfare face barriers to employment, while research shows the negative impact of father absence on children. Funding for responsible fatherhood programs was provided in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The Responsible Fatherhood grant program provided competitive grants totaling $45 million in FY2009, with funding increasing to $75 million in FY2011. The program was extended through February 2012 at the FY2011 funding level. The Responsible Fatherhood grant program was extended through March 2013 at its FY2011 funding level. Programs include parenting education, conflict resolution, job training, and peer support, mainly targeting low-income individuals. The MFS-IP program, initiated in 2006, aims to strengthen relationships for incarcerated and reentering fathers and their partners. An evaluation study running from 2006 to 2013 will assess the effectiveness of relationship education in enhancing relationship quality and stability during reentry. Research indicates that healthy relationships are crucial for successful reentry, and improving relationship skills through education can support this process. Responsible fatherhood programs emphasize the importance of fathers in their children's lives, promoting communication between noncustodial parents and child support enforcement (CSE) agencies. Positive communication can lead to increased child support payments. Partnerships between CSE programs and employment services have shown to boost child support payments significantly. A final report on the program's impact is expected in 2015 or 2016. Employment programs can lead to higher child support payments from noncustodial parents. Integrating CSE agencies into responsible fatherhood programs can help in recruiting noncustodial parents and improving program knowledge. CSE agencies can also implement realistic child support orders and address parents with large debts. Expanding responsible fatherhood programs is crucial for parents to meet their parental responsibilities. To expand responsible fatherhood programs, collaborative strategies involving schools, employment programs, prison systems, churches, community organizations, and the health care system are essential. These entities can recruit noncustodial parents, provide relevant information, and offer services to existing programs. Human capital programs focus on developing skills for employment and economic potential, different from family support or economic assistance programs. Several human capital programs aim to enhance employability and earnings. Workforce development programs aim to enhance employability and earnings, providing job search assistance, education, and training services. These programs, authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, help individuals prepare for work and improve their labor market performance. Title I of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) provides job training and related services to unemployed and underemployed individuals through activities such as job search assistance, career counseling, and occupational skill training. WIA programs are administered by the U.S. Department of Labor and funded through annual appropriations, with $4.9 billion allocated in FY2012 for state formula grants and national programs. Noncustodial parents may not receive services under WIA. Title I programs under the Workforce Investment Act aim to benefit all participants by improving their employment prospects and skills. While data on noncustodial parents' participation is lacking, initiatives like the One-Stop delivery system and re-entry programs for prisoners may help noncustodial parents increase their wages and attachment to the workforce, enabling them to better provide for their children. The Workforce Investment Act established the One-Stop delivery system to provide coordinated access to employment and support services, including core, intensive, and training services. Each local workforce area must have a physical One-Stop center, with the option to access services through affiliated sites and electronically linked partners. This system serves as a central point for accessing programs and services. The WIA One-Stop system provides a central point of service for employment, training, and related services. Partner programs like TANF and SNAP target low-income individuals. Formula grant programs fund activities at One-Stop Career Centers for youth, adults, and dislocated workers based on unemployment and poverty measures. States distribute funds to local workforce investment boards for overseeing workforce development activities funded by WIA. Eligibility requirements for participation in services are not specified. The Youth Activities program funded by WIA provides training and services to low-income youth aged 14-21 through formula grants allocated to states. Priority is given to recipients of public assistance and other low-income individuals when funds are limited. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) provides various programs for youth and adults. The Youth Activities program offers strategies for completing secondary school, summer employment, and more, with $826 million in funding in FY2012. The Adult Activities program offers training and services to individuals 18 and older through formula grants to states, with no income requirements. Services are provided in a sequential manner, starting with core services like job search assistance, then moving to intensive services like career planning. In FY2012, funding for state grants for Adult Activities under the Workforce Investment Act was $771 million. WIA Dislocated Worker Activities funds are allocated by formula grants to states, which then provide training and related services to individuals who have lost their jobs. In FY2012, funding for state grants for Adult Activities under the Workforce Investment Act was $771 million. The WIA Dislocated Worker Activities program has no income requirements. Funding for state grants for Dislocated Worker Activities was $1.0 billion, with $224 million for the National Reserve. Detailed WIA data is based on program \"exiters,\" individuals who have not received services for 90 days. The Adult Activities program serves the most individuals. In the most recent period, 1,247,220 adults exited the Adult Activities program. 65.7% received only core services, while 35% received specialized services including job training. Demographic breakdown of those receiving specialized services included single parents, low-income individuals, public assistance recipients, offenders, and individuals without high school degrees. WIA authorizes funding for various national programs such as Job Corps, Native American programs, and Veterans' Workforce Investment programs. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program (REO) is a key program for low-income and noncustodial males, consolidating funding from previous projects like the Prisoner Reentry Initiative (PRI) and Responsible Reintegration of Youthful Offenders (RRYO). In FY2012, the program received $80.4 million in funding. In FY2012, funding for the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program was $80.4 million. The program aims to help disadvantaged youth overcome barriers to becoming productive members of society, including those from single-parent households with lower resources. Social science research shows that these youth are more likely to face challenges such as lower school performance and early childbearing. Federal programs aim to support disadvantaged youth, including those from single-parent households, in preparing for adulthood. These programs focus on delaying early family formation and engaging young people in productive activities through teenage pregnancy prevention, youth employment, and education programs. The goal is to ensure that youth are adequately prepared for adulthood and equipped with the necessary skills for a successful transition. Federal programs aim to support disadvantaged youth by preparing them for adulthood, which includes teenage pregnancy prevention and youth employment programs. The U.S. teen birth rate has fluctuated over the years, remaining higher than in most industrialized nations. Some attribute the high pregnancy rates to a liberal view of sexual activity and a false sense of security from contraceptive advancements. The high pregnancy rates among teens in the U.S. are attributed to a false sense of security from contraceptive advancements and a liberal view of sexual activity. Teen parenthood is seen as a negative consequence of growing up without a father present, and welfare was previously viewed as a guaranteed income source for unmarried teenage mothers. Poverty, lack of access to contraceptive services, and misinformation about sex are also factors contributing to high rates of pregnancy, birth, and abortion in the United States. The high pregnancy rates among teens in the U.S. are attributed to a false sense of security from contraceptive advancements and a liberal view of sexual activity. Teen parenthood is costly for U.S. taxpayers, with adolescent childbearing estimated to cost about $9 billion per year in various expenses. Research shows that teen parents are less likely to complete high school and go on to college, impacting their economic self-sufficiency. Children of teen parents are also more likely to experience problems in school and drop out. The 2006 report highlights the negative consequences of teenage pregnancy, stating that teen parents are more likely to experience problems in school, drop out of high school, and repeat the cycle of poverty. Federal programs aim to prevent teenage and out-of-wedlock childbearing, with laws addressing teen pregnancy prevention. The Adolescent Family Life program, established in 1981, provides health, education, and social services to pregnant and parenting adolescents. The Adolescent Family Life program offers health, education, and social services to pregnant and parenting adolescents, their infants, male partners, and families. It includes comprehensive sex education information on contraceptive methods and abstinence. The program did not receive funding for FY2012. The Title V Abstinence Education block grant supports abstinence-only education programs, providing $50 million for each of the six fiscal years FY1998-FY2003. States must match federal funds with state funds to qualify for funding. The Title V Abstinence Education program received temporary funding extensions between 2003 and 2009. Funding was restored by the ACA, providing $250 million for abstinence-only education over five years. Additional funding of $5 million was allocated for competitive grants in FY2012. The Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010 allocated $75 million per year for five years to fund the new Personal Responsibility Education program, which focuses on teen pregnancy prevention through education on abstinence, contraception, and adulthood preparation subjects. The program is required to be evidence-based, medically accurate, and age-appropriate. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program receives funding from public and private entities for \"medically accurate and age appropriate\" programs. In FY2011, $105 million is allocated for replicating proven effective programs, and $4.5 million for research grants. The program is administered by the Office of Adolescent Health within HHS. In FY2012, the TPP program received level funding of $104.790 million, with at least $75 million for Tier 1 grants and at least $25 million for Tier 2 grants. Additionally, $4.5 million is provided for evaluations of teenage pregnancy prevention approaches. Federal funding for teen pregnancy prevention programs in FY2012 totaled $243.5 million, including grants for Tier 1 and Tier 2 programs. Various federally funded programs offer pregnancy prevention services to teens and adults, such as Medicaid Family Planning, Title X Family Planning Program, Maternal and Child Health block grant, TANF block grant program, Title XX Social Services block grant, and CDC-administered teen pregnancy prevention programs. Federal job training and employment programs have aimed to support vulnerable youth aged 14-24 since the 1930s. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and services for unemployed youth, aiming to connect them to educational and employment opportunities. Youth job training programs are authorized under Title I of WIA and are carried out by the Department of Labor. The unemployment rate for teens is higher than for young adults and adults, with young men ages 16 through 24 being more likely to face challenges in finding employment. Young men ages 16 through 24 are more likely to not be in school or working for at least one year. The federal job training system for disadvantaged young people includes WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders programs. These programs provide job training, education, and employment opportunities for youth while working towards a high school diploma or equivalent. The federal job training system for disadvantaged young people includes WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders programs. These programs offer job training, education, and employment opportunities for youth while working towards a high school diploma or its equivalent. Each program has unique services, such as mentoring, construction work, residential services, and grants for educational and alternative education services for at-risk youth. The federal job training system for disadvantaged young people includes programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders. These programs target vulnerable youth with specific eligibility criteria, focusing on helping them achieve economic independence and gain workplace skills. Young men are well represented in these programs, making up about half or more of the participants. The WIA Youth Activities program aims to help young people achieve economic independence and gain workplace skills. Congress allocated $825.9 million to the program in FY2012, which provides services through contracted organizations to offer academic and employment assistance, mentoring, training, leadership opportunities, and incentives for recognition and achievement to eligible youth. The WIA Youth Activities program receives funding from DOL and is distributed to state workforce investment boards, which then allocate funds to local programs. Local WIBs oversee youth workforce activities and establish youth councils to assist in awarding grants. Local programs must provide 10 activities focusing on education, employment, and follow-up. Youth Activities focus on education, employment, and civic engagement for low-income individuals aged 14-21 with barriers like basic literacy deficiency or being homeless. 30% of funds are for out-of-school youth. Participation data is based on program \"exiters.\" The WIA Youth program serves low-income individuals aged 14-21 with barriers like basic literacy deficiency or homelessness. Nearly 128,000 youth exited the program from April 2011 to March 2012, with a majority being female, and a significant portion being African American or Hispanic. President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, allocating $1.2 billion for the program to create and preserve jobs for youth, extending the age of eligibility to 24. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) extended the age of eligibility for youth activities funded under the law from 21 to 24. It also created a $5 billion TANF Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) for FY2009 and FY2010, reimbursing states for increased costs of basic assistance, emergency aid, and subsidized employment. Health and Human Services and Labor Departments encouraged the use of the ECF for subsidized employment and other services for low-income youth, promoting co-enrollment in TANF and WIA programs for additional benefits. Job Corps is a job training program established in 1964 for low-income individuals aged 16-24, offering services like supportive services, occupational skills training, and education primarily in a residential setting. The program aims to equip youth with skills for employment, military service, or further education, providing support services such as child care, health education, counseling, and recreation. Eligibility criteria include being low-income and meeting specific needs like basic skills deficiency or being homeless. Job Corps is a program established in 1964 for low-income individuals aged 16-24, providing education, vocational training, and counseling to help them participate in school or secure employment. There are over 120 Job Corps centers in the US, with a budget of $1.7 billion in FY2012. Most participants are male, black, and Hispanic, with many lacking a high school credential. A study showed that program participants received the equivalent of one additional year of schooling compared to non-participants. Job Corps program participants showed improved literacy and numeracy skills, with higher rates of obtaining GEDs and vocational certificates. Over 90% of enrollees engaged in education or training programs post-program, compared to 72% of the control group. While initial employment and earnings gains were seen, long-term impacts on earnings were limited, except for older students. Education programs aim to involve disadvantaged youth in beneficial activities. Federal education programs aim to engage disadvantaged youth in activities leading to a high school diploma and college degree. Men's earnings are strongly linked to educational attainment, with advanced degree holders seeing the biggest wage gains. Programs like TRIO and vocational training grants support at-risk young adults. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins) and the Department of Defense's Youth ChalleNGe program provide education and training opportunities. The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) offers federal student aid programs to support postsecondary education for low-income students. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) recently extended authorization for many HEA programs. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA, P.L. 110-315) extended authorization for HEA programs through FY2014. TRIO programs received $826.5 million in FY2012 funding. These programs serve low-income youth not yet in postsecondary education, including Upward Bound, Talent Search, and Educational Opportunity Centers. Services aim to support disadvantaged students' educational persistence and achievement, with at least two-thirds of participants being low-income and first-generation college students. Foster care youth are also eligible for services. The Perkins Act aims to enhance the academic and technical skills of students in career and technical education programs. In FY2011, Upward Bound, Talent Search, and Educational Opportunity Centers served 588,908 students, including those in foster care or homeless as defined by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The Act promotes challenging standards, integrates academic and technical instruction, and fosters partnerships among educational institutions, workforce boards, businesses, and intermediaries. The Perkins Act, reauthorized in 2006, aims to enhance academic and technical skills for career and technical education. Funding for CTE is mainly provided at state and local levels, with federal funding through the State Grants program. Federal funding is a small portion of total CTE funding, and courses supported by federal dollars are not specified. State allotment is based on the state's population aged 15-65. The Perkins Act provides funding for career and technical education at the state and local levels through the State Grants program. States must distribute at least 85% of grant funds to eligible recipients like local education agencies and community colleges. States have discretion in funding secondary and postsecondary CTE, with funding totaling $1.1 billion in FY2012. Funding distribution at the secondary level is determined by a formula accounting for age distribution and poverty, while postsecondary funds are distributed based on state decisions. Funds under the Perkins Act are distributed based on Pell grant recipients and Bureau of Indian Affairs assistance at the postsecondary level. The Act includes required and allowable uses of funds at state and local levels, focusing on education and workforce development. States must coordinate Perkins activities with One-Stop programs and provide listings of education programs receiving Perkins Act assistance. During PY2006-2007, states reported 15.6 million students enrolled in CTE programs, with 2.6 million in Tech-Prep. Most CTE funding comes from state and local levels. The majority of CTE students were white, followed by Hispanic and black students, with about one-third being economically disadvantaged. The Youth ChalleNGe Program, a quasi-military training program by the Army National Guard, aims to help economically disadvantaged youth who dropped out of school. Established under the National Defense Authorization Act, it operates in 28 states and Puerto Rico, with a budget of $115 million in FY2012. Over 113,000 youth graduated in 2012, with 79% males, 23% black, and 16% Hispanic. Eligible youth are ages 16 to 18. The Youth ChalleNGe Program is for economically disadvantaged youth aged 16 to 18 who have dropped out of school. It consists of three phases: a pre-program assessment phase, a 20-week residential phase, and a 12-month post-residential phase. During the program, cadets work towards their high school diploma or GED, develop life skills, and engage in community service. They also create a \"Post-Residential Action Plan\" to set goals and objectives for the future. The post-residential phase of the Youth ChalleNGe Program focuses on graduates returning to their communities, continuing education, or entering the military. Mentoring is a core component during this phase, where cadets work with a mentor to achieve their goals outlined in their P-RAP. Parents and youth nominate mentors before acceptance into the program, aiming for individuals who are respected and good role models. The program was evaluated by MDRC using a random assignment research design. The Youth ChalleNGe Program used a random assignment research design to evaluate its impact on youth. Results showed that the program group had higher rates of high school graduation, employment, college attendance, good health, and lower arrest rates compared to the control group. These differences were statistically significant, indicating the effectiveness of the program intervention. The program group showed lasting positive outcomes after 21 months, including higher rates of high school graduation, employment, and college attendance. There were no significant differences in health or arrest rates between the program and control groups. Policy options to reduce barriers for low-income men, particularly fathers, were discussed, such as modifying the Earned Income Tax Credit and addressing child support arrearages. Policy changes in the early- and mid-1990s aimed to \"make work pay\" more than welfare through supporting low-wage work, including strategies for reducing child support arrearages, changing the financing structure of child support enforcement programs, and enhancing job training and education programs for low-income men and youth. The 1993 expansion of the EITC was a key component of these changes. The 1993 expansion of the EITC and the child tax credit have transformed the nation's income safety net into one supporting work. Cash-welfare work requirements and limits on receiving federally funded benefits have shifted towards supporting low-wage work. In FY2013, the refundable portions of the EITC and child tax credit are estimated to cost $80 billion in outlays. The federal income tax system changes dynamics between work and welfare, reducing single mothers' reliance on cash welfare and poverty among their children. However, families without children do not benefit. Employment rates for white and African American men without a high school diploma have declined. Noncustodial parents saw little benefit from EITC expansions in 1993. Refundable tax credits in 2009 reduced poverty for families with children by 29%, but had minimal impact on single individuals without children. Legislation in 2013 may overhaul the tax code, potentially addressing differences in tax treatment between custodial and noncustodial parents. Proposals aim to increase work effort and financial support from noncustodial parents to their children, potentially reversing the decline in employment among men with low earnings. Federal legislation has been introduced to expand EITC to childless workers, including noncustodial parents, or specifically to noncustodial parents who pay child support. In the 110th Congress, there were proposals to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for childless workers, including noncustodial parents. Senator Bayh and Senator Obama suggested targeting the expanded EITC towards noncustodial parents who pay child support, doubling the credit for those who fulfill their child support obligations. New York has had a \"noncustodial EITC\" linked to full child support payment since 2006, with positive outcomes according to an Urban Institute evaluation. The Urban Institute evaluated New York's noncustodial EITC, finding it increased child support payments for those with small obligations but not for those with larger ones. The program disproportionately benefited white males and those supporting only one child. The SNAP ABAWD rule imposes a time limit on benefit receipt unless recipients work at least 20 hours per week or participate in a state employment program. Unemployed ABAWDs in states without employment services are removed from the rolls. Welfare reforms in the 1990s linked assistance receipt to work or job preparation. Unlike SSI and TANF, SNAP focuses on work incentives. SNAP provides economic assistance to adults without children, including noncustodial parents. In FY2011, 57% of non-disabled SNAP recipients aged 18-49 were men. Policymakers have the opportunity to condition aid for unemployed ABAWDs on job preparation activities. One policy option to address the issue of unemployed ABAWDs on SNAP benefit rolls is to require them to participate in work or job preparation activities before reducing or ending benefits for noncompliance. This could be implemented through individual requirements or a state participation standard, potentially targeting noncustodial parents. However, additional funding for employment and training activities may be needed. Large child support arrearages impact millions of children receiving less than owed, reduce the cost-effectiveness of the CSE program, and create a perception of neglecting the financial needs of low-income individuals. The CSE program needs to consider the financial situation of low-income noncustodial parents to prevent the accumulation of unpaid child support. A proactive approach may help children of unemployed or underemployed parents. Reducing child support debt can increase payments and improve future outcomes for families. The current strategic plan for the OCSE aims to address these issues. The current strategic plan for the OCSE aims to reduce high child support arrearages by updating guidelines regularly, simplifying order modifications, ensuring support obligations align with noncustodial parents' ability to pay, using automation for early non-compliance detection, and promoting regular current support payments. States may compromise uncollected arrearages to encourage consistent current payments and eliminate child support debt. Some states use debt compromise to reduce child support debt by forgiving a portion or all of the debt in exchange for the noncustodial parent's participation in specified activities. Federal funds can be used to pay off arrearages, but the federal share of the debt still remains. Congress would need to pass legislation to eliminate the federal portion of the debt. It has been suggested that consumer protection limits on garnishment of child support should be revised. CSE officials can garnish up to 65% of a noncustodial parent's wages for child support debt, impacting housing, transportation, and employment. Recommendations include considering parental obligations during sentencing, not defining incarceration as voluntary unemployment, and automatically modifying child support orders for incarcerated parents. The proposal is to automatically modify child support orders for incarcerated noncustodial parents, unless the custodial parent objects due to the inmate having income/assets. Custodial parents argue that lowering child support could lead to poverty for some families and lower income for the child. They believe noncustodial parents should still have financial responsibility despite financial difficulties. Some argue that prisoners should not be fully exempt from child support obligations, as it may send the wrong message and create inequity for unemployed noncustodial parents. Suggestions include implementing child support arrearage remedies outlined in the OCSE FY2005-2009 Strategic Plan at a federal level. The CSE Access and Visitation Grant program emphasizes the importance of healthy families. The CSE Access and Visitation Grant program, funded at $10 million annually, provides access and visitation services to over 500,000 noncustodial parents and their families. It has been a separate line item in the CSE budget since 1996. The Obama Administration proposed to maintain funding at $10 million annually and include access and visitation activities as core components of the CSE program. The budget provides $580 million over ten years to support increased access and visitation services in the Child Support program. The proposal aims to update the program's statutory purposes to promote cooperation between parents and support their children, requiring states to include access and visitation responsibilities in initial child support orders. States are encouraged to undertake activities supporting access and visitation while implementing domestic violence safeguards. The CSE Access and Visitation Grant program aims to improve parent-child relationships and outcomes for children, as well as increase collections by engaging fathers in their children's lives. Child advocates suggest incorporating this program into the CSE program to receive federal matching funds and meet the demand for services, emphasizing the importance of noncustodial parents being involved in their children's lives. The CSE Access and Visitation Grant program aims to improve parent-child relationships and outcomes for children by engaging noncustodial parents. A state report highlights the need for increased funding to expand services, reach underserved populations, and meet the high demand for access and visitation services. Funding limitations currently restrict the program's ability to provide adequate services. During the current economic crisis, funding priorities for the CSE program should focus on paternity establishment, medical and child support orders. Job training and workforce programs for noncustodial parents are limited, with some targeting low-income individuals. Promising youth workforce models can help noncustodial parents find work and prepare disadvantaged young people for family financial responsibilities. Higher educational attainment is linked to higher wages for noncustodial parents. Noncustodial parents and young adults transitioning to adulthood can benefit from education programs targeting disadvantaged groups. Existing youth programs under WIA serve low-income individuals facing barriers to employment, with a focus on job training. Congress could consider implementing income and employment barriers criteria to better serve underserved adult workers. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, which has seen increased funding in recent years, could be moved from a demonstration project to a permanent part of the WIA. A re-entry program in New York City is currently being evaluated by MDRC, with the potential for its elements to be incorporated into a permanent re-entry program under WIA. Funding could also be provided for other groups such as Native Americans and low-income youth. The Department of Labor encouraged funding for transitional jobs programs in the FY2010 budget. Little is known about the effectiveness of federal job training programs under WIA. Congress provided $50 million in FY2012 for the Workforce Innovation Fund to evaluate innovative strategies for improving employment and training services. The Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) aims to improve service delivery efficiency and outcomes for vulnerable populations. The Job Corps program, evaluated by Mathematica from 1994 to 2006, showed positive impacts on youth in education and employment, proving to be cost-effective despite high costs. The Job Corps program, evaluated by Mathematica from 1994 to 2006, increased education and job training for participants by about 1,000 hours. It improved literacy and numeracy skills, GED attainment, and vocational certificates. While initially generating employment and earnings gains, the program did not have long-term impacts on earnings, except for the oldest students. The costs of the program exceeded the benefits by approximately $10,300 per participant. The Job Corps program had costs exceeding benefits by $10,300 per participant. However, for youth ages 20-24, benefits exceeded costs by $17,000. A study by Mathematica found that Job Corps increased the likelihood of marriage for female participants, reflecting the benefits of economic independence and the 'good-catch' effect in the marriage market. Employment and earnings were associated with men's likelihood of marriage, influenced by unobserved individual characteristics. Job Corps impacted the marriage outcomes of women. Subsidized employment, including transitional jobs programs, aims to support disadvantaged populations in the labor market. These programs provide work experience and job placement services to prepare individuals for regular unsubsidized jobs. Participants can be placed in transitional jobs individually or in work crews, often with nonprofit organizations or government supervision. Transitional jobs programs provide work experience and job placement services to support disadvantaged populations. Participants work in crews supervised by the program, with examples like The Community Jobs Program in Washington and the Center for Employment Opportunities in New York City serving TANF recipients and ex-offenders. The Enhanced Transitional Jobs Demonstration program provides short-term subsidized work experience and case management services for low-income or unemployed non-custodial parents and ex-offenders. Participants work in crews supervised by CEO staff, receive job coaching, attend supplemental activities, and aim to secure permanent positions. The program aims to help participants become economically self-sufficient through placement into long-term unsubsidized employment. The program aims to help participants transition into long-term unsubsidized employment. DOL is evaluating the program's impacts on employment and earnings compared to other services. Some propose changes to transitional jobs programs or alternative subsidized employment models to improve outcomes. The provision of child support enforcement law requires non-paying noncustodial parents to participate in mandatory work programs, similar to custodial parents receiving TANF assistance. Noncompliance could result in jail time. The work requirement for non-paying noncustodial parents aims to address inequity in current policy and lack of work discipline. However, there are challenges in funding enforcement costs, which may require new federal budgetary costs. The proposal for a universal work requirement for noncustodial parents raises questions about funding and equity issues. Providing a job guarantee to this population may require new federal budgetary costs and raises concerns about fairness compared to other men and custodial parents receiving TANF cash assistance. Some education programs, like career academies, have been effective for disadvantaged groups and have positive impacts on family formation. These programs, including services for low-income community college students, have shown promising results and policymakers may consider expanding them. A study by MDRC examined the effects of career academies on marital status and family formation outcomes. Career academies combine academic and technical curricula for high school students around a career theme. A study tracked the outcomes of students in nine low-income high schools from entry until eight years after graduation. Alumni of career academies earned more, were more likely to live independently with a spouse or partner and children, and had higher rates of two-parent households compared to non-academy alumni. MDRC's Opening Doors program focused on community college students at risk of dropping out, testing interventions to increase persistence and academic achievement. One site, Kingsborough Community College, used small learning communities for low-income students aged 17 to 27. Students were assigned to program or control groups to evaluate the impact. The Opening Doors program at Kingsborough Community College focused on small learning communities for low-income students aged 17 to 27. These students were more likely to feel integrated at school, be engaged with teachers, pass and earn more credits, and succeed in English skills assessment tests. Efforts to expand programs like Opening Doors have been proposed, including a bill in the 111th Congress for systematic reform of community colleges to serve low-income nontraditional students. The flexibility of TANF allows states to use funds creatively to support disadvantaged noncustodial parents, although it is challenging to mandate specific services. States can be encouraged to consider using TANF for specific benefits or services. Encouraging states to use TANF for specific benefits, such as aiding noncustodial parents, could be achieved by requiring states to address this in their TANF state plan. This would prompt state policymakers to consider serving noncustodial parents and allow for public comment on the plan. One way to encourage states to support noncustodial parents is by requiring them to report on the number of noncustodial parents receiving TANF benefits. This would make the issue more visible to state policymakers and help community organizations provide input on TANF fund usage. Another option is to redefine the youth population for program eligibility, considering the longer and more complex transition from adolescence to adulthood compared to the 1950s. Young adults today face challenges in the global economy, with many pursuing vocational training or higher education after high school. Women's increased college attendance has changed expectations, surpassing that of men. During the transition to adulthood, young adults cycle between school, independence, and living with parents. A study from 2005-2009 found over 60% of 19-22 year-olds receive financial assistance, including help with bills and tuition. Young adults receive financial assistance for bills, tuition, vehicles, and rent. The average value of assistance in 2009 was $7,490, with higher income families providing more support. Disadvantaged youth face barriers to education and employment, impacting their ability to support themselves and contribute to society. Federal programs recognize that adolescence extends beyond age 18 or 21. Congress recently extended the age of eligibility for youth programs from 21 to 24, allowing support for young adults disconnected from education and the labor market. This temporary expansion may become permanent, providing vulnerable youth with assistance as they transition into adulthood. Other programs like Job Corps and YouthBuild also allow enrollment up to age 24. Several federal programs, such as Job Corps and YouthBuild, offer support services like transportation and housing to help young adults stay in school and find work. However, not all programs, like TANF, prioritize work and education for individuals over 21. Despite efforts to align TANF with the WIA Youth Activities program, TANF recipients are defined as under 21. The temporary extension of age eligibility for youth programs until 24 may become permanent, providing crucial assistance to vulnerable young adults. The federal welfare programs have overlooked the importance of fathers in improving the well-being of children. Many children grow up without their biological fathers, and current programs do not fully address the unique needs of fathers, especially those without custody. There is a need to revise federal programs to reflect the influence of both parents on children's well-being. The next era of welfare reform aims to revise federal programs to recognize the significance of fathers in their children's well-being by reducing barriers for low-income men. This includes targeting noncustodial fathers for employment and support services to positively impact their own and other children's well-being."
