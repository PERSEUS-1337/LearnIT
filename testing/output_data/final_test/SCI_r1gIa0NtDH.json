Long-range dependencies are better modeled in two-dimensional time-frequency representations like spectrograms. A model has been designed to generate high-fidelity audio samples with longer-range dependencies than traditional time-domain models like WaveNet, across various tasks including speech and music generation. The generative model introduced captures longer-range dependencies in audio by modeling 2D time-frequency representations like spectrograms, allowing for high-fidelity audio generation with global consistency. This approach contrasts with existing models like WaveNet and SampleRNN, which struggle to capture high-level structure emerging over several seconds. Spectrogram models can generate unconditional speech and music samples with consistency over multiple seconds, capturing global structure efficiently. However, they may struggle with capturing local characteristics that correlate with audio fidelity due to oversmoothing artifacts and information loss. High-resolution spectrograms are modeled to reduce this loss and improve audio fidelity. To reduce information loss and improve audio fidelity, high-resolution spectrograms are modeled using a highly expressive autoregressive approach. A multiscale method is employed to capture both local and global structure in spectrograms with hundreds of thousands of dimensions, generating coarse-to-fine representations. This approach includes generating a low-resolution spectrogram initially, followed by an iterative upsampling procedure to add high-resolution details. MelNet is a generative model for spectrograms that captures local and global structure using a fine-grained autoregressive model and multiscale generation. It can model longer-range dependencies in audio and is broadly applicable for audio generation. MelNet is a generative model for spectrograms that can model highly multimodal data such as multi-speaker and multilingual speech. It uses spectrograms, two-dimensional time-frequency representations, to capture information about the frequency content of an audio signal through time. Spectrograms, representing audio frequency content over time, align with human perception by converting to Mel scale and applying logarithmic rescaling for pitch and loudness perception. To improve the fidelity of generated audio, high-resolution spectrograms can be modeled by increasing the temporal resolution with a smaller STFT hop size and increasing the frequency resolution by adding more Mel channels. This helps minimize artifacts and distortion in the recovered signal. The context for each element in the spectrogram is encoded using 4 RNNs, with three used for extracting features from preceding frames and one for extracting features from all preceding elements within the current frame. The text discusses using shared parameters in RNN cells and increasing Mel channels for generating spectrograms. Spectrograms are converted back to time-domain signals using inversion algorithms. An autoregressive model is used to factorize the joint distribution over spectrograms. The model factors the joint density as a product of conditional distributions parameterized by a univariate density. Each factor distribution is modeled as a Gaussian mixture model with K components. The text discusses modeling factor distributions as Gaussian mixture models with K components. The factor distribution is expressed as the output of a neural network, with parameters computed through gradient descent. Unconstrained parameters are transformed to ensure the network output parameterizes a valid Gaussian mixture model. The text discusses modeling factor distributions as Gaussian mixture models with K components. Transformations are applied to ensure positive standard deviations and sum-to-one mixture coefficients. A network is designed to compute the distribution over x ij in an autoregressive manner, drawing inspiration from existing models for images. The model estimates a distribution element-by-element over the time and frequency dimensions of a spectrogram, with a focus on the non-invariance of spectrograms to translation along the frequency axis. Utilizing multidimensional recurrence instead of 2D convolution has shown benefits in modeling spectrograms. The network has multiple stacks that extract features from different segments of the input to summarize the full context. The time-delayed stack aggregates information from previous frames, while the frequency-delayed stack utilizes preceding elements within a frame and outputs of the time-delayed stack. The stacks are connected at each layer, with features from the time-delayed stack used as input to the frequency-delayed stack. The time-delayed stack uses multidimensional RNNs to extract features from previous frames. Each layer of the stack concatenates the hidden states of three RNNs running along the frequency and time axes. Residual connections are used in both the time-delayed and frequency-delayed stacks to facilitate training of deeper networks. The final layer of the frequency-delayed stack computes unconstrained parameters\u03b8. The frequency-delayed stack computes features at layer l using a linear map to generate Gaussian mixture model parameters. Conditioning features are projected onto the input layer and reshaped as needed for compatibility with the input spectrogram. High-resolution spectrograms are generated for improved audio fidelity. We use a multiscale approach to generate high-resolution spectrograms with hundreds of thousands of dimensions. The distribution is factorized over tiers, each containing higher-resolution information, and further factorized element-by-element.\u03c8 parameterization is explicitly included. The multiscale model generates high-resolution spectrograms with tiered information factorized element-by-element. Tiers are interleaved and conditioned for subsequent generation, with recursive partitioning during training. The recursion in the multiscale model splits spectrogram x into even and odd rows, with each tier defined recursively. A feature extraction network incorporates information from preceding tiers to generate x at each tier. The feature extraction network in the multiscale model uses hidden states of RNNs to condition the generation of x. Sampling from the model involves iteratively sampling values for x conditioned on previous tiers using learned distributions. The multiscale model uses RNN hidden states for feature extraction and conditions the generation of x. Sampling involves iteratively sampling values for x based on learned distributions. The sampling procedure terminates once a full spectrogram, x <G+1, is generated. MelNet is demonstrated as a generative model for audio through training on various tasks and datasets, with generated audio samples available online. Biasing and priming procedures described by Graves (2013) are used to adjust the predictive distribution temperature and seed the model state with a given audio sequence. MelNet is trained on unconditional generation tasks for speech and music, utilizing priming seeds for model state. The presence of latent structures in generated samples serves as a proxy for model learning. Qualitative analysis of samples aids in evaluating generative models of audio. Samples for evaluation are provided on the accompanying web page. MelNet is evaluated through qualitative observations and a human evaluation experiment to compare its performance with WaveNet. The impact of multiscale generation on MelNet's ability to model long-range dependencies is also analyzed. MelNet shows the ability to generate coherent speech with consistent intonation and speaking style, even when producing incoherent speech. The model can produce speech using various character voices and learns to generate from the Blizzard 2013 dataset. MelNet can produce speech with different character voices and generate samples containing narration and dialogue. Biased samples have longer strings of words but are less expressive. When primed with real audio, MelNet maintains consistent speaking style. It is trained on the VoxCeleb2 dataset, which includes diverse speech data with various noises and multilingual speakers. MelNet, trained on the VoxCeleb2 dataset, can generate diverse speech samples with variations in speaker characteristics and acoustic conditions. The generated speech may not always be comprehensible but can be identified as belonging to specific languages. It is challenging to distinguish between real and fake samples in foreign languages, as semantic structures are not understood by listeners. MelNet realistically models phonetic structures, enabling it to generate realistic audio modalities beyond speech. MelNet, trained on the VoxCeleb2 dataset, can model audio modalities other than speech. We apply the model to unconditional music generation using the MAESTRO dataset, showcasing its ability to learn musical structures like melody and harmony. Generated samples exhibit consistent tempo and variation in volume, timbre, and rhythm. Comparisons with WaveNet are challenging, but we provide samples for evaluation. Additionally, a human experiment supports the claim that MelNet generates samples with improved long-range structure compared to WaveNet. MelNet, trained on the VoxCeleb2 dataset, can model audio modalities other than speech. In a human experiment, participants overwhelmingly agreed that samples generated by MelNet had more coherent long-range structure compared to WaveNet. Samples generated by MelNet were found to have more coherent long-range structure compared to WaveNet across all tasks. The two-stage Wave2Midi2Wave model, which conditions WaveNet on MIDI generated by a Music Transformer, did not capture long-range structure as well as MelNet. Models with varying numbers of tiers were trained to evaluate the long-term coherence of their samples. The experiment varied the number of tiers from two to five in order to evaluate the long-term coherence of the samples. Training a single-tier model on full-resolution spectrograms was too memory-intensive, highlighting the benefit of multiscale modeling. This approach allows for the allocation of network capacity based on the complexity of the modeling task. The predominant research on generative models for audio focuses on time-domain waveforms with autoregressive models like WaveNet. MelNet excels at capturing high-level structure, while WaveNet produces higher-fidelity audio. MelNet can complement time-domain models like WaveNet by capturing long-range dependencies in waveforms using a hierarchy of autoencoders. The multiscale approach in this work can parallelize tiers for training models on waveforms. Unlike other methods, it optimizes data likelihood and allows for tractable marginalization over latent codes. Generative adversarial networks have been used for waveform and spectral representation modeling, but their ability to capture all data distribution modes remains uncertain. These approaches are limited to generating fixed-duration audio segments, hindering their use in various audio generation tasks. MelNet utilizes a deep autoregressive model for generating spectral representations, influenced by advancements in image modeling. Previous models like end-to-end text-to-speech models are less expressive for tasks like unconditional music generation. Autoregressive models like LSTM, PixelRNN, and PixelCNN have improved image density estimation. The recurrent architecture designed for modelling spectrograms draws inspiration from advancements in image modeling. The multidimensional recurrence used in the architecture independently applies one-dimensional RNNs across each dimension, differentiating it from tightly coupled multidimensional recurrences. Our approach for waveform generation differs from previous methods used for image generation. It allows for efficient training by extracting features from an M \u00d7 N grid in max(M, N) sequential recurrent steps. This approach enables the use of highly optimized one-dimensional RNN implementations and is not directly transferable to waveform generation due to the absence of spatial properties in one-dimensional audio signals. MelNet is a generative model for spectral representations of audio that combines autoregressive models with multiscale modeling to generate high-resolution spectrograms with realistic structure on both local and global scales. This approach exploits spatial properties of images, extending beyond image generation to create coherent spectrograms. MelNet is well-suited for modeling long-range temporal dependencies in audio generation tasks. It offers a flexible probabilistic model for text-to-speech synthesis and representation learning, uncovering salient structures from unlabelled audio data. These capabilities could benefit downstream tasks like speech recognition."
