    "content": "The \"Community Beaches Protection Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Act regarding the protection of shores of publicly owned property. The \"Community Beaches Protection Act\" aims to promote shore protection projects and research to restore and maintain coastal resources in the United States. Preference is given to areas with previous federal investment and regional sediment management plans. The Secretary will fund shore protection projects and research to enhance coastal infrastructure, focusing on areas with federal investment, regional sediment management plans, and projects that benefit human health and safety. The Federal share of the cost for projects like parks, conservation areas, or environmental resources is determined according to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. For beach erosion control projects primarily for recreation, the Federal share is equal to projects for storm damage protection or environmental restoration. The remaining construction costs are to be paid by the State. The Federal Government bears costs for restoration and protection of Federal property, while for publicly-owned areas, the Chief of Engineers may increase the Federal share if certain criteria are met. The Chief of Engineers may approve a recreational beach or area that meets conservation criteria and extends landward to include protective natural features, upland protection measures, and public use facilities. The Act includes provisions for periodic beach nourishment to protect shores and beaches, with sand fill deposited at suitable intervals. Private shores or beaches can receive Federal assistance if they benefit public shores or beaches through public use or protection of nearby public property. The Act allows for periodic beach nourishment to protect shores and beaches, with Federal assistance available for private shores benefiting public shores through public use or protection of nearby public property. The Federal share of a project for a shore or beach is adjusted to reflect these benefits, and no Federal share is provided unless the project plan is specifically authorized by Congress or approved by the Chief of Engineers for small projects. The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is responsible for recommending and conducting studies for shore protection projects as requested by Congress. Annual reports on the status and results of these studies are submitted to relevant committees in Congress. The Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, recommends shore protection projects to Congress. This includes authorizing approved plans and assessing the feasibility of other projects studied but not yet approved. The Chief of Engineers considers economic and ecological benefits for shore protection projects. Coordination with other complementary projects is also required. The Secretary shall construct shore protection projects. The Secretary is required to construct shore protection projects authorized by Congress and offer written agreements for Federal participation with non-Federal interests before construction begins. The Secretary must specify the authorized period of Federal participation in a shore protection project and ensure cooperation between the Federal Government and non-Federal interests. Upon request, the Secretary can extend the period of Federal participation in a project that meets certain criteria. The Secretary may carry over funds appropriated for a specific project by the Corps of Engineers to the next fiscal year if environmental permits or considerations prevent their expenditure, as long as minimal environmental damage is caused and no permits are violated. SEC. 3. NON-FEDERAL CONTRIBUTIONS. Amends Section 103 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to prohibit the Secretary from soliciting excess contributions from non-Federal interests for water resources projects beyond the assigned non-Federal share. SEC. 4. NATIONAL SHORELINE EROSION CONTROL DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The Act authorizes the extension of the shoreline erosion control program, planning, design, and construction phase, technology transfers to educational institutions, and cost-sharing arrangements. The Secretary may enter into cost-sharing agreements with non-Federal interests for erosion control projects. The Act also allows for modifications to existing shoreline protection projects based on performance evaluations. The authorized shore protection project may include a demonstration project with costs determined by the cost-sharing ratio. The Chief of Engineers must approve if it meets engineering, economic, and design standards. Authorization of appropriations is increased from $25,000,000 to $31,000,000."
