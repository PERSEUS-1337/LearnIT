    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nursing Home Staff Improvement Act of 2000\". Congress findings from the Health Care Financing Administration's Report show that staffing below certain thresholds in nursing homes can lead to impaired quality of care, increased risk of life-threatening illnesses, and higher rates of hospitalization. The Health Care Financing Administration's Report found that many nursing home facilities do not meet the minimum nurse aide hours per resident day standards, putting residents at risk. The threshold for appropriate care is 2.0 nurse aide hours per resident day, while 2.9 hours are necessary to deliver essential daily care services. Over 92 percent of facilities fall below this standard, requiring a 50 percent increase in staffing. The 2.9 nurse aide hours per resident day standard is conservative and understates staffing needs, especially for residents with complex medical conditions. Minimum staffing levels based on case mix are not yet established, with a report to Congress pending on this matter. SEC. 3. COMPLETION OF REPORT TO CONGRESS ON ADEQUATE NURSING FACILITY STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 is amended to include an examination of the cost and benefits of establishing staffing minimum and optimal ratios in nursing facilities. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 is amended to include an analysis of multivariate data from 3 States to a national sample, refined case mix classification methods, validation of Phase I findings through case studies, and issues affecting recruitment and retention of certified nursing assistants. The amendments take effect as if included in the original enactment. SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF APPROPRIATE MINIMUM STAFFING REQUIREMENTS.
