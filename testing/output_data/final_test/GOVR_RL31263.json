Experts believe that a more sophisticated biological agent could overwhelm the healthcare system gradually over time. The public health impact of a biological attack can unfold gradually over time, with the speed and accuracy of diagnoses crucial for response. Experts warn of the nation's ill-preparedness due to neglect and lack of funding in the public health system. Experts warn of the nation's ill-preparedness for biological attacks, citing shortages in medical personnel, laboratories, drugs, and vaccines. They also highlight the need for better plans for quarantines and emergency facilities. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 aims to enhance the country's response capabilities. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Response Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-188, H.R. 3448) aims to enhance the nation's ability to respond to bioterrorist threats and public health emergencies. It provides a legislative history and comparison of its provisions with preexisting law. Representatives Tauzin and Dingell introduced the bill in December 2001. The Bioterrorism Response Act (H.R. 3448) was passed in December 2001, building on a bipartisan Senate bill (S. 1765) introduced by Senators Frist and Kennedy. The bill was considered under suspension of the rules and passed by the House with a vote of 418-2. The Senate later took up H.R. 3448, substituted the text of S. 1765, and passed it by unanimous consent. A conference report (H.Rept. 107-481) was filed in May 2002, and the President signed H.R. 3448 into law (P.L. 107-188) in June 2002. The President signed H.R. 3448 into law (P.L. 107-188) on June 12, 2002, incorporating provisions from previous bills. The act authorizes funding for state and local health departments, hospitals, and CDC facilities to improve preparedness for bioterrorism and public health emergencies. The bioterrorism legislation (P.L. 107-188) authorizes funding for upgrading CDC facilities, purchasing smallpox vaccine, and expanding the national stockpile of medicine. It also requires registration of facilities and individuals with dangerous pathogens, establishes safety and security requirements, and grants authority to the Secretary of Agriculture for crop and livestock threats. Additionally, the legislation includes grants for public access to defibrillators. The bioterrorism legislation (P.L. 107-188) aims to increase public access to defibrillators and protect the nation's food and drug supply. It authorizes funding for FDA and USDA to hire new border inspectors, detect contaminated foods, and enhance agricultural security. The legislation also includes provisions for FDA to require prior notice of imported foods, detain suspicious foods for inspection, and mandate registration of all food facilities. Additionally, it allocates funds to protect the nation's drinking water supply by assisting community water systems with vulnerability assessments and response plans. The bioterrorism legislation reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) to expedite drug review and approval processes. PDUFA II aimed to meet tighter performance goals, improve transparency in the review process, and enhance communication with drug makers and patient advocacy groups. The bioterrorism legislation reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) to expedite drug review and approval processes, improve transparency, and enhance communication with drug makers and patient advocacy groups.
