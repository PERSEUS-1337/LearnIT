    "content": "Green payments in the United States refer to agricultural programs with environmental goals, ranging from cost-sharing for conservation practices to incentives for whole-farm management. These programs aim to encourage environmental stewardship on working farms, moving away from land retirement towards sound environmental management. The European Union (EU) utilizes green payments for socioeconomic, rural development, and environmental goals within its rural development policy. These payments include agri-environmental measures to enhance environmental benefits on farms, along with investments in farm modernization, support for young farmers, and programs promoting non-farm rural economy activities like agri-tourism and cultural heritage preservation. Green payments and agri-environmental policy in the United States and the European Union are important aspects of agricultural policy. Global economic forces may increase the role of green payments in agricultural support, especially in trade negotiations to reduce trade-distorting support for domestic agriculture. Green payments are seen as less trade-distorting than other forms of domestic support. In the future, U.S. producers and policymakers may focus more on green payment programs to support agriculture and rural areas. The United States has implemented agri-environmental policies since the 1930s to support agriculture and rural areas. These policies include financial, technical, and educational assistance for farmers to adopt soil conservation practices. The U.S. employs mandatory cross-compliance mechanisms and voluntary incentives as agri-environmental policy tools. Voluntary incentives are central to improving environmental performance in agriculture, with few regulatory federal laws affecting agriculture such as restrictions on certain pesticides. The United States implements agri-environmental policies to support agriculture and rural areas. These policies include mandatory cross-compliance programs to discourage certain farming practices. Farmers must comply with these programs to receive government benefits. About 50% of the country's 2 million farmers currently participate. The U.S. cross-compliance mechanisms, enacted in 1985, include Highly Erodible Land Conservation and Wetland Conservation. Farmers on highly erodible land must implement an approved conservation plan. Producers on erodible land cropped from 1981 to 1985 must implement a conservation plan for a 75% reduction in erosion. Sodbuster and Swampbuster programs require conservation plans for erosion-prone grasslands and wetland conversions, respectively. Most U.S. agri-environmental programs are voluntary and funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The U.S. voluntary agri-environmental programs, also known as \"farm bill\" or \"Title II programs,\" have evolved to promote best management practices on working farmland. These programs are authorized by the farm bill and aim to support federal commodity, farm, and conservation programs. Various U.S. voluntary agri-environmental programs have been enacted over time, with funding primarily provided by the Commodity Credit Corporation. Land retirement programs involve retiring land from crop production in exchange for annual payments. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the largest private land retirement program, administered by the Farm Service Agency with an enrollment ceiling of 39.2 million acres. It is the largest agri-environmental program in terms of annual spending, costing over $2.0 billion annually starting in FY2005. Farmers can enroll land in CRP by submitting bids. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) aims to reduce soil erosion, protect soil productivity, control surplus production, and stabilize land prices. Since 1990, bids for CRP enrollment are evaluated based on an Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) score. The program includes subprograms like the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) administered by NRCS offers long-term protection to agricultural wetlands through restoration and protection plans. Enrolled lands are flood-prone agricultural lands under permanent easements or 30-year easements. The program aims to enroll 250,000 acres annually with a total limit of 2.275 million acres. Working Lands Programs provide payments to farmers for increased environmental services on working lands. The Conservation Security Program, Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), and other working lands programs administered by NRCS offer payments to farmers for environmental benefits while promoting agricultural production. These programs have been popular but face funding limitations, leading to a backlog in requests for participation. EQIP, the second-largest agri-environmental program in funding, provides cost-sharing and technical assistance for implementing environmental practices on farms. EQIP provides cost-sharing and technical assistance for implementing conservation measures on farms to address environmental issues and encourage producers to adopt certain practices. NRCS distributes funds nationally based on environmental priorities, with each state determining fund allocation based on its own priorities. 60% of EQIP funds must be spent on livestock production practices. WHIP offers cost-sharing to landowners for wildlife habitat development or restoration. Program (WHIP) (1996) provides cost-sharing to landowners for wildlife habitat development or restoration. Landowners voluntarily limit incompatible activities in exchange. WHIP targets at-risk species, declining habitats, and conservation practices ineligible for other agricultural conservation program funds. Agreements range from 5 to 15 years or more. Funding is distributed to states, with each state ranking applications based on criteria like proximity to protected wildlife habitat and cost per acre. The Farmland Protection Program (FRPP) allows states with existing programs to purchase conservation easements from willing sellers to restrict non-farm development. The Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP) targets grasslands with ecological value for habitat preservation through easements or rentals. The Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP) offers landowners easements or rental agreements to protect and restore grasslands. It has a funding limit of $254 million and an enrollment limit of 2 million acres. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) rewards producers for proactive conservation efforts and whole-farm planning, contrasting with EQIP. CSP eligibility criteria reward conservation efforts and incentivize future conservation actions. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) rewards producers for conservation efforts with increased payments based on levels of conservation. The program has eligibility criteria that have been limited by the Bush Administration to focus on high levels of conservation in designated watersheds. Congress has redirected funds from CSP to other purposes, impacting the program's availability. The first signup for CSP was in FY2004. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) had its first signup in FY2004. The 2002 farm bill increased funding for voluntary agri-environmental programs, but the full increases were not realized due to subsequent cuts in appropriations. Further reductions in funding can be expected due to budget pressures from various sources. The EU emphasizes multifunctionality in agriculture, where farmers produce food and positive environmental benefits. Agri-environmental policy aims to promote these benefits as public goods undervalued by the market, requiring public funding. For more details on authorized funding for agriculture conservation programs, refer to CRS Report RS22243 by Jeffrey Zinn. The EU supports multifunctionality in agriculture, where farmers produce food and positive environmental benefits. Public funding is needed to incentivize farmers to produce these public goods. Critics argue that multifunctionality is used to justify income support for farmers. EU policymakers consider shifting funds from commodity support to rural development as more aligned with WTO efforts to reduce trade-distorting support. Agri-environmental payments have been available to EU farmers since 1985. Successive reforms of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have emphasized green payments for farm policy and social objectives. Agri-environmental measures have become integral to the CAP, with environmental regulations becoming statutory requirements for EU farmers to receive direct income support. These regulations cover water pollution, nitrates, pesticides, habitats, and wild birds. The EU's reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) includes environmental regulations on water protection, nitrates, and pesticides. Directives aim to safeguard water quality, reduce water pollution from nitrates in agriculture, and regulate pesticide residue limits for various products. The EU's reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) includes directives on harmonizing regulations for pesticides, protecting habitats and wild birds, and notifying protected areas to the European Commission. Initially focused on supporting agricultural markets, the CAP now includes environmental objectives. The CAP included objectives related to structural aspects of agriculture and served as a legal framework for agri-environmental measures. Agri-environmental programs were financed from the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, with pre-1992 programs co-financed by the EU and member states. The EU co-finances agri-environmental programs with member states, focusing on areas like mountainous regions and coastlines. Farmers receive payments for implementing conservation measures, with LFA payments set at EUR 200 per hectare. The \"Efficiency\" Regulations aimed to improve the agricultural sector by promoting agricultural associations, groups of farmers, and environmentally friendly farming practices. Only four countries implemented agri-environmental programs under these regulations. Organic farming is encouraged under EU regulations, promoting environmentally friendly practices such as less intensive land use and exclusion of chemical inputs. Farmers participating in organic farming may receive incentive payments for up to five years. The EU reformed the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992 to reduce market surpluses and make agricultural products more competitive globally. The 1992 Common Agricultural Policy reform aimed to make agricultural products more competitive globally by reducing price supports and providing direct payments to farmers. Additionally, agri-environmental measures were emphasized, including compulsory set-asides and limits on stocking density to qualify for payments. The 1992 CAP reform introduced measures such as extensification premiums, early retirement from farming, and afforestation of agricultural land. Farmers could receive payments for adopting environmentally friendly practices like reducing chemical inputs, practicing organic farming, and maintaining the countryside. The 1992 CAP reform introduced measures to promote biodiversity, maintain landscapes, and protect hydrological systems. Farmers received payments for adopting agri-environmental practices and improving training. The early retirement scheme aimed to replace elderly farmers with younger ones or reallocate land for non-agricultural uses. The 1992 CAP reform introduced programs to promote environmental protection and countryside management. The EU afforestation program encouraged farmers to dedicate land to afforestation for up to 20 years to combat greenhouse gas effects. Member states could decide on participation in accompanying environmental measures funded from the EAGGF Guarantee Section. The EAGGF funded agri-environmental programs on a 50-50 basis with member states, or 75% in poorer regions. Farmers received annual payments for implementing measures, limited to EUR 450-900 per hectare. Livestock producers also received payments per animal unit. This marked a significant change as Guarantee funds were used for these programs instead of commodity support. The Agenda 2000 reforms continued the process of agricultural policy reform by adapting the CAP to EU enlargement and preparing for new WTO agricultural trade negotiations. Adoption of agri-environmental measures became the only compulsory element of EU rural development policy. Agenda 2000 made agri-environmental measures the only compulsory element of EU rural development policy. Member states must include these measures in their programs to access funding from the EAGGF Guarantee Section. Rural development, including agri-environmental measures, is the second pillar of the CAP, co-financed by the EAGGF. The fund has an annual ceiling of EUR 4.3 billion for rural development from 2000 to 2006, co-financing 50% of the costs. The EU co-finances 50% of rural development/agri-environmental measures, with poorer regions eligible for higher funding. A major reform in 2003 introduced a single farm payment decoupled from production, contingent on farmers' compliance with environmental and other standards. Cross-compliance is now mandatory, with sanctions for non-compliance. These policy changes took effect on January 1, 2005. Policy changes took effect on January 1, 2005, with additional funds available for rural development through modulation of Guarantee funds. EU farmers must comply with statutory mandatory requirements for single farm payment eligibility, including environmental and farming practices standards. No extra compensation is provided for meeting these standards. Good farming practices are outlined in the regulation implementing the 2003 reforms, with penalties for non-compliance. Farmers who fail to meet statutory management requirements or good agricultural and environmental practices may have their single farm payment reduced or canceled. Penalties range from a minimum 5% reduction for negligence to up to 20% or more for intentional non-compliance, with member states retaining 25% of any amounts derived from non-compliance. The European Commission oversees member states' enforcement of cross-compliance, with penalties for non-compliance. Farmers receive temporary and degressive support to meet new standards, with assistance available for farm advisory services. The 2003 CAP reforms introduced new cross-compliance standards for farmers, with support available for implementing Natura 2000. Funding per hectare for areas covered by the program will increase, with initial payments starting at EUR 500 and declining over five years. The total area eligible for Natura 2000 funding is no longer restricted to 10% of a member state's area. EU co-financing for agri-environment measures increases to a maximum of 85% in poorer regions and 60% in other areas. Increased support for LFAs with compensatory allowances raised to EUR 250/hectare. The 2003 CAP reforms introduced compulsory modulation, reducing direct payments for farms receiving over EUR 5000 annually by 3% in 2005, 4% in 2006, and 5% from 2007 onwards. Additional funds become available in 2006 for rural development measures. The modulation rate for direct payments under the 2003 CAP reforms will increase to 5% from 2007 onwards, resulting in additional EU rural development funds of EUR1.2 billion per year. Agri-environmental programs currently account for 52% of rural development spending, competing with other programs like rural restructuring and non-farm rural economy initiatives. Despite competition, spending on agri-environmental measures is expected to remain a significant component of total rural development spending in the 2007-2013 EU budget period. In 2007, modulation funds from the CAP will be redistributed among member states based on agricultural area, employment, and GDP per capita purchasing power. Each member state will receive at least 80% of the funds generated by its farmers. The EU Council of Ministers adopted a new Rural Development Regulation in 2005, centralizing rural development funding in one fund. The European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) will centralize funding, with a focus on environmental stewardship in land management. EU and member states' spending on agri-environmental programs is shared, with an estimated EUR 5.7 billion reported for environmental protection, countryside preservation, and organic production support. The EU focuses on aid for environmentally sensitive areas, organic production support, forestry measures, and genetic resource conservation. In contrast, the US reports spending $2.7 billion on various environmental programs. Both regions address similar environmental topics like soil and water quality, wildlife habitat, and farmland preservation, but differ in how they implement cross-compliance measures for commodity support payments. In the US, farmers with erodible lands or wetlands must comply with cross-compliance measures to receive commodity payments. In contrast, all EU farms must meet environmental management requirements to receive support payments. The US government administers programs and provides financial assistance, while EU member states administer programs co-financed by the European Commission. In the EU, farmers receive technical assistance and financial aid to meet agri-environmental standards, integrated with rural development policy. The EU has shifted funds from commodity to agri-environmental support, unlike the US. EU operates on a seven-year fixed budget for agricultural programs. The EU operates on a seven-year fixed budget for agricultural programs, while the United States decides budgets annually. Future agri-environmental policies in both regions may be influenced by ongoing multilateral trade negotiations. Increased funding for green payments could be considered as an alternative to trade-distorting domestic commodity support. The US and EU may closely examine each other's policies and experiences to address any required restrictions. The status and direction of negotiations for green payments in early 2007 will be crucial for U.S. farm policy debates and the crafting of the next farm bill. Uncertainty in the outcome of negotiations may lead to intense debates and potential inclusion of flexible implementation language in legislation. Congressional discussions on green payments could also become contentious for various reasons. The translation of the concept of green payments into policies and programs may lead to contentious debates among interests involved in farm policy. While most support the general concept, disagreements arise over program design, funding allocations, and administrative responsibilities. Key questions include whether the program should provide income support or only cover conservation costs, and what goals should be achieved. Some may see green payments as meeting international obligations with minimal impact on domestic efforts, while others view it as a positive shift in farm policy. Debate surrounds whether payments should be based on cost-sharing for individual practices or improved environmental performance. Green payments could incentivize coordinated actions at a larger scale for greater cumulative benefits. The differences between the United States and the EU in defining and implementing green payments may hinder using EU agri-environmental policy as a model. EU policy includes compulsory cross-compliance with agri-environmental measures, unlike the historical U.S. practice. Spending on agri-environmental programs in the U.S. has been relatively lower compared to the EU. Identifying increased funding sources for these programs is crucial, especially considering possible new WTO restrictions on other forms of support. Agri-environmental programs in the US may face challenges in competing with traditional farm support or other WTO-compatible programs, especially with projected budget deficits. Unlike the EU, there is no consensus in the US on linking agri-environment and rural development with traditional farm program measures. It remains to be seen if the EU's agri-environmental policy could serve as a model for the US. Funding for agri-environmental programs in the US is relatively lower compared to the EU. Identifying increased funding sources is crucial, especially with potential new WTO restrictions on other forms of support."
