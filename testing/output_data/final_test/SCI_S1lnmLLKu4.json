Unlike Conditional VAE models, DualVAE conditions with latent vectors containing label information, allowing for easy image transfer by moving a latent vector towards decision boundaries. DualVAE is robust to missing values of multiclass labels and is evaluated using a conditional inception score (CIS) to measure image quality. In this proposed method, a conditional inception score (CIS) is introduced to measure image changes to the target class. DualVAE demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in generating images based on multiclass labels in CelebA datasets. Other conditional generative models like CVAE, StarGAN, and FaderNetworks have limitations in transferring images corresponding to one arbitrary domain when the dimension of the multiclass is increased. DualVAE proposes a method to transfer images based on multiclass labels using latent vectors instead of labels, reducing the complexity of training. By dividing the latent space into linear decision boundaries, DualVAE can easily transfer images by moving latent vectors. DualVAE proposes a method to transfer images based on multiclass labels using latent vectors instead of labels, reducing the complexity of training. It can easily transfer images by moving latent vectors toward decision boundaries. Additionally, a new metric called conditional inception score (CIS) is introduced to evaluate transferred images conditioned with domains. The existing evaluation methods like Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance are not suitable for this purpose. DualVAE introduces a method for transferring images based on multiclass labels using latent vectors, simplifying training by moving vectors towards decision boundaries. The Conditional Inception Score (CIS) is a new metric to evaluate transferred images conditioned with domains, different from existing evaluation methods like Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance. Conditional VAE BID4 extends VAE BID3 by inferring latent variables z from image x and label y, reconstructing image x with y,z. CGAN BID7 is a conditional model using GAN, inputting noise z and class label y to the generator. FaderNetworks BID5 eliminates label information using adversarial learning to assign attributes to images. StarGAN BID1 succeeds in domain transfer by conditioning with a domain. These models are conditioned with labels, leading to insufficient training samples as label dimension increases. The Information Bottleneck method, including Variational Information Bottleneck and DualVAE, focuses on obtaining a latent variable z that predicts label y while discarding irrelevant information about input x. DualVAE is a framework that minimizes I(Z; i) while maximizing I(Z; Y) and I(Z; X), and can be seen as a probabilistic matrix factorization. DualVAE is a probabilistic matrix factorization model that extends to a generative model, similar to PMF. It is robust to missing labels and uses a decoder to learn decision boundaries between classes. Unlike CVAE, DualVAE does not require labels during inference. The objective function of the VAE involves encoder and decoder parameters. The DualVAE model extends to a generative model, robust to missing labels. It involves encoder and decoder parameters, with an objective function that includes log-likelihood expectations. Image transfer is achieved by adjusting a vector w_i with a parameter \u03bb. The DualVAE model involves adjusting a latent vector w_i to move towards a decision boundary. A new score, CIS, evaluates image transformation into multiclass target domains by measuring transfer success and feature retention. The CIS score is calculated by finetuning Inception-v3 BID10 with train images and domains as outputs. Test images are transferred into domain images and loaded into the model to obtain an n \u00d7 n matrix for each original image. The matrix M is created by subtracting the original image vector from each row of the n \u00d7 n matrix. In the algorithm, the matrix M is created with large diagonal elements to change the domain significantly and small off-diagonal elements to preserve original features. DualVAE was compared with other models for image-to-image translations on the CelebA dataset with 40 attributes. DualVAE outperformed other models in image-to-image translations for multiclass labels on the CelebA dataset. It demonstrated robustness to missing values of labels, maintaining high performance even with 90% of labels missing. StarGAN, on the other hand, showed limitations in handling sparsity of domain labels. DualVAE outperformed StarGAN in generating and transferring images corresponding to multiclass labels, even when 90% of labels are missing. The CIS metric was introduced to measure the ability to generate images corresponding to label changes. The decoder of DualVAE was a simple linear model in this study, with plans to test more complex models in the future."
