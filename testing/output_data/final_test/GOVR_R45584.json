However, concerns around security and privacy arise as information is transmitted internationally. Policymakers in the U.S. are exploring various options to address these challenges. U.S. policymakers are considering policy options to address online privacy and cross-border data flows, including new consumer rights to control personal data. International rules and norms on data flows and privacy are crucial for promoting online security. Recent incidents, such as the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, have raised awareness of the risks of personal data stored online. In 2016, millions of Facebook accounts were used to influence voters in the US election and UK Brexit referendum. Security concerns arise from data breaches like those affecting Google and Marriot customers. Personal data is highly valued by organizations for various purposes, likened to oil or gold but more versatile. Individuals want control over who accesses their personal data. Data is considered personal private property, with individuals wanting control over access and use. It is both a benefit and a liability for organizations, as they take on risks in collecting and protecting data. Privacy concerns grow with the increasing amount of online information and global data flows. The US has supported open data flows and regulated privacy at a sectoral level, aiming to balance consumer privacy, security, and open commerce in trade policy. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of data privacy policies on international trade, highlighting the importance of balancing individual privacy with trade restrictions. It emphasizes the economic benefits of digital trade and international data flows, while also addressing the challenges of ensuring cybersecurity and free data flow. Policymakers are grappling with how to protect privacy without hindering trade, with Congress examining issues related to cross-border data flows and online privacy. In the 115th and 116th Congress, committees have focused on cross-border data flows, online privacy, and data breach notification laws. Congress may consider the USMCA to address these issues through trade agreements. There is no global standard for data privacy, and Congress may need to define personal data and differentiate between sensitive and nonsensitive information. Data privacy involves preventing access to personally identifiable information (PII), which includes data that can trace an individual's identity. Electronic data sharing has made some non-traditional data points, like location tracking and purchase history, more sensitive. The EU's definition of PII encompasses a wide range of online data. Personal data refers to information about an identifiable individual, which can include sensitive details like ethnic origin, health data, and precise geolocation. Policymakers may differentiate between sensitive and nonsensitive personal data. Cross-border data flows involve the transfer of information between servers across national borders, playing a crucial role in digital trade. Cross-border data flows are essential for digital trade, boosting global GDP by 10% in the past decade. Ensuring data flows for commerce while protecting privacy, security, and intellectual property is crucial. Impeding data flows may lead to the balkanization of the internet and hinder the benefits of digital trade. Policymakers focusing on online privacy may restrict data flow across borders, potentially acting as protectionist measures. The growth of digital technologies is transforming international trade by lowering costs, changing traded goods and services, and impacting global supply chains. Measures to limit cross-border data flows could hinder digital trade, e-commerce, blockchain technology, crypto-currency trading, and the use of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence. According to the World Trade Organization, technology plays a significant role in reshaping international trade dynamics. The impact of digital technologies on trade depends on open cross-border data flows. Data localization rules are seen as a major barrier to digital trade, with some governments advocating for storing data locally. However, industry stakeholders argue that this does not necessarily enhance security or privacy. Policymakers are urged to find a balance between limiting cross-border data flows and ensuring security and privacy. Cybersecurity measures are crucial for data protection, but may not fully safeguard privacy. Sharing data securely with third parties may not align with privacy expectations. Breach notification requirements differ from proactive privacy protection measures. Laws can restrict law enforcement's access to information. Keeping user data anonymous allows for analysis while protecting identities. There is debate on balancing online security, privacy, and trade policies. The U.S. government is working on developing a comprehensive data privacy policy to address online privacy concerns. Congress has previously taken action to address privacy issues in specific sectors, such as healthcare. There are ongoing discussions among Members of Congress on possible approaches to improve online privacy protection. Additionally, the United States and other countries are negotiating new trade agreements that address privacy and cross-border data flow issues. The U.S. government is addressing online privacy concerns through new trade agreements and international forums like APEC and OECD. The WTO GATS covers digital services but lacks coverage for new products. Privacy exceptions in GATS allow countries to protect personal data as long as measures are not arbitrary or disguised trade. Efforts to update multilateral agreement and discussions for new digital trade rules under WTO Electronic Commerce Work Program stalled in 2017. Some suggest WTO should identify best practices for digital trade rules. In December 2017, a group of WTO members, including the US, agreed to explore future negotiations on trade-related aspects of electronic commerce. US objectives include free flow of information for international trade and cross-border data flows with safeguards for consumer data protection. The e-commerce initiative was formally launched in January 2019 with the US, EU, China, Brazil, and other developing countries participating. India opted out to maintain flexibility for domestic firms. Data localization measures and enforceable obligations are key points for negotiation. Harmonization of rules may be challenging due to divergent legal systems and privacy norms. The OECD 1980 Privacy Guidelines established international privacy principles for cross-border data flows, aiding countries in developing national data privacy policies. Updated in 2013, the guidelines focus on risk management and improving interoperability between national privacy strategies. The 2018 G-20 Digital Economy Ministerial Declaration builds on OECD principles and prior G-20 work to establish national privacy policies. Japan will host the 2019 G-20 focusing on data governance and global standards on privacy. APEC's initiatives on privacy and data flows have influenced domestic policies of its 21 members. APEC's 21 members, including the United States, agreed to the 2005 APEC Privacy Framework based on OECD guidelines. The framework provides principles for regulating privacy at a national level. APEC also endorsed the Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) in 2011, which aim to balance information privacy with business needs and facilitate cross-border data flows between members. The APEC framework and CBPR system aim to facilitate digital trade and economic growth in the region by identifying best practices for privacy regulations. To join the CBPR system, a government must be an APEC member, establish a regulator, map national laws to APEC guidelines, and appoint an accountability agent. Domestic organizations are not required to join the CBPR system if their government does. To join the CBPR system, organizations can benefit from indicating their commitment to data privacy in international trade. Certified enrollment allows for secure transfer of personal information between economies, ensuring compliance with legal regulations. Membership requires developing data privacy policies aligned with the APEC Privacy Framework and undergoing assessment by a third-party accountability agent for ongoing compliance monitoring and dispute resolution. The CBPR system in each member country serves as a backstop for dispute resolution if an accountability agent cannot resolve an issue. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the regulator in the United States. TrustArc is the current accountability agent, with more expected to be recognized soon. About 20 U.S. firms are APEC CBPR certified. The system's significance grows as more economies and organizations participate. The U.S. ambassador to APEC aims to have as many economies as possible join. Currently, the United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia are CBPR members, with the Philippines in the process of joining. Expanding CBPR beyond APEC could lead to consistent international rules on data flows and privacy, addressing varying privacy policies among countries. China is noted as the most restrictive digital trade country among 64 surveyed. China, Russia, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam are the most restrictive digital trade countries among 64 surveyed. The United States ranks 22, with high restrictions in the financial sector. Russia, Turkey, and China have the most restrictive data policies, while the US ranks 50 for data policy restrictions. The EU and China have different data policies driven by privacy and security concerns, respectively. These policies have influenced other countries and impacted U.S. firms doing business abroad. The EU prioritizes privacy as a fundamental human right, leading to differences with the U.S. in data protection laws. The U.S. and EU negotiated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield for transatlantic data transfers. The U.S.-EU Privacy Shield is a voluntary program for companies with commitments and obligations, overseen by EU and U.S. agencies. The GDPR, effective May 2018, establishes comprehensive privacy rules for EU members with extraterritorial implications. The GDPR applies to businesses with an EU presence processing personal data of EU individuals, including entities outside the EU offering goods/services to EU individuals. Some U.S. stakeholders express concerns about clarity and compliance guidelines. U.S. firms in the EU are making changes to comply with GDPR, like revising user agreements and seeking explicit consent. Some U.S. companies find it easier and cheaper to apply GDPR protections globally rather than maintain different policies. Large firms can afford consultants and lawyers for compliance, but small and mid-sized enterprises may struggle, deterring them from entering the EU market. Some U.S. businesses have exited the EU market due to GDPR complexities and enforcement threats. European DPAs have received complaints and initiated enforcement actions. The French DPA issued the largest GDPR penalty in January 2019. In January 2019, the French DPA fined Google \u20ac50 million for a data privacy breach, citing lack of transparency. This penalty may set a precedent for future enforcement under GDPR regulations. Organizations can transfer personal data in or out of the EU by using Binding Corporate Rules, Model Contracts, or complying with countries with mutual adequacy decisions from the EU. The EU currently deems fewer than 15 jurisdictions adequate for data transfer. U.S. organizations can join the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield program. The GDPR may introduce a certification scheme for data transfer, potentially setting global standards. Many companies are striving for GDPR compliance to avoid penalties and access the EU market. The EU promotes GDPR globally, leading to other countries adopting similar rules. EU and Japan recognized each other's data protection systems as \"equivalent,\" allowing free data flow. China's policies limit information flow and privacy rights. China's Internet Sovereignty policies, Cybersecurity Law, and Personal Information Security Specification impose strict requirements on companies, such as storing data domestically and limiting international data transfer. The 2015 counterterrorism law in China requires assistance from telecommunications operators and internet service providers, potentially sharing individuals' data. Additionally, China's social credit system monitors and shapes businesses' and citizens' behavior. China aims to shape individuals' behavior through a social credit system, determining access to government services based on their score. By 2020, all citizens are expected to be part of the system, with some U.S. businesses in China being required to participate. Various rewards and punishments are being tested in pilot projects, raising concerns about privacy and control. Other countries like Vietnam are considering similar approaches. Some countries, including Vietnam and India, are adopting cybersecurity policies that require data localization and limit cross-border data transfer. U.S. firms are considering exiting markets due to compliance issues, while concerns have been raised about the impact on trade agreements. Unlike the EU, these countries do not have mechanisms for cross-border data flows, with U.S. officials expressing concerns about localization requirements. The EU focuses on privacy protection, China on national security, and countries like Vietnam and India are following suit. The United States prioritizes a balanced approach between trade, privacy, and security in its data flow policies. The U.S. emphasizes the protection of privacy, free flow of data across borders, and an interoperable internet. Recent free trade agreements reflect these priorities, translating them into binding international commitments. The U.S. takes a data-specific approach to regulating data privacy, with laws protecting specific information like healthcare or financial data. The FTC enforces consumer protection laws and requires consumer notification and consent for data use. There is a growing interest in a comprehensive U.S. data privacy policy. The U.S. has been active in international discussions on privacy and data flows. Congress has recognized the importance of digital trade in setting trade negotiating objectives. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement negotiated by the Obama Administration included a principal U.S. trade objective on digital trade and cross-border data flows. The agreement aimed to prevent measures that impede digital trade while recognizing the need for regulations to achieve policy objectives. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2010Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement among 11 Asia-Pacific countries based on the TPP. The CPTPP, which replaced the TPP after President Trump's withdrawal in 2017, includes strong commitments on digital trade. It allows cross-border data flows and personal information protection, prohibits localization requirements for computing facilities, and requires parties to have legal frameworks for personal information protection and consumer laws for online commerce. It also encourages cooperation between data privacy regimes and consumer protection authorities. The proposed USMCA aims to revise NAFTA and includes a chapter on digital trade with articles on consumer protection, personal information protection, cross-border data transfer, and cybersecurity. It builds on the TPP by requiring parties to have legal frameworks for personal information protection and consumer laws for online commerce. The agreement provides guidance on privacy protection beyond the TPP provisions. The proposed USMCA includes provisions on privacy protection, referencing the APEC Privacy Framework and OECD Guidelines. It emphasizes the importance of not restricting cross-border data flows unless for legitimate public policy objectives like privacy or national security. The agreement allows for different legal approaches to protect personal data and recognizes APEC CBPR as a valid mechanism for cross-border information transfer while safeguarding personal information. The USMCA agreement aims to increase cooperation between the United States, Mexico, and Canada on digital trade issues, including personal information protection, cybersecurity, and privacy law enforcement. It encourages private-sector self-regulation and global interoperability of privacy regimes. The provisions are broad to encompass global efforts, with potential implications for future trade agreements. Cross-border data flows will be a key issue in U.S.-EU negotiations. The United States has a clear stance on data privacy in trade agreements. The Trump Administration is working on defining an overarching U.S. policy on data privacy through a three-track process managed by the Department of Commerce. The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a privacy framework to help organizations identify, assess, manage, and communicate about privacy risks. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is developing privacy principles for a domestic legal and policy approach, seeking public feedback on \"user-centric privacy outcomes\" and high-level goals. The International Trade Administration (ITA) focuses on international interoperability aspects of potential U.S. privacy policy, ensuring consistency with U.S. international policy objectives like the OECD framework and APEC CBPRs. The Commerce Department is seeking input for a voluntary privacy framework, unlike the EU or China. Some question if this approach will provide strong privacy protections without congressional action. Congress may lead with new federal legislation, as suggested by the GAO report in January 2019. The GAO recommends Congress develop comprehensive legislation on Internet privacy to enhance consumer protections and address evolving online environment. Stakeholders are influencing U.S. policies by submitting comments, issuing principles, and proposing model privacy legislation. Key themes include transparency in data collection and usage. Stakeholders are influencing U.S. policies on Internet privacy by submitting comments, issuing principles, and proposing model privacy legislation. Key themes include transparency in data collection and usage, user control, data security measures, and enforcement by the FTC. Differences exist on aspects like the right to deletion and data minimization. Industry groups emphasize the need to align with U.S. trade policy. Industry groups and private-sector stakeholders advocate for flexible, innovation-friendly privacy rules that promote international interoperability and cross-border data flows. They stress risk management and a harm-based approach to regulation to keep costs proportional to consumer harm prevented. Consumer advocates call for baseline obligations to protect against discrimination and disinformation, emphasizing the need for federal privacy policies to complement existing sector-specific and state-level legislation. Balancing open data flows with privacy protection globally remains a challenge. Finding a global consensus on balancing open data flows and privacy protection is crucial for maintaining trust in the digital environment and advancing international trade. Over 120 countries have laws related to personal data protection, leading to divergent national privacy approaches that raise business costs and hinder data sharing for various purposes. Establishing a system for global interoperability in a least trade-restrictive and nondiscriminatory way could minimize costs and facilitate cross-border data flows between jurisdictions with different online privacy regimes. This system could prevent internet fragmentation between European, Chinese, and American spheres, as some analysts have warned. The OECD guidelines, G-20 principles, APEC CBPR, CPTPP, and USMCA provisions show an evolving understanding of balancing cross-border data flows, security, and privacy. Various trade agreements aim to create interoperable policies that can be tailored by countries to avoid fragmentation or exclusion of other countries. These agreements may lead to a broader multilateral understanding and enforceable binding commitments based on WTO principles. Congress may consider trade-related aspects of data flows in trade agreements. During the congressional debate on implementing the USMCA, key issues include meeting trade negotiating objectives and balancing public policy goals. Future trade negotiations with the EU and Japan aim to establish rules for cross-border data flows. Congress faces challenges and opportunities to engage with USTR on these issues and oversee negotiations. Consideration may be given to achieving consensus on data flows and privacy globally through oversight of current best practices and ongoing e-commerce negotiations in the WTO. Congress may want to consider endorsing efforts in the WTO on e-commerce to influence international discussions. They may also examine challenges of interoperability between APEC, CBPR, and EU GDPR. Understanding the economic impact of data flows and privacy regimes in other countries is crucial for U.S. access to markets. Congress may need to address barriers that discriminate against U.S. exporters and lack of reciprocal treatment in trade agreements. Congress may need to enact comprehensive privacy legislation and review the implications of not having a national data privacy policy. They should also consider if EU GDPR and China's cybersecurity policies will become global norms in the absence of a clear U.S. alternative. Additionally, Congress should oversee ongoing privacy efforts and ensure they align with U.S. trade objectives. Congress may need to enact comprehensive privacy legislation to address key factors such as balancing cross-border commerce, economic growth, innovation, individual privacy, and national security. They should consider the impact on U.S. consumers and businesses, including multinationals and small- to medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, Congress should assess the tools needed to analyze cross-border data flows and align evolving U.S. privacy policies with trade objectives and international standards. U.S. policymakers may need to prioritize interoperability with international privacy frameworks to prevent global market fragmentation and internet balkanization. Other policy considerations unrelated to trade should also be taken into account."
