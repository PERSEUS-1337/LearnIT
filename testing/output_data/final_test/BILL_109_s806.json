    "content": "TRAUMATIC INJURY PROTECTION. In General, Subchapter III of chapter 19 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to include definitions of 'activities of daily living' and provisions for traumatic injury protection for insured members. The traumatic injury protection rider will provide a payment of up to $100,000 for members who sustain a traumatic injury resulting in a specified loss. The maximum amount payable for injuries from a traumatic event is $100,000. Members with a traumatic injury protection rider are insured against specific losses such as total and permanent loss of sight, limb severance, loss of speech or hearing, and certain types of paralysis. The traumatic injury protection rider covers specific losses such as quadriplegia, paraplegia, hemiplegia, severe burns, and coma resulting from brain injury. Quadriplegia is complete paralysis of all 4 limbs, paraplegia is paralysis of both lower limbs, and hemiplegia is paralysis of upper and lower limbs on one side of the body. Exclusions include injuries from attempted suicide or intentional self-inflicted harm. The traumatic injury protection rider covers specific losses such as quadriplegia, paraplegia, hemiplegia, severe burns, and coma resulting from brain injury. Exclusions for payment include illness, medical treatment, infections, felony commission, intoxication, and willful misconduct. The Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance provides coverage for specific traumatic injuries, with payments made according to a schedule for different types of losses such as loss of hands or feet, inability to carry out daily activities due to brain injury, and severe burns. The member must suffer the loss within a certain timeframe after sustaining the traumatic injury. The Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance provides coverage for various traumatic injuries, with payments based on a schedule for specific losses like burns, loss of sight, limbs, speech, hearing, and paralysis. The amount varies depending on the severity of the injury, ranging from $25,000 to $100,000. The Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance covers traumatic injuries with payments based on a schedule for specific losses. For example, loss of thumb and index finger of the same hand is compensated with $25,000, while a coma resulting from traumatic brain injury is compensated with $50,000 at the time of claim and $50,000 at the end of a 6-month period. Members on active duty have a monthly premium deducted from their pay for traumatic injury protection, determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines the premium for traumatic injury protection for members on active duty, with contributions collected from their pay and credited monthly to the appropriation. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines premium amounts for traumatic injury protection coverage based on actuarial principles. Premium rates for the first policy year continue for subsequent years, with adjustments based on policy experience. The cost of insuring members under this section, minus deducted premiums, is paid by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs monthly. The Secretary of Defense shall provide appropriations for expected claims to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Half of the anticipated cost of claims for the fiscal year will be forwarded upon the legislation's effective date. The Secretary of Defense must certify the eligibility of members claiming benefits under this section. Payment for traumatic injury loss will not be made if the member dies within 7 days. Insurance coverage for loss resulting from traumatic injury provided under this section will cease at the member's separation from the uniformed service. Payment will be made according to the member's beneficiary designation under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance if the member dies within 7 days of the injury. Coverage under this section is not convertible to Veterans' Group Life Insurance. The amendments for traumatic injury protection will take effect more than 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
