    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protection From Price Gouging Against Disaster Victims Act of 2005\". The findings and goals are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that the United States receives generous support after natural disasters, but some exploit these situations for financial gain. The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for preventing unfair practices, with expertise in analyzing markets for anticompetitive behavior. The Senate and House committees focus on consumer protection. The goals of the Act include preventing price gouging after natural disasters, ongoing FTC investigations, and ensuring enforcement authority for consumer protection. The Federal Trade Commission Act is amended to include protection from price gouging following major disasters. The Protection From Price Gouging Against Disaster Victims Act of 2005 defines terms like \"affected area\" and \"consumer good or service\" as related to major disasters declared by the President. The term 'consumer good or service' includes properties or facilities rented for residential or storage use. 'Price gouging' is defined as charging an excessively high price in an affected area. 'Supplier' encompasses various entities involved in providing consumer goods or services. 'Unconscionably excessive price' refers to a grossly disproportionate price in an affected area. The Commission determines price gouging during a major disaster by comparing prices to the average in the area before the disaster. The price increase should not be due to increased costs for the supplier. After a disaster declaration, the Commission consults with the Attorney General and the US Attorney. The Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General and US Attorney, investigates price gouging in disaster-affected areas. They establish a hotline for reporting price gouging and distribute informational materials to help residents detect and avoid it. During a major disaster, suppliers are prohibited from charging excessively high prices for consumer goods or services in affected areas. The Commission will investigate and take appropriate action against any supplier found to be in violation of this regulation. Suppliers violating price regulations during a disaster may face civil penalties up to $500,000, special damages, attorney's fees, and disgorgement of profits. Criminal penalties include imprisonment for up to 1 year. Suppliers who violate price regulations during a disaster may face imprisonment for up to 1 year. Victims can take legal action for damages, attorney's fees, and other relief. State attorneys general can also bring civil actions on behalf of residents for similar damages and relief. The Protection From Price Gouging Against Disaster Victims Act of 2005 allows for legal action against price gouging, with penalties including imprisonment and the recovery of damages, attorney's fees, and other relief. The Act also requires the Commission to report on price gouging complaints and investigations annually to Congress. The Protection From Price Gouging Against Disaster Victims Act of 2005 mandates the Commission to report on enforcement actions, evaluate the toll-free hotline, and make recommendations for improvement. Additionally, the Act requires the Commission to define 'gross disparity' within 180 days of enactment. The Act does not impact the Federal Trade Commission's authority regarding price gouging actions."
