    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Hospice Benefit Amendments of 1996\" establishes hospice care benefit periods. The Medicare Hospice Benefit Amendments of 1996 restructure benefit periods to allow for unlimited subsequent periods of 60 days each. Conforming amendments adjust the time frames for certain periods within the Act. The Social Security Act is amended to include ambulance services, diagnostic tests, chemotherapy services, and radiation therapy services in hospice care. Additionally, contracting with independent physicians or physician groups for hospice care services is permitted. Section 1861(dd)(2) of the Social Security Act is amended to waive certain staffing requirements for hospice care programs in non-urbanized areas. Section 1861(dd)(5) of the Social Security Act is amended to allow the Secretary to waive staffing requirements for certain services in non-urbanized areas if the agency or organization demonstrates inability to recruit appropriate personnel. Additionally, a limitation on liability for beneficiaries and providers for certain hospice coverage denials is established. The Social Security Act is amended to include a new paragraph regarding the provision of hospice care to individuals who are not terminally ill. Additionally, the waiver period for certain services in non-urbanized areas is extended by amending the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. The Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 is amended to remove a specific date. The amendments will be effective on December 31, 1995. SEC. 7 extends the period for physician certification of an individual's terminal illness. SEC. 8 states that the amendments apply to benefits provided on or after the enactment date, regardless of prior elections under the Social Security Act."
