    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Business and Farm Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001\". The Congress recognizes that small businesses in the United States heavily rely on heating oil, natural gas, propane, and kerosene for their operations. Sharp price increases in these fuels can disproportionately harm small businesses, causing them significant economic injury. Sharp price increases in heating oil, natural gas, propane, and kerosene can harm small businesses economically and negatively impact the national and regional economies. These price spikes have occurred in specific winters and can be caused by various factors like supply difficulties, weather conditions, and market structures, often unforeseeable to small business owners. The Small Business Energy Emergency Disaster Loan Program is established to help small businesses affected by sharp price increases in heating oil, natural gas, propane, and kerosene. The Small Business Energy Emergency Disaster Loan Program assists small businesses impacted by significant price hikes in heating fuel or electricity by providing loans directly or through partnerships with lending institutions. The Small Business Energy Emergency Disaster Loan Program provides loans at the same interest rate as economic injury loans, with a maximum limit of $1,500,000 unless the applicant is a major source of employment in the area. The Small Business Energy Emergency Disaster Loan Program allows for loans to be provided if a disaster area is declared or if there is a sharp increase in heating fuel or electricity prices causing economic injury to small businesses in need of financial assistance. The Small Business Energy Emergency Disaster Loan Program allows loans for small businesses affected by disasters or sharp increases in heating fuel or electricity prices. Loans can be used to switch to renewable energy sources. Amendments to the Small Business Act include addressing price increases in heating fuel or electricity. SEC. 4. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER EMERGENCY LOANS. Section 321(a) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act is amended to include provisions for small business concerns suffering economic injury due to increased energy costs after June 1, 2000, in connection with an energy emergency declared by the President. The amendment allows for funds from emergency loans to be used for natural disasters or energy emergencies declared by the President or Secretary. SEC. 5. GUIDELINES.\n\nWithin 30 days of this Act's enactment, the Small Business Administration and the Secretary of Agriculture will issue necessary guidelines to implement the Act and its amendments.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORTS. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration will submit a report on the effectiveness of the program established under the Small Business Act, including the number of small businesses that applied, received loans, dollar value of loans, states of participating businesses, and the type of heating fuel causing cost increases. The Secretary of Agriculture will submit a report on the effectiveness of loans made available under the program, along with recommendations for improvements, to the Committees on Small Business and Agriculture. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments made by this Act shall apply during the 2-year period beginning on the date of final publication of guidelines under section 5 by the Administrator for small businesses and by the Secretary of Agriculture for agriculture. Passed the Senate on March 26, 2001. The document is attested by Gary Sisco, Secretary."
