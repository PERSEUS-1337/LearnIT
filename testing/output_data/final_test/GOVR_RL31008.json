    "content": "President Bush signed the FY2002 Department of Transportation and Related Agencies conference agreement, appropriating $59.588 billion with increases for major agencies like the FAA, FTA, and Coast Guard. The bill provides funding for various agencies, with slight decreases for FHWA and FRA compared to FY2001 levels. The 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States (P.L. 107-38) provided $40 billion for various responses, including increased transportation security. Approximately $1.9 billion has been approved for transfer to the Department of Transportation (DOT). Transportation funding is part of the discretionary budget and is derived from various sources. Funding for the DOT budget comes from transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, such as the highway trust fund and transit account, are funded by specific taxes. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending, with highway and transit funding being the largest components. Contract authority, linked to the highway trust fund, is significant for funding highway and transit programs. Contract authority under Title 23 U.S.C. allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year for transportation projects. While appropriations are needed for future outlays, the authority to spend for major programs already exists. Changes in transportation spending were historically achieved by combining changes in budget/contract authority. TEA21 changed the transportation budget process by creating new budget categories for highway and mass transit, setting statutory limitations on obligations, and establishing a discretionary spending guarantee for core programs. TEA21 established \"firewalls\" to guarantee funding for highway and mass transit programs, with additional funds available through annual appropriations. The Revenue Aligned Budget Authority redistributes excess trust fund revenues to states for highway programs. The FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002 Administration requests proposed redirecting RABA funds from highway programs to other DOT initiatives, with FY2002 partially honoring the request. The FY2002 Act made major redistributions of RABA funding outside core programs, impacting the Federal Highway Administration section. TEA21 changed the role of House and Senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002 appropriations acts saw redistributions of funds among programs and added significant spending projects. Appropriators regained discretion over highway spending by adding funds for earmarked projects and redirecting funding between programs. This trend continued and accelerated in the FY2002 Act with major redistributions of RABA funds to agencies not eligible for such funding. The FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002 appropriations acts saw redistributions of funds among programs and added significant spending projects. Appropriators regained discretion over highway spending by adding funds for earmarked projects and redirecting funding between programs. In some instances, RABA funds were transferred to agencies not eligible for such funding. The TEA21 firewalls limited the flexibility of appropriations committees to adjust DOT agency budgets. FAIR21 provided a guarantee for FAA program spending, different from TEA21's guarantee for highway and transit programs. The FAIR21 rules for the House and Senate ensure that appropriations for aviation must use all total budget resources. Spending for FAA operations and maintenance, as well as research and development, is only allowed if AIP and F&E are funded at authorized levels. FAIR21 guarantees are seen as weaker than TEA21's for highways and transit due to Congress's ability to waive points-of-order. Appropriators may still have some flexibility in funding decisions. FAIR21 allows transportation appropriators control over spending for the Coast Guard, FRA, and smaller DOT agencies. FY2001 saw budget increases for major DOT agencies except for FRA. Coast Guard supporters are concerned about funding in this new appropriations environment. The Coast Guard's funding situation is unique within transportation appropriations due to its wartime national defense role. It may seek additional funds from military appropriations if needed. In FY2002, national security concerns led to a significant increase in funding for the agency. The Bush Administration's FY2002 budget proposal included a roughly 1.5% increase in the Department of Transportation budget, totaling around $59 billion. This proposal aligned with existing transportation funding laws like TEA21 and FAIR21. The Conference Agreement (H.Rept. 107-308; P.L. 107-87) resolved differences between House and Senate bills on funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT), including provisions related to NAFTA and Mexican commercial trucks. President Bush signed P.L. 107-87 on December 18, 2001, providing $59.6 billion for DOT, slightly more than requested for FY2002. The FY2002 DOT appropriations act provides significant budget increases for most DOT agencies compared to FY2001. The Federal Aviation Administration budget increases by 6%, the Federal Transit Administration budget by 8%, and the Coast Guard by 12%. However, the Federal Highway Administration receives slightly less funding than in FY2001, and the Federal Railroad Administration receives $21 million less. Additionally, $1.25 billion is allocated for the Transportation Security Administration. The Administration proposed changes to transit programs, including converting programs from discretionary to formula, which was rejected by both the House and Senate. They also suggested reducing the federal share for the New Starts Program from 80% to 50%, sparking debate on project funding and local commitment. The FY2002 Act limits federal share in grant agreements to 60%, potentially favoring urban projects. The budget debate included RABA set-asides for border facilities and transportation solutions for the disabled. The FY2002 Act proposed using $45 million for innovative transportation solutions for the disabled and $100 million for competitive grants to promote alternative transportation access. Congress did not adopt RABA fund redirection in previous years, but there was a modest change in RABA distribution in FY2000 and FY2001. The FY2002 RABA of $4.543 billion increased the potential for congressional initiatives or earmarking. The FY2002 Act allocated $56.3 million of RABA funds for U.S.-Mexico border infrastructure, with $423 million redirected to discretionary programs instead of formula funds for states. This increased the total RABA funding available to $997 million for FHWA's allocated programs, with specific programs receiving set-asides in the conference report. Programs without set-asides did not receive any RABA funding. The FY2002 Act allocated RABA funds for various programs, with some losing funding while others benefitting. Key programs receiving additional funds include Indian Reservation Roads, Public Lands Highways, Park Roads, ferry boats, Corridors and Borders program, and more. Some members of Congress are unhappy with the set-asides not conforming with TEA21. The FY2002 Act allocated $144 million for surface transportation grants, with funds earmarked in H.Rept.107-308. The controversy surrounds the extent of earmarking, particularly of RABA funds. The implementation of NAFTA provisions regarding Mexican trucking in the U.S. was a contentious issue, with safety concerns leading to a dispute resolution under NAFTA. The Bush Administration announced its intention to address the issue. The arbitration panel ruled against the U.S. regarding NAFTA trucking access. The Bush Administration planned to implement the provision by 2001. The House added a provision to H.R. 2299 to block funds for processing applications from Mexico-based trucking firms. The Senate bill included safety requirements for Mexican motor carriers to operate beyond the border commercial zone. These requirements included safety compliance reviews, weigh-in-motion systems at border stations, valid insurance from U.S. companies, and restrictions on Mexican commercial vehicles crossing the border. The Senate passed H.R. 2299 with Mexican trucking provisions intact, overcoming Bush Administration concerns about NAFTA violation. The FY2002 ACT includes measures for cross-border trucking safety between the U.S. and Mexico, with $25.866 million allocated for implementation. The 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act allocated $40 billion for various responses to the September 11 terrorist attacks, including increased transportation security measures. This funding aimed to enhance safety for Mexican trucks and buses entering the United States under the MCSAP program. The 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act allocated $40 billion for transportation security. $10 billion was immediately available, $10 billion after 15 days, and $20 billion required separate legislation. $640 million has been allocated for transportation security so far. $734 million was requested for transportation security from the final $20 billion. $1.296 billion was allocated for transportation projects and activities in the FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2001 provided $1.936 billion for transportation security purposes. Total annual Department of Transportation funding more than doubled from FY1988 to FY2001, with FY2002 seeing an upward trend in funding at roughly $59.6 billion. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (P.L. 107-71) created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the Department of Transportation. The TSA is headed by an Under Secretary for Security appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a fixed five-year term. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) assumes civil aviation security functions, including hiring, training, and deploying security personnel for passenger and baggage screening. TSA also improves airport security, deploys Federal Air Marshals for high-risk flights, and coordinates security during national emergencies. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) coordinates and oversees domestic transportation for air, rail, maritime, and surface transport modes during national emergencies. They develop policies, strategies, and plans for security threats and conduct R&D activities to enhance transportation security. The FY2002 Act provides $1.25 billion for TSA, offset by the security service fee authorized under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA). The fee of up to $2.50 per passenger pays for civil aviation security services, with the option for TSA to impose a fee on air carriers if needed. The revenue collected from the air carrier fee is limited to the amount paid in 2000 for screening services. An allocation of $94.8 million in emergency funds is designated for TSA in the FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act. The Coast Guard appropriation is constrained by increased responsibilities for drug and illegal immigrant interdiction. The Administration requested $5.056 billion for Coast Guard funding in FY2002, with the House approving $4.966 billion. The Coast Guard funding for FY2002 was approved at $5.03 billion, slightly less than the requested $5.056 billion. Additionally, there are mandatory funds for State Boating Safety grants and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The FY2002 Coast Guard funding of $5.03 billion was slightly less than the requested amount of $5.056 billion. The requested $3.38 billion for operation and maintenance included defense-related funding. Additional funds were sought for acquisition, construction, and improvement, with the House approving $600 million and the Senate approving $669.3 billion. Compliance with environmental regulations and cleanup of contaminated sites received $16.9 million in funding. The conferees approved $16.9 million for the budget, the same as current year funding. $15.5 million was approved for altering bridges, matching current year funding. $20.2 million was approved for research and development, slightly less than current year funding. Retirement pay allocation will be $876.3 million, 13% greater than FY2001. $83.2 million was approved for training a military Selected Reserve Force. $50 million was allocated for spill clean-up and damage assessment from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Coast Guard is managing a major replacement of aging vessels and aircraft. The Coast Guard is managing a major replacement program for aging vessels and aircraft, focusing on improving capabilities on the high seas. Funding for FY1998 through FY2001 was for planning and analysis only. Industry teams were to submit design proposals by July 2001, with contracts to be awarded in the second quarter of FY2002. $320 million was provided in the FY2002 Act, with anticipated purchases of nearly $10 billion over a 20-year period starting in FY2002. The FY2002 appropriations bill includes a penalty for late submission of the FY2003 budget request. The Coast Guard received $18 million in immediate funds for New York City harbor patrols and Coast Guard reservists recall under the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. An additional $209.15 million was allocated in the FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act for various purposes until September 30, 2003, including Reserve activation, anti-terrorism activities, and National Defense Authorization Act entitlements. These funds are separate from the $320 million provided in FY2002 for a replacement program for aging vessels and aircraft. The FY2002 Defense Authorization Act provides funding for various programs, including $521 million for Amtrak, $111 million for core safety and operations, and $32.3 million for next generation high-speed rail development. Funding for Rhode Island and West Virginia rail development programs was eliminated, while Alaska received $20 million for railroad rehabilitation. Pennsylvania Station relocation project in New York City and Alaska Railroad rehabilitation maintained funding levels. The FY2002 budget includes $32.3 million for next generation high-speed rail development, a $7 million increase from FY2001. The funding for the Federal Railroad Administration's safety program is proposed at $111.4 million, primarily used for salaries, travel expenses, and monitoring rail industry safety performance. States may also discuss obtaining additional funds for high-speed rail initiatives. The FY2002 budget proposes $110.9 million for railroad safety, with a suggestion to impose a rail-user fee to offset costs. However, both the House and Senate bills rejected this proposal, citing industry objections. The last railroad safety Reauthorization statute was enacted in 1994. The last railroad safety Reauthorization statute was enacted in 1994, and funding authority for that program expired at the end of FY1998. FRA's safety program continues using existing authorities and funds from annual appropriations. Deliberations have not resulted in consensus for continued funding or changes to existing authorities. A reauthorization statute could impact budgets after FY2002, particularly in grade-crossing safety activities. Key safety issues include FRA's effectiveness in helping states with grade-crossing safety challenges and the adequacy of the FY2002 budget for this purpose. In its FY2002 budget, FRA requested funding to strengthen its grade-crossing safety program and associated public education activities. The FRA conducts research on topics like fatigue of railroad employees and technologies to control train movements. The FY2001 DOT appropriations act provided $25.3 million for the R&D program, while FRA requested $28.3 million for railroad R&D activities in FY2002. The FY2002 Act provided $29 million for railroad R&D activities, including $32.3 million for the Next Generation High-Speed Rail Program. Additionally, $6 million was allocated for safety and operations under the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. After September 11, Amtrak increased security measures at its terminals and tracks, including additional personnel and inspections. The FY2002 authorization for Amtrak was $955 million, with President Bush's budget request at $521.5 million. The funding arrangement allowed Amtrak to use their entire appropriation immediately, totaling $833 million for FY2002. The FY2002 Act provided $521.5 million for Amtrak, with increased security measures in response to the events of September 11. After September 11, Amtrak increased security measures at terminals and tracks. Demand for Amtrak's services rose during the suspension of commercial air travel. Despite the preference for not flying, overall passenger load slightly decreased due to security spending and decreased demand. The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 prohibits federal operating grant funds for Amtrak after FY2002. Congress has only provided capital grant funds to Amtrak, which can also be used for operating expenses. The Amtrak Reform Council declared that Amtrak would need operating assistance after FY2002. A plan for restructured national passenger rail service and an Amtrak liquidation plan are due to Congress by February 7, 2002. The FY 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds for developing the Amtrak liquidation plan. The DOT Inspector General estimates the need for operating assistance. Amtrak will require $2.7 billion to $4 billion in federal funds for new equipment and improvements. A capital improvements plan calls for $973 million in annual spending to maintain current service levels and an additional $584 million for expansion. Amtrak foresees a need for $1.52 billion annually for maintenance and service expansion in the long-range plan. Emergency funds were provided for security work on Amtrak rail tunnels in New York City. The Amtrak Reform Council, an independent federal commission, received a budget request of $785,000 in FY2002, compared to $748,000 in FY2001. The Council was created in 1997 to assess Amtrak's labor agreements, productivity, and ability to operate without federal assistance after September 30, 2002. The FY2002 Act provided $225,000, indicating Congress may have expected the Council's work to be completed after submitting a restructuring plan in February 2002. The Amtrak Reform Council concluded that Amtrak needs federal operating grant funds after FY2002, requiring the submission of reorganization and liquidation plans to Congress by February 7, 2002. The Council recommended stable funding for passenger rail operations and separating Amtrak's multiple roles. The FY2002 Act approved $32.895 billion for FHWA, an increase of $1.22 billion from FY2001. The FY2002 Act approved $32.895 billion for FHWA, an increase of $1.22 billion from FY2001. The obligation limitation is set at $31.799 billion, with funding for exempt programs slightly lower at $995 million. The Act also includes a controversial redirection of just under $1 billion in RABA funds. The FY2002 Act approved $32.895 billion for FHWA, with a controversial redirection of just under $1 billion in RABA funds. The Act removes half a billion dollars from core program redistribution to states and zero funds certain programs eligible for RABA funding. Funds are directed to specific discretionary programs, including the Corridor and Border program receiving over $352 million in RABA funding. This results in states losing expected core program funding and the elimination of RABA funding for certain programs. The FY2002 Act redistributes funds from core programs to specific discretionary programs, causing concerns among states and transportation committees. Earmarking in FHWA's non-core formula programs is increasing, leading to controversy over negating the intent of TEA21 legislation. The FY2002 Act redistributes funds from core programs to specific discretionary programs, causing concerns among states and transportation committees. Appropriators believe they should have a role in determining fund allocation, responding to Members of Congress' earmarking requests. The Administration's FY2002 proposal set aside funds for new projects like the New Freedom Initiative and border inspection facilities, but the Act provided funding for the latter only. TEA21 created the largest surface transportation program. TEA21, the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, continued most highway and transit programs from ISTEA. It includes new funding initiatives like the Border Infrastructure Program, but mainly focuses on existing programs like the National Highway System and Bridge Replacement. The highway funding programs under TEA21 include Surface Transportation Program (STP), Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation (BRR), and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ). These programs are apportioned annually by formula and are not subject to program-by-program appropriation. There are also \"exempt\" funds for minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief, as well as \"allocated\" programs like the Federal Lands Highway Program and High Priority Projects. TEA21 links highway revenues to spending, with annual evaluations to adjust funding based on revenue changes. The Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) formula determines funding adjustments. The Act also includes funding for FHWA Research, Development, and Technology Programs. The Administration proposed increased funding for various Research, Development, and Technology (RD&T) Programs from $437.2 million in FY2001 to $528.7 million in FY2002. The funds are used to advance technologies for highway pavements, structures, roadway safety, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The largest requested increases are in FHWA's Surface Transportation R&D and ITS programs, with a focus on deploying advanced communication and information systems to improve transportation management and safety. An issue with the ITS deployment program is the earmarking of funds by appropriators. The FY2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act provides $175 million for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) deployment, with $100 million allocated for interstate ferry expansion. Some Members prefer competitive awarding of deployment funds, but TEA21 specifies projects to receive ITS funds. The Senate bill requires ITS funds to align with the goals of the ITS Act of 1998. The FY2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act provides $175 million for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) deployment, with $100 million allocated for interstate ferry expansion between New York and New Jersey. Additionally, $75 million is designated for FHWA's Emergency Relief Program. An extra $10 million is allocated for the repair of non-federal-aid highways destroyed by the World Trade Center collapse under the Federal Emergency Management Agency. President Bush's FY2002 budget proposal for FTA was $6.75 billion, an 8% increase from FY2001, following the enactment of TEA21 in 1998. Transit funding under TEA21 reached its highest level in FY2001. In FY2001, transit funding under TEA21 reached its highest level. The $6.75 billion passed for FY2002 continues the impact of TEA21 on transit spending. There are two major transit programs: the Capital Investment Grants and Loans Program and the Urbanized Area Formula Grants Program. The Capital Investment Grants and Loans Program has three components: new transit starts, fixed guide way modernization, and bus and bus facilities. For FY2002, the program was funded at $2.891 billion, a 5% increase over FY2001. For FY2002 and FY2003, the Administration proposed shifting bus and bus facilities funding to a formula based on population and density factors. The conference report did not address this proposal, with most of the money in this component being earmarked by Congress. The total funding for bus and bus facilities in FY2002 was $619.7 million, including funds transferred from the Clean Fuels program. Additionally, the Bush Administration suggested changes to the federal matching share for \"new starts\" beginning in FY2004. The Bush Administration proposed reducing the federal matching share for \"new starts\" under the Capital Investment Grants and Loans Program to a maximum of 50% from 80% starting in FY2004. Critics argued that this change would make it harder for cities and states with fewer fiscal resources to fund their local share. After FY2002, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) would not sign any new full funding grant agreements with a federal share greater than 60%. The Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) provides capital and operating needs for urbanized areas with a population of 50,000 or more. The Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) provides funding for urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more. For FY2002, the Administration proposed $3.22 billion, but the FY2002 Act only provided $3.0 billion. Funding is apportioned based on population, with larger areas receiving two-thirds of the funding. Operating assistance funding was eliminated for urbanized areas with populations over 200,000 with the enactment of TEA21. Preventive maintenance is now eligible for funding as a capital expense for urbanized areas over 200,000 population. Urbanized areas under 200,000 and non-urbanized areas can use formula funds for capital or operating purposes. Other transit programs include grants for non-urbanized areas, elderly, individuals with disabilities, and clean fuels. The Act provided $6.95 million for the Rural Transportation Accessibility Incentive Program in FY2002. A provision to transfer $50 million of Clean Fuels formula funds to the Bus Discretionary component was defeated in the House but re-inserted by conferees. The majority of FY2002 formula grants funding is for the Urbanized Area Formula Program, with a small portion allocated to the Non-Urbanized Area Formula Program. TEA21 authorized a new discretionary Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program. TEA21 authorized a new discretionary Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program, providing funding for transportation projects to help welfare recipients and low-income individuals find and get to work in suburban areas. The Administration proposed funding this program at $125 million in FY2002, up from $100 million in FY2001. The FY2002 Act allocated $125 million for the program, but did not address the proposal to convert it to a formula basis. Additionally, the Act provided $10 million for increased security for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and $123.5 million for FTA formula and capital grants under the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The FY2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 3338; H.Rept. 107-350) allocated $23.5 million in formula grants for replacement of destroyed buses and transit kiosks, security and emergency response plans, detection of chemical or biological agents, and security training for transit operators. Additionally, $100 million in capital investment grants were provided for repair of the New York City transit systems damaged by the September 11 attack. The FAA received a total budget of $12.978 billion for FY2002, with the majority of funding coming from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. A Treasury general-fund contribution of $1.113 billion was provided, less than the previous year's $2.13 billion. The FY2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocated $23.5 million in formula grants for transit security and emergency response plans. The FAA received $12.978 billion for FY2002, with funding from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and a $1.113 billion Treasury general-fund contribution. The Act increases funding for all FAA activities, focusing on safety and infrastructure upgrades, with $6.886 billion allocated for Operations and Maintenance. The FAA's FY2002 budget includes funding for air traffic control, safety, and security. The Facilities and Equipment budget receives $2.9 billion, a 10% increase from FY2001. Research, Engineering, and Development is allocated $195 million, slightly higher than the previous year. The Essential Air Service program is operated by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, operated by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, receives funding from user fees collected from foreign aircraft overflights. The program's annual funding level is $50 million, but for FY2002, it is predicted to generate only $40 million. The Bush Administration requested $10 million from the airport and airway trust fund to make up the difference. The Administration proposed cutting subsidies for 18 communities to offset higher costs at remaining EAS communities. The House proposed additional funding of $13 million for the Essential Air Service program to prevent any loss of service. They also allocated $10 million for the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program, which was ultimately removed from the bill. The Senate bill allocated $50 million for EAS from overflight user fees, with the FAA Administrator authorized to transfer up to $10 million if needed. The FAA Administrator has the authority to transfer up to $10 million to the Essential Air Service program from the Airport Improvement Program. The Senate accepted the eligibility requirements for participation in the program and provided $20 million for the Small Community Air Service Development program from within the FAA budget. The FY2002 Act allocates $63 million for EAS, with $13 million in new appropriations and $50 million from overflight fees. Any revenue shortfall will be funded from unobligated balances of the F&E account. Additionally, $20 million is provided for the SCASD, and an extra $50 million for EAS through FY2003 is available from the FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act. The FY2002 Act provides $3.3 billion for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), a 3% increase from FY2001. It does not include using $10 million of AIP for EAS but allocates $20 million for SCASD. The Act also includes a rescission of $301.7 million from previous year budget authority. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 107-38) provides $1.145 billion for FAA security purposes, with immediate and 15-day-wait allocations totaling $611.5 million. The FY2002 DOD appropriations act provides FAA with $533.5 million, including $434 million for increased airport security, $50 million for Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, and $87.5 million for security equipment. Additionally, $200 million is allocated for FAA operations. The FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act allocates funds for FAA operations, including $100 million for cockpit door modifications, $65 million for sky marshals, $20 million for security experts, and $15 million for training facilities. It also provides $108.5 million for explosive detection systems, $50 million for R,E,&D, and $175 million for AIP reimbursement to airports for security requirements post-9/11 attacks. Additionally, $50 million is added to the Office of the budget. The FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act allocates funds for FAA operations, including $100 million for cockpit door modifications, $65 million for sky marshals, $20 million for security experts, and $15 million for training facilities. It also provides $108.5 million for explosive detection systems, $50 million for R,E,&D, and $175 million for AIP reimbursement to airports for security requirements post-9/11 attacks. Additionally, $50 million is added to the Office of the Secretary of DOT for the Essential Air Service program, bringing the total supplemental appropriations for aviation purposes to $1.195 billion under P.L. 107-38. RSPA's budget for transportation safety programs in FY2002 includes $58.3 million for pipeline safety and $21.2 million for hazardous materials transportation safety. The FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act allocates funds for FAA operations, including $100 million for cockpit door modifications, $65 million for sky marshals, $20 million for security experts, and $15 million for training facilities. It also provides $108.5 million for explosive detection systems, $50 million for R,E,&D, and $175 million for AIP reimbursement to airports for security requirements post-9/11 attacks. Additionally, $50 million is added to the Office of the Secretary of DOT for the Essential Air Service program, bringing the total supplemental appropriations for aviation purposes to $1.195 billion under P.L. 107-38. RSPA's budget for transportation safety programs in FY2002 includes $58.3 million for pipeline safety and $21.2 million for hazardous materials transportation safety. The Bush Administration proposed increased user fees on industry to offset additional costs of both the pipeline and hazardous materials safety programs, but industry objections have been raised. The Senate Committee on Appropriations agreed to fund the hazmat safety program from user fees. The President requested $6 million for the DOT Crisis Management Center as authorized by P.L. 107-38. The FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act provides $2.5 million for the crisis management center. The Administration requested a total of $419 million for NHTSA in FY2002, a 4% increase from FY2001 funding. The FY2002 Act provides approximately $425 million for NHTSA. Operations and Research funding was requested at $196 million, a 2.6% increase from FY2001. The FY2002 Act provides $201.8 million for Operations and Research (O&R), with an additional $7.9 million allocated for the \"Safety Performance\" initiative. NHTSA is directed to notify Congress if deadlines specified in the TREAD Act are at risk of not being met, and to submit a strategic implementation plan with the fiscal year 2003 budget. The FY2002 Act provides $223 million for Highway Traffic Safety Grants, a 5% increase from FY2001. The funds are allocated for State and Community Highway Safety Grants, Alcohol-Impaired Driving Countermeasures Incentive Grants, Occupant Protection Incentive Grants, and State Highway Safety Data Grants. NHTSA's responsibilities include setting safety standards, providing information to drivers, studying safety issues, and promoting laws to reduce drunk driving and increase seatbelt use. The Bush Administration continues to prioritize transportation safety through NHTSA, targeting programs to reduce drunk driving, aggressive driving, enhance child safety, and explore safety options for the aging population. Last year, investigations into Firestone tire failures were conducted. The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation (TREAD) Act added new responsibilities to NHTSA, including dynamic rollover tests for vehicles and improving child restraint safety. The FMCSA, created by the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, enforces regulations for commercial truck and bus operations. The FMCSA governs interstate commercial truck and bus operations, administers grants, and enforces safety regulations. The FY2002 budget request was $343.8 million, with an increase of 28% from the previous year. The FY2002 Act provided $335.1 million for FMCSA activities, including funds for administrative expenses and state safety programs.
