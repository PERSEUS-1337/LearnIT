The text discusses the challenges of interpretability in deep learning models for toxicity prediction in cheminformatics. It emphasizes the need to identify key molecular substructures related to toxicity for improved compound design. The proposed approach integrates rationale identification into property prediction tasks, aiming to highlight the importance of specific atoms in the prediction process. The model formulates the problem of selecting important regions of the molecule as a reinforcement learning problem, using a convolutional network over a molecular graph. Our model integrates rationale identification into property prediction tasks by learning a reward function alongside the reinforcement learning algorithm. It works as a search mechanism for combinatorial sets and offers advantages over standard architectures. The model is tested on two toxicity datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying important molecular substructures. The reinforcement learning model identifies key structural components of molecules for toxicity prediction tasks, showing that selecting only 40-50% of atoms can match the performance of using the entire molecule. Deep learning is shifting chemical property prediction, with models based on expert-constructed molecular representations or deep learning approaches. The second class of models goes beyond traditional molecular fingerprints by using convolutional networks to learn a continuous representation of the molecule. This approach aims to improve local representations for better performance in tasks like toxicity prediction. Our focus is on augmenting molecular models with rationales, which is challenging due to the number of candidate substructures and attributing properties to individual atoms. Our work utilizes a reinforcement learning framework over graphs, where rewards are learned by the system. Another related work uses a policy gradient method to search for substructures in large graphs. The focus is on interpretability in molecular prediction models. Recent approaches include visualizing network activations and identifying influential data examples for interpretability. Our model focuses on interpretability in molecular prediction models by making sequential selections of atoms in the molecule using two networks, the Q-Network and the P-Network. This approach allows for a meaningful ordinal ranking over the atom selections, differentiating it from other models that extract parts of text as rationale. Our approach uses reinforcement learning to select important atoms from the graph, similar to BID5. The agent selects atoms sequentially, with a separate P-Network generating rewards based on molecular properties like toxicity. The agent learns a Q-Network to represent the action-value function needed for decision-making. The agent uses a Q-Network to guide its actions and a P-Network to predict molecular properties based on selected atoms. Both networks are trained iteratively to improve selections and predictions. The networks are parametrized by a graph convolutional network for updating atom representations based on local contexts. The text discusses the use of convolutional networks to update atom representations in a molecular graph. It explains how atom representations are iteratively updated based on local contexts, allowing the network to generalize beyond standard substructures. The text explains the iterative update of atom representations in a molecular graph using convolutional networks. Atom features are initialized with input vectors for atoms and bonds, incorporating the current state of selections. Gated units receive contributions from atoms and neighbors, with weight matrices varying across layers. After N iterations, final atom representations are obtained. The Q-Network uses a convolutional network to update atom representations in a molecular graph. The final atom representations are scalar Q-values for selecting atoms. The model considers global context and already selected atoms when making greedy selections. The P-Network is a prediction network. The P-Network is a prediction network that takes the partial selection of atoms from the Q-Network and predicts the label of the molecule using only those selected atoms. It incorporates the selected atoms by zeroing out initial atom features not in the current selection before running the convolutional model, allowing interaction between disjoint selections on the molecular graph to preserve information related to graph distances and learn important interactions. The P-Network predicts molecular properties by aggregating atom vectors through renormalization and a neural fingerprint generation process. The class prediction is made using a sigmoid function, and the prediction loss is measured through cross-entropy. The reward for the Q-network is induced by the P-network, with parameters \u03b8 and binary state vector updates based on actions taken. The Q-network is trained using an n-step Q-learning algorithm, with a loss function that includes a decay constant \u03b3 and Q-values for current and target states. An \u03b5-greedy search policy is used during training to select random atoms. This approach focuses on selecting important molecular substructures. In the context of molecular substructures, a model is proposed that selects a random neighbor of a chosen atom for stability. Limits are set on the number of atoms selected, with a range of 40-50% for larger molecules and a minimum of 5 atoms for smaller ones. Regularization constraints are imposed to enforce model accuracy. The model imposes regularization constraints to enforce specific properties on selections of substructures from molecules. A penalty is applied for selecting too many disjoint groups. The model is evaluated on two toxicity datasets, including the Tox21 challenge dataset with 12 toxicity tests categorized by nuclear and stress response pathways. Conflicting labels are removed from the dataset, and data is cleaned using RDKit. The second toxicity dataset evaluated is the inhibition of the hERG channel, with a training set of 3792 molecules and a test set of 1090 molecules. The model is compared against top reported systems for predictions. BID26 utilizes a data augmentation method called KSPA, which uses public databases for similar toxicity tests. The predictive performance of the convolutional model (Mol-CNN) is comparable to state-of-the-art results. The RL-CNN model makes predictions on a fraction of atoms in the molecule and its performance is evaluated using the AUC metric. The RL-CNN model indirectly measures the quality of selected atoms as rationales. The quality of rationales extracted for the hERG dataset is compared with those described in the chemical literature. Adding features representing common toxic substructures does not improve model performance, indicating that expert-derived important regions are not necessary for prediction tasks. Studies have shown that certain structural features have a high affinity for binding to hERG. The high affinity of a nitrogen atom and hydrophobic cores for binding to protein BID2 BID30 is due to cation-pi interactions with hERG channel residues. A model can identify basic nitrogen atoms within the dataset using Morgan fingerprints. The importance of atoms in molecular fingerprints can be approximated by the difference in predictions with and without them. Rationales are restricted to the same number of atoms as in the RL-CNN model. A synthetic experiment is conducted to evaluate rationales, focusing on toxic substructures like the aromatic diazo group and polyhalogenation. BID13's work focuses on toxicophores common to multiple toxicity assays. Their convolutional model competes well with neural models using molecular fingerprints, but DeepTox BID26 outperforms it by 2.3% on average across twelve tasks due to additional training data. However, BID13's model outperforms BID22 on the hERG dataset. The text discusses the evaluation of different models on the hERG dataset using AUC as the metric. Various baseline models from BID22 are compared, including random forest, support vector machine, k nearest neighbors, and associative neural networks. Individual models are run for each toxicity test using base convolution and reinforcement learning models, showing a slight decrease in performance. The evaluation of different models on the hERG dataset shows a slight decrease in performance, with a 0.7% decrease in AUC on average using around 50% of the atoms in the dataset. The reinforcement learning algorithm performs similarly to the convolution network, with a 3.4% decrease in AUC when selecting 45% of the atoms. The Tox21 datasets show a smaller decrease in performance, likely due to fewer positive examples, allowing the model to generalize better. Evaluation of Rationales using Human Rationales focuses on a specific structural motif - a tertiary nitrogen atom - known to exhibit cation-pi interactions with residues of the hERG protein. The dataset used shows a higher occurrence of a specific tertiary nitrogen substructure in positive examples compared to negative examples. This substructure is important but not sufficient to indicate positivity. The model frequently captures this substructure, especially in positive examples, requiring the selection of the nitrogen and at least two of its three carbon neighbors. Two examples of rationales selected by the reinforcement learning model highlight the tertiary nitrogen motif implicated in hERG channel inhibitors. The model can reliably identify target substructures related to toxicity, such as aromatic diazo and polyhalogenation motifs. The baseline approach, however, matches fewer instances of these motifs but identifies more aromatic nitro groups. The RL-CNN model successfully selects aromatic nitro groups by simplifying initial atom featurization to decrease correlation between adjacent atoms. Example rationales generated for different toxicophores confirm the model's accuracy in identifying target substructures related to toxicity. Our rationale model, using reinforcement learning, excels in selecting relevant features in molecules, outperforming fingerprint models. Through experiments on Tox21 and hERG datasets, we show that our model effectively identifies important substructures in an unsupervised manner, with no loss in predictive performance. Deep learning algorithms are increasingly used in chemistry for tasks like drug design. Interpreting these models will be crucial as molecules are complex to analyze compared to images or text."
