    "content": "The President signed H.R. 4818, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) on December 8, 2004. Congress approved the conference committee report on H.R. 4818 (H.Rept. 108-792) on November 20, 2004. This bill included appropriations for the Department of Transportation, the Department of the Treasury, and other agencies. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 consolidated appropriations for various government departments into a single bill due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. This resulted in the transfer of agencies like the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and others to DHS from the Department of Transportation and Treasury. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation was passed as part of the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-199), which included a 0.59% across-the-board rescission. The Administration's FY2005 budget request for the Departments of Transportation and the Treasury was $88.9 billion, $1.6 billion below the final FY2004-enacted figure. In FY2004-FY2005, the House Committee on Appropriations provided budget tables showing adjustments and cuts in funding for various titles. The FY2004 bill included a 0.59% rescission, while the FY2005 bill had a 0.80% rescission. The House cut $47 billion from Title I (Transportation) funding, with assurances of restoration in conference. The Postal Service was moved to the \"Independent Agencies\" Title in FY2005 following Senate practice. The FY2005 budget request was submitted to Congress after the FY2004 appropriation process. The House Committee recommended $89.9 billion in funding for transportation, treasury, and independent agencies. The House later cut $47 billion in transportation funding due to lack of authorizing legislation for FY2005 programs. Surface transportation programs had no authorizing legislation for FY2005, leading to the elimination of appropriations for highway and transit programs, as well as Airport Improvement Program grants. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $90.5 billion in their FY2005 Transportation, Treasury, and General Government Appropriations bill, which was never taken up by the full Senate. Continuing resolutions were passed to fund the government as negotiations on appropriations bills continued. The House and Senate passed an omnibus bill (H.R. 4818) on November 20, 2004, but controversy arose over a provision giving access to tax returns. The Senate objected, a resolution was approved to remove the provision, and the bill was signed into law on December 8, 2004, providing $90.6 billion. The omnibus bill (H.R. 4818) was signed into law on December 8, 2004, providing $90.6 billion for the Departments of Transportation and the Treasury. A 0.80% across-the-board rescission reduces the appropriation to approximately $89.9 billion, still above the Administration request for FY2005. Funding trends for Transportation/Treasury Appropriations from FY1999 through FY2004 are shown in Table 3. The Committee on Appropriations provided Comparative Statement of Budget Authority tables for fiscal years 1999 through 2004, adjusting figures for Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury appropriations for comparison. Adjustments included subtracting specific agencies and adding others for accurate comparison. The FY2001-2005 budget figures for the Department of Transportation reflect across-the-board rescissions. The FY2005 budget proposed a DOT budget of $58.4 billion, in line with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. The budget request included changes to the highway and transit funding structure. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $58.9 billion for DOT for FY2005, $559 million above FY2004 and $457 million above the Administration request. The major change from the Administration request was additional funding for federal highways and the Essential Air Service program. Appropriators also struck funding for transportation programs not authorized for FY2005, totaling approximately $47 billion of the $58.9 billion budget. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $59.5 billion for DOT for FY2005, with additional funding for federal highways, transit, and Amtrak. House and Senate conferees agreed on $58.9 billion for DOT for FY2005, $559 million above FY2004 and $485 million above the Administration request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $59.5 billion for DOT for FY2005, with additional funding for federal highways, transit, and Amtrak. House and Senate conferees agreed on $58.9 billion for DOT for FY2005, $559 million above FY2004 and $485 million above the Administration request. The major changes included an additional $442 million for transit, $316 million for highways, $317 million for Amtrak, and a $322 million cut in Federal Aviation Administration funding for air safety inspectors and air traffic controllers. The transportation appropriations subcommittee chairman assured Members that cuts made to transportation programs would be restored in conference. The figures recommended by the Committee on Appropriations reflect a 0.59% across-the-board rescission. Additional funding for the Essential Air Service program brings the total FY2004 and FY2005 funding to $102 million. Congress postponed Amtrak's repayment of a $100 million loan from the DOT and required a 20% repayment in FY2005. The total resources for RSPA for FY2004 may be seen as $126 million. The total resources for RSPA for FY2004 are $126 million and for FY2005 are $131 million. The FAA received $13.83 billion in the FY2005 Conference Report, slightly less than the Bush Administration's request of $13.96 billion. The appropriations bill for FY2005 is close to the FY2004 funding level of $13.88 billion, with some program adjustments and a shift of $393 million from the F&E program to the O&M program. The House proposed total FAA funding of $14.3 billion, with a rescission of $758 million. The bill included a General Fund contribution to O&M programs of $1.7 billion, later amended to $2.7 billion during floor debate. The Senate proposed a funding level of $13.9 billion, with no major programmatic changes. The bill proposed no major programmatic changes or initiatives, accepting the Administration's recommendation to reduce F&E funding and increase O&M funding. The General Fund contribution to O&M was set at slightly more than $2.5 billion, with a historical funding split between trust fund and Treasury general fund monies. The FY2005 bill reduced the general fund contribution to $2.8 billion, aligning more with historical levels. This funding split has been a significant part of the annual FAA budget debate. The annual FAA budget debate historically includes a funding split between trust fund and Treasury general fund monies for Operations and Maintenance (O&M). The FY2005 proposed budget saw an increase in total spending to $7.8 billion, with a majority allocated to FAA personnel salaries for air traffic control and safety activities. The House, Senate, and Conference bills differed slightly in their proposed funding levels for O&M. Hiring practices are a key focus in this year's appropriations bills. The appropriations bills for the FAA budget include provisions for hiring additional air traffic controllers due to concerns about upcoming retirements. The House bill allocates $9 million for new controllers and $4 million for supervisors, while the Senate bill provides an additional $10 million for new hires. The Conference report includes measures to address staffing shortages. Additionally, the Administration's request for Facilities and Equipment funding was $2.5 billion, $393 million lower than the FY2004 figure. The Bush Administration requested $2.5 billion for Facilities and Equipment (F&E) funding, which is used for air traffic control and safety investments. The proposal would provide less for safety and capacity technology compared to FY2004. Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) funding would see a small cut to $117 million. No significant new initiatives were proposed in the FAA budget. Both the House and Senate bills adopted the Administration's requested F&E funding level. The Senate bill increases overall funding for RE&D to $129.4 million, while the Conference bill provides $129.9 million. The Essential Air Service program receives funding from user fees collected from foreign aircraft overflights and has had an annual authorized funding level of $50 million. The FY2004 Act provided $102 million for EAS. The Essential Air Service program received $102 million in funding from the FY2004 Act, with $50 million from its regular authorization and an additional $52 million from the aviation trust fund. The FY2005 proposal aimed to reduce the program's size and require a local contribution, but the House Committee on Appropriations rejected this, providing $101.7 million instead. The House bill for FY2005 provided $36 million from other funds to the FAA, maintaining funding levels from the previous year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations rejected the Administration's funding request and allowed $102 million for the Essential Air Service program, with $52 million as a direct appropriation and $50 million from overflight fees. The Conference bill accepted the Senate's funding arrangement and prevented the Administration from implementing the local participation program. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act accepts the Senate funding arrangement for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), providing $3.5 billion in grants for airport development. The Act also includes a rescission of $265 million of F&E contract authority from FY2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $3.5 billion in grants for airport development, with a rescission of $265 million from FY2004 F&E contract authority. The Act also includes funding for administration, prohibits using AIP funds for certain improvements, and sets aside money for the Small Community Air Service Pilot program. The conference report names 140 airports for funding and allows state AIP apportionment funds to be used as discretionary funds for earmarks. The Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) includes various highway programs such as National Highway System (NHS), Interstate Maintenance (IM), Surface Transportation Program (STP), Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation (BRR), and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ). Funding for these programs is apportioned annually by formula. There is also an \"exempt\" category with additional minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief funds that are not subject to annual obligation limitations. The \"allocated\" programs under FHWA's control include the Federal Lands Highway Program, High Priority Projects, Appalachian Development Highway System roads, National Corridor Planning, and Border Infrastructure Program. Discretionary program funding has been mostly earmarked by Congress in recent years. The President's FY2005 budget assumed that the authorization would align with the surface transportation reauthorization recommendations. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act retained the TEA21 program structure due to surfacetransportation programs not being reauthorized. The President requested $34.18 billion for FHWA, a decrease from the previous year. The Act provided $34.86 billion for FHWA, $316 million above the FY2004 level. The obligation limitation was set at $34.64 billion. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $34.86 billion for FHWA, with an obligation limitation of $34.64 billion. Exempt obligations were set at $835 million, with an additional $80 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System and $741 million for the Emergency Relief program. The Act also rescinded $1.35 billion in unobligated contract authority and $100 million from TIFIA funds. Section 117 of the Act set aside a 4.1% administrative take-down for various programs. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated funds for FHWA, including $25 million for the Delta Regional Authority and $1.21 billion for 795 projects. Section 117 earmarked funds for FHWA discretionary programs and established the FMCSA to enforce regulations for commercial truck safety. The FMCSA enforces regulations for commercial truck and bus operations, conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled drivers and vehicles entering the US, and administers grants for safety compliance activities. Funding for FMCSA activities comes from the Federal Highway Trust Fund, with a FY2005 budget request of $455 million. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $438.5 million, but this was eliminated during floor debate. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $450 million as the benchmark for FMCSA funding during conference discussions. The FMCSA appropriation includes administrative expenses and financial assistance for state safety programs. Congress approved $447.5 million for FMCSA in FY2005, with $257.5 million for administrative expenses and $190 million for safety grants. The President's budget request for administrative expenses was $228 million, but the House recommended $248.5 million, which was eliminated during floor debate. The House floor debate focused on the recommended figure of $257.5 million for administrative expenses for the FMCSA in FY2005. This funding covers various activities such as research, regulatory development, enforcement, and outreach efforts to educate the commercial motor vehicle industry on safety regulations. It also supports personnel compensation, benefits, and other related expenses for over 1,000 employees. The FY2005 funding for the commercial motor vehicle industry focuses on federal safety regulations, improving truck and bus standards, and oversight. The requested amount was $227 million, but the House Committee recommended $190 million, which was approved in the conference report. These funds primarily support the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) grants to states for enforcing safety regulations. The MCSAP grants cover up to 80% of state truck and bus safety program costs, with $169 million allocated in FY2005. NHTSA funding supports behavioral and vehicle safety programs to reduce impaired driving, improve occupant protection, enhance emergency medical responses, ensure compliance with federal safety regulations, and address emerging vehicle safety issues. For FY2005, NHTSA requested $689.3 million to carry out its mission, with $456 million designated for general traffic safety and incentive grants to states. The remaining $233 million was allocated for NHTSA's operations and research activities aimed at reducing highway fatalities and preventing injuries from traffic crashes through research, highway safety programs, and safety assurance measures. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $225 million for traffic safety grants and $223.1 million for NHTSA's operations and research, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $225 million for traffic safety grants and $228.3 million for operations and research. The conference report for FY2005 provides $225 million for traffic safety grants and $233 million for operations and research. The Administration requested funding for NHTSA's mission. The Administration requested $1.09 billion for the Federal Railroad Administration, which was $357 million less than the previous year's funding. The House Committee recommended the same amount, but it was eliminated during House floor debate. The Senate Committee recommended $1.44 billion, and conferees agreed on this amount. Most of the funding for FRA goes to Amtrak, with the difference between House and Senate amounts mainly for additional Amtrak funding. The FRA budget debate focuses on Amtrak, safety activities, Next Generation High-Speed Rail program, and state funding for high-speed rail. The FRA promotes and regulates railroad safety to address increased traffic volume and density vulnerabilities. Funding for safety programs in FY2005 was recommended at $139.8 million by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The FRA's budget request supports goals of reducing rail accidents, grade-crossing accidents, and hazardous material incidents. The safety program continues using existing authorities and annual appropriations. Deliberations on funding and regulatory activities have not resulted in agreement since 1994. A reauthorization statute could impact budgets after FY2005. The Administration's requested budget for the Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D program for FY2005 was significantly lower than the previous year's appropriation. Key areas affected by the budget cuts included high-speed train control systems, non-electric locomotive development, grade crossing hazard mitigation, corridor planning, and maglev technology. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $11 million for high-speed rail projects, including grade crossing hazard mitigation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $20 million for corridor planning, maglev projects, and train control systems. Conferees agreed on $19.7 million for Amtrak funding, with requirements for a five-year business plan submission. Amtrak submitted a five-year business plan to Congress in 2003, requesting $1.6 billion annually for maintenance and backlog needs. The Administration proposed $900 million for FY2005, less than requested. House and Senate Committees recommended different funding amounts for Amtrak. Amtrak received $1.2 billion for FY2005, with conferees directing repayment of a $100 million loan in five annual installments. Amtrak must develop an operating and capital plan to receive funding, and the Secretary of Transportation will value Amtrak's assets and determine costs for each route. Amtrak's funding for FY2005 includes repayment of a $100 million loan in installments. A methodology is established to determine costs of each route, with budget requests now submitted through the DOT. Competitive bidding for non-Amtrak operators on state-supported routes is encouraged. If a state contracts with a non-Amtrak operator, they may use Amtrak's equipment and services. The Secretary of Transportation has the power to compel Amtrak to provide equipment and services. Funding for Amtrak in FY2004 was $900 million, with the House agreeing to this amount. The Senate agreed to $1.346 billion and extended the requirement for individual grant requests for long-distance routes. Conferees settled on $1.225 billion for Amtrak in FY2004. President Bush's FY2005 budget request for FTA was $7.27 billion, similar to FY2004 appropriation. The Administration proposed changes to FTA's program structure, including grouping funding into three categories and creating a New Freedom Initiative program. Congress did not support these changes for FY2005, with the House Committee on Appropriations recommending $7.25 billion. During the FY2005 appropriations bill debate, FTA's funding was eliminated on a point of order. The Senate Committee recommended $7.76 billion, but conferees agreed on $7.7 billion. The largest transit programs include Capital Investment Grants and Loans Program and Urbanized Area Formula Grants Program. The Capital Investment Grants and Loans Program has three components: new transit starts, fixed guideway modernization, and bus and bus facilities, with funds allocated on a 40-40-20 basis. The FY2005 appropriations bill allocated funds for the Capital Investment Grants and Loans Program, with three components: new transit starts, fixed guideway modernization, and bus and bus facilities. The Administration requested increased funding for new transit starts and fixed guideway modernization. The House Committee recommended decreased funding for the new transit starts program but maintained funding for fixed guideway modernization and bus and bus facilities. The FY2005 appropriations bill allocated funds for the Capital Investment Grants and Loans Program, including new transit starts, fixed guideway modernization, and bus and bus facilities. The Senate Committee recommended increased funding for new transit starts, fixed guideway modernization, and bus and bus facilities compared to FY2004. Conferees agreed on funding levels for the new starts program, fixed guideway modernization, and bus and bus facilities, with slight variations from the Senate Committee's recommendations. The Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) provides capital and operating funds for urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more. Eligible activities include bus purchases, maintenance facilities, and operating assistance. Funding is apportioned based on population and transit service data. For FY2005, the proposed budget was $3.444 billion, with the final allocation set at $3.6 billion. The Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) provides capital and operating funds for urbanized areas with populations over 50,000. Operating assistance funding was eliminated for areas with populations over 200,000 with the enactment of TEA-21. Preventive maintenance is now eligible for funding as a capital expense. Non-urbanized areas (Section 5311) can use formula funds for capital or operating purposes. Other transit programs include the Non-Urbanized Areas Formula Program (Section 5311) with $253 million allocated for FY2005, and Grants for Elderly and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310) with $89 million requested for FY2005. The House and Senate Committees recommended $95 million for the FY2005 budget, with $169 million requested for Planning and Research programs. The Rural Transportation Accessibility Incentive Program requested $7 million for FY2005. The President's budget proposed the New Freedom Initiative with a $148 million request, which Congress did not support. The FY2005 budget requested $148 million for the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program, which provides funding for transportation projects to help welfare recipients and low-income individuals get to work in suburban areas. The House Committee recommended $150 million, the Senate Committee recommended $125 million, and conferees agreed on $125 million for the program. Funding for FY2005 was eliminated during House floor debate. The FY2005 funding for transportation projects was eliminated during House floor debate, but it was expected to be restored in conference. The FY2004 appropriation was supplemented with $70 million, while the FY2005 appropriation was supplemented with $50 million from other FTA programs. MARAD's mission is to promote the development of a U.S. merchant marine for domestic and foreign commerce, as well as to serve as a naval and military auxiliary in times of war. MARAD administers programs benefiting U.S. vessel owners, shipyards, and crews. The President requested $234.4 million for MARAD in FY2005, with Congress providing $305 million. The budget discussion focuses on the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, which promotes shipyard growth and modernization. The Administration requested no funds for this program in prior years. The Administration has requested no funds for additional loans in FY2005, calling the program a \"corporate subsidy.\" However, $4.8 million was requested for the administration of existing loans, which Congress agreed to. In FY2004, no funds were provided for additional loans, but $4.5 million was provided for the administration of existing loans. The DOT Inspector General issued a report in March 2003 on the Title XI program, calling for more effective review of loan applications and rigorous financial oversight of borrowers. This was prompted by the bankruptcy of American Classic Voyages, leaving MARAD with $367 million in bad loans. In July 2004, the DOT announced the creation of a Credit Council to enhance oversight of loan programs. Congress provided $109.5 million for operations and training in FY2005. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed MARAD to prepare a report on the nation's inland waterway system for anticipated trade increase. The Administration requested $98.7 million for the Maritime Security Program (MSP), which is a fleet of 47 U.S. flag commercial vessels available to support the Department of Defense in a national emergency. Congress provided $21.6 million for the disposal of obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF), with over 130 vessels awaiting disposal due to environmental concerns. MARAD has until 2006 to dispose of these surplus ships. MARAD has until 2006 to dispose of surplus ships located in Virginia and California. Congress provided $75 million for a financial assistance program to construct up to five privately owned product tanker vessels under the Maritime Security Act of 2003. The program aims to decrease the Department of Defense's reliance on foreign-flag oil tankers by providing up to $50 million per vessel for construction in U.S. shipyards. The Maritime Security Act of 2003 aims to reduce the Department of Defense's dependence on foreign oil tankers by allowing up to 10% of a vessel's steel weight to be built by foreign shipyards. The program received $75 million in funding after a conference agreement, with the Senate initially proposing $150 million and the House providing no funds. The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) oversees various entities related to transportation safety and research. The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) manages DOT's transportation-related emergency response and recovery responsibilities. The Administration requested a budget of $123.25 million for RSPA in FY2005, with most funding allocated to activities promoting transportation safety. The House Committee recommended $115.3 million for RSPA, while the Senate Committee recommended $120.3 million. The conference report provides $117 million for RSPA. The conference report provides $117 million for FY2005, including $25.2 million for hazmat transportation safety and $69.8 million for pipeline safety within the Department of the Treasury Appropriations. Treasury Department functions include economic formulation and implementation. The Department of the Treasury performs functions such as formulating economic policies, serving as the financial agent for the government, enforcing financial and tax laws, and producing currency and stamps. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 changed Treasury's role in law enforcement. The department consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus. The Department of the Treasury consists of departmental offices responsible for policy formulation and implementation, and operating bureaus carrying out specific tasks. The bureaus, except for one, can be categorized into financial responsibilities and law enforcement. Financial responsibilities are managed by various agencies, while law enforcement is handled by agencies like BATF, U.S. Secret Service, and U.S. Customs Service. The Department of the Treasury includes various agencies responsible for financial and law enforcement tasks. The creation of DHS led to the transfer of agencies like the Secret Service and Customs Service from Treasury to DHS. Additionally, the Treasury Department established the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to handle alcohol and tobacco regulations previously managed by BATF. The Treasury Department established the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (BATF) to collect excise taxes, classify products, and regulate industrial users of distilled spirits. Treasury also created the Executive Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (EOTF) to combat terrorist financing and financial crimes, implement key provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act, and represent the US in international efforts against terrorist financing. The Treasury Department established the Executive Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (EOTF) to combat terrorist financing and financial crimes. However, in March 2004, the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (OTFI) was announced to oversee and coordinate the department's efforts in combating terrorist financing and financial crimes. OTFI is responsible for analyzing financial intelligence and providing policy guidance. In FY2004, the Treasury Department received $11.100 billion in appropriated funds, with most of the funds allocated to the IRS. The remaining funds were distributed among various departmental offices and bureaus for different programs and services. In FY2004, the Treasury Department received $11.100 billion in appropriated funds, with the majority going to the IRS. For FY2005, the Bush Administration requested a budget of $11.610 billion for Treasury, with the IRS receiving $10.674 billion. Other departmental offices and bureaus would receive allocated amounts as well. The FY2005 budget request for the Treasury Department included funding for various programs such as the Air Transportation Stabilization program, Treasury Building and Annex Repair and Restoration, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Financial Management Service, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and Bureau of the Public Debt. The budget aimed to make permanent tax relief measures, improve tax law compliance, modernize IRS systems, monitor terrorist financing, and safeguard integrity. The House Appropriations Subcommittee approved a bill to fund Treasury operations in FY2005, with a focus on improving tax compliance and thwarting terrorist financing. The full Appropriations Committee later passed the bill, with a stern rebuke issued in the report. The Appropriations Committee rebuked the Treasury Department for creating a new office for combating terrorist financing without proper information or budget approval. The House passed H.R. 5025, providing $11.247 billion in funding for Treasury in FY2005, with the IRS receiving the majority of the funds. The budget was higher than FY2004 but lower than the Administration's request for FY2005. The House passed H.R. 5025, providing $11.247 billion in funding for Treasury in FY2005. The budget for IRS in FY2004 was $382.5 million below the Administration's request for FY2005. H.R. 5025 also allocated $177.0 million for Treasury's departmental offices, with specific amounts designated for various programs. The House passed H.R. 5025, providing $11.247 billion in funding for Treasury in FY2005. Specific allocations included $2.0 million for the Air Transportation Stabilization Program, $20.3 million for building and annex repair, $90.0 million for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, $230.9 million for the Financial Management Service, $82.5 million for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and $175.2 million for the Bureau of the Public Debt. H.R. 5025 provided $11.247 billion in funding for Treasury in FY2005. During the House debate, contentious amendments were considered, including one to prohibit the Treasury Department from allowing financial institutions to accept matricula consular cards as valid identification. Another approved amendment specified that funds for FY2005 could not be used for contracts to collect delinquent debts. The House approved amendments to prevent funds for FY2005 from being used for contracts to collect delinquent tax debt and to prohibit Treasury from overturning a court decision on cash-balance pension plans. The Senate also approved an appropriations measure for Treasury operations in FY2005. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved an appropriations measure (S. 2806) for Treasury's FY2005 budget, setting it at $11.329 billion, with the majority going to the IRS. The full Senate never voted on the bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved an appropriations measure for Treasury's FY2005 budget, allocating funds for various programs including the Office of the Inspector General, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Air Transportation Stabilization Program, and FinCen. The budget also includes funds for the Financial Management Service and Treasury's Building and Annex Repair and Restoration Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funds for various Treasury programs in the FY2005 budget, including allocations for the Financial Management Service, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and Bureau of the Public Debt. S. 2806 also established a separate appropriation account for OFAC with $22.3 million for its operations in FY2005. The bill supported the Administration's request to eliminate certain programs and endorsed the creation of OTFI with recommended funding of $12.7 million in FY2005. The House and Senate agreed on a budget for the Treasury Department in FY2005, included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005. President Bush signed the measure into law on December 8th, which incorporated a 0.83% across-the-board cut in spending unrelated to national defense and homeland security. A controversial provision added to H.R. 4818 late in the conference negotiations would allow certain members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees access to IRS facilities and tax return information without explicit criminal penalties for privacy violations. The Senate and House passed an enrolling resolution to delete a controversial provision in H.R. 4818. Treasury is set to receive $11.248 billion in funds for FY2005, with the majority of the increase going to the IRS. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, FinCen, Financial Management Service, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and Bureau of the Public Debt are receiving increased funding in FY2005. However, three Treasury accounts are receiving less money compared to FY2004. H.R.4818 creates a separate appropriations account for OFAC with a budget of $22.3 million in FY2005. The bill appropriates $22.3 million for OFAC in FY2005, with funds designated for 138 full-time staff positions. Additionally, $157.6 million is allocated for Treasury departmental offices in FY2005, while programs aimed at expanding financial services for low-income households and reducing violent crime are eliminated. The IRS administers various taxes and fees, processes tax returns, payments, and refunds, enforces compliance, and collects delinquent taxes. The IRS enforces compliance through audits, collects delinquent taxes, and provides services to taxpayers. In FY2003, $1.969 billion was collected, with individual income tax revenue of $987 billion. In FY2004, $10.184 billion in funds were received, allocated for various purposes including tax law enforcement and information systems management. The IRS requested $10.674 billion in funding for FY2005, with allocations for processing, tax law enforcement, information systems management, and business systems modernization. Funds for low-income taxpayer clinics were set aside, and approval from House and Senate Appropriations Committees was required for spending. Additionally, the IRS was prohibited from using funds to lift a moratorium on pension plan conversions imposed in 1999. The IRS requested $10.674 billion in funding for FY2005, including allocations for processing, tax law enforcement, information systems management, and business systems modernization. The budget proposal aimed to improve taxpayer service, enforce tax laws, and enhance the IRS's information infrastructure. Calls for increased funding for tax law enforcement were prompted by disclosures of illegal tax shelters and decreased audit rates for high-income taxpayers and large corporations. The IRS Oversight Board recommended a budget of $11.204 billion for the IRS in FY2005, which was 10% higher than the previous year's budget.

The Human Capital Performance Fund had a FY2004 appropriation of $1 million, reduced to $994,000 after a rescission. It aims to create performance-driven pay systems for employees and provide additional pay based on performance. The House recommended $12.5 million for the fund, $287.5 million less than the President's request. OPM will distribute 90% of funds to agencies based on approved plans, with the remainder allocated at OPM's discretion. The OPM Director can transfer necessary amounts to federal agencies for the performance fund, pending approval from relevant subcommittees. The Senate Committee did not recommend funding for the fund, suggesting it be managed within individual agency budgets. The Office of Special Counsel investigates federal employee allegations. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) investigates federal employee allegations of prohibited personnel practices, enforces the Hatch Act, and provides a channel for whistleblowing. The President's FY2005 budget proposed $15.449 million for the OSC, a 15.1% increase from FY2004 funding after a rescission. The funding increase is intended to hire additional staff to increase the case closure rate and prevent case backlogs. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended funding for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to address case backlogs. The FY2005 funding is $15.325 million after a 0.80% rescission, slightly lower than the President's request. OSC is urged to hire new staff to reduce the backlog, with a report due by March 31, 2005 on the impact of new personnel on case closure rates. The Office of Special Counsel's case backlog has improved due to the addition of new personnel. The FY2005 funding for OSC is $15.325 million after a 0.80% rescission, slightly lower than the President's request. The agency is encouraged to hire more staff to reduce the backlog, with a report on the impact of new personnel on case closure rates due by March 31, 2005. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) oversees federal campaign finance law and has a budget of $52.2 million for FY2005, with an increase of $919,000 from the previous year. The agency has 391 full-time employees and $4.7 million designated for automated data processing systems. The House and Senate Committees recommended the $52.2 million budget for the Federal Election Commission. The House added a requirement for electronic reporting, while the Senate added provisions for excess campaign funds and contribution limits. The Omnibus Appropriations measure authorized $52.2 million for the FEC and included legislative provisions recommended by the Senate Committee. The FLRA serves as a neutral party in settling disputes between unions, employees, and federal agencies, adjudicating labor-management disputes, investigating unfair labor practices, and facilitating labor-management relationships. The FLRA, responsible for investigating unfair labor practices and resolving labor disputes, had a proposed budget of $29.7 million for FY2005. Despite the President's request for this amount, the Senate approved an appropriation of $25.7 million, including a $4 million reduction and a $3 million rescission from prior unobligated funds. The FY2005 funding for the FLRA is $25.5 million after a 0.80% rescission, reflecting a reduction from the President's request. The committee report attributes the decrease to a decline in caseload and FTE levels. A $3 million rescission is recommended for salaries and expenses due to lapsed appropriations reflecting surplus benefits. The General Services Administration oversees federal procurement policies and property management. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 allocated funds for government-wide policy, operating expenses, the Office of Inspector General, allowances for former Presidents, and the electronic government fund. No funds were needed for a presidential transition in FY2005. Resources for activities associated with the President's second term were to be funded by agencies and departments as necessary. S. 2806 recommended an appropriation of $62.1 million for government-wide. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended appropriations for government-wide policy, operating expenses, the Office of Inspector General, allowances for former Presidents, and the electronic government fund. They also allocated funds for expenses related to a presidential transition and denied a request to amend the Presidential Transition Act for training and briefings for incoming appointees. The House recommended appropriations totaling $62.1 million for government-wide policy, $82.2 million for operating expenses, $42.4 million for the Office of Inspector General, $3.5 million for allowances and office staff for former Presidents, and $5.0 million for the electronic government fund. Additionally, $7.7 million was allocated for expenses related to a presidential transition, with $1.0 million designated for training and briefings of incoming appointees. The remaining $6.7 million would be returned to the general fund of the Treasury. The House recommended appropriations totaling $62.1 million for government-wide policy, $82.2 million for operating expenses, $42.4 million for the Office of Inspector General, $3.5 million for allowances and office staff for former Presidents, $45.0 million for interagency electronic government initiatives, and $17.6 million for the Federal Consumer Information Center Fund. In the event of a presidential transition, $7.7 million was requested for an orderly transfer of executive leadership, with $1.0 million allocated for briefing new personnel. Additionally, there is a proposed amendment to the Presidential Transition Act to allow for briefings for incoming appointees associated with the second term of an incumbent President. The House recommended appropriations for various government-wide expenses, including $3.5 million for allowances and office staff for former Presidents. In the event of a presidential transition, $7.7 million was allocated for an orderly transfer of executive leadership. If there is no transition, remaining funds would be returned to the Treasury. The appropriations for the Federal Buildings Fund in FY2005 include $708.5 million for new construction projects, $980.2 million for repairs and alterations, $161.4 million for installment acquisition payments, $3.7 billion for rental of space, and $1.7 billion for building operations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $710.9 million for the Fund. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $710.9 million for new construction projects and $980.2 million for repairs and alterations from the Federal Buildings Fund, totaling $7.2 billion. Additional funds were allocated for special services like fencing and lighting for the U.S. Secret Service. The House passed H.R. 5025 directing $522.3 million for building operations. H.R. 5025 directs $522.3 million for new construction projects and $931.2 million for repairs and alterations from the Federal Buildings Fund. It also includes funding for special services like a glass fragmentation program and chlorofluorocarbons program. Additionally, funds are allocated for installment acquisition payments, rental of space, and building operations. The President's FY2005 budget requested $650.2 million for new construction projects and $980.2 million for repairs and alterations from the Federal Buildings Fund. This included funding for courthouses, glass fragmentation program, chlorofluorocarbons program, and facilities for the United States Secret Service. Additionally, $3 million was allocated to the Electronic Government Fund. The consolidated appropriations legislation approved by Congress allocated $3 million to the Electronic Government Fund for FY2005, $2 million less than the President's request. The Senate approved the $3 million allocation recommended by its Committee on Appropriations, while the President had requested $5 million. Additional funding of $40 million was proposed from surplus revenues, totaling $45 million requested for FY2004. The General Supply Fund received $5 million in appropriations for FY2004 and finances activities within the Federal Supply Service and Federal Technology Service of GSA. The FSS offers commercial services and products through over 10,000 contractors, with a business volume of $33.8 billion in FY2003. The Electronic Government Fund's funding has been a point of contention between the President and Congress, with the President proposing $5 million for FY2005 but receiving $3 million from Congress. The Blueprint proposed establishing an electronic government account with $10 million in 2002, growing to $100 million over three years to support interagency e-gov initiatives. Managed by OMB, the fund would support projects across agency boundaries, implement digital signatures, and comply with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998. The Administration doubled the allocation to the e-gov fund to $20 million, established within the General Services Administration to support interagency projects for electronic activities. Congress appropriated $5 million for FY2002, with transfers to federal agencies allowed after a proposed spending plan. The e-gov fund allocation was increased to $20 million, with transfers to federal agencies requiring a proposed spending plan and justification. The Administration recognized GSA as key in implementing the President's e-gov vision for easy access to federal services. Clarification on authorization status was recommended by both chambers. The Administration sought $45 million for the e-gov fund to develop high priority Internet services, in line with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. The House recommended $5 million instead, emphasizing the need for a spending plan and GSA's role in implementing the e-gov vision. The President requested $5 million for the e-gov fund, but Senate appropriators recommended the full $45 million. However, final funding was only $5 million. The President requested $45 million again for FY2004, but House appropriators only provided $1 million without further explanation. The E-Government Act of 2002 authorized a fund that was initially requested for $5 million but was reduced to $3 million through a compromise between the House and Senate. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) manages federal records, presidential libraries, and assists in information security oversight. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) manages federal security classification and declassification policy, as well as grants for nonprofit organizations to preserve American history. The allocated funds for NARA were slightly over $321 million, with specific distributions for operating expenses, electronic records archives, repairs and restoration, and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC). This amount exceeded the House and President's requests by $20 million and $17 million respectively. The House approved $302.2 million for the National Archives, with reductions in operating expenses. The Senate recommended over $320 million, exceeding the President's request by $16 million. Operating expenses were allocated $266.9 million, electronic records archives $35.9 million, repairs and restoration $12.1 million, and $5 million for additional purposes. The President requested $304 million for NARA for FY2005, with $266.9 million for operating expenses, $6.1 million for repairs and restoration, and $3 million for NHPRC. Congress approved $35.7 million for electronic records archives in FY2004, with $22 million designated until FY2006. The President requested $35.9 million for this account in FY2005. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) serves as guardian of the federal government's merit-based system of employment by hearing and deciding appeals from federal employees. The President's FY2005 budget proposed an appropriation of $37.3 million for the MSPB, with the FY2004 appropriation being $32.9 million. Additionally, up to $2.626 million for administrative expenses could be transferred from the Civil Service. The MSPB requested up to $2.611 million from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund for administrative expenses to adjudicate retirement appeals in FY2005. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations disagreed with the proposal to transfer funds and recommended continuing the trust fund transfer. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended continuing the trust fund transfer to MSPB for administrative expenses, despite the President's request to discontinue this practice. The House passed an appropriation of $34.7 million with a trust fund transfer of up to $2.620 million, $2.6 million less than the President's request. The Senate Committee concurred with this decision. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a budget of $34.7 million for MSPB, $2.6 million less than the President's request. The committee justified this decision by continuing the trust fund transfer practice, which was not adequately justified by the President. The trust fund transfer amount remained the same as requested by the President, up to $2.626 million. The budget for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is $2.605 million after a 0.80% rescission, a reduction of $21,000 from the President's request. OPM is the central human resources agency for the Federal Government, responsible for implementing human resources policies and strategies to help federal agencies meet their missions. The Human Resources Products and Services Division of OPM supports federal agencies with retirement and insurance programs, personnel investigation services, and managerial training. The Office of Inspector General conducts audits and investigations, with a proposed budget of $18.2 billion for OPM in FY2005. This includes funding for salaries and expenses, as well as sanctions related to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The OPM budget for FY2005 includes funding for salaries and expenses, government payments for annuitants, trust fund transfers, and administrative expenses for retirement and insurance programs. The requested amount for salaries and expenses is $131.3 million, which includes funds for e-Government projects and coordination. The budget submission for FY2005 includes funds for e-Government projects, program evaluation, and performance measurement. It also includes resources for human capital support, IT enhancements, competitive sourcing studies, and homeland security. The OIG budget will finance additional audit staff and improved information systems to reduce audit cycles and increase recoveries. OPM plans to add audits for pharmacy benefit managers and expand audits for health maintenance organizations participating in FEHBP. The FY2005 budget request for OPM is 4% higher than the FY2004 total funding, with increases in various areas such as salaries and expenses, government payments for annuitants, and OIG expenses. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $120.4 million for OPM salaries and expenses, $10.9 million less than the President's request. Funds for various projects would be allocated as requested, including the enterprise human resources integration project and the e-clearance project. Appropriations for OIG salaries and expenses, employee benefits programs, and trust fund transfers are consistent with the President's request. The OPM and OIG salaries and expenses accounts align with the President's request. The House Committee on Appropriations lists specific program appropriations, including funding levels for performance culture, human capital leadership, management strategy, and retirement readiness projects. The House Committee on Appropriations directs OPM to submit an operating plan for FY2005 within 60 days of the act's enactment. The plan should include funding levels for various offices, programs, and initiatives. The committee finds that the budget justification materials lack detail about OPM's programs and resources. Additionally, OPM is directed to include the 'Annual Report on Locality-Based salaries and expenses' with the annual report. OPM is directed to include a report comparing Federal workforce compensation with the private sector in annual reports. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $130.6 million for OPM salaries and expenses, $691,000 less than the President's request. This includes funding for the Enterprise Human Resources Integration project and modernizing federal payroll systems. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for various e-Government projects, OIG salaries and expenses, employee benefits programs, and retirement recordkeeping systems. The total amount transferred from trust funds to OPM salaries and expenses account is $128.5 million, with $27.6 million allocated for automation of retirement recordkeeping systems. The Senate bill allocates $27.6 million for automating retirement recordkeeping systems. It also prohibits funds from being used to enforce restrictions on the Coast Guard Congressional Fellowship Program or OPM's proposed regulations regarding executive branch employee details to the legislative branch. Additionally, the Senate Committee on Appropriations directs the GAO to study federal employees' child care needs and provide recommendations. The GAO is directed to provide guidance on child care facility needs for Federal employees, while OPM is instructed to reevaluate efforts on subsidized child care programs. The Committee recommends OPM to seek GAO support for automating the federal retirement program. An appropriation of $125.5 million is provided for OPM salaries and expenses, with $12 million available until September 30, 2007. The funding provided is $5.8 million less than the President's request. Specific amounts are allocated for OIG salaries and expenses, employee benefits programs, retirement funds, and trust fund transfers. A portion of the money is designated for automating retirement recordkeeping systems. After a 0.80% rescission, the funding for OPM and OIG salaries and expenses, as well as trust fund transfers, is reduced from the President's request. The conference report includes reductions from the President's request for various e-gov projects. Specific funding levels are set for projects like enterprise human resources integration and federal payroll. Funds are allocated until September 30, 2007, with no provision for certain projects. $250,000 is provided for the retirement readiness project, with a call to expand it to non-federal employees. The Director is given budget allocation flexibility. The conferees direct the Director to allocate budget resources as per the provided direction, submit an operating plan within 60 days, respond to a petition within 30 days, compare pay packages of Federal workforce and private sector by March 4, 2005, and collaborate with GAO on collecting data on child care needs. The conferees direct GAO to review data and analyses, evaluate results, and provide an update on efforts 90 days after enactment. They also instruct GAO to reevaluate informing low-income employees about child care assistance programs. The Human Capital Performance Fund had a proposed budget of $300 million for FY2005, with FY2004 appropriation at $994,000 after a rescission. The fund aims to create performance-driven pay systems for employees based on performance and agency needs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $12.5 million for civilian employees based on performance and agency needs. OPM will distribute funds to agencies upon approval of their plans, with the remainder allocated at OPM's discretion. The House bill allows the OPM Director to transfer necessary amounts to federal agencies for fund purposes, with funds not obligated until relevant subcommittees are notified and approve agency plans. OPM is required to report annually to the House. OPM is directed to report annually to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on approved performance pay plans and obligated amounts. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend funding for the performance fund, stating it should be budgeted within agency expenses. The Office of Special Counsel investigates federal employee allegations and enforces the Hatch Act. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) issues advisory opinions, investigates whistleblower allegations, and receives funding from the government. The President's FY2005 budget proposed $15.449 million for the OSC, with a focus on increasing staff to reduce case backlogs. The FY2005 funding was ultimately reduced to $15.325 million after a rescission. The Senate bill reduced the President's request for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) by $124,000. The committee expects OSC to hire new staff to reduce its case backlog and report on the status of its staffing efforts by March 31, 2005. The U.S. Postal Service generates most of its funding through user fees but also receives a regular appropriation from Congress. Congress provides revenue forgone appropriations to compensate for USPS services provided below cost, such as freemailing privileges for the blind and overseas voting. The 2001 terrorist attacks led to new funding needs for bio-terrorism detection, which USPS believes should be funded through appropriations. Congress is authorized to reimburse USPS $29 million annually until 2035 for services provided to non-profit organizations below cost in the 1990s. In FY2004, USPS received a revenue forgone appropriation of $65.5 million, including $36.5 million for revenue forgone in FY2004 but not payable until October 1, 2004, and the $29 million due annually under the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993. The actual estimate for revenue forgone in FY2004 was $55.7 million, but it was reduced by $19.2 million as a reconciliation adjustment to reflect actual versus estimated free mail volume in 2001. The Administration proposed an appropriation of $61.7 million in its FY2005 Budget, with $55.6 million for revenue forgone. The Postal Service estimated $69.8 million for FY2005, requesting Congress to appropriate that amount. A reconciliation adjustment of $6.1 million was needed due to underestimation of subsidy use in FY2002. The $61.7 million would not be available until October 1, 2005, but USPS had $36.5 million available for obligation in FY2005 from fiscal 2004. The Administration did not renew the proposal for advance appropriations in its subsequent budgets. The Postmaster General expressed concerns about a $14.2 million cut in FY2005 revenue forgone. The Administration's FY2005 budget did not include the usual $29 million annual payment for revenue forgone as mandated by the Revenue Forgone Reform Act. The Bush Administration proposed to eliminate the annual payment for revenue forgone in its FY2005 budget, citing the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993 as the reason. Congress and the Administration had previously relieved USPS of a $3 billion per year pension cost obligation, resulting in a $3.8 billion net income for USPS in 2003. USPS requested an additional $779 million in emergency response funds for employee and customer safety, citing threats like the 2001 anthrax attack. This funding would continue the acquisition and deployment of ventilation and filtration equipment initiated with $762 million in FY2002. The Administration's FY2005 Budget does not include additional funds for emergency preparedness for the Postal Service. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $61.7 million as an advance appropriation for FY2006 and directed OMB to report on the funding needed for securing the mail system within 90 days. Postal issues were not addressed in the House Transportation, Treasury, and General Government appropriations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended additional funding for the Postal Service in FY2005, including $29 million for past revenue forgone and $507 million for an Emergency Preparedness Account. Conferees ultimately provided $598 million for the Postal Service in FY2005. The conferees allocated $598 million for the Postal Service in FY2005, with $502 million designated for biohazard protection. The report discusses general provisions related to infrastructure, overhead policies, Buy America Act, drug-free federal workplaces, and agency payments to GSA for services. New or modified policies in the FY2005 budget are highlighted. The Administration's proposed language for government-wide general provisions in the FY2005 Budget Appendix includes reiterating language that has appeared under specific titles for several years. Congress prefers this approach over placing the provisions in permanent law. The Administration recommended dropping several provisions, as shown in Table 10. Under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), federal white-collar employees paid under the General Schedule (GS) receive annual pay adjustments based on changes in private sector wages reflected in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The adjustments include a base pay increase and a locality-based comparability payment determined by the President to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries. If granted in 2005, the nationwide average net pay increase would be significant. If FEPCA payments were granted in 2005, the nationwide average net pay increase would be 13.06% and for the Washington, DC area, it would be 15.94%. The Administration's FY2005 budget proposed a 1.5% federal civilian pay adjustment, with resolutions emphasizing parity between military and civilian pay increases. The Senate includes a provision on pay parity in Section 505, stating that civilian employee compensation should increase at the same rate as proposed for the military in the President's Fiscal Year 2005 Budget. However, the House version of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget does not include a provision on pay parity. Representative James Moran's amendment for pay parity was not approved during the House Budget Committee markup. Arguments against the amendment included the belief that military jobs are more demanding than civilian jobs. During discussions on H.Con.Res. 393, a separate vote was allowed in the House of Representatives on pay parity resolution H.Res. 581. The resolution, passed by a 299 to 126 vote, states that civilian employee compensation in FY2005 should be adjusted in the same proportion as military compensation. Section 640 of Title VI of Division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 provides a 3.5% pay adjustment for civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. Congress has limited pay adjustments for blue-collar workers since 1979. Section 636 of the House bill regarding locality pay regulations was not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The limitation on pay adjustments for federal blue-collar workers is based on local wage rates, with higher cost areas capped to prevent wages from exceeding General Schedule supervisors' salaries. Blue-collar workers in certain locations are guaranteed a minimum pay adjustment, as outlined in Section 640(b) of P.L. 108-199. The Monroney Amendment extended out-of-area wage survey data application to Department of Defense personnel. Changes to the Senior Executive Service pay system were enacted under the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004, setting a minimum SES salary of $104,927 and a maximum of $145,600. Employees in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems can receive up to $158,100. Proposed regulations by OPM in 2004 established a new performance-based pay system for the Senior Executive Service (SES) with a higher aggregate pay limit. The Administration's FY2005 pay proposal included a 1.5% across-the-board increase and a $300 million fund for rewarding top-performing individuals. P.L. 108-199 provided $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund in FY2004, but no appropriation was made in FY2005. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 does not provide an appropriation for the fund. Members of Congress, judges, and other officials have different rules for annual pay adjustments. Judges require specific authorization for pay increases, while other officials receive automatic adjustments. Pay adjustments for federal officials are based on ECI calculations, with a 2.5% adjustment in January 2005. The ECI calculations require a 2.5% pay adjustment in January 2005, limited to the General Schedule base pay rate. The President's salary was increased to $400,000 per annum in 2001, up from $200,000 since 1969. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate, currently $175,700, with automatic adjustments. Provisions in the annual Treasury appropriations bill have aimed to ease U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba since 2000. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba under Fidel Castro has focused on isolating the nation through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo and restrictions on financial transactions. Efforts to ease these sanctions were included in the annual Treasury appropriations bill, but provisions to weaken Cuba sanctions were vetoed by the President in 2005. The U.S. has imposed restrictions on travel and financial transactions with Cuba, including a trade embargo and limitations on private commercial financing. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) issued by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulate cash remittances and travel-related financial transactions to Cuba. The Bush Administration tightened travel restrictions in 2003 and 2004, eliminating certain categories of travel and remittances. In 2004, the Bush Administration tightened Cuba travel restrictions, including eliminating fully-hosted travel and restricting family visits to once every three years. Per diem for family visits was reduced to $50 per day, and cash remittances were limited to $300 per quarter. Mixed reactions followed the increased restrictions. The House passed H.R. 5025 with provisions easing Cuba sanctions, including restrictions on visiting relatives and travel for educational activities. Opponents argue that the sanctions will harm the Cuban government financially and cause more suffering for the Cuban people. In 2004, the House passed H.R. 5025 with provisions easing Cuba sanctions, including restrictions on travel for educational activities. Amendments were made, such as prohibiting funds from implementing sanctions on private commercial sales to Cuba. Representative Jeff Flake announced not offering an amendment to restrict travel-related transactions. The Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, S. 2806, included a provision to prohibit funds from enforcing restrictions on Cuba travel. Proposed by Senator Byron Dorgan, it was unanimously approved by the Subcommittee on Transportation. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL31139 and CRS Report RL31740. The curr_chunk provides a list of abbreviations related to various transportation programs and agencies, including ATSA, BRR, CG, CMAQ, DOT, EAS, FAA, FHWA, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HTF, and IM. Abbreviations related to transportation programs and agencies include HPP, ITS, MCSAP, NHS, NHTSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, SCASD, STB, and STP. The Department of Transportation (DOT) funding comes from various sources including transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds include the highway trust fund, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund. Transportation is part of the discretionary budget and function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending, with highway and transit funding being the largest component of DOT appropriations. Contract authority from the highway trust fund allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year, without the need for appropriations legislation. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit funding in the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century created a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs by establishing funding guarantees that are difficult to alter annually. A mechanism called Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) can provide additional highway funds based on increased trust fund revenues. However, for FY2003, the RABA adjustment was set to $0, leading to a drop in highway obligational funding availability. Congress maintained FY2003 highway funding at the same level as FY2002, which was $4 billion higher than the authorized level. RABA was not considered in the FY2004 appropriations calculations. TEA-21 changed the role of appropriations committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The committees no longer set annual obligations, which are now determined by RABA computations. This limits the committees' ability to change spending levels for specific programs or projects. In FY2000, some discretion over highway spending was regained through fund redistribution and new spending projects. In FY2001, this trend continued. In FY2001, appropriators added funds for earmarked projects and redirected funding between programs. The FY2001 Act included significant additional funding for some TEA-21 programs. In FY2002, major redistributions of RABA funds occurred, with some funds transferred to ineligible agencies. Transportation budgeting involves a confusing lexicon of budget authority and contract authority. Contract authority provides obligational authority for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Prior to TEA-21, changes in transportation budget spending were achieved through the appropriations process. The annual transportation budget component achieved changes in budget/contract authority and placed limitations on obligations to control outlays. Contract authority provides obligational authority for trust fund-financed programs. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in core highway and transit programs by enumerating the limitation on obligations level. Highway and transit programs are funded through a confusing lexicon of budget authority and contract authority. The highway and transit grant programs operate on a reimbursable basis, with states paying for projects upfront and receiving federal payments only after completion. Trust fund balances appear high due to funds set aside for future commitments. Both accounts have significant short- and long-term obligations, including payments for current projects and outstanding commitments for the future. The distribution of contract authority funds to states and programs involves apportionments for formula-driven programs and allocations for programs under direct federal control. Apportionments are for state distribution, while allocations are for administrative distribution. These terms provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients. The terms apportionments and allocations provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients, who may incorrectly assume that a state apportionment is part of the federal budget."
