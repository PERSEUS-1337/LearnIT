    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Property and Casualty Insurance Company Equity Act of 1997\" and involves amending the 1986 Code. Any references to amendments or repeals in the Act are considered to be related to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Additionally, there is a provision for a small company deduction. The Small Property and Casualty Insurance Company Equity Act of 1997 amends Section 832 of the 1986 Code to include a small insurance company deduction. This deduction allows for 60% of tentative taxable income up to $3,000,000 for taxable years starting after December 31, 1997. The small insurance company deduction is reduced by 15% of taxable income exceeding $3,000,000. The deduction is not allowed for companies with assets of $500,000,000 or more. Assets refer to all company assets, and their valuation is crucial for this determination. The deduction for small insurance companies is based on the fair market value of real property and stock, and the adjusted basis of other assets. Interests in partnerships or trusts are not considered assets, but the company is treated as owning its share of the assets held by them. The term 'tentative taxable income' is defined as taxable income without considering the small insurance company deduction. It excludes items related to noninsurance businesses, which are activities not classified as insurance businesses. Non-insurance activities can be treated as insurance business if they are traditionally carried out by insurance companies for investment purposes or involve administrative services for property or casualty insurance plans. There are limitations on the amount of loss from non-insurance business that can offset income from insurance business. In computing taxable income for insurance companies subject to tax, any loss from a noninsurance business is limited. Controlled groups of insurance companies are treated as one entity for small insurance company deductions, allocated based on their respective incomes. In computing taxable income for insurance companies, controlled groups are treated as one entity for asset test purposes. Adjustments may be made to prevent excess detriment or benefit under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The amendments made by this Act will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 1997."
