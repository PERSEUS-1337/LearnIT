    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Control Act of 2004\". Congress finds that tan oak, coast live oak, Shreve's oak, and black oak trees in California and the Pacific Northwest are at risk from the exotic fungal pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, causing a die-off approaching epidemic levels. Efforts are needed to protect native plants and forests from this pathogen, and more information is required on Phytophthora ramorum and sudden oak death syndrome, including causes, transmission methods, and treatment options. The host list for Phytophthora ramorum includes 60 plant species in 32 genera, some of which are economically important landscape and garden plants in the United States. Wild huckleberry plants are also affected, posing a threat to the commercial blueberry and cranberry industries. Sudden oak death syndrome poses economic and environmental problems in California, the Pacific Northwest, and other regions, leading to increased fire risk, tree removal costs, property value reduction, and revenue loss due to movement restrictions in forests. In 2002, a quarantine was imposed on the exportation of oak trees and nursery plants from 10 counties in northern California and Curry County, Oregon due to Phytophthora ramorum. In 2004, restrictions were placed on the interstate movement of species that could serve as hosts to Phytophthora ramorum after its discovery in nurseries in southern California. In 2004, restrictions were expanded to include interstate movement of host and potential host plants from commercial nurseries in California outside the 10 quarantined counties, as well as plants in the same genus and those growing within 10 meters of a host plant. Several states and Canada have also restricted the importation of nursery plants from California. SEC. 3. RESEARCH, MONITORING, AND REGULATION OF SUDDEN OAK DEATH SYNDROME. The Secretary of Agriculture will implement a program for sudden oak death syndrome research, monitoring, and regulation to address the disease in trees, shrubs, and host plants. Activities may include surveys, workshops on monitoring techniques, and national research efforts. The program for sudden oak death syndrome research will include a national survey of forests, plant nurseries, and landscapes for Phytophthora ramorum exposure, risk assessment, study of imported nursery plants, and baseline information on oak distribution and mortality rates. The sudden oak death syndrome research program includes maintaining a database of Phytophthora ramorum occurrences, conducting research on its ecology, pathology, and management, evaluating susceptibility of oak and other species, assessing trees for hazards, and providing diagnostic services. The Secretary is responsible for managing sudden oak death syndrome, treating affected vegetation, and preventing fires. This includes reducing fire threats, improving firefighting capabilities, treating infected areas, and providing grants for hazard tree removal and restoration projects. The Secretary conducts education and outreach activities to provide information on sudden oak death syndrome to the public. This includes developing educational materials, maintaining a website, and offering support to states, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. The Secretary is required to facilitate communication between various government levels for effective implementation of programs authorized under the Act. Regular meetings or consultations must be held to exchange information and recommendations on carrying out the Act, ensuring representation from different regions of the United States. The Secretary must facilitate communication between government levels for program implementation. Meetings must include representatives from various regions and agencies like Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Agriculture Research Service, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, Forest Service, State forester offices, and National Plant Board. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2005 through 2009: $25,000,000 for section 3, $18,500,000 for section 4, and $700,000 for section 5. Passed by the Senate on December 8, 2004. The act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct research, monitoring, management, treatment, and outreach activities related to sudden oak death syndrome. Regular meetings or consultations with government officials are to be held to provide recommendations on carrying out these activities."
