The \"End Discriminatory State Taxes for Automobile Renters Act of 2009\" prohibits discriminatory taxes on the rental of motor vehicles compared to other tangible personal property within the same State or Locality. It ensures that taxes imposed on renting motor vehicles are not unfairly targeted compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers. The Act prohibits discriminatory taxes on motor vehicle rentals compared to other property within the same State or Locality, ensuring fair taxation for commercial and industrial taxpayers. The Act prohibits discriminatory taxes on motor vehicle rentals compared to other commercial and industrial property within the same State or Locality. \"Local\" or \"Locality\" refers to a political subdivision with the authority to impose taxes. \"Motor vehicle\" is defined as in title 49 of the United States Code. The term \"other commercial and industrial taxpayers\" refers to entities engaged in business within a State or Locality subject to taxation. \"Rental of motor vehicles\" involves renting a vehicle for up to 180 days for a fee, excluding taxi services. \"State\" includes States, the District of Columbia, territories, or entities acting on their behalf. The term \"tax\" refers to charges required by statute, regulation, or agreement to be paid to a State or Locality, excluding charges related to concession agreements at federally assisted airports or registration, licensing, or inspection of motor vehicles. The term \"tax base\" refers to the measure to which a tax rate is applied, while the term \"tax rate generally applicable to other commercial and industrial taxpayers\" means the lower of the rate imposed on the majority of taxpayers or the average rate at which the tax is imposed. SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS. No State or Locality may levy discriminatory tax on motor vehicle rental. SEC. 5. REMEDIES. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to prevent violations of the Act. The burden of proof is on the party seeking relief, and relief against a tax violating the Act involves striking the tax entirely. The court has the authority to strike a tax in its entirety if it violates certain criteria, unless it is found to be non-discriminatory and equivalent to taxes imposed on other taxpayers. The burden of proof lies with the State or Locality imposing the tax. An action to enforce the Act can only be brought by a person who rents motor vehicles to another person. A person engaged in renting motor vehicles can bring a cause of action against the State or Locality for discriminatory taxes. The burden of proof lies with the State or Locality imposing the tax. SEC. 6. LIMITATIONS. This Act does not allow State or Local taxation that would be prohibited without this Act. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Discriminatory taxes defined by this Act are not prohibited if certain conditions are met, such as existing legislative authorization or enactment of new legislation by December 2, 2009."
