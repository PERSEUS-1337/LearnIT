Foreign assistance is primarily managed by USAID under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with funding allocated from various accounts including Development Assistance and Economic Support Fund. In addition to funding from various accounts, U.S. international food aid programs are administered by USAID and USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a global hunger and food security initiative at the G8 Summit in 2009. The Department of State launched the Feed the Future initiative in May 2010 with a focus on reducing hunger and poverty by addressing root causes and promoting sustainable agriculture. USAID is responsible for implementing the initiative, which aims to accelerate agricultural sector growth and improve nutrition in developing countries, especially for women and children. The Feed the Future initiative, launched by the Department of State in 2010, focuses on sustainable agriculture to reduce hunger and poverty. It follows five principles for sustainable food security and invests in country-owned plans in 20 developing countries. The strategy does not include food aid funding but aims to increase the effectiveness of investments. The United States maintains a strong commitment to providing emergency and humanitarian food assistance through programs like Food for Peace/P.L. 480. Additionally, the World Bank established the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) in response to a request from the G20 leaders in 2009. GAFSP aims to improve food security and livelihoods in developing countries through public and private sector investments. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) was established in response to a request from G20 leaders in 2009. Financial commitments to the GAFSP Trust Fund totaled $925.2 million as of January 31, 2011, with contributions from various countries and organizations. GAFSP financing is available to World Bank member countries meeting specific criteria, and $337 million has been awarded to eight countries for agricultural development. The United States has provided food aid for over 55 years through various program authorities like the Food for Peace Act and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. The 2008 farm bill authorizes and amends U.S. international food aid programs, primarily funded through Agriculture appropriations bills and administered by USAID or USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) is also reauthorized as a reserve for Food for Peace programs. The United States has provided food aid for over 55 years through various program authorities like the Food for Peace Act and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. The 2008 farm bill authorizes and amends U.S. international food aid programs, primarily funded through Agriculture appropriations bills and administered by USAID or USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) is a reserve of commodities and cash for use in the Food for Peace programs to meet unanticipated food aid needs. Average annual spending on international food aid programs has been approximately $2.2 billion over the past decade, with Food for Peace Title II activities comprising the largest portion of the total budget. The President's budget request has included up to $300 million annually in International Disaster Assistance for emergency food assistance interventions. Funding for foreign assistance and agricultural development activities, including Feed the Future, is made available through the annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill from several different budget accounts at USAID. In FY2010, the Administration allocated $1.31 billion to Feed the Future (FtF) programs, including $1.17 billion for agricultural development at USAID, $75 million for nutrition activities, and $67 million for the World Bank GAFSP. Additionally, Title II received $1.84 billion, and the McGovern-Dole program got $209.5 million. In FY2011, the Administration requested $1.84 billion for FtF activities, representing over 3% of the total international affairs budget. In FY2011, the Administration requested an increase in funding for international affairs, including $408 million for the World Bank GAFSP Trust Fund and $2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance related to food security. Congress passed a continuing resolution that funded federal agencies and programs through the remainder of FY2011. The CR included funding allocations to major USAID budget accounts, but did not specify funding for FtF programming. After appropriations bills are passed, USAID must submit a Section 653(a) report to Congress detailing budget allocation plans. The final FY2011 CR included funding allocations for various USAID budget accounts, with reductions in funding levels compared to previous years. The reductions were attributed to the tight federal fiscal situation, deficit reduction efforts, and a less favorable view of foreign assistance by the current House leadership. The Section 653(a) report, typically completed a few months after the final appropriations bill is passed, will provide additional insights on funding levels for FY2011. The reductions in USAID foreign aid funding accounts, including the dramatic cut to ESF, are attributed to Congress's desire to reduce funding to \"frontline states\" like Iraq and Afghanistan. ESF funds are used for U.S. economic, political, and security interests, with a focus on countries important in the war on terrorism. The selection of projects and countries is based more on U.S. political and strategic interests rather than development and humanitarian goals. The FY2011 CR includes reduced funding for food aid programs and IDA, with the FY2012 budget requesting increased funding for the FtF initiative, particularly for bilateral agricultural development activities. The FY2012 budget request includes funding for agricultural development activities, with allocations for ESF, AEECA, Global Health, Child Survival program, World Bank GAFSP, Food for Peace Title II, and International Disaster Assistance. The breakdown of funding allocation by region and activities is provided in Figure 1. The FtF initiative includes investments in bilateral and regional programs, multilateral mechanisms like the World Bank GAFSP Trust Fund, strategic partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation for technology development in agriculture."
