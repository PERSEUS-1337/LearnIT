An excise tax is imposed on the first sale and use of imported crude oil or refined petroleum products in the United States. The tax rate is determined based on the excess value of each barrel, with specific calculations outlined for crude oil and refined petroleum products. The energy policy price per barrel of crude oil is a key factor in determining the tax rate. The energy policy price for determining tax rates is based on the weighted average international price of crude oil over the previous 4 weeks, as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Energy Information Administration. The tax liability for the first sale of imported crude oil or refined petroleum products is imposed under subsection (a)(1). Sales tax is paid by the first seller of crude oil or refined petroleum products in the US, while the user tax is paid by the person who uses the products. Tax-free exports are allowed under certain conditions set by the Secretary, where no tax is imposed on products sold for export or resale for export. Proof of export is required for tax-free sales. The seller must receive proof of export within 6 months of the sale for tax-free sales of crude oil or refined petroleum products to apply. SEC. 5892. DEFINITIONS. Defines terms like crude oil, barrel, refined petroleum product, and export. SEC. 5893. REGISTRATION. SEC. 5893 requires registration for those subject to tax under section 5891. The tax imposed by section 5891 is treated similarly to the tax imposed by section 4986. Additionally, a new chapter is added for imported crude oil or refined petroleum products, and imported oil taxes are now deductible under section 164(a). The amendments made by this Act will apply to sales and use of imported crude oil or refined petroleum products after the date of enactment."
