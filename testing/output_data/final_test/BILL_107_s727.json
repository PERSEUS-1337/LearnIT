    "content": "Title XII of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section called \"Teaching Children To Save Lives Act\" which aims to teach children life-saving skills. The Teaching Children To Save Lives Act emphasizes the importance of teaching school children CPR, choking response, and stroke recognition to improve emergency response confidence and potentially reduce death rates from sudden cardiac arrest, choking, and stroke. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US, with 220,000 Americans dying annually from sudden cardiac arrest. The American Heart Association estimates that 50,000 lives could be saved each year by following the 'chain of survival'. The Teaching Children To Save Lives Act emphasizes the importance of incorporating lifesaving training programs into school health curriculum. This includes teaching school children CPR, choking response, and stroke recognition as part of the 'chain of survival' to improve emergency response confidence and potentially reduce death rates from sudden cardiac arrest, choking, and stroke. \"SEC. 1273. GRANTS FOR CPR TRAINING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.\" The Secretary can award grants to State agencies for CPR training in targeted localities, utilizing nationally recognized courses. Grants cover instructor training, CPR instruction, materials, manikins, AED training devices, and equipment. State agencies should promote community partnerships for CPR training in public schools. The State agency awards grants for CPR training in targeted schools and communities, considering the need for existing programs, geographic barriers, and maximizing fund usage. Eligibility for AED training device grants is also outlined. Under this section, a local agency or targeted school must show they have a CPR training program in place to purchase an AED training device. Definitions include AED as automated external defibrillator, CPR as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, instructor as a certified individual to train CPR, and targeted school as a public school with grades 6-12. The Secretary may make rules to carry out this part of the legislation for students in grades 6 through 12. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress on the activities assisted under this legislation. An authorization of $30,000,000 is provided for a 3-year period starting in fiscal year 2002."
