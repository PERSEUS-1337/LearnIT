The impacts include record prevented plantings, delays in planting and harvesting, crop insurance indemnity payments, and ad hoc payments for producers facing trade damage and losses from prevented planting. Corn and soybeans are crucial crops in the U.S., accounting for over half of the land planted to major field crops since 2010 and serving as key inputs for various sectors. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasted increased federal support for farm incomes in 2019, including direct payments and crop insurance indemnities totaling $32.7 billion. The federal crop insurance program has become the largest component of the farm safety net, with annual premium subsidies averaging $7.8 billion since 2010. Congress is responsible for authorizing and funding the program, which is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980. The Federal Crop Insurance Program, authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980, receives mandatory funding and has been modified in recent farm bills. In 2019, U.S. agricultural production was delayed due to cool, wet spring conditions, leading to prevent plant acres and late planting of corn and soybeans in several states. In 2019, planting delays for corn and soybeans in the U.S. pushed the growing cycle into hotter, drier periods of the summer than usual. This could potentially impact crop maturity and yield potential, with the risk of an early fall freeze terminating further growth. Late planting also complicates producer decision-making, especially when it occurs after the crop insurance policy's \"final planting date.\" After the final planting date in the insurance policy, late planting reduces coverage by 1% per day for 25 days. Producers must choose between a reduced indemnity payment or planting with higher risk. In 2019, many corn and soybean crops were planted after the final planting date, complicating decisions due to potential yield reductions. In 2019, not planting was complicated by Secretary of Agriculture Perdue's announcement that only producers with planted acres would be eligible for trade damage assistance payments under the Market Facilitation Program. The announcement could have encouraged greater planting as farmers sought eligibility for higher payment rates for soybeans and corn. The MFP payment formula for 2019 would use planted acres, not harvested production, and combine payment rates at the county level. The 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) incentivized some producers to plant corn and soybeans under challenging conditions due to the potential for MFP payments. This planting may have prevented larger Prevented Planting (PPL) acres from being reported. The ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China added uncertainty, reducing agricultural exports and complicating producers' market evaluations. Producers' evaluations of market payoffs were complicated by factors related to planting and crop insurance choices. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Risk Management Agency (RMA) provide data on Prevented Planting (PPL) acres, with similar but not identical estimates. FSA manages USDA's farm revenue-support and disaster assistance programs, while RMA oversees crop insurance programs. Discrepancies in reported acres planted, harvested, and prevented from being are due to not all farms participating in USDA programs or buying federal crop insurance. As of November 1, 2019, U.S. farmers reported 19.6 million acres prevented from planting due to wet conditions. FSA reported 19.6 million PPL acres, including record numbers for corn and soybeans. RMA also reported a record 18.8 million PPL acres, with slightly more soybean and wheat acres compared to FSA. In 2019, RMA's PPL acres had more soybean and wheat acres but fewer corn acres compared to FSA. Corn, soybeans, and wheat made up over 90% of PPL acres. RMA reported over $4.2 billion in indemnity payments, with the majority going to corn and soybean PPL acres. The average national PPL payment rate for all crops was $224.04 per acre, varying by crop. Some economists suggest discrepancies in corn PPL acres may be due to farmers claiming soybean acres as corn to receive higher indemnity payments. In 2019, corn had a higher PPL indemnity rate than soybeans, with an average payment rate of $270.13 per acre. Producers were incentivized to claim PPL for corn due to the higher payment rate. The record PPL acres in 2019 were mainly in Corn Belt states but also reported in other states like Arkansas, Texas, and North Carolina. In 2019, South Dakota reported 3.9 million PPL acres, more than double Ohio's 1.4 million acres. South Dakota accounted for over 20% of the national total PPL acres and 21.9% of indemnity payments. Federal programs provided multiple payments for farmers unable to plant due to natural causes, including crop insurance, disaster assistance, and MFP payments based on planted acres. Cover crops on PPL acres were also eligible for payments. Crop insurance PPL coverage compensates producers for pre-planting costs if they are unable to plant an insured crop due to an insured peril. This coverage is available for any farm-based COMBO policy, including individual yield or revenue insurance policies like Revenue Protection (RP) and Yield Protection. Area-based revenue and yield policies are also included. Crop insurance PPL coverage compensates producers for pre-planting costs if they are unable to plant an insured crop due to an insured peril. This coverage is available for any farm-based COMBO policy, including individual yield or revenue insurance policies like Revenue Protection (RP) and Yield Protection. Area-based revenue and yield policies such as Area Risk Protection and Area Yield Protection are not eligible for PPL indemnities. Policyholders who cannot plant due to planting delays may choose not to plant and receive a PPL indemnity, calculated as a percentage of the original insurance guarantee. For example, a corn producer with RP coverage at an 80% level could receive a PPL indemnity of 55% of the insurance guarantee. On June 3, 2019, Congress passed a FY2019 supplemental appropriations bill (P.L. 116-20) authorizing $3 billion in additional funds for farmers impacted by disasters. The funding covers various agricultural losses from 2018 and 2019, including prevented planting losses. Producers who claimed Prevented Planting (PPL) losses in 2019 are eligible for a top-up of 10%-15% of their PPL indemnity. Producers who claimed PPL losses in 2019 are eligible for a top-up of 10%-15% of their PPL indemnity. The top-up is 15% for producers with standard RP policies that include the harvest price option and 10% for those who opted out. 91% of corn and soybean insured acres were covered by RP with harvest price option in 2019. The supplemental program limits payments to 90% of losses, excluding MFP payments. Payments are limited to 70% of losses for producers without crop insurance or NAP. In 2019, producers who claimed PPL losses are eligible for a top-up of 10%-15% of their PPL indemnity. The top-up is 15% for those with standard RP policies and 10% for those who opted out. Payments are limited to 70% of losses for producers without crop insurance or NAP. USDA announced a 2019 MFP payment rate of $15 per acre for PPL losses claimed on non-specialty crop acres followed by a USDA-approved cover crop. In 2019, producers who claimed PPL losses can combine payments from multiple programs without planting the intended cash crop. A corn farmer with a standard RP policy and 80% coverage could receive combined PPL payments of $419.80 per acre, including the PPL indemnity, supplemental top-up payment, and MFP payment for an eligible cover crop. This combination can result in a higher payment than previous years, with a yield loss of nearly 66% needed to match the federal payout under the suite of programs available. In 2019, farmers could receive combined PPL payments for planting cover crops. Some farmers may have missed out on higher payments by choosing to plant corn or soybeans instead of opting for PPL with top-up and extended MFP on cover crops. In 2019, late planting of corn and soybean crops due to wet conditions led to concerns about crop development and yields. The wet weather continued into the fall, with North Dakota and Iowa experiencing record-breaking precipitation. Harvesting the corn crop was challenging due to high moisture content, requiring drying. An early cold spell in the Upper Midwest further complicated the situation. The high moisture content of the corn crop required drying, leading to limited propane supplies and higher prices. As of December 16, 2019, 8% of the U.S. corn crop remained unharvested, adding uncertainty to yields. Saturated soil conditions suggest continued wetness into the 2020 planting season, potentially causing planting difficulties. The wet conditions in 2019 led to record crop insurance payments, with concerns that persisting wetness in 2020 could lead to planting challenges and potential limits on Prevented Planting (PPL) eligibility for affected cropland. The wet conditions in 2019 resulted in record crop insurance payments, raising concerns about potential planting challenges in 2020 and limits on Prevented Planting eligibility for affected cropland. Additionally, there are worries about the timing and clarity of USDA announcements regarding new payment programs linked to producer production choices. Market watchers and policymakers are also concerned about the increased role of USDA payments to support farm incomes in 2019, with forecasts of $22.4 billion in direct support payments to the agricultural sector. In 2019, USDA forecasts $32.7 billion in farm support and crop insurance payments, representing 35.3% of the projected net farm income. Weak crop prices may lead to continued reliance on federal programs in 2020."
