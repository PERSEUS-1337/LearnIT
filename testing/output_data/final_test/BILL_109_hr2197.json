    "content": "The Act titled \"Health Care for Working Families Act of 2005\" is abbreviated as such. Congress finds that every industrialized country guarantees the right to health care, except the United States. 45,000,000 Americans lack health insurance, with the number increasing annually. Most uninsured individuals are workers or their dependents. Congress has historically passed laws to ensure fair compensation for work, including minimum wage and safe working conditions. It is now necessary to implement requirements guaranteeing job security. It is time to enact requirements ensuring that jobs provide affordable, adequate health insurance benefits. Title II of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 introduces health benefits for employees and their families. Title II of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 mandates large employers to offer qualifying health benefit plans to employees and their families. These plans must provide coverage equivalent to or better than the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Plan as of January 1, 2006, and comply with the requirements of the Public Health Service Act. Large employers are required to contribute to the cost of qualifying health benefit plans for employees and withhold the employee's share of the premium. The employer's contribution must be at least equal to the portion that the Federal Government contributes under the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Plan. The Standard Plan provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program requires employer contributions based on the number of hours worked per week, with a limitation for employees working less than 10 hours. Employees covered under a Federal health insurance program have certain obligations. Employees covered under a Federal health insurance program must accept an offer of health insurance coverage and agree to payroll withholdings or provide payment for premiums, with exceptions for those already covered under a qualified health benefit plan or for family members who are also covered under such a plan. Employees covered under a Federal health insurance program can request payment of their share of premiums for a qualifying health benefit plan from the relevant Federal administrator. The term 'Federal health insurance program' refers to the Medicare or Medicaid program under the Social Security Act. The provisions of this title apply to large employers, defined as those with at least 50 full-time employees on average during the preceding calendar year and not less than 50 employees on the first day of the plan year. The provisions of this title apply to large employers with at least 50 full-time employees on average during the preceding calendar year. An exception applies if the majority of services are performed on behalf of a single large employer. Contract workers are considered employees of the employer. SEC. 202 requires coverage under a qualifying health benefit plan for employees of large employers to begin within 30 days of their first hour of service. Employers can withhold premiums from employee paychecks. SEC. 203 addresses enforcement. SEC. 203 enforces compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for large employers through civil money penalties and injunctive relief. SEC. 204 addresses preemption. SEC. 204 states that states can enforce their own standards on employer health insurance as long as they don't conflict with federal requirements. SEC. 205 defines the terms and effective date. SEC. 205 defines the terms 'family' and 'family member' as the spouse and children of an employee, with an effective date of January 1, 2006 for employers. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, also known as the 'Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938', is amended to replace \"this Act\" with \"this title\" and include violations of title II. Additionally, the Public Health Service Act is amended to require health insurance coverage under section 249. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to require health insurance coverage for employees offered by health insurance issuers to comply with title II requirements."
