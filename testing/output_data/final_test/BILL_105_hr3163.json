    "content": "The \"Trade Dress Protection Act\" may be cited as the short title for this Act, which provides protection for trade dress. The Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to include new provisions regarding functional matter in trademarks. Subsection (f) is updated to include subsection (e)(5), and a new subsection (g) is added to clarify exclusions. Trade dress that functions as a mark can be registered and protected without showing distinctiveness if the public can identify the source by the claimed trade dress. Factors considered include uniqueness, common shapes, and mere refinements. The trade dress can be registered without distinctiveness if it can identify the source. Factors include uniqueness, common shapes, and commercial impression distinct from words. Marks on the supplemental register can consist of various elements but must distinguish goods or services. The term 'trade dress' refers to the overall appearance of a product or service, including packaging, design, color, and features, but cannot be registered if it is functional. The functionality of protected matter is determined by its superior design for its purpose and its impact on competition. The Act considers factors like competitive advantage, availability of alternative designs, and impact on cost or quality when protecting functional matter. In civil actions for trade dress infringement, the burden of proof lies with the person asserting protection to show that the matter is not functional. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments will take effect upon enactment, excluding any ongoing proceedings or civil actions. SEC. 4. TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. The Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to make various changes to sections 1(a)(1)(A), 7(a), 10, 26, and 31. The Trademark Act of 1946 is amended in sections 32, 39, 42, and 44(d) by making changes to wording and references. The Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to replace \"trade-mark\" with \"trademark\" in the text and title."
