The findings of Congress highlight the increasing population of seniors in the US, with millions facing abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation annually. Fraud targeting seniors is underreported and widespread across various demographics. Seniors are often targeted for fraud, with cases being severely underreported. The Federal Bureau of Investigation states that seniors may not report fraud due to various reasons, such as not knowing who to report to or feeling ashamed. A 2011 report estimated that victims of senior financial abuse lose at least $2.9 billion annually. Financial abuse targeting seniors is estimated to cost at least $2.9 billion annually. Perpetrators often operate outside the US, reaching victims through mail, phone, and the internet. The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act helps protect consumers from deceptive mailings. In fiscal year 2007, over 27,000 letters were prepared in response to mail fraud. In fiscal year 2007, postal inspectors investigated 2,909 mail fraud cases in the United States, resulting in 1,236 arrests and 1,118 convictions. Additionally, there were 162 telemarketing fraud investigations with 83 arrests and 61 convictions. The Special Committee on Aging reported that consumers lose approximately $40 billion annually to telemarketing fraud, with an estimated 10% of telemarketing firms being fraudulent. Researchers suggest that only one in 10,000 fraud victims report the crime. A 2003 report by AARP found that telemarketing fraud is underreported among senior victims, but counseling by trained peer volunteers reduces the likelihood of falling victim. The FBI warns that fraud threats to seniors are increasing, with criminals using various techniques including online scams like phishing. The Internet Crime Complaint Center, a partnership between the National White Collar Crime Center and the FBI, receives and refers criminal complaints regarding cybercrime. The Internet Crime Complaint Center processed over 219,553 complaints of Internet crime in 2007, referring 90,008 complaints with a total dollar loss of $239,090,000 to law enforcement agencies for further action. Consumer awareness is crucial in preventing fraud. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Trade Commission. The term \"senior citizen\" is defined as an individual who is at least 65 years old. SEC. 4. INFORMATION AND CONSUMER EDUCATION ON MAIL, TELEMARKETING, AND INTERNET FRAUD TARGETING SENIOR CITIZENS. The Commission will disseminate information on mail, telemarketing, and Internet fraud targeting senior citizens in a user-friendly manner after consulting with relevant authorities. The Commission will provide easily accessible and user-friendly information to senior citizens on scam and fraud prevention through safe financial practices. This information will be regularly updated to keep pace with criminal activity and will include instructions on how to report complaints to law enforcement and a national toll-free telephone number. The Commission will establish a national toll-free telephone number with live individuals available to answer calls from senior citizens. Senior citizens can call a national toll-free number for advice on reporting fraud or to ask about scams. The Commission will maintain a website with information on fraud for senior citizens, work with State agencies to track fraud cases, and provide publicly available information upon request. The Commission will establish procedures to provide information on civil or criminal law enforcement actions for fraud targeting senior citizens within one year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. EDUCATION TO CERTAIN ENTITIES REGARDING FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION OF SENIOR CITIZENS. The Commission will educate entities like depository institutions, credit offices, remittance transfer providers, and prepaid card distributors on legal obligations and best practices for preventing financial exploitation and neglect of senior citizens. The Act requires training for entities like financial institutions to recognize elder financial abuse and neglect. The Act mandates training for entities, including financial institutions, to identify and address financial exploitation and neglect of senior citizens. The Commission must establish procedures for implementing these requirements within one year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 6. Grant program to prevent mail, telemarketing, and internet fraud and for scientific research on senior citizens' vulnerability to scams. The Attorney General may award grants to eligible entities for fraud prevention activities to protect senior citizens, giving priority to those with public-private partnerships focused on Internet scam prevention. The Attorney General is authorized to appropriate $5,000,000 annually from 2018 to 2022 for fraud prevention activities targeting senior citizens. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on seniors' susceptibility to scams due to age-related health conditions, with funding derived from existing sources. Congress believes in the importance of increasing awareness of fraud targeting senior citizens and proposes designating a week in March as \"National Senior Fraud Awareness Week.\" This week aims to coincide with the end of winter, a period of increased isolation, and precedes tax season. The public is encouraged to observe this week with relevant educational activities, and the President should issue a proclamation in support of increased awareness of senior fraud."
