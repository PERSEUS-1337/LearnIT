    "content": "In FY2015, the Department of Defense faced a cap on national defense spending, set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. President Obama's budget request and the National Defense Authorization Act complied with the cap. The Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, part of the National Defense Authorization Act, authorizes funds for military construction projects. This act is crucial for setting policy and organizing the Department of Defense. The Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 authorizes funds for military construction projects, modifies existing projects, approves land title transfers, sets policy for property disposition, and directs DOD real property management. It also authorizes appropriations for the NATO Security Investment Program and addresses DOD-related provisions. The Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 authorized $6.6 billion for military construction and family housing, reflecting a 40% decrease from the previous year due to appropriations caps. The act also approved additional overseas contingency operations construction and \"unfunded\" projects planned by DOD. The President's requested amounts for Army construction, family housing, and operation and maintenance were all authorized. The FY2015 Military Construction Authorization Act authorized $6.6 billion for military construction and family housing, with $351.0 million allocated for operation and maintenance. The authorization typically remains current for three years, but can be modified in subsequent acts. The act extended authorization for Army projects from FY2011 and FY2012, adjusted construction priorities, and collapsed phases of a Command and Control Facility project to save costs and speed up completion. Additionally, it authorized three projects not initially requested in FY2015. The FY2015 Military Construction Authorization Act authorized $6.6 billion for military construction and family housing, with $351.0 million allocated for operation and maintenance. It extended authorization for Army projects from FY2011 and FY2012, adjusted construction priorities, and authorized three new projects including a Consolidated Shipping Center at Blue Grass Army Depot, a Simulations Center at Fort Hood, and the third phase of construction of the Individual Training Barracks Complex at Fort Lee. Additionally, it prohibited funds for family housing construction at Camp Walker in the Republic of Korea until DOD validated housing requirements. The FY2015 Military Construction Authorization Act authorized $6.6 billion for military construction and family housing, with $351.0 million allocated for operation and maintenance. The President requested $16.4 million for Navy and Marine Corps family housing construction and $354.0 million for operation and maintenance, which was authorized. The act also authorized $993.2 million for Navy and Marine Corps construction, with reductions made for a Cyber Studies Building at Annapolis, MD. Additionally, unrequested authorizations were added for a Regional Ship Maintenance Support Facility at Bangor, WA, and a Radio Battalion Complex at Camp Lejeune, NC. The FY2015 Military Construction Authorization Act authorized $6.6 billion for military construction and family housing. The President requested $811.7 million for Air Force construction, but the act authorized $846.2 million, including $34.4 million for a Corrosion Control and Composite Repair Shop at Andersen AFB. The act also modified previously enacted construction authorizations and did not authorize family housing construction funding for the Air Force. The FY2015 Military Construction Authorization Act authorized $6.6 billion for military construction and family housing. The President requested $2.1 billion for Defense-Wide construction, but the act authorized $2.0 billion. The difference is due to reductions in funding for hospital construction in Germany, Contingency Construction, and Planning and Design. The act also modified ongoing construction projects and restricted funds for specific facilities until a report on suicide prevention efforts is received by the Committees on Armed Services. No funding was requested for family housing. The President did not request family housing construction funding for the Defense account in the FY2015 Military Construction Authorization Act. However, $61.0 million was authorized for the operation and maintenance of defense family housing. The international Chemical Weapons Convention, ratified in 1997, banned the production, stockpiling, or use of chemical weapons. The U.S. has reduced its supply of chemical munitions since then, with the U.S. Army Chemical Munitions Activity responsible for their destruction. Currently, only Pueblo Chemical Depot, CO, and Blue Grass Army Depot, KY, have remaining munitions. The President requested funding for chemical demilitarization construction and NSIP contributions, with authorized amounts slightly lower than requested. Projects authorized included those not initially requested. The Family Housing Improvement Fund received $1.7 million as requested. During BRAC rounds, Congress creates appropriations accounts to fund activities for military Base Realignment and Closure. The President requested $270.1 million for the BRAC account, which was authorized. The act also rejected the President's request for a 2017 base closure round. DOD and Local Redevelopment Authorities work together for redevelopment under previous BRAC procedures. The Defense Department and Local Redevelopment Authorities collaborate on redeveloping BRAC-surplused defense properties. The creation of LRAs can be problematic. Sections 2721 and 2801 of the act address LRA recognition and advance notification to congressional defense committees for construction on military installations. Section 2802 modifies construction authority by raising cost ceilings. The amendment to the statute raised construction cost limits and allowed the use of O&M funds for projects under $1.0 million. It also clarified that military construction projects can be accepted as payment-in-kind only if authorized by law. The amendment will be effective on September 30, 2016. Section 2804 expanded Secretaries' authority to use a single fixed-price contract for design and construction of military projects. It introduced \"one-step turn-key selection procedures\" for combined contracts. Section 2805 extended restrictions on military construction in the European Command Area of Responsibility until certified as necessary. The section extends temporary authority for O&M funds to be used for contingency construction in the CENTCOM AOR, limited to $100 million. Section 2807 expanded green building standards for residential projects. Section 2808 prohibited new construction at NS Guantanamo Bay without certification. Section 2821 modified restrictions on Marine Corps forces movement from Okinawa to Guam. The DOD created a Master Plan for Guam in July 2014, replacing a previous prohibition with a cap on construction costs for moving Marines from Okinawa. Section 2822 allows for the establishment of a surface danger zone in Guam for a live-fire range. Subtitle D of the act involves the conveyance of land parcels administered by DOD to various entities. Section 2851 amended 10 U.S.C. \u00a74772 to allow the Secretary of the Army to accept funds and gifts for the Heritage Center for the National Museum of the United States Army. Section 2852 directed the Secretary of Defense to convey title to the Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial in San Diego to the Mount Soledad Memorial Association. Section 2853 authorized the Secretary of the Navy to establish a memorial on the Washington Navy Yard for the victims of a shooting attack in 2013. Section 2871 required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on actions taken following shooting incidents at Fort Hood and the Washington Navy Yard. Senator Daniel K. Inouye was honored by renaming the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies. Army and Air Force construction projects supporting the ERI were authorized. The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill authorized several construction projects in Eastern European countries to support the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI). This included funding for a National Security Agency project, minor construction associated with the ERI, and a total of $220.4 million for overseas contingency operations military construction. The bill covers planning, design, construction, and improvement of facilities for active and reserve military components worldwide, as well as military family housing and NATO Security Investment Program funding. The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill funds various programs and projects related to veterans' benefits, health care, cemeteries, and monuments. It also supports the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, Armed Forces Retirement Homes, and Arlington National Cemetery. The bill was introduced to the House by Representative John Abney Culberson and passed with overwhelming support. The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill was introduced in the Senate on May 1, 2014, and underwent various amendments before being incorporated into a separate bill, H.R. 83, and ultimately passed by both the House and Senate in December 2014. The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, passed in December 2014, includes appropriations for military construction, family housing, NATO Security Investment Program, chemical munitions stockpile demilitarization, DOD homeowners assistance program, DOD family housing improvement program, and military base closure and realignment activities. Since 1948, the median annual military construction and family housing appropriation is $11.9 billion in constant FY2015 dollars. For FY2015, Congress allocated $6.6 billion for military construction and family housing projects. The appropriations flow is illustrated in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72802, which defines military construction projects as surveys, site preparation, facility acquisition, equipment installation, and planning. The end of World War II in 1945 left the Department of War and the Department of the Navy with massive infrastructure inventories supporting a demobilizing military force. Construction requirements were minimal until the outbreak of hostilities on the Korean Peninsula in 1950, when the Cold War required a significant reorientation of U.S. national strategy. During the Cold War, the U.S. reoriented its national strategy to counter Soviet threats by constructing radar facilities, missile defense sites, and bomber bases. Construction continued during the Vietnam War but slowed after the conflict ended. The Reagan Administration's military buildup in the 1980s led to renewed construction. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 allowed for a significant reduction in the Department of Defense's infrastructure. During the Cold War, the U.S. expanded its military infrastructure to counter Soviet threats. In 1988, a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process was established to reduce the Department of Defense's footprint. BRAC recommendations were implemented in 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005, funded through military construction appropriations. The 2005 BRAC round, implemented between FY2006 and FY2011, contributed to sustained military construction appropriations levels post-Cold War. The 2005 BRAC round required significant funding due to its focus on transforming military forces post-Cold War, increasing ground forces for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and constructing new facilities for redeployed units. Military construction appropriations have decreased since 2011, with FY2012 seeing a 28% reduction and FY2014 a further 27% decrease. The military construction appropriations have been decreasing since 2011, with significant reductions in funding. The President requested a lower budget for FY2015, and future projections show a fluctuation in funding levels from FY2016 to FY2019. The conference committee raised key issues in drafting the FY2015 appropriation, including the funding of capital asset projects like military facilities. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directs federal agencies, like DOD, to fully fund construction projects to reflect real costs. However, large projects with substantial budget needs are funded in phases over several years, which some in the construction industry find inefficient. Congress has occasionally consolidated construction phases into a single project to address this issue. Several major construction projects were funded in phases over several years, but Congress consolidated them into a single project in the FY2015 act. Military installations may provide minimal upkeep to unused buildings, which could be a cost-saving measure in the long run. The conference committee urged the DOD to eliminate wasteful spending on unused facilities and manage properties responsibly. Budget constraints on military construction have impacted surface transportation infrastructure, with the DAR Program being the only way DOD can assist in road construction outside military installations. The committee directed DOD to update its list of unfunded DAR requirements and internal road improvements for installations experiencing growth. Funding for \"Quality of Life\" facilities was also noted in the Explanatory Statement. The Department of Defense (DOD) acknowledged the decline in funding for \"Quality of Life\" (QOL) facilities due to budget constraints. The Senate provided additional funding for unfunded QOL military construction requirements in 2015, but no extra funding was authorized in the Defense authorization bills. DOD was directed to prioritize a list of unfunded QOL requirements for the FY2016 military construction appropriations request. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers programs providing benefits to veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, medical care, and burial benefits. The VA has three primary organizations: the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits for disabled veterans, including medical care, life insurance, home loan guarantees, burial benefits, and educational and training benefits. VA appropriations for benefits and services have increased by almost 81% from FY2008 to FY2015. The FY2015 budget called for funding the VA at $158.64 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to the previous year. The final enacted FY2015 appropriation for the VA was $159.14 billion, approximately $505 million above the Administration's request. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits for disabled veterans, with appropriations increasing by almost 81% from FY2008 to FY2015. The FY2015 budget allocated $158.64 billion for the VA, a 7.2% increase from the previous year. Advance appropriations for FY2016 are scored in the fiscal year they become available for obligation, not when enacted. Funding for FY2015 does not include advance appropriations provided in FY2015 for use in FY2016, which are shown in the FY2016 column. Since FY2010, the annual appropriations process for VHA includes advance appropriations for use during the following fiscal year. The Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 authorized advance appropriations for three VHA accounts: medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities. The Department of Veterans Affairs is required to request advance appropriations for VHA with its budget request each year. The 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided advance appropriations for FY2011 for the three VHA accounts. Subsequent appropriation measures have continued to provide advance funding. The Administration also requested $58.66 billion in advance FY2016 funding for VA health care. Congress extended advance appropriations to mandatory VA benefits, including compensation and pensions, readjustment benefits, and veterans insurance and indemnities. Beginning with the FY2016 MILCON-VA Appropriations bill, these three VBA accounts will receive advance funding. The FY2016 MILCON-VA Appropriations bill provides advance appropriations for FY2017 to three VBA accounts, in addition to the three VHA accounts already authorized for advance appropriations. P.L. 113-235 includes slightly less funding for medical services than requested in the FY2015 Administration request. It also includes rescissions and reallocations of funding, with a total of $56 million in rescissions. $40 million was reprogrammed to extend a pilot program for VA to contract outside physicians for disability examinations. The Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-275) allocated $16 million in rescissions for the VA under P.L. 113-235. The 2015 MILCON-VA Appropriations Act (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235) provided $56.4 billion for VHA, including funding for various VA departmental administration functions and medical accounts. The 2015 MILCON-VA Appropriations Act allocated approximately $45.225 billion in new budget authority for VHA medical services, including funding for Hepatitis-C drug therapies, the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, and provisions in the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. Additionally, advance appropriations of around $58.7 billion were provided for FY2016 for three VHA accounts. In FY2015, VA health care appropriations included higher mandatory funding compared to discretionary funding. Mandatory funding, making up 59.1% of total funding, consists of entitlements like disability compensation and pension. The growth in mandatory funding is driven by disability claims from former servicemembers and individuals eligible for benefits. The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) maintains 24 cemeteries and 25 memorials in foreign countries and on U.S. soil. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has the authority to interpret laws, compel action by the VA, and overturn decisions. The Secretary of the Army oversees Arlington National Cemetery and the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery. Arlington hosts numerous ceremonies and millions of visitors annually. Funding for Arlington is $20 million above the Administration request, and the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund supports operations. The Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund provides funds for the operation and maintenance of retirement homes in Washington, DC and Gulfport, MS. The trust fund is funded through gifts, bequests, and a $0.50 per month assessment on active duty military personnel. The Administration's FY2015 budget request, House-passed and Senate proposed appropriations, and final enacted appropriations for related agencies are shown in Table 10. Additionally, a new title for military construction was created in Division I of H.R. 83. The FY2015 Military Construction budget included funds for projects related to the Global War on Terrorism and the European Reassurance Initiative. $46 million was allocated for a Defense-Wide OCO construction project at a classified location, and an additional $175 million was appropriated for ERI construction. The funds were initially requested from defense Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds but were later identified for specific construction requirements by DOD."
