Alternative payment methodologies can also be used if agreed upon by the State and the grantee. The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to services furnished on or after January 1, 2010, without final regulations. State legislation may be required for a State plan to meet additional requirements for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The State plan must meet additional requirements imposed by the amendments without being considered non-compliant solely for not meeting the requirement before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session."
