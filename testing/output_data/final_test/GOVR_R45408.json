TEFAP supports the agricultural economy by reducing market supply and increasing food prices. Administered by the USDA-FNS, TEFAP was established in 1983 to address hunger and dispose of government-held agricultural surpluses. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) is a permanent program with mandatory funding operating in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Administered by USDA-FNS at the federal level and by state distributing agencies at the state level, TEFAP provides commodities and funds to feeding organizations. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) is a federal program that provides commodities and funds to feeding organizations. TEFAP operates in all 50 states and U.S. territories, with a budget of nearly $354 million in FY2018. It is the largest federal support for emergency feeding organizations and complements other food assistance programs. The Food and Shelter Program, funded at $120 million in FY2018, provides food through shelters, food banks, and pantries for homeless individuals. The USDA's Commodity Supplemental Food Program, funded at $238 million in FY2018, distributes monthly food packages to low-income elderly individuals. The report discusses the TEFAP program's administration, eligibility rules, funding structure, role in disaster response, and recent reauthorization efforts. Appendices list TEFAP expenditures, legislative history, and funding by state. According to USDA's Economic Research Service analysis, 5.9 million households used food pantries and 726,000 used soup kitchens in 2017. Feeding America estimated 15.5 million households accessed their network in 2013. Data on emergency food assistance usage is likely underestimated due to certain limitations in the surveys. Food insecurity is common among households using emergency feeding organizations, with approximately 65% of them being food insecure in 2017. Roughly half of these households experienced very low food security, leading to disrupted eating patterns. Nationally, the percentage of households experiencing food insecurity was 11.8% in 2017, down from a recent high of 14.9% in 2011. Data on the number of TEFAP recipients specifically are not available due to the transient nature of participation. In 2017, 11.8% of households experienced food insecurity, down from 14.9% in 2011. Those using food pantries had lower incomes and more children. Individuals using meal programs were often single-person households and more likely to be homeless. Emergency feeding organizations serve as a safety net for those ineligible for federal assistance programs like SNAP. Among households using feeding organizations affiliated with Feeding America's network, 55% reported receiving SNAP benefits in 2013. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) is administered by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), responsible for allocating aid to states and coordinating the distribution of commodities. FNS collaborates with USDA's purchasing agencies to fulfill orders for commodities. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) collaborates with FNS and AMS to purchase bonus commodities at USDA's discretion. These commodities are delivered to state distribution points, often nonprofit-run warehouses. FNS oversees states' TEFAP operations by reviewing and approving state plans. States must submit plan amendments for approval when necessary. TEFAP is administered at the state level by an agency designated by the governor or other State executive authority. States commonly house TEFAP in health and human services, agriculture, or education departments. State agencies are responsible for creating eligibility criteria, selecting recipient agencies, distributing commodities and funds, and overseeing recipient agencies. States maintain state TEFAP plans with program and eligibility rules. Federal regulations allow states to delegate responsibilities to recipient agencies. States can delegate responsibilities to recipient agencies, such as warehousing and transportation to food banks. They must review recipient agencies regularly and address any deficiencies found. Recipient agencies eligible for TEFAP aid are required to follow set eligibility rules. Recipient agencies eligible for TEFAP aid, known as \"recipient agencies\" in the Emergency Food Assistance Act, include public or nonprofit organizations that administer emergency feeding organizations, charitable institutions, summer camps, child nutrition programs, nutrition projects under the Older Americans Act, or disaster relief programs. Emergency feeding organizations (EFOs) receive priority and the majority of TEFAP aid, defined as organizations providing food assistance to relieve emergency situations for needy individuals. These include food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and similar entities. Recipient agencies responsible for distributing TEFAP foods must adhere to program rules, including safely storing food, complying with food safety regulations, maintaining records of received commodities and households, and restricting unrelated activities at distribution sites. Recipient agencies distributing TEFAP foods must adhere to program rules, including restrictions on unrelated activities at distribution sites and eligibility guidelines set by states. Eligibility rules vary for organizations distributing commodities directly to households and those providing prepared meals. States must establish income-based standards for households receiving foods directly, but not for individuals receiving prepared meals. Federal assistance through TEFAP is primarily provided to needy individuals receiving prepared meals. States have the authority to set higher standards for eligibility, including considering socioeconomic data. Income eligibility for households receiving TEFAP foods directly varies by state, with many states limiting it to 185% of poverty. Some states also use categorical eligibility based on participation in other programs. States may impose additional eligibility rules, such as requiring identification or proof of residency, but length of residency cannot be a criterion according to federal regulations. Federal assistance through TEFAP is primarily provided in the form of USDA-purchased domestic agricultural products (\"USDA Foods\") and cash support for administrative and distribution costs. Roughly half of the funding for TEFAP's commodities is an appropriated entitlement, while the other half is provided by separate USDA budget authority for \"bonus\" commodity purchases. TEFAP's administrative funds require an annual appropriation, with $289.5 million for entitlement commodities and $64.4 million for administrative costs in FY2018. In FY2018, USDA allocated $289.5 million for TEFAP's entitlement commodities and $64.4 million for administrative costs. The funding for TEFAP commodities is authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act, with additional amounts provided annually since FY2015. The total amount for bonus commodities purchased and distributed for TEFAP in FY2017 was $268.6 million. In FY2017, $19 million was appropriated for TEFAP's entitlement commodities, with states allowed to convert a portion of funds into administrative funds. States converted $22.9 million out of $29.7 million in eligible funds. Bonus commodities are purchased at USDA's discretion using separate budget authority. In FY2017, USDA purchased $268.6 million in bonus commodities for TEFAP through the Section 32 and Commodity Credit Corporation accounts, which are funded by customs receipts to support the farm sector. In recent years, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and Section 32 have been used to finance TEFAP commodities. The CCC has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to support U.S. agriculture, while Section 32 is less limited in the types of commodities it can provide for TEFAP, including meats, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and seafood. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) collaborates with the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and CCC to determine TEFAP purchases, seeking input from state and local agencies. USDA purchases agricultural products for TEFAP based on market conditions, state preferences, and recipient needs. These products include meats, eggs, vegetables, soup, beans, nuts, peanut butter, cereal, pasta, milk, and juice. Bonus foods are selected by USDA based on market conditions, with some foods requiring refrigeration. States and recipient agencies can request entitlement commodities from a list of USDA Foods. In FY2017, bonus foods provided by TEFAP included Alaska pollock, apples, beans, blueberries, cranberries, eggs, figs, grape juice, peaches, pears, plums, raisins, and turkey. A 2012 USDA study showed that TEFAP foods are nutritious, scoring 88.9 out of 100 on the Healthy Eating Index compared to 57.5 for the average American diet. These foods supply a significant portion of fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, dairy, oils, and recommended solid fats and sugars for a 2,000-calorie diet. TEFAP also covers costs for processing and storing foods. TEFAP provides funds for state and agency costs related to processing, storing, transporting, and distributing USDA-purchased commodities, as well as administrative costs for eligibility determination, staff training, and recordkeeping. The Emergency Food Assistance Act authorizes $100 million annually for administrative costs, with $64.4 million provided in FY2018. Additionally, up to $15 million can be appropriated for TEFAP infrastructure grants, although no funds have been allocated since FY2010. Administrative funds must be distributed to states, with at least 40% to be passed on to recipients. In FY2017, states converted $260,250 of administrative funds to food funds. TEFAP's expenditures on administrative costs, entitlement commodities, and bonus commodities are displayed in Figure 3 from FY1983 to FY2018. Originally, bonus foods were the only commodities in TEFAP, serving as a means to dispose of government-held stockpiles. Since FY1989, bonus foods' value decreased as federal acquisitions declined, and commodities purchased for TEFAP became the program's main commodities. Expenditures rose in FY2009 and FY2010 due to additional funding from the ARRA. Funding for TEFAP's entitlement commodities increased with the 2008 farm bill. Spending on commodities has varied between $500 million and $650 million since FY2011, allocated based on poverty and unemployment rates. The USDA calculates each state's share of TEFAP commodities and funds based on poverty and unemployment rates. States can carry over extra food or administrative funds for one fiscal year. States must match any administrative funds not allocated to emergency feeding organizations. Most states use 90% to 100% of their administrative funds. In TEFAP, states must match administrative funds not allocated to emergency feeding organizations. States also reported supplying additional state funds to support the program. There is a maintenance of effort requirement to maintain funding levels for recipient agencies. States can distribute USDA Foods to disaster relief organizations during declared disasters. TEFAP foods are used for disaster response in various states after hurricanes. USDA replenishes TEFAP foods used for disaster assistance. Congress may appropriate additional funds for TEFAP for disaster relief purposes. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provided $24 million in supplemental funding for TEFAP commodities for disaster-affected areas. The 2018 farm bills include TEFAP provisions to extend funding. Both versions of H.R. 2 include TEFAP provisions, extending funding for entitlement commodities through 2023. The House bill establishes a \"Farm-to-Food-Bank Fund\" to distribute $20 million for procuring excess fresh fruits and vegetables, while the Senate bill creates \"Projects to Harvest, Process, and Package Donated Commodities.\" The Senate bill proposes $4 million in mandatory funding for states and recipient agencies to harvest, process, or package commodities donated by agricultural producers for emergency feeding organizations. It also requires state agencies to include plans for input on commodity preferences, issue guidance on minimizing food waste, and reauthorize $15 million annually for TEFAP infrastructure grants through FY2023. TEFAP began in 1981-82 as a temporary expedient to dispose of excess federally held food commodities. It was established in response to reductions in federal food assistance programs and concerns over hunger and homelessness during an economic recession. The Reagan Administration started distributing excess food commodities in 1981-1982, which were termed \"bonus\" commodities. Congress later provided legislative authority in 1983 for TEFAP. In 1983, Congress established the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) to reduce federal commodity stocks, provide food assistance for low-income individuals, and support emergency food aid providers. Initially, TEFAP only required funding for distribution costs, but as commodity holdings decreased in the late 1980s, Congress made additional provisions. In the late 1980s, Congress established the practice of providing federal funds to buy food commodities for donation through TEFAP, ensuring a minimum level of support regardless of federal commodity holdings. This was mandated in the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, with funding starting at $120 million for FY1989. Additionally, a separate mandatory program was created to buy commodities for soup kitchens and other organizations, with funding starting at $40 million for FY1989. In the 1990s, a separate program was established to ensure federal food donations reached shelters and soup kitchens, rather than just food pantries. The 1990 omnibus farm bill made funding for TEFAP and soup kitchen programs discretionary, dependent on annual appropriations decisions. The authorizing law for TEFAP, the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983, has been amended multiple times. The Emergency Food Assistance Act (EFA) of 1983, amended multiple times, underwent significant changes in 1996 with the passage of the farm bill (P.L. 104-127) and welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). These changes consolidated TEFAP and soup kitchen programs, mandated annual funding of $100 million for food commodities, and extended funding authority through FY2002. The Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 underwent significant changes in 1996 with the passage of the farm bill and welfare reform law. Annual funding of $100 million was mandated for food commodities through FY2002, ensuring a minimum level of commodity support for TEFAP. This change set aside $100 million in \"entitlement\" appropriations under the Food and Nutrition Act to purchase TEFAP commodities, with the majority of funding now coming from this source unless additional money is appropriated by Congress. The Food and Nutrition Act appropriation is used for commodities under the Emergency Food Assistance Act, with additional funding needed for administrative and distribution costs."
