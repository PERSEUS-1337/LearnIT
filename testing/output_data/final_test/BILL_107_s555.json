    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mercury-Safe Seafood Act of 2001\". Congress finds that mercury pollution from various sources continues to contaminate waterways, leading to mercury accumulation in fish as methylmercury. Methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cause serious damage to the human central nervous system, especially in pregnant women and young children, putting thousands of newborns at risk for adverse effects each year in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration's outdated action level of 1.0 parts per million for methylmercury in fish does not adequately protect pregnant women and young children, according to scientific evidence. The EPA recommended a much lower methylmercury consumption limit of 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day in 1997. The National Academy of Sciences confirmed that the EPA's methylmercury limit is scientifically justifiable for public health. The General Accounting Office highlighted inadequacies in FDA guidance on methylmercury in seafood. Many states have issued mercury advisories for inland waterways and health warnings for fish caught in those areas. Some states have issued mercury advisories for commercial seafood, including fish caught in waterways. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include tolerance for methylmercury in seafood, specifically addressing seafood that contains unsafe levels of methylmercury. The Secretary must establish a tolerance for methylmercury in seafood within a year of this section's enactment. The tolerance must be based on health risk analysis and ensure no harm from aggregate exposure to methylmercury. Seafood with excessive methylmercury is deemed unsafe unless within tolerance limits. Special consideration is given to pregnant women, infants, and children. The Secretary will establish a sampling system for seafood to monitor compliance with methylmercury tolerance, ensuring no harm to pregnant women, infants, and children. The Secretary will establish a sampling system for seafood to monitor compliance with methylmercury tolerance, avoiding duplication of effort with other sampling systems. Additionally, a national public education program will be implemented to inform the public about methylmercury in seafood, including federal standards and good practice requirements. The Secretary will provide information to promote public awareness, understanding, and acceptance of standards related to mercury. Health professionals will receive information to improve diagnosis and treatment of mercury-related illness. The Secretary will also give advice to consumers and others to achieve the goals of this section. The Secretary will work with appropriate entities to develop and distribute advisories about methylmercury in seafood, create standardized formats for advisories, and include State and local advisories in the national public education program. SEC. 4. CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.\n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services will consider the National Academy of Sciences' findings on methylmercury exposure and its presence in seafood when implementing section 406A(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $500,000 for sampling under section 406A(e) for fiscal years 2002-2011\n- $500,000 for public education and advisory system under section 406A(f) for fiscal years 2002-2011\n- $2,000,000 for State support to sample noncommercial fish for mercury and produce health advisories for fiscal years 2002-2011. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will distribute funds equitably among states through existing programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress within 180 days on the progress of establishing the required tolerance under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The report will detail the research conducted or reviewed regarding the tolerance."
