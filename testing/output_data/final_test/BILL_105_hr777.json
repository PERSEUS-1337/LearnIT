    "content": "The \"21st Century Scholars Act of 1997\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 introduces Pell Grant guarantees under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The purpose of this section is to establish a program to provide eligible 21st Century Scholars with a legally binding promise to cover the costs of attendance at an eligible institution with the maximum authorized Pell Grant for up to 4 years. Eligible Scholars are students who completed the uppermost grade at a qualifying elementary school and were residents of the school attendance area during that school year. The program aims to provide eligible 21st Century Scholars with a commitment to cover attendance costs at an eligible institution with the maximum Pell Grant for up to 4 years. Upon notification from a qualifying elementary school, the Secretary will inform eligible students and their parents/guardians about the grant. The Pell Grant covers attendance costs at eligible institutions and is a legal obligation of the United States. Students and parents/guardians are obligated to meet Pell requirements at the time of admission to postsecondary education. The Secretary provides annual notices restating the commitment to eligible students and their parents/guardians. The Pell Grant program requires a written commitment from students and parents/guardians, including a statement of the maximum Pell Grant authorized, notification of the Secretary's records, and instructions for updating information. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to these commitments. The commitments under subsection (c) guarantee eligible Scholars an amount equal to the greater of the maximum Pell Grant available for the academic year they are seeking payment or the year they are first notified. The guaranteed amount for any academic year cannot exceed the Scholar's cost of attendance at the institution they are enrolled in. The Pell Grant awarded under this section is not subject to reduction based on expected family contribution or any other limitation. Eligible Scholars must file applications for payments of commitments, and payments will be made according to regulations set by the Secretary. The Pell Grant disbursements are regulated by the Secretary to cover tuition, fees, and housing costs. TRIO eligibility is extended to 21st Century Scholars, and talent search mentoring is also addressed in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include special mentoring programs for eligible 21st Century Scholars and early intervention services for identified scholars.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include mentoring programs for 21st Century Scholars and evaluation of the program's impact by the Secretary of Education. The evaluation will measure the impact of the Program on Pell Grant participation by low-income individuals, educational attainment of 21st Century Scholars compared to control groups, and changes in social behavior such as teenage pregnancy, drop-out rates, and juvenile detention/incarceration rates."
