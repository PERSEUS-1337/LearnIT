    "content": "U.S. and French economies share similarities in terms of GDP, population, and workforce structure. The U.S. has the world's largest economy with a GDP of $14.3 trillion, while France is the sixth largest economy with a GDP of $2.9 trillion. Both countries have a majority of their workforce employed in services and a small percentage in agriculture. France's economy relies more on state intervention compared to the United States, especially in sectors like education, healthcare, energy, telecommunications, and transport. The French government implements policies to support national champions, influence mergers, screen foreign investments, and maintain personal relationships between business leaders and civil servants. Despite these differences, France is moving towards privatization and deregulation to comply with EU mandates and reduce budget deficits. President Sarkozy's efforts to create \"national champions\" in key sectors like nuclear power, energy, and defense have weakened the French government's interventionist capabilities. Despite promoting market-oriented reforms to boost economic growth, the French economy is predicted to decline by 3.5% in 2009 due to the global economic crisis. Sarkozy aims to support domestic companies, protect key sectors from foreign ownership, and stimulate employment through business and investment support measures. Trade unions are expected to push for more direct benefits for workers to ease social tensions. President Sarkozy's center-right government faces a challenge in balancing social tensions while cutting bureaucracy and promoting competition. Despite differences in the state's role in the economy, U.S.-French merchandise trade is significant, with a $14.8 billion deficit for the U.S. in 2008. The trade is concentrated in similar industries, with $42 billion or 57% being intra-industry trade. In 2008, $42 billion or 57% of U.S.-French bilateral trade occurred in major industries such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, electrical machinery, and plastics. This trade involves similar products being exported and imported by both countries, with a significant portion being intra-industry trade between parent companies and their affiliates. Multinational companies like Michelin and General Electric engage in intra-firm trade, accounting for around 50% of total trade turnover. The United States and France have a significant trade relationship, with a focus on intra-industry and intra-firm trade in major industries like aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment. In addition to merchandise trade, both countries also engage in a large and growing trade in services such as tourism, education, finance, and insurance. France is the most visited country in the world, with the U.S. exporting $18.4 billion in services to France in 2007. France ran a $1 billion surplus in services trade for the first time, while the United States tends to run small surpluses in services. In recent history, the United States tends to run small surpluses in services trade with France, affecting the merchandise trade balance only modestly. Foreign direct investment and activities of foreign affiliates are seen as the backbone of the commercial relationship, with U.S.-owned companies in France and French-owned companies in the U.S. outweighing trade flows by almost five times. French companies sold $258.9 billion of goods and services to U.S. consumers in 2006, while U.S. companies sold $236.0 billion to French consumers, totaling $494.9 billion in sales. In 2006, the combined sales between U.S. and French companies totaled $494.9 billion, with only 18% coming from international trade. The majority of sales were from U.S. and French foreign affiliates operating in each other's countries. France was the eleventh largest host country for U.S. foreign direct investment, while the U.S. was the top foreign investor with investments valued at $65.9 billion. French companies had direct investments in the U.S. totaling $147 billion, making France the fifth largest foreign investor. French-owned companies operating in the United States had total assets of $777 billion in 2006, with manufacturing accounting for 44% of investments. The total gross product of these companies was $59 billion, equivalent to the gross national product of countries like Morocco, Ukraine, and Vietnam. French affiliate sales in the U.S. reached $207 billion in 2006. French affiliate sales in the U.S. totaled $207 billion in 2006, significantly higher than French exports to the U.S. French-owned companies employed 496,000 workers in the U.S. in 2006, with the top states being California, New York, and Texas. In 2006, U.S. affiliates in France had 651,300 employees, with 40% in manufacturing. French companies spent $3.3 billion on R&D in the U.S. France follows EU trade policies, leading to few trade disputes with the U.S. The U.S. trade and investment with France is mostly non-controversial, but issues like agriculture, government intervention, and the war in Iraq have caused tensions. Agricultural trade disputes have been a major point of contention, with the Common Agricultural Policy being a key problem according to the U.S. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been a longstanding issue in U.S.-France trade relations. The U.S. argues that the CAP distorts global agricultural trade, while the EU claims it has been reformed. Tensions arise from EU restrictions on market access, export subsidies, and domestic income support programs. France's agricultural sector is affected by these disputes. France's agricultural sector, the largest in Europe, benefits significantly from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), receiving about 20 to 25% of CAP outlays totaling around $40 billion annually. The French position, shared by other EU members, influences the European Commission's stance on agricultural issues, impacting negotiations such as reducing subsidies and trade barriers in the WTO Doha round. This stance has also complicated settlement of disputes, including issues like expanded trademark protection. The French government's interventionist and regulatory tendencies have made settlement of disputes more difficult, with expanded trademark protection and a ban on hormone-treated beef. Despite significant reform and privatization, France continues to influence corporate activity more than the U.S. President Sarkozy supports this policy tradition, leading to potential bilateral disputes. The urgent need to raise revenues through privatization efforts also plays a role in French government intervention. The French dirigiste tradition is weakening due to EU laws and the urgent need for privatization and market-oriented reforms. The government has reduced its stakes in large companies like Air France-KLM, France Telecom, Renault, and Thomson. Despite ongoing privatization efforts, the government still maintains a strong presence in sectors like power, public transport, and defense. The French government promotes national champions and \"economic patriotism\" to resist foreign takeovers. Efforts include strengthening French takeover laws, scrutinizing foreign investments, and creating national champions in industries like nuclear power and defense. President Sarkozy is exploring mergers involving Areva, Thales, and Safran to protect French interests. President Sarkozy supports interventionist policies to enhance France's economic strength and promotes market-oriented domestic reforms. Important labor reforms were implemented during 2007-2008, including extending the 35-hour work week. Increased competition is seen as a way to boost France's economy, but further reform efforts have been delayed due to the economic crisis. Trade disputes between allies during the Cold War era raised concerns about weakening political and security ties. During the Cold War era, trade disputes between allies raised concerns about weakening political and security ties. However, tensions over divisions on Iraq did not significantly impact sales of French products in the US, with imports of wines, perfumes, handbags, and cheeses increasing from 2003 to 2008. The French market share of these products also either increased or remained stable during this period.

Imports of wines, perfumes, handbags, and cheeses increased from 2003 to 2008, with the French market share of these products either increasing or remaining stable. The euro's substantial weakening during this time frame required strong U.S. demand for these products. While there are signs of public support for expressing opposition to foreign policy disagreements, a substantial economic backlash is unlikely due to high economic integration. Effective boycotts could jeopardize thousands of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic."
