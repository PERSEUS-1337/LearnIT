    "content": "The EPA Administrator signed a proposal to strengthen the NAAQS for particulate matter on June 14, 2012, in response to health concerns. The proposal was a result of a court order and has sparked controversy and national debate. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on June 29, 2012, initiating a nine-week public review. The EPA initiated a review of the PM NAAQS in June 2012, following a court order. The proposal was open for public comment until August 31, 2012, with public hearings held in July. The final decision on the PM NAAQS is expected by December 14, 2012, based on scientific studies and recommendations. In 2006, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson proposed tightening the current standard for fine particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM 2.5) based on scientific evidence, including options for new secondary standards to address visibility impacts in urban areas. The proposal would not modify standards for inhalable coarse particles smaller than 10 microns or PM 10. The agricultural community and some Members are particularly interested in EPA's consideration of PM 10 and its potential impacts on agricultural operations. The final designation of areas as nonattainment for revised PM standards would be determined by the end of 2014, with states having until at least 2020 to achieve compliance. EPA estimated that strengthening the PM 2.5 annual standard would provide similar health benefits as the 2006 PM NAAQS. Tighter standards may lead to higher health benefits but could also impose additional compliance requirements and economic costs on communities, states, and industry. The EPA anticipates that existing federal regulations will help meet proposed PM standards by 2020. Recent EPA regulations have faced scrutiny in Congress, particularly regarding the Clean Air Act and greenhouse gas emissions. NAAQS decisions have significant health and cost implications. The EPA's proposed changes to the PM NAAQS in June 2012 have raised concerns in Congress due to health and cost implications. Members have expressed concerns and proposed legislation in anticipation of potential changes. The report summarizes the proposed changes and compares them to previous standards. Key actions leading up to the proposal and potential issues associated with strengthening the PM 2.5 annual standard are highlighted. Particulate matter (PM) is one of six principal pollutants regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. PM 2.5 can be emitted directly from various sources or form in the atmosphere from gaseous precursors. This information can be found in CRS reports discussing the 2006 revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Particulate matter (PM) including sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organics occur naturally or as emissions from various sources. PM 10 is an indicator used in the NAAQS to protect from slightly larger inhalable particles associated with dust from roads, industrial processes, agriculture, construction, and biomass burning. Establishing NAAQS represents the EPA Administrator's judgment on ambient pollution levels to protect public health with a margin of safety. EPA is mandated by Congress to set national ambient air quality standards under the Clean Air Act. Under Sections 108-109 of the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to set national ambient air quality standards for pollutants that may endanger public health or welfare. The process for setting and revising these standards involves statutory steps and additional requirements from EPA, executive orders, and regulatory reform enactments. EPA must review the criteria for NAAQS every five years and has revised the PM NAAQS three times to ensure they remain effective. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals remanded EPA's decisions on PM 2.5 standards from October 2006 for further consideration. The decision was in response to petitions challenging certain aspects of EPA's revisions for PM 2.5 and PM 10. The American Lung Association, National Parks Conservation Association, and nine states filed petitions urging EPA to comply with the 2009 remand on PM NAAQS revisions. Lawsuits were filed in 2012 for EPA's failure to review the standards within five years. The D.C. Circuit directed EPA to complete the review by June 14, 2012. The Clean Air Act requires EPA and states to designate areas for compliance with new PM NAAQS standards within three years. States must submit plans outlining how they will achieve compliance. EPA revised the standards in 1997 to focus on PM 10 and introduced standards for PM 2.5 for the first time. EPA and states determine milestones for meeting secondary PM standards through the implementation planning process. The current primary PM NAAQS include annual and daily limits for PM 2.5, with a three-year average required to meet the annual standard. The 24-hour standards indicate the percentage of time a monitoring station can exceed the standard. The secondary NAAQS for PM 2.5 and PM 10 are set at levels to protect public welfare. Proposed changes in 2012 include adjustments to the PM 2.5 and PM 10 standards. Proposed changes in 2012 to the PM 2.5 and PM 10 standards include strengthening the annual PM 2.5 standard to 12 or 13 \u00b5g/m3, retaining the daily standard at 35 \u00b5g/m3, and maintaining the current PM 10 daily standard. Secondary NAAQS for PM 2.5 and PM 10 would align with the primary standards, with the exception of visibility impairment associated with PM 2.5. The EPA is proposing changes to monitoring regulations for PM 2.5, including setting a distinct secondary standard for visibility impairment based on speciated PM 2.5 mass concentrations and relative humidity data. They are also considering alternative levels and averaging times for the standard. Additionally, the proposal includes updates to monitoring requirements, such as relocating some PM 2.5 monitors to be collocated with measurements of other pollutants in urban areas with a population of 1 million or more by January 1, 2015.

Additionally, the proposal includes updates to monitoring requirements, such as relocating some PM 2.5 monitors to be collocated with measurements of other pollutants in urban areas with a population of 1 million or more by January 1, 2015. The Air Quality Index (AQI) would be updated for PM 2.5, changing the upper end range for the \"Good\" category to the level of the proposed revised annual PM 2.5 standard. The EPA is proposing changes to monitoring regulations for PM 2.5, including setting a distinct secondary standard for visibility impairment based on speciated PM 2.5 mass concentrations and relative humidity data. The Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM 2.5 would be updated, with the upper end range for the \"Good\" category changing to the level of the proposed revised annual PM 2.5 standard. The current upper end for the \"Hazardous,\" \"Unhealthy,\" and \"Very Unhealthy\" AQIs would be retained. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permitting program would be revised to avoid unreasonable delays for permits related to the revised PM NAAQS. Compliance with the revised standards would be required for permits not meeting the criteria once finalized. The Clean Air Act (CAA) includes specific requirements for setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health. The EPA proposed changes to the PM 2.5 annual standard, which was less stringent than recommended by the CASAC. The CAA lays out a multistage process for determining NAAQS, ensuring scientific integrity in setting standards. The Clean Air Act (CAA) specifies criteria for setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health. The process includes preparing a \"criteria document\" summarizing scientific information, review by an independent advisory committee (CASAC), and a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for informational purposes. EPA initiated the current PM NAAQS review in June 2007. The EPA initiated the current PM NAAQS review in June 2007, leading to the publication of the final Policy Assessment in April 2011. The staff paper presented conclusions and recommendations based on scientific evidence and quantitative analyses. The CASAC reviewed EPA's drafts and final documents supporting the science and policy behind the Administrator's decisions. The CASAC reviewed EPA's drafts and final documents supporting the science and policy behind the Administrator's decisions in the June 2012 PM NAAQS proposal. CASAC provided their views on the validity and completeness of the assessments, recommending improvements. CASAC historically signed off with a \"closure letter\" when convinced that each document accurately reflected the science status. The CASAC panel members reached consensus on the scientific basis for regulatory decision-making. The closure letter discontinuance sparked debate within the science community. EPA revised the CASAC review process in May 2009. The April 2011 EPA staff paper supported modifying the PM 2.5 standard. Recommendations were made for the Administrator to consider modifying the current PM NAAQS. The Administrator's decision to strengthen the annual PM 2.5 primary standard was based on various factors, including public comments. The staff paper suggested modifications to the PM 10 standard, but uncertainties and lack of data hindered support for changes. The existing PM 10 standard was provisionally retained due to evidence supporting its protection of short-term health effects. The agency faces challenges in ensuring decisions are based on the latest scientific studies. The EPA is conducting a review of new scientific studies on the health effects of PM since 2009 to ensure the Administrator is fully informed before making a final decision. The EPA is reviewing new studies on the health effects of PM since 2009 to inform the Administrator's decision. This assessment will be included in the rulemaking docket for NAAQS, which sets the process for identifying nonattainment areas and compliance timelines under the CAA. States must submit infrastructure plans within three years of NAAQS issuance to demonstrate basic air quality management components. States must submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to achieve NAAQS standards, including transportation-related emissions allowances and control measures. Transportation conformity is required to ensure federal projects align with air quality goals and do not worsen existing violations. The NSR requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments aim to prevent violations of air quality standards by newly constructed or modified facilities. The June 2012 PM NAAQS proposal would revise the PSD permitting program. The 2012 PM NAAQS proposal aims to revise the PSD permitting program to prevent delays in permits and includes a \"grandfather\" provision for pending applications. EPA regulates NAAQS pollutants through national programs, including regulations for products and activities that emit pollutants and emission standards for new stationary sources. Recent CAA rules, such as those for power plants and diesel engines, are expected to help states comply with the proposed changes. The NAAQS designation process involves states and tribes providing initial recommendations to EPA for areas that do not meet air quality standards. The EPA Administrator has discretion to modify area boundaries after state and tribal submissions. The EPA must notify states and tribes of any modifications to area boundaries, allowing them to provide input, but the final decision rests with the EPA. Monitoring air quality is crucial for determining NAAQS nonattainment designations, with data collected over three years. The network of monitors for PM 2.5 has been developed and modified over time. EPA amended its particulates NAAQS in 2006. EPA amended national air quality monitoring requirements in 2006 to align with revised particulates NAAQS. The modifications aim to improve monitoring technology for particle pollution. Factors like population density, urbanization, traffic patterns, and geography are considered in designating nonattainment areas. States and tribes can provide additional information for these determinations. Nonattainment areas are designated based on pollutant concentrations exceeding standards, including those contributing to exceedances in adjoining counties. Metropolitan areas are often designated nonattainment even if only one county has worse readings. States and tribes must show that excluded areas do not have violations or emission sources contributing to violations. Tightening the PM 2.5 standard in June 2012 is expected to increase the number of designated areas. The EPA's proposed range of concentrations for the PM 2.5 annual standard in June 2012 is expected to increase nonattainment areas, including some counties not previously designated. Final PM NAAQS revisions are expected by December 14, 2012, with state and tribal area designation recommendations due to EPA by December 2013. EPA must make final area designations within one year of receiving recommendations. The EPA is required to make final area designations within one year of receiving state and tribal recommendations, expected by December 2014. Counties with PM 2.5 concentrations exceeding proposed standards based on 2008-2010 data have been identified. Final designations are projected to be effective in early 2015, with nonattainment areas based on more recent monitoring data. The map illustrates potential nonattainment areas for the June 2012 proposed standards based on 2008-2010 data. It shows overlap with existing nonattainment areas for PM 2.5 and additional areas. Final designations of 31 areas in 18 states are expected by early 2015. In November 2009, 18 states with 120 counties were designated as nonattainment for the revised 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 standard. The majority of these counties had previously been identified as nonattainment for the 1997 PM 2.5 standard. Tightening the 24-hour standard led to more areas being designated nonattainment for both the 24-hour and annual standards. Most counties in the US were designated as attainment/unclassifiable and did not need to implement additional emission control measures for PM 2.5. EPA predicted that only a few counties would not be in compliance with the proposed primary standards for PM 2.5 by 2020. Two counties in California and four counties in Alabama, Arizona, Michigan, and Montana are projected to not meet the proposed standards. States are required to submit infrastructure plans within three years of NAAQS issuance. Areas designated as attainment/unclassifiable do not need to improve air quality but must prevent air pollution. Under the Clean Air Act, states must prevent air quality from deteriorating to unhealthy levels and develop detailed control requirements in plans to meet the revised PM 2.5 standards. These plans, known as state implementation plans (SIPs), must be submitted to the EPA within three years of final designations. Failure to comply may result in EPA imposing a plan. States must meet the PM 2.5 standard within five years of the effective date. The EPA must implement the revised PM 2.5 standards within five years of designation, with the possibility of a five-year extension. National regulations and strategies, such as CSAPR and MATS, are expected to aid states in meeting the proposed standards. The EPA faces skepticism and concerns from stakeholders and Congress regarding the expectations and delays of various emissions regulations, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The EPA faced skepticism and concerns from stakeholders and Congress regarding delays in implementing various emissions regulations, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and other remanded rules such as the hazardous air pollutant standards for boilers and cement kilns. The agency has postponed the implementation of certain rules and extended compliance deadlines while considering changes to requirements. Estimates of health and welfare risk reductions and control strategies provide insights into potential impacts of proposed PM NAAQS. The Clean Air Act requires NAAQS to be set based on public health protection, with costs considered during implementation. The EPA is directed to protect public health without considering costs or feasibility when setting NAAQS. However, the EPA released a regulatory impact analysis assessing costs and benefits of setting the PM NAAQS standard. The EPA released a regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12866 and in compliance with guidance from the White House Office of Management and Budget. The analysis presented estimated economic costs, monetized benefits, and net benefits associated with achieving the proposed revisions to the PM NAAQS. Estimated benefits are expected to be at least 30 times greater than the costs for the most stringent option included in the proposal. EPA notes that a full accounting of benefits would include additional environmental and societal benefits not quantified in the analysis. The EPA estimated total costs and benefits associated with achieving the proposed revisions to the PM NAAQS. The analysis focused on health and welfare impacts from reductions in PM 2.5 emissions, with mortality co-benefits representing a significant portion of total benefits. The costs included engineering costs for control technologies, but did not model specific state actions or emerging technologies. EPA anticipates that state and local governments will consider programs best suited for local conditions to meet revised standards in nonattainment areas. There are concerns about potential health risks associated with PM, as well as apprehension about underestimated costs and monetary consequences in the current economic environment. Critics question EPA's reliance on national regulations to reduce burdens, leading to underestimation of impacts. Critics are concerned about underestimating the number of affected areas and associated costs of meeting proposed PM NAAQS. Stakeholders provided evidence and arguments for their recommendations before EPA's 2012 rule revision. Business opposed stricter standards due to economic concerns, while health and environmental groups supported them based on scientific research. Several states petitioned EPA for timely completion of PM NAAQS review in response to a 2009 remand. State regulators recognized the need for health protection from PM but expressed budget concerns. Proponents argue for more stringent standards based on compelling scientific evidence of adverse health effects and continued progress in public health protection. Critics argue that the proposal for more stringent PM NAAQS standards is not justified by scientific evidence, fails to consider recent studies, and imposes excessive costs on the economy. They believe that revising the standards could hinder compliance with existing regulations and impede progress in improving air quality. The EPA's data shows a decline in PM national concentrations from 2001 to 2010. The agency is seeking feedback on its analysis and alternative PM NAAQS. They will consider information from public hearings and new studies. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce also discussed the potential impacts of stricter PM standards. The House Committee on Energy and Power held a hearing on June 28, 2012, regarding the potential impacts of tightening the PM 2.5 NAAQS. Members raised concerns about regulatory costs, economic growth, and employment. Some urged the EPA to retain the PM 2.5 standard as an option. There were also discussions about the potential impacts of tightening the PM 10 NAAQS standards on the agricultural industry. Many Members encouraged EPA to keep the current PM 10 NAAQS standards. EPA to retain current PM 10 NAAQS standards despite concerns from stakeholders and Members about potential changes. Congress considering legislation to delay EPA regulatory action on revising PM 10 NAAQS. The House-passed Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act of 2011 (H.R. 1633) is awaiting action in the Senate. NAAQS decisions have been a significant concern for Congress, especially regarding the PM (and ozone) standards. Congress has held hearings and enacted legislation to address the implementation and review of NAAQS standards, particularly focusing on the potential impacts on public health and the economy. EPA's reassessment and proposed modifications of the PM NAAQS in June 2012 are under scrutiny. The EPA's reassessment and proposed modifications of the PM NAAQS in June 2012 have sparked interest and conflicting concerns among stakeholders and Congress. The scrutiny and oversight are expected to increase as the agency moves towards a final decision by December 2012. The health and economic consequences of particulate matter standards make the PM NAAQS a prominent issue of interest in Congress. More stringent standards could reduce adverse health effects, especially for vulnerable populations like children, asthmatics, and the elderly. Despite the potential benefits for vulnerable populations, concerns remain about the costs associated with tightening the PM NAAQS. Industry and some state representatives fear that stricter standards could lead to more areas classified as nonattainment, requiring new pollution controls and increasing costs for sectors like transportation and industry. EPA's 1997 promulgation of the PM NAAQS faced litigation and challenges, including a Supreme Court decision in 2001. EPA's 1997 promulgation of standards for particulate matter faced challenges, including a Supreme Court decision in 2001. Critics accused EPA of over-regulation, while environmental groups claimed EPA had not gone far enough. The science behind the PM NAAQS was questioned, leading to lawsuits and petitions for more or less stringent standards. Stakeholders continued to advocate for their recommendations, with various groups challenging EPA's revisions of the PM NAAQS in 2006. The D.C. Circuit granted petitions in part regarding EPA's revisions of the PM NAAQS in 2006, remanding the standards for further consideration. Implementation is ongoing, with final revisions expected after receiving comments on the June 2012 proposal. Potential delays in designating nonattainment areas and states' SIPs may occur due to possible challenges after the agency promulgates final standards in December 2012. The EPA has agreed to issue final revised PM NAAQS by December 14, 2012, as part of the D.C. Circuit's decision and a related Consent Agreement. The timeline for milestones is based on statutory requirements under the CAA and milestones identified in the June 29, 2012, Federal Register. The CAA does not specify a timeframe for states to meet secondary PM standards."
