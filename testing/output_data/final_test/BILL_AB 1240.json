    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that children who eat school breakfasts have improved cognitive function, academic achievement, and behavior. 2.2 million low-income pupils in California miss out on school breakfasts each day, impacting a total of 4.3 million public school pupils. Serving breakfast after the start of the schoolday improves participation, yields fiscal benefits, and enhances the learning environment by reducing absenteeism and disciplinary issues. The federal School Breakfast Program provides essential resources to low-income pupils in California, with potential for $344 million in additional federal meal reimbursements. Increasing participation in the program positively impacts the state's economy by distributing funds to school districts and boosting local employment. High-need schools should make breakfast readily available during the schoolday for academic, health, and fiscal benefits. Section 49550 of the Education Code is amended to ensure that school districts provide free or reduced-price meals to needy children in grades K-12, except for family day care homes which will be reimbursed for 75% of meals served. School districts or county offices of education can use funds from federal or state programs to provide meals to students, including the School Breakfast Program and National School Lunch Program. They must provide breakfast to students in grades K-12. From July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, schools with at least 40% needy children must offer breakfast daily. From July 1, 2017, this applies to schools with 40-60% needy children. From July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018, schools with at least 60% needy children must comply with specific requirements. From July 1, 2018, schools with 60-80% needy children must provide a nutritionally adequate breakfast for sale or free after instruction begins. If over 80% of pupils are needy, breakfast must be offered at no cost. No pupil is required to eat. The breakfast provided to needy children at schools must be available after instruction has started. This does not require schools to set aside instructional time for serving breakfast. If the state mandates costs, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts."
