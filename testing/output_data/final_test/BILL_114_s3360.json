    "content": "The \"Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act of 2016\" authorizes grants to support marginalized youth in accessing sexual health services. The Secretary may award grants to eligible entities to support marginalized youth in accessing sexual health services, including providing information, promoting communication, supporting school-age parents, and training individuals on prevention and healthy relationships. To be awarded a grant under this program, eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary. Priority is given to entities with a history of supporting marginalized youth in accessing sexuality education and those planning to serve youth not covered by Federal teen pregnancy prevention programs. The Secretary cannot award a grant unless the entity has formed a partnership. To be eligible for a grant, entities must partner with a community organization and agree to employ effective strategies for providing age-appropriate, medically accurate, and culturally relevant information to marginalized youth. Annual reports must be submitted to the Secretary for each year of grant funding received. Entities receiving grants must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the use of funds, how it has improved access to sexual health services for marginalized youth, and any other required information. The Secretary will evaluate the effectiveness of a certain number of grants every two years and make the evaluations public. The Secretary will make evaluations and reports public. Funds cannot be used for sexual health services that withhold information, are inaccurate, promote stereotypes, or are insensitive to specific groups. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"community organization\" and \"eligible entity,\" which encompass various entities that offer sexuality education or sexual health services to marginalized youth. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms like \"marginalized youth,\" \"medically accurate,\" and \"scientifically effective strategy\" in the context of promoting sexual health awareness.
