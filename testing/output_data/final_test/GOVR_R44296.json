The resolution does not become law but helps Congress plan the budget. Once agreed upon by both chambers, it can be enforced through points of order and the budget reconciliation process. The Budget Act of 1974 created the budget resolution as an agreement on spending and revenue levels between the House and Senate. Points of order can be raised against legislation violating these levels, with the presiding officer making a ruling based on Budget Committee estimates. Points of order are not self-enforcing, and can be waived by either chamber with varying requirements. The Budget Act of 1974 established the budget resolution as an agreement on spending and revenue levels between the House and Senate. The resolution must include budgetary levels for total spending, revenues, surplus/deficit, new spending categories, public debt, and Social Security (Senate only). Allocations for spending are required among committees, with Appropriations Committees receiving allocations for the budget year and other committees for the entire period covered by the resolution. Sub-allocations by subcommittee must be reported by Appropriations Committees.

Allocations for spending are required among committees, with Appropriations Committees receiving allocations for the budget year and other committees for the entire period covered by the resolution. Subcommittee allocations must be reported to their respective chambers. The Budget Act enforces spending and revenue aggregates, committee spending allocations, and prohibits measures that exceed budget resolution levels.

Subcommittee allocations must be reported to their respective chambers. The Budget Act enforces spending and revenue aggregates, committee spending allocations, and prohibits measures that exceed budget resolution levels. Points of order can be raised against legislation only when it is pending on the House or Senate floor, but they cannot limit direct spending or revenue levels resulting from current law. Congress must pass legislation to alter revenue and direct spending levels to reconcile them with the budgetary levels outlined in the resolution. The budget reconciliation process allows special consideration of legislation to align spending and revenue levels with the budget resolution. Reconciliation directives instruct committees to develop legislation related to direct spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Once developed, the legislation can be submitted for consideration in its chamber or included in an omnibus reconciliation measure. The budget reconciliation process allows special consideration of legislation to align spending and revenue levels with the budget resolution. Reconciliation legislation is eligible for expedited procedures in both the House and Senate. Without an agreement on budgetary parameters, it may be difficult for Congress to reach agreement on subsequent budgetary legislation. The usefulness of multi-year enforceable levels in a budget resolution may be limited due to economic conditions and technical factors. The absence of a budget resolution hinders the Appropriations Committees' ability to allocate spending and use the budget reconciliation process for budgetary changes. This can lead to difficulties in developing and considering individual appropriations measures. The Budget Act requires adoption of a budget resolution before Congress can consider budgetary legislation for the upcoming year. Exceptions and waivers are allowed, with other budget enforcement mechanisms available in the absence of a budget resolution. These mechanisms include chamber rules and spending caps that restrict certain budgetary legislation. In the absence of a budget resolution, Congress may use alternative legislative tools like deeming resolutions to establish enforceable budget levels for the upcoming fiscal year. Deeming resolutions serve as substitutes for a budget resolution when final agreement cannot be reached, allowing Congress to proceed with budgetary legislation. Deeming resolutions are used as substitutes for budget resolutions when Congress cannot reach final agreement. They include budgetary levels and language for enforcement, with adoption dates varying and some years seeing Congress not agreeing on a budget resolution. Deeming resolutions serve as substitutes for budget resolutions when final agreement cannot be reached by Congress. They have varied in form, initially used as simple resolutions but also included in lawmaking vehicles like appropriations bills. Questions may arise about the enforceability of budgetary levels when alternative legislative vehicles are used. Deeming resolutions are used as substitutes for budget resolutions when Congress cannot reach final agreement. The Constitution grants each house of Congress the authority to determine its rules of procedure, including enforceable budgetary levels. This rulemaking principle allows for parliamentary action to waive rules if necessary, even if the rulemaking provision is established in statute. The timing of congressional action on deeming resolutions varies, with resolutions being initiated as needed. Deeming resolutions are used as substitutes for budget resolutions when Congress cannot reach final agreement. They are agreed upon by chambers anticipating difficulty resolving differences. For example, the Senate agreed to a budget resolution for FY1999 on April 2, 1998, and also agreed to a deeming resolution the same day. Similarly, the House passed a budget resolution for FY2007 on May 18, 2006, and agreed to a deeming resolution the same day. Deeming resolutions have also been provided far in advance of potential action on a budget resolution, as seen in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Deeming resolutions are used as substitutes for budget resolutions when Congress cannot reach final agreement. They are agreed upon by chambers anticipating difficulty resolving differences. In the House, deeming resolutions are often included in the same resolution providing for consideration of the first appropriations measure for the upcoming fiscal year. Just as employing a deeming resolution does not preclude Congress from subsequently agreeing to a budget resolution, it also does not preclude Congress from acting on another deeming resolution that either expands or replaces the first deeming resolution. The House passed a deeming resolution for FY2014 in June, but later passed the Bipartisan Budget Act in December, which included a new deeming resolution that superseded parts of the initial one. Deeming resolutions always include specific budgetary levels and are enforceable as if they were in a budget resolution. Variations exist in their content, with some including explicit dollar amounts. The deeming resolution under 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 assigns budget authority and outlays to the Committee on Appropriations. Some resolutions reference budget levels from previous resolutions when no agreement is reached between chambers. Chairs of Budget Committees may file enforceable budget levels in the Congressional Record. The deeming resolution assigns budget authority and outlays to the Committee on Appropriations. Committee chairs are directed to file enforceable budget levels in the Congressional Record, consistent with discretionary spending caps or baseline projections. This process has been used in past budget acts like the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Deeming resolutions assign budget authority and outlays to committees, enforcing budget levels consistent with spending limits. Resolutions may reference a previously adopted budget resolution or include specific levels for enforcement, such as aggregate spending and revenue levels. If no budget resolution is referenced, resolutions typically include levels enforced by points of order. Deeming resolutions assign budget authority and outlays to committees, enforcing budget levels consistent with spending limits. However, deeming resolutions do not always include all required budget resolution details, such as deficit and public debt levels. Congress also uses procedural and statutory budget enforcement mechanisms, like points of order and sequestration, even in the absence of a budget resolution. The House and Senate have various budget-related points of order that restrict different types of budgetary legislation. These points of order are outlined in the Budget Act, House and Senate rules, and past budget resolutions. For example, in FY2017, Congress proceeded with appropriations without a budget resolution or deeming resolution. The House and Senate have budget-related points of order that restrict different types of budgetary legislation. The House Appropriations Committee adopted interim 302(b) sub-allocations for some appropriations bills, while a separate order prohibited floor amendments increasing spending. The Senate has a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rule and the House has a cut-as-you-go (CUTGO) rule to limit deficit-increasing legislation. Numerous other points of order exist to control budget measures. Numerous points of order exist in the Congressional budget process, as detailed in CRS Report 97-865 by James V. Saturno. In addition to points of order, a sequester is a budget enforcement mechanism that automatically cancels previously enacted spending, leading to across-the-board reductions in nonexempt programs. The President issues a sequestration order to enforce statutory budget requirements, such as limits on discretionary spending and deficit increases from new revenue and spending laws. Sequesters serve as a deterrent for Congress to pass legislation violating budget rules. Sequestration is a budget enforcement mechanism used to deter Congress from passing legislation that violates specific budgetary goals. It is currently employed for three budgetary policies, including the Budget Control Act of 2011 which established annual limits on defense and non-defense discretionary spending. If these limits are breached, a sequester will occur, leading to automatic cuts in non-exempt programs to stay within the specified limits. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established limits on discretionary spending and created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to reduce the budget deficit. If specific requirements were not met by January 15, 2012, a sequester would be triggered to enforce the budgetary goal. The sequester is now in effect through 2024. Another enforcement mechanism, the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, ensures new revenue and spending legislation align with budget goals. Statutory PAYGO aims to prevent new revenue and spending laws from increasing the deficit over a 6- or 11-year period. The sequester enforces this by automatically cutting spending if needed."
