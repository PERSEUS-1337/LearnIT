    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Justice and Understanding By IMF Loan Elimination and Equity Act of 2004\" or the \"JUBILEE Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that many poor countries are burdened by international debts, some of which were incurred by dictatorships and not used for the benefit of the population. Jubilee coalitions advocate for full debt cancellation for these countries. The IMF has imposed harsh conditions on poor countries for past loans, and it is deemed just to cancel debts owed to the IMF by eligible poor countries. SEC. 1626 of the International Financial Institutions Act amends Title XVI to allow for the cancellation of debt owed to the IMF by eligible poor countries. The Secretary of the Treasury shall work within the Paris Club, IMF, and other institutions to cancel debts owed by eligible poor countries to promote development and poverty alleviation. The IMF will cancel debts and finance the debt cancellation from its existing operations and accounts. The IMF will cancel debts of eligible poor countries within 1 month of application. Countries encouraged to allocate 20% of budget for basic services. Input from civil society required. Privilege for IMF credit prohibited. The Secretary of the Treasury will work to prevent the IMF from requiring countries to prioritize IMF as a creditor over the United States for new concessional loans. Efforts will also be made to establish transparency in creditor activities within various multilateral development institutions. The Club of Official Creditors, IMF, and other multilateral development institutions are urged to promote transparency in their activities, project design, monitoring, evaluation, implementation, resource allocation, and decision-making. Efforts should be made to allow informed participation and input from affected communities through various means such as translation of information, information technology, oral briefings, and dialogue with community organizations. The Secretary of the Treasury will make available on the Department of the Treasury website the remarks of the United States Executive Director at meetings of international financial institutions, with redactions for sensitive material. The Comptroller General of the United States will prepare and submit a report on the availability of ongoing operations, procedures, and accounts of the IMF for canceling debt of eligible poor countries. The President will submit annual reports to relevant committees on the IMF's activities. The Senate committees will provide a public report on debt cancellation activities, including countries that received, denied, or under consideration for debt cancellation. The Secretary of the Treasury will promote equitable burden sharing among creditors. The Senate committees will report on debt cancellation activities for eligible poor countries, ensuring creditors use their resources for debt reduction without affecting poverty alleviation programs. Eligible poor countries include Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, and others, excluding those with excessive military expenditures. The government of a country may face restrictions if it supports terrorism, fails to cooperate on narcotics control, violates human rights, or lacks free and fair elections (e.g., Haiti). SEC. 1627 prohibits structural adjustment programs under the International Financial Institutions Act. The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with promoting development and poverty alleviation in poor countries by seeking debt cancellation without conditions that worsen poverty or harm the environment, such as implementing user fees on education and healthcare. The curr_chunk discusses the potential negative impacts of increased cost recovery from poor people to finance public services like education and healthcare. It highlights how this could raise the cost of clean drinking water for consumers with incomes below $2 per day and undermine worker rights. The curr_chunk discusses internationally recognized worker rights under the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1995. It requires the President to submit an annual report to Congress on activities and progress made in achieving the section's purposes. SEC. 5 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1995 imposes conditions on providing funds to the IMF, including debt cancellation for eligible poor countries, termination of certain programs, and certification by the Secretary of the Treasury. This does not apply to funds allocated for debt relief to poor countries."
