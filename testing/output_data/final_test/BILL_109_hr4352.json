Modification of circumstances for interment of persons convicted of capital offenses in national cemeteries. Section 2411 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to prohibit interment in national cemeteries for individuals sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish regulations to ensure that individuals are not interred in National Cemetery System unless efforts have been made to determine their eligibility under Federal law. Modification of circumstances for denying interment in military cemeteries and funeral honors for individuals committing capital offenses. The amendment prohibits interment in military cemeteries and denies funeral honors for veterans convicted of committing capital offenses. The Secretary of Defense shall not ensure funeral honors for veterans convicted of capital crimes, and regulations must be followed to determine eligibility for interment in military cemeteries or receiving funeral honors under Federal law. SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF REMAINS OF RUSSELL WAYNE WAGNER FROM ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY. Congress finds that Arlington National Cemetery is a sacred place honoring the service of Armed Forces members. The inclusion of individuals who have committed heinous acts dishonors the cemetery. The removal of such individuals, like Russell Wayne Wagner, is not a punishment but preserves the sanctity of the grounds. The Secretary of the Army will notify next-of-kin before removing Russell Wayne Wagner's remains from Arlington National Cemetery. After removal, the Secretary will arrange reinternment in a public or private cemetery or relinquish the remains to the next-of-kin upon request."
