Congress acknowledges that physical and mental impairments are inherent aspects of human diversity, leading to discrimination when individuals face barriers in society. The use of mitigating measures does not negate the presence of impairments, and the courts have not fully interpreted the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as intended by Congress. The courts have limited the intended reach of the Americans with Disabilities Act, leading to discrimination against individuals with impairments. It is necessary to restore the Act's intent to remove barriers for disabled Americans and allow full participation in society. SEC. 3. DISABILITY DEFINED. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended to define disability as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or a perceived impairment. The determination of disability does not consider mitigating measures or the duration of the impairment. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended to define disability as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or a perceived impairment. The term 'physical impairment' includes disorders affecting various body systems, while 'mental impairment' covers psychological disorders. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to define disability as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or a perceived impairment. The term 'record of physical or mental impairment' refers to a history of misclassification, while 'perceived physical or mental impairment' means being regarded as having an impairment. SEC. 4 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. This includes changing language in section 2(b) and section 102(a) to ensure protection against discrimination. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to include a defense that an individual alleging discrimination may not be a qualified individual as defined in the Act. This defense is applicable in discrimination charges under the Act. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to remove references to \"with a disability\" after \"individual\" in certain sections. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to ensure broad construction of its provisions to achieve the comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability."
