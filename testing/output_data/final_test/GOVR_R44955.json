    "content": "Serbia was part of two South Slavic states for almost a century, including the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Belgrade was the capital, and Serbia was dominant in political, economic, and military affairs. The Balkan conflicts in the 1990s saw Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia declaring independence. Kosovo also fought for independence from Serbia, leading to NATO intervention and a cease-fire in 1999. In 1999, the United Nations Security Council authorized a U.N. mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and a NATO-led force (KFOR) for peace and security. Yugoslavia reorganized as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003. Montenegro gained independence in 2006, becoming the Republic of Serbia. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, leading to tensions with Serbia. While many countries recognize Kosovo's independence, Serbia, Russia, China, and some European nations do not. Tensions persist between Belgrade and Pristina as they negotiate a resolution. Serbia has evolved since the end of Slobodan Milosevic's regime in 2000. Since the end of Slobodan Milosevic's regime in 2000, Serbia has developed into a functioning democratic system, ranking 66th in the 2017 Democracy Index. Domestic tensions persist between pro-Western forces and nationalist groups led by the Serbian Radical Party, who oppose Western orientation and prefer closer ties with Russia. Many nationalists hold resentment towards the West for past interventions in the region. Successive Serbian governments have had to navigate these tensions. Successive Serbian governments have balanced relations with Russia and aspirations for better ties with the EU, US, and NATO. Parties with roots in the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 era opposition ruled from 2000 to 2012, but since then, reformed parties like the SPS and SNS have dominated politics. The SPS, led by Milo\u0161evi\u0107, reformed in the 2000s with a pro-EU stance, while the SNS split from the ultranationalist SRS in 2008 and also adopted a pro-EU platform. The SNS and SPS have governed together since 2012. In March 2014, the SNS-led coalition won a significant victory in the Serbian parliament with 48.4% of the vote and 158 seats. The SNS's Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 became prime minister, while the Socialist Party, with 44 seats, joined as a coalition partner. The government faced criticism for economic stagnation, media control, and democratic backsliding. In April 2016, Prime Minister Vu\u010di\u0107 called early parliamentary elections to secure a stable basis for enacting reforms necessary for EU membership. The SNS-led coalition won the largest number of votes but saw a decline in parliament seats. The SRS, led by Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj, became the largest opposition party with 22 seats. The far-right Dveri party earned 13 seats. In the 2017 presidential election in Serbia, President Vu\u010di\u0107 won with 55% of the vote, amid allegations of campaign abuse. Despite his popularity as a politician who could move the country forward, protests erupted against what was seen as a descent into autocracy. In June 2017, President Vu\u010di\u0107 appointed Ana Brnabi\u0107 as Serbia's first female prime minister, causing tension within the SNS due to her pro-EU views. Despite initial controversy, Brnabi\u0107 has gained the party's confidence and President Vu\u010di\u0107's support. Critics believe Vu\u010di\u0107 will hold the real power in Serbia, despite the presidency's limited formal powers. Serbian civil society and the EU criticized Vu\u010di\u0107 for Serbia's hostile media environment during his time as prime minister. Media coverage of the 2017 presidential election was overwhelmingly positive towards Vu\u010di\u0107, leading to concerns of self-censorship among journalists. Several media outlets faced pressure and harassment for critical reporting, leading to increased intimidation tactics and smear campaigns. In 2017, Serbian media and civil society organizations launched a blackout campaign to protest the media climate in Serbia. Vu\u010di\u0107 has been praised for his technocratic efficiency, flexibility, and pragmatism in politics, with support from center-right and right-wing voters. He has opened 12 of the 35 EU negotiating chapters, positioning him as a reliable partner in the region. Some believe his nationalist background makes him capable of reaching a compromise with Kosovo. Serbia's relations with its neighbors have been tense due to allegations of war crimes committed during the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia investigated and prosecuted cases against individuals from various ethnic backgrounds, with the majority of cases brought against Serbs, leading to resentment among many Serbians. Serbian attitudes towards war crimes were highlighted in October 2017 when Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin expressed pride in those who defended the former Yugoslavia. Russia supported Serbia's stance, criticizing the U.N. war crimes tribunal for bias against Serbs. Kosovo's courts have also prosecuted war crimes, leading to complaints from Belgrade about the treatment of Kosovo Albanians. Kosovo's government established a specialist court in The Hague to prosecute former KLA members, causing tensions with Serbia. Meanwhile, Serbia has been criticized for delays in prosecuting war criminals, straining its relations with Croatia. The legacy of Yugoslav wars strains Serbia's relationship with Croatia, especially over war crimes. Croatian courts tried Serbs for crimes, including a trial in 2018 for 30 Serbs accused of killing 47 Croats in 1991. Croatia blocked EU talks with Serbia twice in 2016 due to historical grievances but lifted objections under EU pressure. Both countries were disappointed by the International Court of Justice's rejection of genocide claims in 2015. The dispute over territory along the Danube remains unresolved. Serbia's dispute with Bosnia over territory along the Danube River remains unresolved. There are also border demarcation disputes at four locations along the Drina River, with Serbia's preferred demarcation potentially shifting infrastructure onto Serbian territory. Tensions between Belgrade and Sarajevo have been fueled by disputes with the Bosnian entity of Republika Srpska, including threats of independence referendums. Serbia has stated it respects Bosnia's territorial integrity and has no intention of incorporating Republika Srpska into Serbia. Serbia's location along the Balkan Route has made it a corridor for trafficking weapons, narcotics, and people. It became a land route for refugees and migrants during Europe's recent migration crisis, with an estimated 1 million passing through in 2015 and 2016. Despite the Balkan Route being closed since March 2016, thousands of migrants and refugees remain stranded in Serbia. The government has not processed many asylum applications and has rejected most cases. Reports in mid-2018 suggested ongoing migrant flows across the region. In mid-2018, reports indicated a resurgence in migrant flows across the Balkans, though not as high as in 2015 and 2016. Serbia addressed deficiencies in its border security by enhancing screening, security measures, and information-sharing with neighboring countries. A Migrant Smuggling Task Force was established in 2016, with support from the U.S. Department of State. Serbia's economy struggled post-2008 financial crisis due to institutional and regulatory issues, poor infrastructure, and an oversized state. Serbia's recent economic growth is attributed to increased consumption and investment, with real GDP growth reaching 4.9% in the first half of 2018. Unemployment has slightly decreased to 12.5%, but youth unemployment remains high at 33%. The country was ranked 48th in the World Bank's Doing Business 2019 report, showing improvement compared to previous years. Serbia has a strong economy with a higher rating than its neighbors, including EU members. Its main exports are machinery, manufactured goods, agricultural products, and chemicals. Belgrade has trade agreements with Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkey, EU, and European Free Trade Association. Turkey, under President Erdogan, has funded projects in the Western Balkans, signing agreements to expand economic ties with Serbia in 2017. Turkish businesspeople are interested in projects involving the TurkStream gas pipeline extension, Serbia's textile and tourist industries, and infrastructure. China and Turkey have made significant investments in Serbia, with Turkey focusing on projects such as the gas pipeline extension and infrastructure development, while China is investing in transportation and infrastructure projects as part of its global strategy. China has reportedly invested over $6 billion in Serbia, with pledges of nearly $9.5 billion for the Western Balkans. These investments target improving rail and highway links between Serbia and neighboring countries, as well as revitalizing aging industrial complexes. The Zijin Mining Group won the tender to invest in RTB Bor, Serbia's main copper mining company. Chinese investments in Serbia have expanded, with agreements signed for various projects including a Belgrade bus manufacturer, an industrial park, and a bypass highway. Despite this, the EU remains Serbia's most important economic partner, accounting for the majority of trade and foreign direct investment. Serbia received 11 billion euros in foreign direct investment from EU member states. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided a $1.2 billion standby loan in 2015, with terms requiring public sector cuts and anti-corruption efforts. Despite initial hesitations, Serbia made progress in meeting the loan conditions, completing the IMF program in February 2018. Continued structural and institutional reforms are emphasized for long-term growth, with a Policy Coordination Instrument approved in July 2018. Serbia's Policy Coordination Instrument, approved in July 2018, aims to facilitate fiscal consolidation and improve public finances. One of Serbia's major challenges is its relations with Kosovo, which it regards as the cradle of its nation and Orthodox Christian faith. Belgrade strongly opposes Kosovo's independence and refuses to recognize it, with the constitution stating that Kosovo is part of Serbia. Serbia is paying nearly $1 billion to international creditors for Kosovo's foreign debt incurred before Yugoslavia's collapse. Serbia strongly opposes Kosovo's independence and refuses to recognize it. Belgrade is paying nearly $1 billion to international creditors for Kosovo's foreign debt incurred before Yugoslavia's collapse. Serbia's diplomatic strategy suffered a setback when the International Court of Justice ruled in 2010 that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not contravene international law. Belgrade has drawn on Russian support to block Kosovo's attempts to gain membership in organizations such as the U.N., Interpol, and UNESCO. Serbia continues to support the de facto autonomy of the four Serb-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo. Despite its nonrecognition of Kosovo, Belgrade entered into EU-brokered talks with Pristina in 2011. In 2011, technical agreements were reached between Kosovo and Serbia on various issues such as mobility, customs stamps, university diplomas, real estate records, civil registries, border management, and regional cooperation. Implementation of these agreements varied. In 2013, a landmark agreement known as the Brussels Agreement was signed, addressing sensitive issues like Kosovo's judiciary and policing. In 2015, the EU brokered technical deals on energy, telecommunications, and the creation of an Association of Serbian Municipalities in Kosovo. Implementation of these agreements has been hindered by political issues on both sides. The energy agreement between Serbia and Kosovo stalled due to political disagreements, particularly regarding the recognition of Kosovo's independence. Tensions rose in 2018 over the failure to draft a statute for the Association of Serbian Municipalities, leading to ongoing disputes between Belgrade and Pristina. Negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina faced challenges in 2018, including the murder of Kosovo politician Oliver Ivanovi\u0107 and the arrest of Serbian official Marko \u0110uri\u0107. These events complicated the dialogue aimed at easing tensions between Serbia and Kosovo. In 2018, Kosovo police faced criticism for using excessive force in the arrest of Serbian official Marko \u0110uri\u0107, leading to tensions between Serbia and Kosovo. President Vu\u010di\u0107 condemned the act as a \"brutal provocation\" and threatened retaliation. Kosovo also arrested five ethnic Serbs, prompting Belgrade to halt talks with Pristina until their release. President Vu\u010di\u0107 visited northern Kosovo in September 2018, further escalating tensions. In September 2018, Serbian President Vu\u010di\u0107 visited northern Kosovo for discussions with Kosovo Serbs, despite facing criticism for praising Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Talks between Vu\u010di\u0107 and Tha\u00e7i were held separately with EU High Representative Federica Mogherini due to the fallout. Kosovo's parliament passed a law to transform the Kosovo Security Force into a national army, causing objections from Kosovo Serb members and concerns from NATO about their involvement in the dialogue. In November 2018, Kosovo imposed a 10% customs tariff on imports from Serbia in response to alleged efforts to block recognition. Talks between presidents Vu\u010di\u0107 and Tha\u00e7i continued, but Vu\u010di\u0107 insisted on the removal of tariffs for further dialogue. Serbian and Kosovo officials have shown a range of tones in the dialogue, being cooperative or combative depending on the audience, with a tendency towards conciliatory tones before external audiences. In summer and early fall 2018, leaders from Serbia and Kosovo discussed border adjustment as a way to normalize relations, which could have significant political costs for both sides. This approach has been met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a potential threat to the fragile peace in the region. Some believe Kosovo may cede four majority-Serb municipalities in the north for diplomatic recognition or territory in Serbia's Albanian-majority Pre\u0161evo Valley. Both sides and Western states oppose redrawing borders on ethnic basis in the Balkans. Nationalist parties in Kosovo and Serbia, NGOs, and factions oppose border adjustment. E.U., U.S., Austria, and other countries are open to proposals, but Germany remains firm. Vu\u010di\u0107 faces opposition from Serbian Orthodox Church, Kosovo's leader faces opposition from prime minister and parliament. Since 2000, Serbia has aimed for EU membership, which hinges on normalizing relations with Kosovo. While most EU states recognize Kosovo's independence, five do not. In 2012, Serbia became an EU candidate, and in 2013, a Stabilization and Association Agreement was signed. Despite progress, Germany opposes border adjustments, which may be necessary for a final agreement between Serbia and Kosovo. Serbia's EU membership negotiations have been ongoing since 2014, with public support slightly decreasing due to enlargement fatigue and the EU's requirement for normalizing relations with Kosovo. Serbia has opened 14 chapters of the acquis and closed two provisionally. In 2018, European Commission President Juncker mentioned the possibility of Serbia joining the EU by 2025. Juncker stated that Montenegro and Serbia could become EU members by 2025, but disagreements over Kosovo's status may delay Belgrade's timeline. EU provides financial assistance to Serbia through IPA, with a funding allocation of \u20ac1.5 billion for 2014-2020. There are around 600 EU-funded projects in partnership with Serbian government, businesses, and civil society. Serbian citizens can travel visa-free to Schengen countries since 2009. Some EU officials criticized Serbia for not joining EU sanctions against Russia. Some criticize Serbia for not joining EU sanctions against Russia in response to Ukraine conflict. EU's stance on Serbia may reinforce Belgrade's feeling of not being fully embraced. EU worries about political instability and influence of third powers in the Western Balkans. EU enlargement seen as key for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region. The EU's main tool for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region is seen as crucial for integrating the Western Balkans post-Brexit. Russia's historical ties to Serbia and the Balkans, especially after the Yugoslav-Soviet split, have influenced their relationship, with Russia supporting Serbia's nonrecognition stance on Kosovo's independence. Russia's influence in Serbia is rooted in popular support, with polls showing most Serbians view Russia as their closest friend. There are over 110 registered NGOs, associations, and media outlets in Serbia with Russian connections. Kremlin-linked media outlets like Sputnik and RT amplify anti-Western narratives in the Balkans. Political and economic ties between Moscow and Belgrade strengthened after the breakup of Yugoslavia. Russia's influence in Serbia has grown stronger since the breakup of Yugoslavia, especially during the 1999 NATO campaign against Serbia. Russia supplies Serbia with all its natural gas, with plans to increase deliveries to 5 bcm by 2021. Russian investments in Serbia's oil and gas industry are significant, with Gazprom holding majority shares in NIS energy enterprise. Moscow reportedly supports Serbian political parties financially and politically, aiming for a neutral military area in the Balkans. Russia's influence in Serbia has strengthened since the breakup of Yugoslavia, with significant investments in the country's oil and gas industry. Observers believe Russia uses its position in Serbia for regional intelligence operations, including alleged involvement in an assassination plot in Montenegro to prevent its NATO accession. Concerns have been raised by U.S. and EU officials about a Russian facility in Ni\u0161, which the Kremlin claims is for emergency humanitarian response training. The Ni\u0161 center in Serbia is suspected of being used by Russia for military and intelligence operations, despite claims of providing emergency humanitarian response training. The US and EU have expressed concerns, with Russia requesting diplomatic status for its staff at the center. The Serbian government denies allegations of hosting a Russian military base at Ni\u0161. In 2017, Russia agreed to transfer fighter jets, tanks, and armored vehicles to Serbia. Serbia is set to receive six MiG-29 fighter jets, 30 tanks, and 30 armored vehicles from Russia, with Serbia covering the cost of upgrading the equipment. There are reports of Serbia's interest in acquiring a Russian air defense system and establishing a facility to repair Russian MIL helicopters, which some view as akin to a Russian military base on Serbian territory. This arms deal has the potential to escalate tensions with neighboring countries like Kosovo and Croatia, although some believe that Serbian commitment to Euro-Atlantic integration is strong. Despite joint military exercises with Russia, Serbia participates in more exercises with NATO and the US. Serbia has a stronger military relationship with NATO and the United States than with Russia. In 2017, Serbian forces had 2 joint exercises with Russia and Belarus, but conducted 13 exercises with NATO members and 7 with U.S. units. Despite occasional tensions, Serbia's relationship with Russia is influenced by pressure from Russia to prevent further NATO expansion into the Western Balkans. Relations with Moscow were strained in 2014 when President Putin canceled the South Stream gas pipeline project, which would have benefited Serbia. Serbia's relationship with Russia has been influenced by the cancellation of the South Stream gas pipeline project in 2014. Belgrade's stance on Ukraine's sovereignty caused some tension with Moscow, but Serbia did not join the EU and the US in imposing sanctions on Russia. In 1999, the US broke off relations with Serbia due to ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, leading to a NATO bombing campaign and the establishment of UNMIK and KFOR for stabilization. Since Serbia's 2000 transition, the United States has viewed a stable, democratic Serbia as essential to Balkan region stability. U.S.-Serbian ties were strained when the U.S. recognized Kosovo's independence in 2008. In early 2016, relations were tense when a Serbian newspaper accused U.S. and U.K. ambassadors of provoking chaos in Serbia. This led to Vu\u010di\u0107 canceling a visit to the U.S. Relations between the United States and Serbia improved after Serbia agreed to allow two inmates from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to be relocated to Serbia. President Vu\u010di\u0107 visited Washington, DC in June 2017 and met with Vice President Mike Pence, addressing concerns over Serbia's relations with Russia. However, relations hit a snag in October 2017 when the U.S. ambassador to Belgrade was accused by the pro-government press. In October 2017, the U.S. ambassador to Belgrade faced accusations of interfering in Serbia's internal affairs, leading to complaints after the visit of U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hoyt Yee. U.S. foreign aid to Serbia has fluctuated in recent years, reflecting budgetary constraints and changing global priorities. U.S. foreign aid to Serbia has varied in recent years, with funding amounts ranging from $14.2 million in FY2014 to $10.5 million in FY2019. The assistance aims to help Serbia integrate into the EU, focusing on economic support, Foreign Military Financing (FMF), and International Military Education and Training (IMET). U.S. foreign aid to Serbia aims to help the country integrate into the EU by supporting democracy, rule of law, economic development, and military relations. American firms like Philip Morris, Coca-Cola, and Microsoft have invested in Serbia. In 2013, Microsoft signed a $34 million software contract with the Serbian government. U.S. technology companies have shown interest in investing in Serbia. Fiat started exporting cars made in its Serbian plant to the United States in 2013. Serbia is a source, transit, and destination country for sex trafficking and forced labor, according to the U.S. Department of State. The Serbian government has made efforts to combat trafficking, but it remains a Tier 2 country due to not fully meeting minimum standards. The Serbian government has made efforts to combat trafficking but has not fully complied with the minimum standards. The U.S. Department of State's 2016 report mentions assistance and training provided by the United States to Serbian law enforcement and security agencies. Congressional interest in Serbia and Kosovo dates back to the conflicts in the Western Balkans from 1991-1999. Congress has established Member caucuses on both Kosovo and Serbia and has held hearings on the Western Balkans. In 2018, the Serbia Caucus in the House commemorated the 100th anniversary of Woodrow Wilson's \"day of prayer\" for Serbia. Discussions on a possible land swap between Serbia and Kosovo have also been raised. Many Members of Congress support Kosovo's independence, reconciliation efforts between Serbia and Kosovo, and EU membership for both countries. The United States has maintained a steady interest in the stability of the Western Balkans and has supported efforts for Serbia and Kosovo to join the EU and NATO. Congress has held hearings on the Balkans and some Members visited the region in 2017 and 2018. The U.S. sees a democratic and prosperous Serbia, integrated into Euro-Atlantic institutions, as crucial for a peaceful Europe. Serbia's relations with Russia and the future of Serbia-Kosovo coexistence have raised skepticism among some Members of Congress. In light of the United States' interest in the stability of the Western Balkans, Congress may focus on U.S. relations with Serbia, Serbia's EU membership negotiations, Serbia-Russia relations, and the Serbia-Kosovo relationship. This could impact closer U.S. cooperation with Belgrade."
