    "content": "Neuroscientists use brain atlases to study brain function and analyze data. The choice of functional brain parcellation impacts models of brain functions. Principles are discussed to guide these choices, considering the meaning and validity of functional brain units. An empirical study is conducted on popular brain-imaging functional parcellations to probe different aspects of functional parcels. Functional units are seen as implementing an elementary operation, similar to layers of an artificial neural network. In an ideal world, a functional brain parcellation would capture units analogous to layers of an artificial neural network. Research is active in defining brain regions that better reflect intrinsic brain structure and functional connectivity models. Different functional atlases derived from fMRI are being investigated for their performance in identifying biomarkers for various traits across subjects. The usefulness of continuously defined nodes in these atlases is highlighted. The best options for functional brain parcellation include ICA-derived modes at low dimensionality and the BASC atlas at higher dimensionality. The Schaefer atlas appears to provide the most useful functional units for higher dimensionalities. The BASC atlas is recommended for building brain-connectivity models. Currently, there is no high-dimensional atlas available for brain parcellation, despite the usefulness of low-dimensional options like ICA-derived modes and the BASC atlas. The challenge lies in capturing actual functional units accurately, especially in regions with well-known functional organization. While fMRI clustering can extract valid parcels, the use of predefined atlases is common due to the complexity of multimodal approaches. These atlases offer a simplified view of brain architecture at a population level, guiding the choice based on their suitability for capturing coherent neural populations amidst measurement imperfections. The choice of brain atlas for analyzing brain architecture should be guided by its suitability for the task, as all atlases are wrong but some are useful."
