    "content": "The \"Private Property Rights Act of 1994\" aims to protect private property from government takings without just compensation, as outlined in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Federal agencies should consider the impact of their actions on private property ownership. The Act emphasizes the importance of private property in the nation's economic and social well-being, and the Federal Government's policy is to minimize takings of private property. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"agency\" refers to an Executive agency as defined under section 105 of title 5, United States Code, including the United States Postal Service but excluding the General Accounting Office. The term \"taking of private property\" refers to any action requiring compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The Congress directs that US policies align with this Act and agencies must certify completion of a private property impact analysis before implementing any action affecting private property. The analysis must state the purpose of the policy or regulation. The private property impact analysis required by Congress includes assessing the potential for property takings, effects on property use and value, the need for compensation, alternative actions to mitigate adverse effects, and estimating costs to the Federal Government for compensation. The Government must compensate private property owners for any reduction in use or value due to policies or regulations. Agencies must make these impact analyses public and provide copies to affected property owners. In proceedings, there is a presumption that the costs and estimates in the analysis are outdated and inaccurate. Private property takings impact analysis may be outdated and inaccurate if it was completed more than 5 years before the action or proceeding, and if costs, values, or estimates have not been updated within the 5-year period preceding the action. SEC. 6. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION: This Act does not limit any rights or remedies under other laws or determine property value conclusively for appraisals or damages. \n\nSEC. 7. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS: No action can be filed in a US court to enforce this Act after 6 years from the submission of the private property taking impact analysis certification.\n\nSEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE: The Act will take effect 120 days after its enactment."
