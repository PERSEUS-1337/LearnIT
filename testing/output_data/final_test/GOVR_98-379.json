    "content": "The Inspectors General (IGs) have four main responsibilities: conducting audits and investigations, providing leadership and recommending policies for efficiency, preventing waste, fraud, and abuse, and keeping the agency and Congress informed. They have broad authority to access records, request assistance, subpoena information, hire staff, and protect employee confidentiality. The Inspectors General (IGs) have broad authority to access records, conduct audits, and investigate suspected violations of federal criminal law. They are responsible for implementing the cash incentive award program for employee disclosures of waste, fraud, and abuse. IGs have reporting obligations to the Attorney General, agency heads, and Congress for their findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The CIA IG must also report to the Intelligence Committees if the Director or Acting Director is the focus of an investigation. IGs have broad authority to access records, conduct audits, and investigate violations of federal law. They report findings to the Attorney General, agency heads, and Congress. IG independence is reinforced through various measures, including protection of budgets and qualifications for appointment. They may conduct reviews at their discretion and are required to report to the Intelligence Committees if the Director or Acting Director is under investigation. The Inspector General Act ensures IGs' independence and neutrality by prohibiting them from taking corrective action or assuming program operating responsibilities. They serve under the general supervision of the agency head and have the authority to initiate audits and investigations without interference, except for a few specified exceptions. Under the IG Act, heads of six agencies can prevent IGs from conducting audits or investigations or issuing subpoenas for specific reasons. They must explain their actions to relevant committees. The CIA IG Act allows the director to stop investigations or audits with notification to intelligence panels. Presidentially appointed IGs have separate appropriations. Under the Inspector General Act, IGs in certain agencies are appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation, and selected based on integrity and relevant experience. The CIA IG and SIGAR have specific criteria for selection. Presidentially appointed IGs have separate appropriations and can only be removed by the President. The process of appointing and removing Inspectors General (IGs) varies depending on the agency. Nominated and Senate-confirmed IGs can only be removed by the President, who must notify Congress of the reasons. In contrast, IGs in Designated Federal Entities (DFEs) are appointed and removed by the agency head, with Congress being notified in writing. The USPS IG can only be removed \"for cause\" with the written concurrence of at least seven of the nine governors. Terms of office vary for different IGs, with the possibility of reappointment. After its parent entity's reconstruction funds are less than $250 million, presidential orders govern coordination among IGs investigating charges of wrongdoing by high-echelon officers. Two councils, governed by E.O. 12805, are the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) and a parallel Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE), chaired by the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Investigations of alleged wrongdoing by IGs or other top OIG officials are overseen by a special Integrity Committee, composed of PCIE and ECIE members and chaired by the FBI representative (E.O. 12993). Other coordinative devices have been created administratively. Statutory offices of inspector general have been authorized in 67 federal establishments and entities, including cabinet departments, executive branch agencies, regulatory commissions, government corporations, and legislative branch agencies. Inspector generals are appointed by the President, entity heads, or operate under separate authority in various units. In response to the 2005 Gulf Coast Hurricanes, initiatives were implemented to enhance the oversight capacity of various inspector general offices. This included the establishment of a Homeland Security Roundtable and a Hurricane Katrina Contract Fraud Task Force, as well as additional funding for the Office of Inspector General in Homeland Security. Additionally, in the 110th Congress, inspector generals were tasked with combatting waste, fraud, and abuse in wartime contracting, leading to the creation of new inspector general offices in various agencies. In the 110th Congress, proposals include requiring IG annual reviews on program effectiveness, establishing IGs for the Judicial Branch and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, and creating an inspector general for the Intelligence Community. Other bills aim to grant statutory recognition to specified OIGs in the Defense Department. Proposals in the 110th Congress aim to increase the independence and powers of OIGs in the Defense Department. Bills like H.R. 928 and 2324 seek to provide specifics on OIG budget estimates, establish a Council of Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency, revise pay structures, and grant law enforcement powers to qualified IGs in DFEs."
