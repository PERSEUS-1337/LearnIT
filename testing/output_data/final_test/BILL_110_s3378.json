The Secretary can withhold all Federal funds under title II to a State educational agency in such cases. Federal funds under title II to a State educational agency may be withheld if the agency reallocates funds in violation of regulations. Local educational agencies that fail to comply with requirements may lose eligibility for additional funds. Conforming amendments are made to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.
