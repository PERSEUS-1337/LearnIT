    "content": "The \"Black Lung Benefits Restoration Act of 1997\" is referenced in this section. It addresses benefit overpayments. The \"Black Lung Benefits Restoration Act of 1997\" addresses benefit overpayments by stating that repayment of benefits is not required if a claim is denied unless fraud was involved. The trust fund will refund payments made as reimbursement, and reimburse operators for denied claims. The Secretary determines eligibility for benefits. The responsible operator must start paying benefits within 30 days of a determination or award. Failure to make timely payments results in the determination or award becoming final. SEC. 3. EVIDENCE. Section 422 (30 U.S.C. 932) is amended to allow up to 3 medical examinations as evidence for benefits claims. The responsible operator and trust fund can each request one medical examination at no cost to the claimant. An administrative law judge can also order a medical examination if there is good cause. The amended Section 422 allows up to 3 medical examinations as evidence for benefits claims. An administrative law judge can order a medical examination if there is good cause, such as when existing evidence is insufficient to determine benefit entitlement. Additionally, records of hospitalization, medical treatment, biopsies, or autopsies can be submitted as evidence. Each party may also submit one interpretive medical opinion. The amended Section 422 allows up to 3 medical examinations as evidence for benefits claims. A request for modification of a denied claim under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act shall be considered as a new claim. The treating physician's opinion is given substantial weight in determining eligibility for benefits. Eligibility for benefits requires a board-certified physician in a relevant specialty to diagnose total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis. A medical examination includes a physical exam and relevant clinical studies. SEC. 4. SURVIVOR BENEFITS. The amendment to Section 422 of the U.S. Code now considers a miner's death as a result of pneumoconiosis if the miner was receiving benefits for the disease or was totally disabled by it at the time of death. Additionally, widows or widowers of miners married for less than 9 months can only receive survivor benefits if they were the parent of the miner's child. The widow or widower of a miner may be disqualified from receiving survivor benefits if they remarry before the age of 50 and cannot receive an increase in benefits due to a remarriage. SEC. 5. RESPONSIBLE OPERATOR. Section 422(h) (30 U.S.C. 932(h)) is amended to include provisions for determining operator liability under the Act. The Secretary must conduct an investigation, provide notice, and hold a hearing to determine if an operator meets the criteria for liability. If a hearing is requested, the decision must be issued within 120 days and is not subject to further review. If a hearing is deemed to be without reasonable grounds, the administrative law judge may assess penalties. The administrative law judge may assess the operator for the costs of the proceeding if a hearing is deemed to be without reasonable grounds (not to exceed $750). SEC. 6. ATTORNEY FEES. Section 422 (30 U.S.C. 932) is amended to allow claimants to receive all reasonable costs and expenses, including expert witness and attorney's fees, if entitled to benefits in any administrative or judicial proceeding. This applies to proceedings related to the claim, whether in administrative or judicial settings. The court will determine and assess reasonable costs and expenses, including expert witness and attorney's fees, incurred by the claimant in a judicial proceeding. If no operator is responsible, the fund will cover these costs. The determination must be made within 60 days of the claimant's petition submission, and payment should be made within 45 days unless a motion to reconsider is filed. The court will assess costs and expenses incurred by the claimant in a judicial proceeding within 60 days. If an operator pays these costs and the claimant is later found ineligible for benefits, the operator will be reimbursed by the fund. Section 28(e) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act applies to individuals receiving these costs. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION.\n\nNo appeal to the Benefits Review Board can be made unless ordered by an administrative law judge. The Secretary of Labor cannot delegate the authority to refuse to acquiesce in a Federal court decision.\n\nSEC. 8. REFILING.\n\nClaims filed after January 1, 1982, but before the effective date of this Act, can be refiled for de novo review after the effective date.\n\nSEC. 9. CONSTRUCTION.\n\nIn case of ambiguity, the legislative history of this Act will be considered controlling in legal proceedings.\n\nSEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATES. The Act and its amendments will be effective from October 1, 1997, with specific provisions for claims filed before or after that date."
