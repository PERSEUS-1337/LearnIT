    "content": "The Act is named the \"Grassroots Campaigning and Election Reform Act of 1993\" and emphasizes reliance on in-state contributions. The Grassroots Campaigning and Election Reform Act of 1993 amends the United States Code to prohibit Senate and House candidates from accepting funds for election purposes from entities outside their state. Contributors must provide evidence of residency, and candidates must verify this information. The Grassroots Campaigning and Election Reform Act of 1993 requires candidates for Congress to maintain records of contributors' home states. Contributors must provide evidence of residency, such as a check drawn from a bank within the candidate's state or a notarized statement for cash contributions over $99. Contributions over $499 require a notarized statement verifying the contributor's name and address. The Grassroots Campaigning and Election Reform Act of 1993 mandates candidates to verify contributors' residency and provide notarized statements for certain contributions. Contributions failing to meet criteria must be returned or donated to charity. Violations result in a $1,000 civil penalty. Members of Congress elected in 1992 must rebate campaign funds to contributors or donate to nonpolitical organizations. Members of the Senate elected in 1992 must rebate campaign funds to contributors or donate to nonpolitical organizations by January 31, 1993. Failure to do so will result in a civil penalty equal to twice the sums involved. Limitations on political action committees include amendments to the United States Code regarding contributions and expenditures. It is now unlawful for banks, labor organizations, or corporations to make contributions to political committees. Additionally, there are restrictions on the use of personal wealth for campaign purposes. Sec. 4. Chapter 2, section 441 of title 2, United States Code, is amended to require candidates for federal office to disclose their intent to use personal funds and family funds exceeding certain amounts for their campaign within fifteen days of qualifying for the ballot under state law. Candidates for federal office are required to disclose their intent to use personal and family funds exceeding certain amounts for their campaign. The disclosure includes information about the candidate's spouse, relatives, and their spouses, as well as the required format specified by the Commission. Waivers on contribution limitations apply if a candidate exceeds the expenditure limits or fails to file the necessary declaration. The limitations on contributions for candidates in federal elections can be waived under certain circumstances, allowing for increased contribution amounts. This applies to individuals running for office in a specific state, with limitations increased to 1000% and 150% of the original amounts for certain subsections. Contributions exceeding these limitations can only be made to candidates affected by the increased levels. The provisions of paragraph (2) no longer apply to a candidate in a primary election if they are not running in any subsequent election in the campaign. Candidates who declare they will not exceed certain expenditure limits but later do so must notify the Commission and other candidates within 24 hours. Any candidate who incurs personal loans for their campaign must not repay them with contributions made after the election date. Candidates are prohibited from using personal funds or incurring personal loans within 90 days before the election or 24 hours after the primary election. Failure to comply may result in a civil penalty. Candidates are prohibited from using personal funds or incurring personal loans within 90 days before the election or 24 hours after the primary election. Violation may result in a civil penalty three times the funds expended. The Commission will enforce compliance with these rules. Candidates are prohibited from using personal funds or incurring personal loans within a specific timeframe around the election. Violation may result in a civil penalty. Sec. 5 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 states that any amount solicited, received, or spent by a political party committee in connection with a Federal election must comply with the Act. This includes activities like voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts. Generic activities such as broadcasting, newspaper, magazine, billboard, mail, or public advertising, and campaign materials identifying a Federal candidate must comply with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Severability clause: If any part of the Act or its amendments is deemed invalid, it will not affect the validity of other provisions or their application to different situations."
