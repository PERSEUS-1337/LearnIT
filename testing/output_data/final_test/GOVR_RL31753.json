    "content": "Noncitizen eligibility in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development programs is governed by Title IV of the PRWORA and Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act. There is uncertainty about how these laws interact, leading to conflicting interpretations of eligible noncitizen categories. Documentation requirements for immigration status vary based on the housing program, applicant's citizenship status, and age. Congress passed PRWORA in 1996, imposing new restrictions on noncitizen eligibility. The PRWORA of 1996 established restrictions on noncitizen eligibility for public benefits, including housing. It created the term \"qualified alien\" for eligible noncitizens, exempted certain programs from restrictions, and imposed more stringent requirements for federal means-tested public benefits. Under PRWORA, qualified aliens, including Legal Permanent Residents, refugees, asylees, paroled aliens, those with withheld deportation, conditional entrants, and Cuban/Haitian entrants, are eligible for federal public benefits. Battered aliens may also qualify if they meet certain criteria. Under PRWORA, qualified aliens, including Legal Permanent Residents, refugees, asylees, paroled aliens, those with withheld deportation, conditional entrants, and Cuban/Haitian entrants, are eligible for federal public benefits. Battered aliens may also qualify if they can demonstrate a substantial connection between the battery or cruelty they experienced and the need for benefits. Nonimmigrants, unauthorized aliens, and aliens with deferred action are not considered qualified aliens. Certain exemptions exist for aliens receiving specific types of assistance. Under PRWORA, certain programs and assistance are exempt from eligibility restrictions for aliens, including emergency programs like soup kitchens and crisis counseling specified by the Attorney General. These programs provide in-kind services at the community level without income or resource conditions for recipients. Nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens are eligible for emergency programs under PRWORA. Former Attorney General Janet Reno specified exempt services for alien eligibility limitations, including short-term shelter for the homeless, victims of domestic violence, or individuals in adverse weather conditions. HUD has released limited information on federal public benefits. HUD has released limited regulations interpreting PRWORA's impact on alien eligibility for housing programs. A 2000 regulation stated that no HUD program is considered a federal means-tested public benefit, with stricter eligibility requirements for qualified aliens. The enactment of PRWORA led to stricter eligibility requirements for qualified aliens in federal means-tested public benefits programs. However, HUD programs are not considered federal means-tested public benefits, so these requirements do not apply. Victims of trafficking are eligible for housing programs to the same extent as refugees under federal and state programs. Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 specifies eligible noncitizens for HUD programs providing rental or homeownership assistance to low-income families. Public Housing and Section 8 vouchers are managed by local PHAs, while other programs are overseen by private property owners under HUD contracts. This predates PRWORA and restricts financial assistance to aliens. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development can only provide financial assistance to aliens who are residents of the United States and lawfully admitted for permanent residence, excluding certain categories such as visitors, tourists, diplomats, and students. This eligibility criteria also includes refugees, asylees, parolees, and individuals granted withholding of deportation. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 requires HUD to provide prorated housing assistance to families with at least one member having eligible immigration status. The eligible aliens for housing assistance are similar to those for federal public benefits, including LPRs, asylees, refugees, and those on the registry. Unauthorized aliens are not eligible for financial assistance under Section 214-covered programs. Both PRWORA and Section 214 allow certain immigrants to be eligible for assistance, including LPRs, asylees, refugees, and parolees. PRWORA specifies a one-year parole requirement, while Section 214 does not. PRWORA includes eligibility for Cuban/Haitian entrants and battered immigrants with a connection between the battery and the need for benefits. Neither statute allows nonimmigrants, unauthorized aliens, or those with deferred action to receive benefits. In the 108th Congress, Senator Christopher (Kit) Bond offered S.Amdt. 224 which aimed to add \"qualified alien\" as eligible for housing benefits under Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, aligning it with PRWORA. The amendment did not make it into the final version of the bill. The Bond amendment aimed to align Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 with PRWORA, making certain aliens eligible for housing benefits. There was confusion over the purpose of the amendment, with concerns about broadening or restricting noncitizens' eligibility. The amendment was not included in the final bill, but the Department of Housing and Urban Development was directed to work with the Department of Justice on technical corrections for qualified aliens who are victims of domestic violence and Cuban entrants. The Bond amendment aimed to align Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 with PRWORA, ensuring certain aliens are eligible for housing benefits. There are conflicting interpretations regarding noncitizen eligibility restrictions, with uncertainty surrounding HUD's stance. One interpretation suggests that noncitizens must not be prohibited from receiving benefits under PRWORA to be eligible for Section 214 programs. For example, parolees in the US for less than a year would be ineligible under this interpretation. Battered immigrants may also face eligibility challenges. The interaction between Section 214 and PRWORA makes alien eligibility requirements for Section 214 housing programs more restrictive than other federal public benefits. PRWORA does not prohibit qualified aliens from federal public benefits, potentially granting them eligibility. Under PRWORA, qualified aliens are eligible for federal public benefits, including Section 214-covered housing programs. HUD regulations require verification of immigration status using the SAVE program to determine eligibility for benefits. Some housing authorities may be using noncitizen eligibility requirements from PRWORA without considering Section 214. HUD's homeless programs, funded under Homeless Assistance Grants, include Shelter Plus Care, Supportive Housing Program, Single Room Occupancy, Emergency Shelter Grants, and Housing for Persons with AIDS. The SRO program is one of the Section 214-covered programs for homeless individuals. The SRO program under Section 214-covered grants provides housing units for homeless individuals with Section 8 rental assistance. Nonqualified aliens are ineligible for the SRO program, but other homeless programs like HOPWA, S+C, SHP, and ESG are not covered by Section 214. HUD has not clarified if homeless assistance programs are considered federal public benefits under PRWORA, potentially making citizens and qualified aliens eligible for benefits if they meet the need. Nonqualified aliens may have access to emergency programs under HUD's homeless assistance programs if the benefits provided meet specific requirements. Formerly homeless individuals in permanent supportive housing pay a portion of their income towards rent. Nonqualified aliens may access emergency programs under HUD's homeless assistance programs without verification of citizenship status. HUD has not provided guidance on which programs qualify as emergency programs exempt from PRWORA requirements. Nonprofit organizations administering HUD programs are not required to verify clients' citizenship status, potentially allowing nonqualified aliens to receive services. HUD has published guidance on verifying immigration status for homeless programs not governed by Section 214, creating uncertainty around benefits for nonqualified aliens. Mixed families' eligibility status is unclear due to lack of verification guidance. Other HUD needs-based housing programs differ from Section 214-covered programs, primarily funding nonprofits, states, and local governments to assist low-income individuals and communities. Other HUD needs-based housing programs, such as Section 202 for the Elderly, Section 811 for the Disabled, Community Development Block Grant, and HOME Investment Partnerships, are administered by nonprofits, states, and local governments. These programs may be subject to PRWORA restrictions on noncitizen eligibility, but it is unclear if they qualify as \"federal public benefits.\" HUD has not provided guidance on this issue. HUD has not issued guidance on which types of assistance under other needs-based housing programs are considered \"federal public benefits\" under PRWORA's noncitizen eligibility restrictions. If PRWORA restrictions apply to these programs, citizens and qualified aliens may be eligible for benefits if they meet need standards. Nonqualified aliens are not legally eligible for housing benefits from these programs. Unlike Section 214-covered programs, there are no regulations requiring citizenship verification for other HUD needs-based programs, potentially allowing nonqualified aliens to receive benefits. Nonqualified aliens may be receiving housing benefits from other HUD needs-based programs without verification of their eligibility. Assistance from these programs is often administered through nonprofits, which are not required to verify immigration status. Mixed families' eligibility status is unclear due to the lack of verification guidance. Noncitizen eligibility varies among HUD's programs. Noncitizen eligibility for HUD's needs-based housing programs varies and is determined by PRWORA and Section 214. Documentation requirements for citizens and noncitizens to demonstrate eligibility include a declaration under threat of perjury. PHAs and property owners must verify eligibility for Section 214-covered programs. Citizens are not required to provide documentation. Noncitizens seeking housing assistance must provide documentation of their eligible immigration status, including a signed declaration under threat of perjury and proof of age for those over 62. Social Security numbers do not prove citizenship. PHAs may require documentation like a U.S. passport. Other eligible noncitizens must provide documentation from DHS and a signed verification consent form. Noncitizens seeking housing assistance must provide documentation of their eligible immigration status, including a signed declaration under threat of perjury and proof of age for those over 62. Social Security numbers do not prove citizenship. PHAs may require documentation like a U.S. passport. Other eligible noncitizens must provide documentation from DHS and a signed verification consent form. A PHA or property owner may provide an extension of up to 30 days for submitting required evidence. Verification of documents must be done using the SAVE system, with the option to appeal to DHS if information is deemed inaccurate. Temporary assistance may be provided while the alien's status is being verified. Mixed-status families can have eligible noncitizen/qualified alien members receive pro-rated benefits. Noncitizens seeking housing assistance must provide documentation of their eligible immigration status. Social Security numbers do not prove citizenship. Verification of documents must be done using the SAVE system, with the option to appeal to DHS if information is inaccurate. Mixed-status families can have eligible noncitizen/qualified alien members receive pro-rated benefits, but documentation requirements for other needs-based housing programs are unknown. HUD has not issued guidance on how to implement PRWORA restrictions for noncitizen beneficiaries. Funding for housing programs is often administered by charitable organizations, with PRWORA allowing nonprofits to opt out of verifying noncitizen eligibility for federal benefits."
