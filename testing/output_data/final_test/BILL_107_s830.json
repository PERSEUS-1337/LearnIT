More women in the United States are living with breast cancer than any other cancer. Approximately 3,000,000 women in the United States are living with breast cancer, with 2,000,000 diagnosed and an estimated 1,000,000 undiagnosed. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States and worldwide. In 2001, an estimated 233,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United States. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States, with approximately 40,000 deaths each year. A woman in the US has a 1 in 8 chance of developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime, with a new case diagnosed every 2 minutes. Family history is not a significant risk factor, as 90% of women who develop breast cancer do not have a family history of the disease. The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer emphasizes the need for increased research on the role of the environment in breast cancer development. There is a call for expanded federal investment to explore prevention strategies related to environmental factors. To understand the impact of chemicals and radiation on cancer development, multi-generational prospective studies may be necessary. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on research centers focusing on environmental factors related to breast cancer. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Centers of Excellence for multidisciplinary research on environmental factors linked to breast cancer. Grants will be awarded based on recommendations from the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Panel. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Panel, appointed by the Secretary, consists of 9 members, including 6 physicians and health professionals from various disciplines and regions in the United States. Members are not government employees and come from different practice or research settings. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Panel, appointed by the Secretary, consists of 9 members, including 6 physicians and health professionals from various disciplines and regions in the United States. The panel includes individuals experienced in biomedical review and representatives of individuals who have had breast cancer. Nonvoting, ex officio members may also be appointed as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The members select a chairperson from among themselves, and the panel meets at least once a year. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Panel oversees grant peer review process, makes funding recommendations, and collaborates with community organizations. Centers must collaborate with local community groups, including those representing women with breast cancer. The Director of the Institute coordinates centers and provides reports as needed. The Institute coordinates information among centers, requires collaboration among institutions, scientists, and health professionals, and supports centers for up to 5 years, extendable after review. The Director of the Institute coordinates information among centers, requires collaboration, and supports centers for up to 5 years, extendable based on peer review recommendations. The geographical distribution of centers should be equitable, and innovative approaches must be used to study unexplored areas of the environment and breast cancer. $30,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2007 for this purpose."
