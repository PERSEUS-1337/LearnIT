The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies plans and executes the swearing-in ceremony and hosts an inaugural luncheon for the President and Vice President at the U.S. Capitol. The 2017 committee was authorized by the 114th Congress in February 2016. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, appointed by the Speaker of the House, is responsible for organizing the inauguration of the President-elect and Vice President-elect of the United States. The committee's history dates back to 1901 when it was established for President William McKinley's inauguration. Prior to 1901, the Senate supervised inaugural ceremonies, but the House took on this responsibility due to its structure as a new legislative body each Congress. The House did not challenge the Senate's supervision of inaugural ceremonies until 1901 when a Joint Inaugural Committee was established. The committee was created to address concerns of discrimination against certain House Members in the planning of ceremonies. In 1885, House Members felt discriminated against for being seated at the rear of the inaugural platform. Representative Mills proposed a resolution to boycott the ceremonies, but it was rejected. In 1889, Representative Blanchard raised the issue again of House Members being given an \"inferior position\" at the inaugural ceremonies. In 1889, Representative Blanchard raised concerns about the unequal seating arrangements for House Members at the inaugural ceremonies compared to Senators. He proposed a resolution to address the issue, highlighting the disparity in honor and dignity between the two groups. The resolution was adopted but not communicated to the Senate. In 1889, Representative Blanchard raised concerns about unequal seating arrangements for House Members at inaugural ceremonies compared to Senators. He proposed a resolution asserting the House's right to equal share in arrangements with the Senate. The issue resurfaced in 1901, with Representative John Dalzell proposing modifications to the funding resolution for inaugural ceremonies. In 1901, Representative Henry H. Bingham introduced a resolution for a joint inaugural committee consisting of three Senators and three Representatives, appointed by the Senate President pro tempore and House Speaker. The Senate agreed to appropriation language approved by the House, along with the resolution for the committee. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies was authorized for the 2017 inauguration, with a resolution creating the committee consisting of 3 Senators and 3 Members of the House of Representatives. They are responsible for making arrangements for the inauguration of the President-elect and Vice President-elect on January 20, 2017. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, authorized for the 2017 inauguration, consists of 3 Senators and 3 Members of the House of Representatives. They are responsible for arrangements for the inauguration on January 20, 2017. The committee can utilize government equipment and personnel, accept gifts, and appointments are made by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. Reappointment is necessary for committee members due to an intervening election between initial appointment and the inaugural ceremony. Senate membership on the Joint Inaugural Committee is appointed by the President of the Senate, typically including the chair and ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and the Senate majority leader. House membership on the committee is appointed by the Speaker of the House. Since 1901, House membership on the Joint Inaugural Committee is appointed by the Speaker of the House, typically including the Speaker, House majority leader, and minority leader. In case of changes due to reelection, resignation, retirement, or death, the Speaker appoints a replacement. During the 89th Congress, the Speaker appointed Representative Gerald R. Ford to replace Representative Charles A. Halleck on the Joint Inaugural Committee. The committee chair has traditionally been a Senator, but in recent decades, the chairmanship has rotated between the chambers. The chairmanship of Joint Inaugural Committees has historically rotated between the chambers, with Senators typically holding the position. However, there have been instances where House Members have chaired temporary inaugural panels. Table 3 shows the chairs of the Joint Inaugural Committee from 1901 to 2017, highlighting that for many inaugurations, the chair of the Senate Committee on Rules or Rules and Administration also chaired the Joint Inaugural Committee. On some occasions, Senators from different institutional positions have chaired the committee. The 1901 Joint Inaugural Committee chair, Senator Marcus A. Hanna, was the chair of the Senate Committee on Relations with Canada in the 56th Congress. Senator Hanna was a close political confidant of President William McKinley. Senator John C. Spooner represented the Committee on Rules on the Joint Inaugural Committee. Senator George H. Moses chaired the Joint Inaugural Committee in 1929 and was the third-ranking Republican on the Committee on Rules. Senator Frederick Hale, also a member of the Committee on Rules, was on the Joint Inaugural Committee as well. The 1933 inaugural committee was complicated by the 1932 election, switching Senate control from Republicans to Democrats. Senator Joseph T. Robinson, previously a minority member of the Committee on Rules, became majority leader for the 73rd Congress. Senator George H. Moses, chair of the Committee on Rules, was also on the inaugural committee. Senator Frederick Hale was the second-ranking Republican on the committee. Senator Styles Bridges succeeded Senator Carl T. Hayden as chair of the Joint Inaugural Committee for the 83rd Congress after the Republicans assumed control of the Senate in 1953. Senator Bridges also served as President pro tempore of the Senate and chair of the Appropriations Committee in the same Congress. Senator Hayden continued to serve on the Joint Inaugural Committee after relinquishing his chairmanship. Senator Bridges never served on the Committee on Rules and Administration. Senator Styles Bridges returned as chair of the Joint Inaugural Committee for President Dwight D. Eisenhower's second inauguration, despite being the only Republican appointee in the majority Democratic party. Senator Theodore F. Green also served on the committee. Senator John J. Sparkman later chaired the committee for President John F. Kennedy's inauguration, having previously served on the committee for Eisenhower's second inauguration. Senator Carl T. Hayden, another Democratic member, also served on the committee. In 1957, Senator Everett M. Dirksen became the Senate minority leader and chair of the Joint Inaugural Committee. Senator B. Everett Jordan represented the Committee on Rules and Administration. In 1980, party control in the Senate switched from Democrats to Republicans, with Senator Claiborne Pell as the new chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration. Mark Hatfield, chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration, was chosen as the new chair of the Joint Inaugural Committee in 1981. The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 2 to expand the committee's membership to four Senators and four Representatives. Hatfield, along with Senators Howard H. Baker, Robert C. Byrd, and Claiborne Pell, were part of the committee. The party controlling the Senate during inaugurations was not always the same as the President-elect's party in various years. In the history of Joint Inaugural Committees, members from the Senate minority party have often chaired the committee, except for two instances. The committee has always been chaired by a Senator and has included members from the Senate Rules Committee or the Committee on Rules and Administration. The Joint Inaugural Committee, established since 1947, is responsible for federal elections, including the inauguration costs. The committee's jurisdiction is defined by Senate rules, granting authority over expenses like Capitol Police security. Unlike before 1947, committee responsibilities are now specified in Senate rules, with no provision for specialized staff. The Joint Inaugural Committee, established since 1947, is responsible for federal elections, including inauguration costs. Congress approved funding resolutions for the inauguration between 1901 and 1992, covering expenses for the official ceremony on Capitol Hill and public order in the District of Columbia. Funds were used for constructing the inaugural platform, seating arrangements, and reimbursing entities for expenses. Only since 1996 have funds included specific language authorizing reimbursement to the Senate Committee on Rules. The resolution for the 2009 inauguration authorized reimbursement to the Senate Committee on Rules for staff assisting in inaugural preparations. Prior to 1996, appropriations did not specify the use of Rules and Administration staff. William Cochrane served as both staff director of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee and executive director of the Joint Inaugural. The Joint Inaugural Committee, responsible for inaugural activities, coordinates with the President-elect's committee for the swearing-in ceremony and luncheon at the U.S. Capitol. President Thomas Jefferson was the first to be inaugurated at the Capitol in 1801. The presidential and vice presidential oath of office is usually administered at the U.S. Capitol. The inaugural platform is overseen by the Joint Inaugural Committee and can accommodate over 1,600 people, including dignitaries and former Presidents. The platform is built from scratch for each inauguration and is fully ADA compliant. Since 1981, the inaugural ceremony has been held on the West Front Steps of the Capitol. The inaugural ceremony was moved to the West Front Steps of the Capitol in 1981 to accommodate more visitors. Following the ceremony, a luncheon is hosted by the Joint Inaugural Committee in National Statuary Hall, featuring cuisine reflecting the new President and Vice President's home states. The tradition of the luncheon dates back to 1897, with a multiple course meal and a specific painting displayed behind the dais. For example, President Obama's 2009 inauguration featured the painting \"View of Yosemite Valley\" by Thomas Hill. The House and Senate, through the Joint Inaugural Committee, organize and implement the arrangements for the 2017 presidential and vice presidential inauguration at the U.S. Capitol. The swearing-in ceremony will be held on the West Front Steps with special events in the Rotunda and Emancipation Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center."
