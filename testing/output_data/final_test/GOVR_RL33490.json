    "content": "On December 8, 2006, the House passed legislation to grant Vietnam permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status as part of a comprehensive trade bill. The bill was coupled with a tax-extension bill and passed by the Senate on the same day. President Bush signed the bill into law on December 20, 2006, proclaiming PNTR for Vietnam on December 29, 2006. The legislation also included provisions regarding Vietnam's accession to the World Trade Organization. Vietnam's accession package, approved by the General Council, includes bilateral agreements ratified by the National Assembly on November 28, 2006. The United States played a significant role in this process, with an agreement signed on May 31, 2006, paving the way for Vietnam to join the WTO on January 11, 2007. This agreement was the final and most challenging step in Vietnam's negotiations with twenty-eight WTO members. The U.S. Congress did not have a direct role in Vietnam's accession to the WTO, as no approval was required for the bilateral agreement to go into effect. However, Vietnam's accession will require adherence to WTO rules in bilateral trade relations, including not imposing unilateral measures like quotas on textile imports. Congressional indirect involvement was through Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, governing trade relations with communist states. Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 prohibits the President from granting most-favored-nation (MFN) status to countries unless certain conditions are met. Vietnam needed to be removed from Title IV coverage for the President to grant unconditional MFN status. Congressional debate on granting Vietnam permanent NTR status raised concerns about the impact on the U.S. textile industry and other aspects of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship, including human rights issues. Vietnam's accession to the WTO provides protection in trade relations with the US and participation in DDA negotiations. PNTR from the US enhances predictability in trade relations and normalizes foreign policy with Vietnam. It also aligns the US with Vietnam's major trading partners. Vietnam's membership in the WTO requires adherence to multilateral trade rules, subject to challenges by the US and other members. The report covers the US-Vietnam economic relationship, WTO accession, Jackson-Vanik amendment, and PNTR issues. Diplomatic and economic relations between the US and Vietnam improved significantly in the mid-1990s after a long freeze post-1975. Since the mid-1990s, US-Vietnam diplomatic relations have normalized, with a focus on economic ties. A bilateral trade agreement (BTA) was signed in 2001, extending mutual MFN (NTR) status. However, negotiations over Vietnam's WTO accession and US anti-dumping duties have strained trade relations. Since signing the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) in 2001, Vietnam has implemented various economic reforms, including passing new laws, reducing red tape, and promoting transparency. The decision to sign the BTA helped break the logjam in economic policymaking and led to a new consensus in favor of reform. Since signing the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) in 2001, Vietnam has made progress in implementing economic reforms, including allowing party members to engage in private business. The government's efforts to meet WTO goals have spurred bureaucratic action, although some U.S. industry officials have raised concerns about delays in implementing concessions, especially in the services sector. Despite criticisms, Vietnam passed laws in 2005 to address these issues, with the belief that Hanoi is striving to fulfill its BTA obligations. The Bush Administration has refrained from harshly criticizing Vietnam for delays, attributing them more to capacity constraints than protectionist motives. Since signing the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) in 2001, Vietnam has seen significant growth in bilateral trade with the United States, with trade increasing from $1.4 billion to over $7.6 billion from 2001 to 2005. The majority of this growth has been due to increased U.S. imports of apparel products from Vietnam. U.S. firms are also the largest source of foreign direct investment in Vietnam, with FDI increasing by an average of 27 percent per year from 2002 to 2004. Despite this, U.S. exports to Vietnam have seen modest growth since 2003. U.S. exports to Vietnam have been modest, mainly in aircraft, but have fallen since 2003. Clothing imports from Vietnam have been a major issue for U.S. apparel manufacturers, with a sharp rise in imports totaling $2.7 billion in 2005. Apparel now represents about 40% of total U.S. imports from Vietnam, compared to 4.3% of total U.S. clothing imports in 2005. Since 2001, Vietnam's apparel exports to the United States have increased rapidly, surpassing China. Vietnamese apparel exports continue to rise, indicating competitiveness in the market. Vietnam is the sixth largest exporter of apparel to the United States, alongside India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. Mexico's apparel exports to the United States have decreased since 2001. Vietnamese apparel exports to the United States have grown significantly since 2001, with outer garments accounting for a majority of the total exports in 2005. The United States imports minimal non-apparel textile products from Vietnam, and U.S. apparel exports to Vietnam are less than 1% of imports from Vietnam in 2004 and 2005. The surge in clothing imports from Vietnam to the United States post-2001 was due to the granting of conditional normal trade relations status to Vietnam, leading to a significant increase in apparel exports. A bilateral textile agreement was negotiated in April 2003 to maintain quotas on Vietnam's clothing exports. Vietnam was placed on the \"Special 301 watch list\" by the Bush Administration for poor protection of intellectual property rights. The BTA required Vietnam to align its IPR regime with WTO standards by the end of 2003. The United States Trade Representative's 2006 report highlighted Vietnam's progress in establishing IPR protection laws, but enforcement remains weak with high piracy rates. U.S. trade losses from Vietnam piracy were estimated at $42.8 million in 2005. Despite increased U.S. aid to Vietnam since 1991, enforcement of IPR protection remains a challenge. U.S. assistance to Vietnam increased significantly from around $1 million in 1991 to an estimated $60 million in FY2005, with a focus on health-related aid, particularly for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. Vietnam is eligible for increased funding under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Some Members of Congress have tried to tie non-humanitarian aid increases to Vietnam's human rights record. \"Normal trade relations\" status is used for fair treatment in trade. In practice, imports from countries with NTR status have lower duty rates compared to non-NTR countries, giving them a price advantage. The Trade Act of 1974 established the Jackson-Vanik amendment to restore MFN status to communist countries, excluding Poland and Yugoslavia. The Jackson-Vanik amendment also denies NTR status and access to U.S. financial facilities to countries that deny their citizens certain rights. The Jackson-Vanik amendment allows the President to waive freedom-of-emigration requirements for countries if it promotes the objectives of the amendment. The President must confirm compliance with these conditions in semiannual reports to Congress, with a possibility of congressional disapproval. The President can grant NTR treatment to countries subject to annual renewal and congressional disapproval. A bilateral agreement must be in place for NTR status, with fast-track consideration for approval. President Clinton granted Vietnam a waiver in 1998, which has been upheld. Disapproval resolutions failed from 1998 to 2002, and were not introduced in 2003-2005. The waiver gave Vietnam access to Export-Import Bank. In 2000, a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) was signed between the United States and Vietnam, which went into effect in 2001 after approval by Congress and Vietnam's National Assembly. Conditional NTR status for Vietnam was granted on December 10, 2001, under the President's waiver authority. Cuba and North Korea do not have NTR status, while Belarus and Turkmenistan have conditional NTR status. Other countries like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan have conditional NTR under the full compliance provision of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Vietnam was granted PNTR on December 29, 2006, which does not directly impact U.S.-Vietnam trade relations as Vietnam already had conditional NTR. PNTR provides predictability for U.S. businesses conducting business with Vietnam. Vietnam's status as a \"nonmarket economy\" under U.S. antidumping laws remains unchanged despite PNTR. PNTR in Vietnam provides predictability for trade relations with the United States, eliminating annual reviews and politically symbolizing a higher level of relations. The Jackson-Vanik requirements are seen as outdated Cold War relics, reflecting a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards former adversaries. Vietnam's WTO accession process started in 1995 and is set to officially join on January 11, 2007, with 149 member countries. The WTO, with 149 member countries, was established in January 1995 to administer trade agreements. GATT, founded in 1947, evolved into the WTO with China and Taiwan joining in 2001 and 2002. The WTO, with 149 member countries, was established in January 1995 to administer trade agreements. China, Taiwan, Armenia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Cambodia, Nepal, and Saudi Arabia joined between 2001 and 2005. Vietnam will join in 2007, and Ukraine is close to completing its accession process. Membership in the WTO commits countries to trade principles like Most-favored nation treatment and National treatment. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ensures that imports are treated no less favorably than domestically produced goods and services. Governments are prohibited from discriminating against imports in the application of laws and regulations. Transparency is also emphasized, requiring government laws and regulations affecting foreign trade to be published and accessible to all. GATT/WTO members have conducted negotiations to lower trade barriers, initially focusing on tariffs and later expanding to include nontariff barriers. The WTO addresses barriers like discriminatory government practices, standards, and subsidies. The Uruguay Round expanded rules to cover trade in agricultural products, services, intellectual property rights, and foreign investment regulations. The Doha Development Agenda began in 2001. The WTO requires member countries to use tariffs instead of quotas for imports. Dispute settlement mechanisms are provided for resolving conflicts between members. The WTO provides a mechanism for settling disputes between members over alleged violations of agreements. Countries can accede to the WTO by meeting requirements outlined in Article XII of the agreement. The accession process starts with a letter to the WTO requesting membership, followed by the formation of a Working Party by the General Council. The WTO forms a multilateral Working Party (WP) when the Ministerial Conference is not meeting to consider membership applications. The applicant submits a memorandum detailing its trade regime, negotiates with the WP for necessary changes, and conducts bilateral negotiations with interested WTO members. The WP's findings are included in a \"Report of the Working Party\" and form the basis for the \"Protocol of Accession.\" The WTO member and applicant negotiate concessions and commitments for trade entry. Bilateral agreements are combined into one document for approval by the General Council or Ministerial Conference. The process duration varies based on legislative changes needed, legislative speed, and applicant's willingness to accept demands. The process of WTO accession involves negotiations between members and the applicant, with the success depending on political will. A 2/3 majority vote is required in the WTO for accession, with a focus on consensus. The process can be lengthy, as seen with China's 15-year application. Vietnam's bilateral agreement with the United States sets conditions for WTO entry but does not require congressional approval. Vietnam's bilateral agreement with the United States sets conditions for WTO entry, including reforms in government subsidies for the textile and apparel industry. The agreement includes an enforcement mechanism for the first 12 months after Vietnam's accession. The United States could seek consultations with Vietnam and if unresolved, involve a neutral WTO arbitrator to determine compliance. If Vietnam fails to comply, the US can re-impose quotas on textile imports for up to 12 months. Vietnam will eliminate tariffs on information technology products upon WTO accession. Vietnam will eliminate tariffs on information technology products, chemical products, aircraft, engines, motorcycles, SUVs, autoparts, medical equipment, scientific equipment, agriculture and construction equipment, wood products, encryption technology, and scrap metals within specified timeframes upon WTO accession. Vietnam has committed to reducing tariffs on 3/4 of U.S. agricultural products to 15% or lower, adhering to WTO agreements on sanitary measures, recognizing U.S. food safety inspections, and allowing imports of certain beef products. Vietnam's bilateral agreement with the WTO includes commitments in services trade such as allowing foreign banks to establish 100%-owned subsidiaries, permitting foreign securities firms to have up to 49% foreign ownership in joint ventures, and granting national treatment to foreign financial firms in all financial services subsectors. Additionally, foreign-owned insurance companies can operate 100% foreign-owned subsidiaries and foreign insurance companies can open direct branches selling non-life insurance after five years of accession. Vietnam's bilateral agreement with the WTO includes commitments in services trade, such as allowing foreign banks to establish 100%-owned subsidiaries, permitting foreign securities firms to have up to 49% foreign ownership in joint ventures, and granting national treatment to foreign financial firms in all financial services subsectors. The agreement also allows foreign-owned insurance companies to operate 100% foreign-owned subsidiaries and foreign insurance companies to open direct branches selling non-life insurance after five years of accession. Additionally, Vietnam has signed 28 bilateral accession agreements, including with the United States, which apply conditions to its trade with all WTO members. The provisions of these agreements were combined to become part of Vietnam's protocol of accession. Vietnam's protocol of accession to the WTO included bilateral agreements and negotiations with the 63-member working party. Concerns over intellectual property rights led to Vietnam passing a new IPR law. Contentious issues arose, such as Vietnam's request for a phased implementation of WTO obligations under the ASCM agreement, which was resisted by working party members. Working party members raised concerns about Vietnam's discriminatory policies towards foreign-owned firms in importing rights, as well as the ban on certain types of printed matter. Vietnam's obligations as a WTO member prevent discrimination among members and between foreign and domestically-owned firms. Vietnam's accession to the WTO will lead to changes in trade relations with the United States. Both countries will be bound by WTO rules, preventing unilateral restrictions on imports. They can use the dispute settlement body to challenge each other's trade practices. This has been a focal point for the improvement of U.S.-Vietnam relations. The improvement of U.S.-Vietnam relations over the past few years was highlighted by President Bush hosting Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai at the White House in June 2005. They discussed moving bilateral relations to a higher level and President Bush supported Vietnam's bid to join the WTO. This move was driven by economic, strategic, and historical factors, with PNTR and WTO accession seen as steps towards broader U.S. trade and foreign policy goals. The PNTR status for Vietnam aligns with the trade policy of the Bush and Clinton Administrations to normalize trade relations with former adversaries. Vietnam's WTO accession could help manage trading relations with the U.S. The U.S. is strengthening trade ties with East Asian countries and ASEAN members, including Vietnam. Vietnam's economic importance to the United States lies in its large developing market, fast-growing economy, low wages, and educated population. This makes it an attractive site for foreign direct investment, especially for U.S. multinational corporations looking to diversify away from China. Vietnam is seen as a promising export and investment opportunity in various sectors. Vietnam is considered an attractive export and investment opportunity in sectors like computer hardware, telecommunications, and energy-related services. U.S. PNTR and support for Vietnam's WTO accession are viewed as tools to achieve foreign policy objectives, including expanding cooperation with a country that has a complex relationship with China. WTO membership is seen as a way to promote pluralism, accountability, and adherence to the rule of law in Vietnam's political system. PNTR also symbolizes a milestone in normalizing relations with Vietnam and moving away from the legacy of the Vietnam war. President Bush attended the APEC summit in Hanoi in November 2006, signaling a move towards greater distance from the Vietnam war legacy. Vietnam's WTO entry is expected to boost its economy, particularly in the clothing industry, with increased exports and FDI. U.S. companies have been significant investors in Vietnam since 1988. Since 1988, U.S. companies have been major investors in Vietnam, with over $2.5 billion in FDI. From 2002-2004, U.S. companies invested more in Vietnam than firms from any other country. Vietnam's dependence on foreign trade, especially with the United States, has increased since the late 1980s. Vietnam's strategy of \"open market industrialization\" includes joining the WTO, signing a BTA with the U.S., and participating in AFTA to become an industrialized country. Vietnam aims to become an industrialized country by 2020 without protectionism or subsidization like the East Asian tigers. Economic reforms are driven by the need to create jobs for over 1 million new labor force entrants annually, crucial for the ruling Vietnamese Communist Party's legitimacy. Despite expected challenges for state-owned and private firms post WTO entry, there is broad support for it in Vietnam's leadership circles. The decision to sign the BTA in 2000 sparked domestic debates on economic policy. Prior to the signing of the BTA, Vietnam experienced political deadlock and infighting over economic reforms. Conservatives feared that rationalization would lead to increased unemployment and undermine the country's socialist foundations. The lack of a paramount leader and consensus-based decision-making style worsened these divisions. The absence of a paramount leader exacerbated divisions in Vietnam, leading to a debate over signing the BTA with the United States. After the agreement, new leaders endorsed reforms at VCP's 9th Party Congress in 2001. The government enacted measures to boost privately-owned businesses, give legal status to the private sector, reduce red tape, increase transparency, and allow party members to engage in private business. Vietnam has embraced deeper integration for the foreseeable future. Vietnam has embraced deeper integration into the global economy as the key to its economic policy. The debate over PNTR and WTO accession raised trade-related issues, including Vietnam's exports of wearing apparel. Vietnam agreed to terminate textile subsidy programs and eliminate WTO-prohibited textile/apparel subsidies upon accession. Vietnam agreed to eliminate textile and apparel subsidy programs by the date of accession, with the possibility of re-imposing quotas if the programs are not eliminated. U.S. textile groups advocated for the extension of import quotas on Vietnam's textile and apparel exports or the implementation of a safeguard mechanism similar to China's accession agreement. Key elements of the China agreement included the right to impose safeguard measures on textiles and apparel until 2008 and a reduction in tariffs on textile and apparel products. The textile industry sought to impose restraints on apparel imports from Vietnam in the future, with streamlined procedures for quicker action. U.S. officials have not committed to addressing this issue in multilateral negotiations. The industry proposed that restrictions remain until Vietnam eliminates export subsidies, which may slow down future increases in clothing exports to the U.S. The expiration of import quotas on textile and apparel products for WTO members in 2005 disadvantaged Vietnam's apparel industry. The U.S. textile industry strongly opposes the bilateral agreement with Vietnam, citing concerns about subsidized imports and unfair competition. Auggie Tantillo, president of the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, criticized the lack of safeguards in the deal due to Vietnam's state-owned textile industry. The U.S. textile industry opposes the agreement with Vietnam due to lack of safeguards. USTR officials argue that Vietnam is not as competitive as China in textile and apparel exports. Senators Dole and Graham initially blocked PNTR for Vietnam over concerns about its impact on the U.S. textile industry. They lifted their holds in September 2006. The U.S. textile industry opposed the agreement with Vietnam, citing lack of safeguards. Senators Dole and Graham initially blocked PNTR for Vietnam over concerns about its impact on the industry, but lifted their holds in September 2006 after the Bush Administration agreed to monitor textile imports from Vietnam and self-initiate antidumping investigations. U.S. retailers and apparel importers supported the agreement, viewing it as a way to access lower-priced merchandise and create a more level playing field. Retailer groups have raised concerns about the initiative to monitor apparel imports from Vietnam and self-initiate antidumping investigations. In response to concerns raised by retailer groups, Senators Feinstein and Smith sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Schwab and Commerce Secretary Gutierrez regarding antidumping investigations. The groups are prepared to withdraw support if their concerns are not addressed, specifically requesting written commitments on how the Commerce Department will consider the impact of Vietnamese imports on apparel makers. Congress has also focused on Vietnam's human rights record in recent years. Vietnam's human rights record has been a focus of Congress in recent years. The country is ruled by the Vietnamese Communist Party, which has relaxed restrictions on personal and religious expression in urban areas but remains more restrictive in rural regions, particularly the Central Highlands and northwestern areas. The government has cracked down on anti-government protests, especially by ethnic minority groups like the Montagnards. In the Central Highlands of Vietnam, clashes between protestors and government forces have occurred since 2001, particularly involving ethnic minority groups, including non-registered Protestant denominations. Despite some improvements in human rights in Vietnam in 2005 and 2006, challenges persist for certain individuals and regions. Government repression in the Central Highlands has decreased since 2004, following violent clashes with Montagnard tribal groups. The State Department's 2005 report labeled Vietnam's human rights record as \"unsatisfactory,\" an improvement from previous assessments. In 2006, Vietnam released prominent dissidents identified by the Bush Administration as \"prisoners of concern\" and committed to repealing its decree allowing detention without trial. However, concerns remain over human rights cases involving Vietnamese-Americans detained during trips to Vietnam, including the arrest of Thong Nguyen Foshee. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice raised Foshee's case with Vietnamese counterparts, leading Senator Mel Martinez to place a hold on the PNTR bill. In September 2005, Thong Nguyen Foshee and six others were arrested in Vietnam for plotting violence against the government. After U.S. concerns were raised, they were brought to trial and sentenced to 15 months in prison. Foshee's daughter reported her release for \"humanitarian reasons\" in November 2006, while the other six defendants remained imprisoned. Vietnam regulates religious activities despite the freedom to worship. The Vietnamese government monitors and restricts religious organizations, requiring them to join officially-recognized groups. Many groups either refuse or are denied permission, making their activities technically illegal. In 2004, Vietnam was designated a \"country of particular concern\" for religious freedom violations. After negotiations with the Bush Administration, some internal changes were adopted. In spring 2005, the US and Vietnam reached a controversial agreement on religious freedom, aiming to improve conditions for people of faith in the Central Highlands. The agreement allowed Vietnam to avoid sanctions for its CPC designation. Despite criticism from human rights groups, Vietnam was removed from the CPC list in 2006 due to positive steps taken since 2004. Vietnam was removed from the CPC list in 2006 due to improvements in religious freedom, including a decline in forced renunciations of faith, release of religious prisoners, and new laws. Some disputed the decision, linking U.S. aid to human rights in Vietnam. President does not certify Vietnam's progress in human rights, but political and security ties with the United States have been expanding. Vietnam's leadership aims to strengthen relations with the U.S., as seen during Prime Minister Phan Van Khai's visit in 2005. Both countries signed agreements and pledged to enhance bilateral relations. Since 2002, U.S. adoptions of Vietnamese children have been halted. Protesters, including Vietnamese-Americans, opposed Prime Minister Phan Van Khai's visit in 2005. Despite initial reluctance, Vietnam has shown increased responsiveness to U.S. entreaties, signing agreements like the IMET agreement in 2005. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld visited Vietnam in June 2006, agreeing to enhance military cooperation and exchanges. During Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's visit to Vietnam in June 2006, discussions included increasing military cooperation through medical exchanges, U.S. de-mining programs, and English language training for troops in peacekeeping missions. The Vietnamese also inquired about acquiring U.S. military equipment. Opposition to granting PNTR to Vietnam may stem from concerns about accounting for U.S. Prisoners of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA), although efforts in this area have increased since the mid-1990s. The Vietnamese authorities have allowed U.S. analysts access to POW/MIA-related archives. Efforts have led to understanding the fate of hundreds of Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina. U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam stated it is unlikely to find live Americans in Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos. Official U.S. policy keeps names on the unaccounted for list until remains are identified. Cooperation on recovering remains was discussed during Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's visit to Vietnam in June 2006. The U.S. and Vietnam are expanding cooperation on recovering remains, potentially using advanced technology. Legislation for permanent normal trade relations with Vietnam was introduced in 2006, but did not pass initially. Rep. Bill Thomas later introduced a bill combining Vietnam PNTR authorization with other trade measures. The House passed H.R. 6406 authorizing trade preferences for Haiti and suspending duties on 500 products. The bill was combined with a tax-extension bill (H.R. 6111) and passed by the Senate. President Bush signed the bill into law (P.L. 109-432) on December 20, 2006. Vietnam completed its WTO membership bid, ratified by the National Assembly on November 28, 2006, and is set to join the WTO on January 11, 2007. On January 11, 2007, Vietnam completed its WTO membership bid and is set to join the WTO. U.S. Imports of Apparel and U.S. Imports from Vietnam of Selected Apparel Items are detailed in appendices."
