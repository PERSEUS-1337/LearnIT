    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Youth Apprenticeship Opportunity Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that a significant proportion of youth in the United States lack necessary skills for entry-level positions, many are struggling in school, the American workplace is evolving, and there is a lack of support programs for youth transitioning to employment. The majority of American workers without college lack necessary skills for employment. Work-based learning is effective for preparing youth for high-wage jobs. Many American youth do not earn college degrees and could benefit from structured job skill training. The US lacks a comprehensive approach to help youth transition to the workplace, leading to declining real wages and increasing wage inequality. The United States faces a choice between becoming a nation of high skills or declining living standards due to global economic competition. To achieve a nation of high skills, there must be a fundamental change in the approach to work, education, and training, requiring collaboration between business, labor, government, and the education community to invest in providing opportunities for American youth. The Act aims to establish a nationally recognized system for youth apprenticeships, engaging businesses in partnerships with education to develop workplace learning sites. It also encourages businesses and labor organizations to participate in youth apprenticeship programs. The Act aims to establish a system for youth apprenticeships, involving businesses in partnerships with education to create workplace learning sites. It also aims to prepare young people for high-wage, high-skilled occupations by improving their basic skills and providing marketable skills through apprenticeship programs. The Act aims to enhance youth apprentices' prospects for immediate employment in positions that offer opportunities for continued education and career development. The Act aims to enhance youth apprentices' prospects for immediate employment in positions that offer opportunities for continued education and career development. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For the purpose of this Act, a youth apprenticeship program integrates academic instruction and work-based learning, provides work-site learning and paid work experience, is offered to 11th-grade students, aims to result in a high school diploma and approved certificate of competency, and may lead to postsecondary education, National Apprenticeship Act programs, or permanent employment. The term \"youth apprenticeship agreement\" is a written agreement between the employer, local educational agency, student, and parent defining their roles. A \"youth apprentice\" is a student at least 16 years old enrolled in a public secondary school participating in a program meeting the Act's requirements. An \"employer\" is any person or organization employing a youth apprentice under a program meeting the Act's requirements. The term \"skilled mentor\" is defined as the individual at the work site who instructs the apprentice and critiques performance. The Act also defines the terms \"State,\" \"State Board,\" and \"local educational agency\" in specific ways. The term \"work-site training\" involves hands-on work under a skilled mentor's supervision, leading to proficiency in an occupational area with financial compensation. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. State program responsibilities and administration are outlined in Section 4. State Boards receiving funds under this Act must make grants to local educational agencies to ensure wide participation among 11th and 12th grade students and develop high-quality youth apprenticeship programs. State Boards are encouraged to designate a higher education institution as a youth apprenticeship research and curriculum center to collaborate with various stakeholders in curriculum development and technical assistance. The Act requires State Boards to provide technical assistance for youth apprenticeship programs and limits administrative expenses to 5% of funds appropriated. SEC. 5. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES. Each local educational agency receiving a grant must implement a youth apprenticeship program integrating academic and work-site training for grades 11 and 12. Career counseling and exploration opportunities must be provided before 10th grade, with the option for additional training in a community or technical college starting in 11th grade. The youth apprenticeship program ensures transferable credits for college, written agreements for students, adequate supervision and training from employers, and a safe workplace. The youth apprenticeship program must adhere to Federal and State health and safety standards, provide instruction for high school diploma requirements, offer the opportunity for an associate degree or skills certificate, ensure financial compensation for work, and establish a local steering committee for program oversight. In designing youth apprenticeship programs, local educational agencies are encouraged to form school advisory committees with vocational and academic teachers, use the tech-prep education program model for academic and technical training, and enhance opportunities for apprentices to enter the workforce. Enhance opportunities for youth apprentices to enter programs leading to an associate degree or certificate in an occupational field or program, using vocational educational and job training funds. SEC. 6. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. The Secretary of Education is responsible for making grants to States for youth apprenticeship programs, establishing an Information Clearinghouse on Youth Apprenticeships, identifying successful model programs, and conducting studies on state implementation. The Secretary of Education is tasked with monitoring the implementation of youth apprenticeship programs, tracking student participation, assessing impact on dropout rates, and addressing any other relevant issues. Recommendations for statutory changes to support successful program implementation are to be made by January 1, 1996, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Education oversees youth apprenticeship programs, ensuring availability for all students, coordinating with other federal programs, providing academic instruction for college readiness, and issuing regulations. Up to 3% of funds can be used for administrative expenses. The Secretary of Labor is responsible for overseeing certain aspects of youth apprenticeship programs, coordinating with other federal programs, providing academic instruction for college readiness, and issuing regulations. The Secretary of Labor provides technical assistance to the Secretary of Education, assists in developing recommendations for congressional committees, and conducts a study on establishing national occupational standards for youth apprenticeships. The study will report on the outcomes of youth apprentices who complete additional postsecondary training. The results will be submitted to relevant congressional committees by January 1, 1995. SEC. 8. INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE ON YOUTH APPRENTICESHIPS. An Information Clearinghouse on Youth Apprenticeships will be established within the Department of Education to house and disseminate information on youth apprenticeship programs. SEC. 9. COORDINATION WITH OTHER FEDERAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. Vocational Education: The Carl D. Perkins Act is amended to include youth apprenticeship programs. A tech-prep education program can be part of the academic and work-based learning for youth apprenticeships. Youth apprenticeship programs under the Carl D. Perkins Act can be merged with Job Training Partnership Act programs for coordination and grants. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 is set at $100,000,000 to carry out the purposes of the Act."
