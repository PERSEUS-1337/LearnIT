    "content": "The \"Federal Employee Tax Accountability Act of 2015\" establishes ineligibility of noncompliant taxpayers for federal employment under Chapter 73 of title 5, United States Code. \"Under the \"Federal Employee Tax Accountability Act of 2015,\" a seriously delinquent tax debt is defined as a Federal tax liability that can be collected by levy or court action, excluding debts being paid under an agreement, debts with pending hearings or relief requests, and debts with continuous levies issued.\" Sec. 7382. Ineligibility for employment states that any individual with a seriously delinquent tax debt subject to levy under section 6331 of the Internal Revenue Code is ineligible for employment in certain agencies, as defined in the section. Individuals with seriously delinquent tax debt are ineligible for employment in certain agencies, and must certify their tax status when applying for a job. The Office of Personnel Management will establish regulations for enforcement, ensuring due process rights are upheld. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will report annually to Congress on the number of exemptions requested and granted under chapter 75. Individuals have 180 days to demonstrate their debt falls under specific categories before being deemed ineligible for employment. Employees facing financial hardship may continue serving if it is in the best interests of the United States. Each agency must review public records to check for tax liens filed against employees or job applicants. If a lien is found, the agency can request authorization to determine if the individual has a seriously delinquent tax debt. The Secretary of the Treasury provides a standard authorization form for agencies to request disclosure of information regarding delinquent tax debt or acts under section 7385(b). Negative consideration is given to those who refuse to comply with such requests. Confidentiality is maintained regarding information obtained under these provisions. Sec. 7385 prohibits the unauthorized use or disclosure of information obtained under this subchapter. It also outlines adverse actions that can be taken against employees who understate taxes or fail to file. Sec. 7385 outlines personnel actions for employees who commit specific acts related to tax evasion, such as failure to file returns or willful understatement of tax liability. Employees facing personnel actions are entitled to certain procedures under regulations by the Office of Personnel Management. The text amends sections 7513 or 7543 of title 5, United States Code, and includes a clerical amendment to the analysis for chapter 73. The Act establishes ineligibility for federal employment for noncompliant taxpayers and outlines procedures for review of public records and confidentiality. Adverse actions are specified for employees who fail to file or underreport taxes. The Act and its amendments will take effect 9 months after enactment."
