Excess contributions are included in gross income for the year they were made. Rollovers are allowed within 60 days to another account for the same beneficiary. Changes in beneficiary are also permitted. Any change in the beneficiary of a Disabled American Financial Security Account is not considered a distribution if the new beneficiary is disabled and a family member of the old beneficiary.
