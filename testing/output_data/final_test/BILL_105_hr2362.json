    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Republican Form of Government Guarantee Act\". Congress finds that the United States must guarantee a republican form of government to the States, but organized criminal actions pose a threat to this. Those upholding the laws have been threatened, leading to a chilling effect on the democratic process. Many are targeted for their views on controversial political issues. The violence stemming from criminal actions is causing a breakdown of law and order in the United States. This increase in violence is partly due to unfounded exaggerations about recent firearms laws and baseless conspiracy theories. The climate of violence created by these criminals threatens to undermine republican government in some States. SEC. 3 amends Section 111(a) of title 18, United States Code to provide protection against assault for officers and employees of State or local government. SEC. 4 introduces increased penalties. Section 111 of title 18, United States Code is amended to increase penalties for assault. Offenders face fines and imprisonment ranging from 2 to 10 years, depending on the severity of the offense. In amendments to title 18 of the United States Code, penalties for interstate communications and mailing threatening communications are increased to a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 5 years. SEC. 5. RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT; ENFORCEMENT. The right to participate in a republican form of State government includes carrying out elected or appointed duties, assisting officials in their duties, and engaging in lawful campaigning activities. The right to participate in political activities includes campaigning, petitioning the government, and exercising constitutional rights. Violations of these rights can be addressed through legal action in federal court. The right to participate in political activities, including campaigning and petitioning the government, can be protected through legal action in federal court. State chief executive officers can seek damages and injunctive relief against organizations violating residents' rights, with the possibility of attorney's fees awarded to the prevailing plaintiff. There is a 5-year statute of limitations for bringing such actions. The 5-year statute of limitations applies to legal actions in federal court for violations of residents' political rights, with the possibility of attorney's fees awarded to the prevailing plaintiff. The Attorney General, in consultation with other departments, will develop a training program for Federal law enforcement to address politically motivated violence. Additionally, Federal payments may be withheld. Federal payments may be withheld if an agency's employees are unlawfully prevented from carrying out duties by employees of a State, county, or local government. The Attorney General can investigate complaints and place payments in escrow under the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act until interference ceases, with rules governing the process."
