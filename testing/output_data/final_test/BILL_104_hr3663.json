The Act also amends section 490(a)(1) to include industrial, water, and sewer facilities within its scope. The term \"water and sewer facilities\" is defined as facilities for water treatment, storage, distribution, wastewater collection, treatment, transportation, storm drainage, and liquid and solid waste disposal. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority Act of 1996 allows for the issuance of revenue bonds for wastewater treatment activities, including water and sewer facilities. The Act also permits the delegation of authority to issue revenue bonds to the Water and Sewer Authority. The Authority Establishment and Department of Public Works Reorganization Act of 1996 grants the Council the authority to issue revenue bonds for utilities facilities, pollution control facilities, and water and sewer facilities. Revenue bonds issued by the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority under this delegation of authority are done through a resolution of the Authority, not the Council. The resolution of the Authority, not the Council, allows for the issuance of revenue bonds for various facilities and improvements, exempting certain expenditures from specific restrictions.

The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority must provide annual budget estimates to the Mayor for inclusion in the budget, with the Council having the authority to comment but not revise the estimates. Independent agencies are exempt from budget reductions. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority is being amended to include the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority established in 1996.
