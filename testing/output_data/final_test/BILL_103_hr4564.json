    "content": "The Act titled \"Fusion Energy Research Accountability Act of 1994\" is referred to as the short title. It includes findings related to fusion energy research. The Congress recognizes the importance of the Federal fusion research program, highlighting the significant investment made by taxpayers over the last 40 years. Fusion energy is seen as a potential long-term, safe, and affordable energy source. While the Department of Energy's focus on the deuterium-tritium fuel cycle and tokamak concept has shown scientific feasibility, concerns have been raised about the cost, radioactivity, and complexity of the tokamak concept for commercial viability. The Department of Energy is urged to support research in alternative fusion concepts due to resource constraints and a reduction in research. Construction of large tokamak devices threatens funding for basic fusion research, leading to a recommendation to terminate planned construction and focus on cleaner, cheaper alternative concepts with potential for viability. The Department of Energy is recommended to focus on cleaner, cheaper alternative fusion concepts with commercial potential. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"commercially viable\" means attracting private sector capital, low operation and maintenance costs, reliability, limited personnel resources, low plant design complexity, low end-of-life costs, acceptable waste emissions, easy to site, and safety. The term \"Department\" refers to the Department of Energy, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will convene a fusion policy advisory panel with diverse representatives to analyze and recommend a plan for the future of US fusion energy research, considering alternative concepts and international agreements. A report to Congress is due within 180 days. The fusion policy advisory panel will issue recommendations to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. UNITED STATES FUSION ENERGY RESEARCH PROGRAM. The Secretary must develop a comprehensive management plan for the US fusion energy research program within 270 days of the Act's enactment. The plan should focus on fusion concepts leading to a commercially viable power system, with specific objectives, cost estimates, and resource requirements. An independent evaluation mechanism will be established to terminate programs not advancing towards commercial fusion power. Reports to Congress will be submitted every 2 years. Every 2 years after the Act's enactment, the Secretary must report to Congress on the progress made in meeting program objectives and schedules outlined in the management plan."
