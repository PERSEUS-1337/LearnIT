Section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974 is amended to exempt certain disclosures required by regulations from the Commissioner of Social Security or the Secretary of the Treasury. Agencies are prohibited from requesting individuals to disclose their social security account number, except as specified. SEC. 4 prohibits government-wide uniform identifying numbers, except as authorized under the Social Security Act. Identifying numbers are defined as any combination of symbols that serve to identify an individual. SEC. 5 prohibits government-established identifiers. Federal agencies are prohibited from establishing a uniform standard for individual identification that must be used by other agencies or private entities. They also cannot require states to adopt such standards in exchange for federal funding. However, this does not apply to transactions between private individuals. The provision prohibits federal agencies from imposing a uniform standard for individual identification on other agencies, states, or private entities for transaction oversight or administrative simplification. Any inconsistent provisions in existing federal laws are repealed. The term \"agency\" refers to an Executive agency as defined in title 5, United States Code. The term \"State\" includes various entities such as States, the District of Columbia, and other territories like Puerto Rico and Guam. The provisions of this Act, along with the amendments made, will be effective starting January 1, 2001."
