    "content": "The United Nations distinguishes two main approaches for protecting Geographical Indications (GIs) at the national level: 1. The public law approach involves enacting legislation for specific GI protection, granting official recognition through a common logo for government protection. 2. The private law approach uses laws against unfair competition and trademark laws for protection based on private actions, with rights for collective use by those meeting defined standards. Geographical Indications (GIs) are protected through various legal frameworks, such as trademarks in the United States and quality schemes in the EU. GIs are also safeguarded by multilateral trade agreements like the WTO's TRIPS agreement, which mandates recognition and protection of GIs as intellectual property. The US and EU countries, as signatories of TRIPS, are obligated to uphold these standards. Under TRIPS, the United States has committed to protecting Geographical Indications (GIs) to prevent misleading the public and unfair competition, especially for wines and spirits. GIs identify a product's origin based on its quality, reputation, or characteristics attributed to its geographical location. The US has previously challenged the EU's GI laws. The United States challenged the EU's GI laws under WTO Dispute Settlement in 1999, alleging discrimination against U.S. GIs and failure to protect U.S. trademarks. A WTO panel ruled aspects of the EU's GI laws were inconsistent with TRIPS, resulting in changes to the EU program. WIPO, a specialized agency in the U.N. system, defines GIs as a sign used on products with a specific geographical origin and qualities or reputation due to that origin. WIPO oversees the \"International Register of Appellations of Origin\" established in the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin. The agreement ensures protection against imitation and was adopted in 1958. The United States is not a party to the agreement, but several EU countries are members. The Lisbon Agreement's multilateral register covers food and beverages, Cuban cigars, and other products with appellations of origin (AO) or geographical indications (GIs). AOs require a link to the geographical environment, while GIs may only need a single criterion of geographic origin. The registry contains over 1,000 products as of May 2016, raising U.S. concerns about recent developments. The Geneva Act under the Lisbon Agreement could expand GI restrictions, raising U.S. concerns. The U.S. opposes the agreement due to objections to GI registration of cheese names. Congressional leaders express disappointment over lack of meaningful participation in the negotiation process. U.S. interests may focus on ensuring fair treatment. The Geneva Act under the Lisbon Agreement may expand GI restrictions, raising U.S. concerns about trademark owners' ability to use generic names in foreign markets. EU regulations on GIs cover agricultural and food products, wine, and spirits, with changes enacted in 2006 following a WTO ruling. EU laws include three quality labeling schemes. EU laws and regulations introduced three quality labeling schemes in January 2013: Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), and Traditional Specialties Guaranteed (TSG) for agricultural products and foodstuffs. These schemes ensure products are linked to specific geographic areas and traditional production methods. Unlike PDO and PGI, TSG focuses on traditional character in composition or production methods. The EU introduced three quality labeling schemes in 2013: PDO, PGI, and TSG for agricultural products and foodstuffs. TSG focuses on traditional character in composition or production methods, with the geographical origin being irrelevant. GIs are used to identify products linked to specific geographic areas, creating value for local communities and supporting rural development. The EU prioritizes protecting Geographical Indications (GIs) to support rural development and create new job opportunities. A 2012 study estimated GI product sales at \u20ac54.3 billion, with wines accounting for over half of the value. Leading EU member states in GI sales include France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, and Portugal. The EU actively advocates for stronger GI protection globally due to concerns about misuse and imitation. EU trade policy seeks \"TRIPS-Plus\" provisions to protect EU names in countries outside the EU and allow coexistence with prior trademarks. The EU prioritizes protecting Geographical Indications (GIs) to support rural development and create new job opportunities. In countries outside the EU, they allow coexistence with prior trademarks (if registered in good faith), phase out other uses of EU names, ensure a right to use, guarantee administrative protections, and create a cooperation mechanism. Over 4,500 product names are registered and protected in the EU for foods, wine, and spirits, with two-thirds being wine registrations. As of May 2016, there were 1,341 product names registered as PDO, PGI, or TSG products for agriculture and food products, showing a 10% increase in registrations compared to two years ago. The breakdown of product registrations shows that half originate in Italy, France, and Spain, with registrations also coming from countries outside the EU. As of May 2016, there were 2,885 registered wine names under the EU's quality scheme, with PDOs for quality wines and PGIs for table wines with geographical indication. Both systems establish geographical names for products originating in specific regions, requiring a registration process and providing intellectual property protections. The majority of EU wine PDO/PGI registrations (about 60%) are from Italy and France, with examples like Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Montagne-Saint-Emilion. Third country GIs make up 40% of registrations, including wines like Napa Valley from the United States. Italy, France, Greece, and Spain have the most registrations. Most wine registrations originate in Italy, France, Greece, and Spain, with third countries like South Africa, Australia, and Chile also holding a significant number. The United States has 700 \"Names of Origin\" registrations due to a 2006 agreement with the EU. There are 332 spirit name registrations, with fruit spirits making up 22% of all registrations. France leads in spirit registrations, followed by Italy, Germany, Spain, and Portugal. Other European and Eastern European countries also have registered product names. In the United States, GIs are treated as brands and trademarks. In the United States, Geographical Indications (GIs) are treated as brands and trademarks, administered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). U.S. trade policy is addressing concerns regarding the EU's GI protections to protect U.S. industries' market access and defend the use of common food names. The U.S. seeks protection for trademarks overlapping with EU-protected GIs and the ability to use U.S. trademarked names in third countries and the EU. GIs in the U.S. fall under common law rights or as trademarks, collective, or certification marks. Trademarks are distinctive signs used by companies to identify products or services to consumers. They can include words, names, symbols, sounds, or colors and can be renewed indefinitely as long as they are used in commerce. Trademarks do not include generic or geographical terms and can be registered for 10-year terms. Certification marks and collective marks are used in commerce to certify the origin, quality, or characteristics of goods or services. GIs, as defined by PTO, are indications that identify a good. GIs, defined by PTO, are indications that identify a good's geographic origin and are protected under U.S. trademark laws. They serve as source-identifiers and guarantees of quality, similar to trademarks. Establishing a product based on its geography can be complicated, involving establishing a trademark or brand name through an extensive advertising campaign. Limited information specific to food and agricultural products regarding the application process on certification or collective marks is available from PTO. PTO does not protect geographic terms that are considered \"generic\" or \"so widely used that consumers view it as designating a category of all of the goods/services of the same type, rather than as a geographic origin.\" PTO does not provide oversight of any applicable standards or standards established by private industry. PTO does not have a special register for GIs in the United States. The U.S. Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) contains GIs registered as trademarks, certification marks, and collective marks in the United States. EU farm products hold nearly 12,000 trademarks in the U.S., including Idaho Potatoes, Florida Oranges, and Napa Valley Wines. Foreign GI certification marks protected in the U.S. include Brunello Di Montalcino (Italy) and Cognac (France). The U.S. promotes owning a federal trademark registration for advantages like constructive notice of ownership, legal presumption of exclusive rights, ability to bring actions in federal court, and use as a basis for foreign registrations. The U.S. promotes owning a federal trademark registration for advantages like legal presumption of exclusive rights and ability to bring actions in federal court. The U.S. Customs Service prevents importation of infringing foreign goods. TTB oversees labeling resources for wine, beer, and distilled spirits, with regulations governing generic and non-generic designations of geographic significance for grape wine. The TTB regulates approved names for grape wines from various countries and oversees the establishment of American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) in the United States. AVA designations allow for attributing wine characteristics to geographic origin. Mandatory labeling requirements apply for distilled spirits and malt beverages. Regulations specify standards of identity for various classes and types of distilled spirits and malt beverages, including geographical designations for distinctive products. Oversight authority lies with the U.S. Treasury Department. The U.S. Treasury Department addressed issues on grape wine names through bilateral negotiations in 2006 as part of the U.S.-EU Agreement on Trade in Wine. The agreement aimed to establish predictable conditions for bilateral wine trade. EU officials expressed intentions to maintain GI protections in T-TIP negotiations, with Greece threatening to veto unless GIs are protected, including feta cheese. EU's GI list includes about 14% of U.S. cheese production. The EU's GI list represents about 14% of U.S. cheese production, valued at approximately $4.2 billion per year. Recent reports suggest the EU may prioritize this list to around 50 GIs. The EU's proposal in March 2016 highlights concerns about registration and judicial costs, protection against fraud, and misleading indications of origin. USTR argues that the U.S. trademark system adequately protects European products. The EU's proposal on wines and spirits aims to enhance cooperation and transparency in regulations between the U.S. and EU. The EU's T-TIP proposal aims to enhance cooperation and transparency in regulations between the U.S. and EU, but raises concerns among U.S. winemakers about restrictions on the use of semi-generic wine terms and protection of registered GIs as a form of trade protectionism. The EU is using GIs to restrict common names like parmesan, feta, and provolone cheeses and certain wines, limiting U.S. food companies from marketing these foods. This creates trade concerns when a product name protected as a GI in Europe is considered generic in the United States. For example, \"feta\" is a generic name for cheese in the U.S. but protected as a GI in Europe, preventing U.S.-produced feta cheese from being sold in the EU. The EU's GI system restricts common names like parmesan, feta, and provolone cheeses, creating trade concerns for U.S. food companies. U.S. agricultural exporters are worried about GI protections in third country markets due to recent trade agreements with the EU. The EU's GI system restricts common cheese names like parmesan, feta, and provolone, affecting U.S. food companies. Recent trade agreements with Canada and South Africa could recognize up to 200 EU GIs for dairy products, impacting U.S. trade. These GI protections may limit future sales of U.S. products in third countries, regardless of previous exports using generic names. USTR's 2016 Special 301 Report highlights U.S. concerns about global IPR protection related to GIs. The U.S. has concerns about the treatment of geographical indications (GIs) in trade negotiations with various countries. Key goals include ensuring GI protection does not violate prior rights, allowing the use of common names like parmesan and feta, providing notice and opposition opportunities for GI protection, and opposing extension of GI protection beyond wines and spirits. The U.S. has concerns about extending GI protection beyond wines and spirits, with some Members of Congress and USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack expressing worries about EU GI protections creating trade barriers. Vilsack stated that the EU's GI system doesn't align with U.S. trademark laws, and the U.S. has resisted EU demands to reserve certain food names for EU producers, particularly affecting cheese exports. This GI debate in the T-TIP could hinder U.S. commercial interests. The U.S. is concerned about EU GI protections creating trade barriers, particularly affecting cheese exports. Many U.S. food producers are part of the Consortium for Common Food Names, aiming to protect the right to use common food names and legitimate GIs. Various U.S. agricultural groups support these efforts, along with food groups in Central and Latin America. The American Origin Products Association (AOPA) is advocating for a system similar to the EU GI system to protect American Origin Products (AOPs) from fraud and deceptive labeling. They aim to increase the value of AOPs, create a national certification system, and respond to consumer demand for regional products. Members include Napa Valley Vintners, California Dried Plum Board, and others. The American Origin Products Association (AOPA) is advocating for a system similar to the EU GI system to protect American Origin Products (AOPs) from fraud and deceptive labeling. Members include Napa Valley Vintners, California Dried Plum Board, and others. This divide is evident in the U.S. wine industry, with concerns about traditional and semi-generic names addressed in the 2006 agreement. Key provisions included measures regarding the U.S. industry's use of 16 \"semi-generic\" names of wine originating in the EU. The EU and U.S. wine industry have ongoing trade concerns regarding GIs, \"semi-generic\" terms, market access issues, new winemaking practices, and regulatory coherence. The Wine Institute and other U.S. agriculture groups criticize the EU GI registration process for lacking transparency and discriminating against non-EU products. Napa Valley Vintners are also involved in advocating for protection of American Origin Products. The U.S. wine industry, including Napa Valley Vintners, supports expanding and protecting Geographical Indications (GIs) in the United States. There is a debate within the industry about GIs and \"semi-generic\" terms. Many are looking to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement for guidance on trade issues with the European Union. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement is being looked at for guidance on negotiating certain proposals in T-TIP, particularly on issues like regulatory coherence and GI names. The TPP agreement obligates member countries to make the GI recognition process transparent and available to all interested parties, with provisions for canceling GI protection and allowing objections. Concerns about confusion with recognized trademarks are among the reasons for opposing a GI. The U.S. and EU are likely considering how GIs are addressed in the TPP agreement as they negotiate T-TIP. Stakeholders in the United States are tracking GI issues in ongoing negotiations between the EU and other countries, such as Canada and Japan. Concerns are raised about the potential implications for global agricultural trade under preferential agreements and establishing precedents. Speculation arises on whether the issue of GIs in trade agreements like T-TIP may need to be addressed at a higher political level due to concerns from the U.S. dairy industry and the reluctance of parties to compromise."
