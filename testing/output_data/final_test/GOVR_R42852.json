    "content": "President Obama announced plans to reinstate presidential reorganization authority, with a legislative proposal sent to Congress in February 2012. This authority, previously available from 1932 to 1984, would allow the President to propose reorganizing executive branch departments. The first plan under this authority would consolidate six business and trade-related agencies into one. The report discusses the history of presidential reorganization authority from 1932 to 1984 and President Obama's request to reinstate it in 2012. It also analyzes possible options for congressional consideration regarding this legislation. The presidential reorganization authority allowed the President to implement plans unless Congress rejected them, shifting the burden of action to opponents. In 1984, Congress amended the mechanism to require affirmative action for plans to take effect, giving more power to Congress. This authority expired in 1984 and has not been available since. Presidents used this authority regularly between 1932 and 1984 for various reorganizations within agencies. The presidential reorganization authority allowed the President to create new organizations like HEW, EPA, and FEMA. Congress delegated varying authority to the President over the century, refining and reauthorizing the authority between 1932 and 1984. The statute in the U.S. Code is structured differently from early statutes, with modifications made through new statutes or amendments. The current statute on reorganization authority is structured differently from early statutes, but still contains all key elements. These elements influence the balance of power between the President and Congress, including reorganization plan contents, limitations on power, and expedited parliamentary procedures. These provisions set boundaries for the President's proposed reorganizations under this special authority. The presidential reorganization authority, rooted in the Herbert Hoover Administration, has evolved over time through congressional reshaping. Congress has adjusted the scope of reorganization activities and expedited procedures, impacting the ease or difficulty of enacting the President's plans. The presidential reorganization authority has evolved over time, with Congress adjusting the scope of activities and procedures. The authority lapsed at various times and was modified in 1983 due to a constitutional issue. The last plan was submitted in 1980, and the 1984 authority expired without being used. The presidential reorganization authority, last submitted in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, expired in 1984. The provisions are listed in 5 U.S.C. Sections 901 et seq. Table 1 summarizes the authority by President. Congressional debates over the constitutionality of the legislative veto mechanism were a key issue until 1984 when it was found unconstitutional. Recent legislative proposals no longer consider this mechanism. The reorganization authority in the U.S. Code dates back to 1932 when President Hoover proposed delegating authority to the President for executive branch reorganizations. This authority has evolved over the years, with the last submission in 1980 by President Carter before it expired in 1984. Congressional debates on the constitutionality of the legislative veto mechanism were prominent until it was deemed unconstitutional in 1984. Recent legislative proposals no longer include this mechanism. The President's reorganization authority was enacted in 1932, allowing the President to direct government reorganization actions by executive order subject to congressional review. The 72nd Congress adjourned shortly after the statute was enacted, making it unlikely for an executive order to go into effect within the 60-day review period. President Hoover did not submit any executive orders during this brief window. The President's reorganization authority was enacted in 1932, but President Hoover did not submit executive orders under the act to Congress until December 9, 1932, after he had been defeated in his bid for reelection. The act established definitions for federal government agencies, distinguishing between executive agencies and independent executive agencies. The Reorganization Act of 1932 granted the President the authority to transfer agencies, consolidate functions, and eliminate duplication to streamline government operations. The purpose was to group, coordinate, and consolidate agencies, reduce overlap, and segregate regulatory functions. The President's actions were to be consistent with these goals and within specified limitations. The Reorganization Act of 1932 allowed the President to transfer agencies, consolidate functions, and eliminate duplication to streamline government operations. President Hoover issued 11 executive orders under this authority, directing the consolidation and grouping of agencies and activities according to major functions and purposes. The act included a mechanism for disapproval by a resolution of a single house of Congress. The House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments recommended disapproving all executive orders issued under the Reorganization Act of 1932, citing concerns about binding the incoming President with the outgoing President's initiatives. The committee's report, published on January 9, 1933, highlighted the Director of the Budget's opinion that making changes on the eve of a new President's inauguration would be unwise. President Hoover's reorganization orders were disapproved by the House on January 19, 1933, preventing their implementation. Hoover urged Congress to either allow the orders to take effect or provide enhanced authority to his successor for reorganization efforts. Hoover criticized opposition to his orders, stating that real reorganization would eventually include the same proposals. President Hoover's reorganization orders were disapproved by the House in January 1933, leading to a call for enhanced authority for reorganization efforts. President Hoover signed the Treasury-Post Office Appropriations Act of March 3, 1933, amending the 1932 statute to extend reorganization authority for President Roosevelt. The urgency to reorganize the federal government was emphasized in light of the national economic downturn. The amended act in response to the national economic downturn emphasized the need for urgent reorganization of the federal government. It expanded the list of reorganizational actions and removed the expedited method of congressional disapproval for executive orders. The 1933 amendments expanded the President's authority to abolish agencies or functions, with the exception of departments. Congress had limited ability to prevent these orders. Executive orders had to be transmitted to Congress within two years. Roosevelt issued various executive orders for reorganization but did not undertake a comprehensive rearrangement of the executive branch. The 1933 amendments expanded the President's authority to abolish agencies or functions, with limited congressional oversight. Roosevelt issued executive orders for reorganization but did not undertake a comprehensive rearrangement of the executive branch, which included creating new offices and transferring functions between departments. President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6166, which included the consolidation of government agencies such as the Office of Education, Farm Credit Administration, Office of the Alien Property Custodian, and Board of Indian Commissioners. A Division of Territories and Insular Possessions was created in the Department of the Interior. The order aimed to save over $25 million, but the actual savings are unknown. Despite the reorganization, the number of government agencies did not decrease. During the period of government reorganization under President Roosevelt, 60 new administrative units were created, but none took departmental form. Roosevelt believed that reorganization could increase efficiency and minimize waste, but did not expect significant savings. During the period of government reorganization under President Roosevelt, 60 new administrative units were created, but none took departmental form. Reorganization for efficiency does not lead to major cost savings in government. The reorganization authority expired in mid-1935, prompting studies for potential executive branch reorganization in early 1936. The Brookings Institution conducted studies on executive branch reorganization, with results released after the 1936 election. A 1,200 page Senate report containing 15 reports was published in August 1937, focusing on administrative performance improvement. The President's Committee also completed a study by early 1937. The President's Committee on Administrative Management, also known as the Brownlow Committee, proposed a new version of reorganization authority to Congress. The proposal aimed to give the President more power by removing the requirement to inform or get approval from Congress, extending the authority indefinitely, and expanding the range of reorganizational tools available. This would allow the President to establish or abolish government agencies or federal corporations, including departments. The proposal to reactivate and expand the authority for executive branch reorganization was influenced by President Roosevelt's plan to reorganize the federal judiciary, known as the \"court-packing plan.\" This was during a session of Congress where much of Roosevelt's New Deal agenda had been enacted, but some laws were invalidated by the Supreme Court. President Roosevelt's plan to expand the Supreme Court and appoint additional Justices to rule favorably on New Deal legislation was controversial and never enacted. Some saw it as an attempt to increase executive power. His request for expanded executive branch reorganization authority was also viewed as a power grab at the expense of the legislative branch. People, including legislators and onlookers, were shocked and bewildered by the Court-packing bill and the reorganization bill, which aimed to give the President control of the courts and all the power of Congress. The Court bill did not succeed, but the President partially achieved his goal. The reorganization bill has not yet been successful, but some men in Congress support it. Some scholars attribute congressional opposition to the reorganization bill to factors like insufficient consultation with leadership and opposition to new departments. In 1938, the Senate passed a limited renewal of reorganization authority, requiring the President to inform Congress of executive orders and lasting only two years. The Reorganization Act of 1939 was enacted after President Roosevelt requested reorganization authority at the beginning of the 76th Congress. The terms of the legislation were more limited in scope compared to previous requests, and it was considered mild in contrast to the previous year's defeated measure. The Reorganization Act of 1939 was mild compared to its predecessor, sparking no controversy. It introduced reorganization plans instead of executive orders, allowing Congress to nullify them within 60 days through a two-house legislative veto. This addressed concerns about separation of powers. The 1939 Reorganization Act provided the President with less authority compared to the 1933 act. It allowed for reorganization plans to abolish agencies and transfer functions but not abolish functions. The act also expanded the limitations on actions that could not be included in a plan. The 1939 Reorganization Act limited the President's authority compared to the 1933 act. It allowed for reorganization plans to abolish agencies and transfer functions but not abolish functions. Plans had to be submitted to Congress before January 21, 1941. President Roosevelt submitted five plans, all of which went into effect with Congress passing joint resolutions of approval. One plan faced opposition but was ultimately approved. The 1939 Reorganization Act limited the President's authority compared to the 1933 act. It allowed for reorganization plans to abolish agencies and transfer functions but not abolish functions. Plans had to be submitted to Congress before January 21, 1941. President Roosevelt submitted five plans, all of which went into effect with Congress passing joint resolutions of approval. One plan faced opposition but was ultimately approved. The Senate amended a resolution for Reorganization Plan No. V of 1940, which was approved despite one chamber's opposition, leading to discussions on the shortcomings of congressional consideration. Representative Walter H. Judd referenced this event in advocating for a one-house veto over a two-house veto. The 1939 Reorganization Act limited the President's authority compared to the 1933 act. President Roosevelt submitted five plans, including the establishment of the Executive Office of the President and the Federal Security Agency. President Truman requested reorganization authority in 1945. President Truman requested reorganization authority in 1945, following the expiration of the 1939 Reorganization Act. During World War II, temporary war-time reorganization authority was granted to the President through the First War Powers Act, allowing him to transfer and consolidate agencies without congressional approval. The organizational structure of departments and agencies was to revert to pre-war status unless statutorily changed. The First War Powers Act reduced the need for renewal of 1939 authority. President Truman's 1945 request stemmed from the reversion provision. American participation in World War II lasted 45 months compared to 19 months in World War I. President Roosevelt issued 135 executive orders for war organizations, while President Wilson issued 24. Truman discussed the challenges of unraveling the vast war organization and mobilization of resources. He highlighted the need to avoid automatic reversion to pre-existing status under Title I of the First War Powers Act, as it may re-establish agencies that should not be re-established. Truman proposed reorganization activities not related to post-war reversion, with a permanent authority for broader organizational adjustments. Congress would require a two-house veto for disapproval of submitted plans. The Administration advocated for broader authority for organizational adjustments, which was initially limited by Congress. Comptroller General Lindsay C. Warren played a key role in advancing the Administration's cause, particularly in the House. Warren highlighted the problem in a House Committee hearing. Warren criticized the current government setup as inefficient and wasteful, suggesting that the President's reorganization authority could address the problem. He emphasized the need for coordination and efficiency to prevent the government from collapsing under its own weight. The new statute enacted in December 1945 gave the Administration limited reorganization authority for about two and a quarter years. Certain reorganization activities, like abolishing or creating a department, were still prohibited. The 1945 statute gave the Administration limited reorganization authority for about two and a quarter years, with certain activities like abolishing or creating a department still prohibited. The new statute differed from the 1939 act in various ways, including dropping the declaration about reducing government expenditures and partially or fully exempting only 11 agencies instead of 21. Additionally, it included a provision limiting the authority concerning independent regulatory agencies. The 1945 statute granted limited reorganization authority to the Administration for a specific period, with restrictions on certain activities. It differed from the 1939 act by exempting fewer agencies and included a provision limiting authority over independent regulatory agencies. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary added a provision to protect the independent exercise of quasi-judicial authority in agencies. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary added a provision to protect the independent exercise of quasi-judicial authority in agencies within the executive branch. The committee emphasized the importance of maintaining independence for these agencies, even if they were to be placed under a Cabinet officer. President Truman submitted seven reorganization plans to Congress under the 1945 act, with six of them being disapproved by the House and three also rejected by the Senate. The reorganization authority requiring a two-house veto was more favorable to Administration initiatives. One of the disapproved plans was Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1946, which aimed to consolidate national housing functions and agencies. The plan to consolidate national housing functions and agencies was opposed by the housing industry. Truman's Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1947 reorganized housing agencies in a more acceptable way. Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1947 and Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1948 aimed to transfer the U.S. Employment Service to the Department of Labor to strengthen its position. The Reorganization Act of 1949 was enacted during President Truman's second term, following the recommendations of the Hoover Commission. This law supported the reactivation of presidential reorganization authority, which Truman used to implement some of the commission's suggestions. The Hoover Commission, established in 1947, aimed to reorganize the federal government by reducing the number of agencies that had increased during the New Deal and World War II. The 80th Congress supported this effort, with a focus on containing and shrinking the government's size due to the expansion of agencies from 521 in 1932 to 2,369 in 1947. President Truman endorsed the commission's work and used reorganization authority to implement its recommendations. The executive branch of the Government now has an annual payroll of approximately 6\u00bc billion dollars, which is 1\u00bd billion dollars more than in 1933. It employs more people than all State, city, and county governments combined. The United States Government has numerous agencies with overlapping functions and services, leading to inefficiencies and further expansion without clear purpose. The Hoover Commission, consisting of 12 bipartisan members, was established in 1947 to study the organization and operation of the executive branch. Its goals included promoting economy, efficiency, and improved service by limiting expenditures, eliminating duplication, consolidating services, and abolishing unnecessary functions. The Hoover Commission, formed in 1947, aimed to streamline the executive branch by consolidating services, abolishing unnecessary functions, and defining executive functions. The commission conducted research through 34 working groups, with some seeing it as a way to enhance the President's management capabilities and others as a means to assess the role of the federal government. The Hoover Commission, established in 1947, aimed to streamline the executive branch by consolidating services and defining executive functions. Hoover and other Republican members hoped the recommendations would lead to government reform under an anticipated Republican President, potentially abolishing New Deal-established functions. However, after Truman's reelection, the focus shifted to recommending organizational and managerial improvements acceptable to the Truman Administration. The Hoover Commission aimed to streamline the executive branch by consolidating services and defining executive functions. Recommendations were moderated by various factors, including the views of Thomas E. Dewey and Truman Administration influence. By January 1949, the groundwork was laid for renewing presidential reorganization authority. Administration-drafted bills were introduced to make the authority permanent, eliminate exemptions of agencies, and permit the creation of new departments. The Hoover Commission aimed to streamline the executive branch by consolidating services and defining executive functions. Recommendations were made to eliminate exemptions of agencies and create new departments. However, specific elements faced opposition, such as moving the civil functions of the Army Corps of Engineers to the Department of the Interior. Congress introduced a one-house legislative veto to ease rejection of reorganization plans, leading to the enactment of the reorganization authority in June. The Reorganization Act of 1949, enacted on June 20, 1949, aimed to promote better execution of laws and more effective management of the executive branch. It differed from its 1945 predecessor in disapproval procedures and exempted agencies provisions. The six purposes of the authority no longer included a reference to post-war transition, instead focusing on efficient administration of public business. The Reorganization Act of 1949 aimed to improve the management of the executive branch by allowing reorganization plans to create new departments and granting reorganization power for nearly four years. President Truman submitted 41 plans during this period, each focusing on specific actions for one or two agencies, often based on recommendations from the Hoover Commission. Eleven out of 41 reorganization plans submitted by President Truman were disapproved by Congress, including plans to elevate the Federal Security Agency to department status and centralize administrative authority in various agencies. The Reorganization Act of 1949 transferred certain appointments from the President to the civil service, abolished politically appointed positions, and renewed eight times until 1971. During the reauthorization debates in 1953, 1955, and 1957, efforts were made to ease the process of Congress disapproving a plan by amending the congressional veto provisions. In 1959, President Eisenhower's administration sought an extension of the act until mid-1961, which was supported by the House and the Senate Committee on Government Operations, but opposed by Senator Russell B. Long. Senator Russell B. Long opposed the extension of the delegation of authority in 1959, arguing that Congress should retain its powers rather than surrender them unnecessarily. Without the extension, the authority expired on June 1, 1959. President John F. Kennedy took office in 1961. President John F. Kennedy requested a renewal of the 1949 authority in 1961, which was reauthorized through mid-1963. A two-year extension was requested in early 1963, with the House passing the extension on June 4, 1963. An amendment was included to prohibit the establishment of a new department. The Senate did not act on the extension request until after Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. President Lyndon B. Johnson then requested Senate approval. President Lyndon B. Johnson requested Senate consideration of the reorganization authority, which was extended until December 31, 1968. The House agreed to the extension, and it was signed into law on June 18, 1965. President Johnson submitted 17 plans to Congress, including transferring certain functions to the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Community Relations Service. President Richard M. Nixon requested Congress to renew the authority for reorganization, which was approved without debate and signed into law on March 27, 1969. The authority was extended through April 1, 1971. The Reorganization Act of 1949 was extended by President Nixon in 1969 and again in 1971. Changes were made to limit the frequency of plan transmissions to Congress and the subjects covered in each plan. The congressional veto procedures were also modified to allow for longer committee consideration. Legislation was introduced in 1973 to extend the Act further until 1977. The legislation introduced in 1973 aimed to establish a process for Congress to review and comment on reorganization plans before submission. It would have removed restrictions on the number of plans transmitted and the requirement for itemizing expected savings. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Government Operations but did not progress further. Robert C. Byrd introduced legislation in 1973 to extend authority for reorganization plans for two years, making the process more difficult for the Administration. The bill aimed to strengthen Congress's role by requiring approval through a concurrent resolution and advance notice to Congress. In 1975, President Ford requested Congress to renew the 1949 statute for another four years, but no legislation was introduced. Reasons for not granting extensions in 1973 and 1975 are not documented. Senator Byrd's extension bill in 1973 aimed at regaining congressional power over the federal government. Senator Byrd's bill aims to restore Congress's oversight of the executive branch, strengthen congressional authority over administrative bureaucracy, and prevent hasty executive actions. Congressional control and oversight of executive departments are crucial for ensuring policies are implemented faithfully and holding executive officers accountable. Between 1953 and 1973, 52 reorganization plans were submitted to Congress under the 1949 act, leading to the establishment of various organizations like the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Eight plans were disapproved, including those related to Department of Defense research programs. The curr_chunk discusses reorganization plans for various government agencies, including the Department of Defense, Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, Secretary of Agriculture, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Communications Commission, and National Labor Relations Board. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Department of Urban Affairs and Housing, the transfer of executive functions from the U.S. Tariff Commission, and the influence of government reform committees on reorganization plans. During his 1976 presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter proposed a thorough revision of the federal bureaucracy, aiming to eliminate unnecessary agencies and streamline the Executive Branch. He sought complete authorization to reorganize the government and reduce regulations and paperwork. President Carter proposed a reorganization of the Executive Branch to make it efficient, economical, purposeful, simple, and manageable. Congress approved a modified version of his proposal in April 1977 after hearings and debates in both chambers. The President's reorganization proposal was signed into law in April 1977 after Congress approved a modified version. The legislation faced conflict over the procedures for Congress to pass judgment on a plan, with concerns raised about the constitutionality of the legislative veto procedure. Ultimately, the authority enacted in 1977 continued to use a legislative veto but with modified procedures. The Reorganization Act of 1977 was a new statute that replaced an amendment to the 1949 act. It allowed the President to amend or withdraw a plan within specific timeframes and limited the number of plans pending before Congress. Congress emphasized citizen participation in restructuring the executive branch and prohibited the abolition of enforcement or statutory programs. Additionally, restrictions were placed on establishing, abolishing, transferring, or consolidating departments. The Reorganization Act of 1977 expanded restrictions on departmental changes to include independent agencies. President Carter submitted 10 plans under the new statute, including reorganizing federal personnel management, creating the Office of Personnel Management, and establishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency. President Carter utilized the new authority granted under the Reorganization Act of 1977 to submit 10 plans, amending 6 of them within 30 days of submission. In early 1979, the Carter Administration proposed creating a Department of Natural Resources, which faced congressional opposition and was not submitted as a reorganization plan. The reorganization plan process used by President Carter to establish the new Department of Natural Resources was seen as a violation of the Reorganization Act of 1977. The Administration believed that going through the normal legislative process would not result in the Department's creation, so they used the reorganization plan process to bypass this. Congress extended the authority granted under the Reorganization Act of 1977, allowing President Carter to submit his final reorganization plan. President Carter's final reorganization plan, submitted before the deadline, expired under President Jimmy Carter. Efforts to extend and modify the authority continued during Reagan's presidency. In 1981, reorganization authority legislation supported by Reagan was passed in the Senate but not in the House. Some modifications from the 1977 language in the bill later became part of the statute. The 1981 bill also included provisions to prohibit renaming existing departments and creating new agencies not part of an existing department. The 1981 reorganization authority legislation supported by Reagan aimed to extend the President's ability to amend or withdraw plans, and change the congressional mechanism for approving reorganization plans. The bill also included provisions to prohibit creating new agencies not part of an existing department. The 1984 legislation amended the process for reorganization plans due to a Supreme Court ruling that the legislative veto process was unconstitutional. Congress would now consider a joint resolution approving the plan under an expedited procedure. The 1984 legislation amended the reorganization plan process, requiring Congress to approve the plan through a joint resolution under an expedited procedure. The process included limitations on committee consideration, floor debate, and amendments, with the burden of action on plan proponents. The reorganization plan authority was extended to December 31, 1984, by Congress. The 1984 legislation amended the reorganization plan process, requiring Congress to approve the plan through a joint resolution under an expedited procedure. The Senate adjourned sine die for the year after passing the bill, and did not reassemble until January 3, 1985, missing the deadline for plan submission. The dormant statute remains in the U.S. Code, and concerns were raised about the validity of existing reorganization plans after the INS v. Chadha ruling. Congress passed legislation ratifying all plans that had gone into effect under the now-unconstitutional procedure. The Reagan Administration proposed renewing the 1984 reorganization authority in the FY1986 budget request. The President sought an extension of the authority until December 31, 1988, for continued structural flexibility. Legislation to extend the authority was introduced in the 99th Congress, but no further action was taken. The FY1988 budget documents reiterated the President's interest in renewing the authority. During the 100th Congress, there was no legislation introduced to renew the presidential reorganization authority. Various administrations have had differing views on restoring this authority, with some advocating for it and others not. President George H. W. Bush did not seek an extension, and President Clinton did not directly request action from Congress. The George W. Bush Administration called for a renewal of the authority during the 108th Congress. During the 108th Congress, legislation was proposed to renew presidential reorganization authority, but it was not enacted. President George W. Bush sought to reinstitute permanent reorganization authority for expedited legislative approval. Representative Tom Davis planned to introduce legislation to re-establish reorganization authority, with support from the House Majority Leader. During the 108th Congress, legislation was proposed to renew presidential reorganization authority, but it was not enacted. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay supported the action. The House Committee on Government Reform held a hearing on federal personnel issues and government reorganization. Provisions were passed to renew the President's reorganization authority in a modified form, making it permanent and allowing reorganization plans only for intelligence-related units. The proposed legislation during the 108th Congress aimed to renew the President's reorganization authority, allowing plans only for intelligence-related units. The limitations on the President's authority would have been eliminated, including restrictions on creating or renaming executive departments, abolishing or transferring existing departments, and creating new agencies. Abolishing agency functions without limitations was also permitted in submitted plans. Between 1939 and 1984, over 100 plans were submitted to Congress under presidential reorganization authority, with most going into effect. These plans reorganized the government in minor ways, but also made significant changes such as transferring offices to the Executive Office of the President and creating the Federal Security Agency. In the 1950s, administrative changes were implemented based on recommendations from the Hoover Commissions, including consolidating authority in departments and agencies. The Federal Security Agency was elevated to department status in 1953, leading to the establishment of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was created in 1978. Congress delegated authority to the President while establishing provisions to protect congressional prerogatives. The statutory framework evolved to include four elements defining the scope of the President's plans and the congressional role in passing judgment on them. The President's plans and the congressional role in passing judgment on proposals involve specifying actions, setting limitations, authorizing for a limited duration, and allowing Congress to potentially block a plan before its effective date. A legislative proposal to renew the President's reorganization authority was sent to Congress on February 16, 2012, amending the expired provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1977. This proposal would reactivate the authority for two years by amending specific sections of the law. The President's proposed reorganization authority includes defining \"efficiency-enhancing plans\" for cost savings, allowing consolidation of departments, and creating new agencies. The first plan would consolidate six business and trade-related agencies into one. The President's proposed reorganization authority includes consolidating six business and trade-related agencies into one, involving the relocation of some subunits and functions not directly linked with business and trade. President Obama has requested a renewal of this authority, and Congress may choose whether to grant it. The President's proposal for reorganization authority includes consolidating agencies and Congress may renew it in various ways. Questions arise about the desirability of government reorganization and whether the President or Congress is better suited for it. The reorganization authority granted to the President raises questions about the extent of flexibility, limitations on plan contents, treatment of different types of organizations, input from Congress, and checks on the President's authority. Congress may need to consider whether the President should be required to outline intentions for reorganization before obtaining authority. Congress may need to consider the extent of flexibility and limitations on reorganization authority granted to the President. Questions about the parameters of potential reorganizations, significance of recommendations from stakeholders, and the process of reorganization activities could provide a basis for evaluating different approaches. If Congress chooses not to act on the President's request, reorganization activities could still be accomplished through legislation or agency-directed actions. Advocates argue that existing delegations of reorganization authority provide sufficient flexibility for minor adaptations. They believe renewing presidential reorganization authority for larger scale changes would be an unnecessary delegation of Congress's role in shaping the federal bureaucracy. Congress has demonstrated its ability to carry out this role over the past decade. Congress has demonstrated its ability to carry out its role in shaping the federal bureaucracy over the past decade through various reorganization efforts, such as the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Critics argue that Congress has been ineffective in enacting legislation to improve federal organizational arrangements. President Obama highlighted the challenges in enacting reorganization authority due to congressional inertia and lobbying interests. Despite this, Congress was able to legislate large-scale reorganizations post-9/11. The Department of Homeland Security reorganization was a response to a crisis, but it does not indicate readiness for transformative government reorganization. Congressional oversight of federal bureaucracy's organizational arrangements may occur regardless of reorganization authority renewal. Congress has previously established blue ribbon commissions for further investigation and analysis of federal organization. The first Hoover Commission conducted work before a presidential election, providing recommendations to the new Congress and re-elected President Truman. If Congress renews the authority without amendment, it would be the same as in 1984, which was never used. The 1984 statute differs from President Carter's authority, with expedited procedures for approving plans. The scope of the 1984 statute is more limited, prohibiting renaming of departments and disapproval of plans. The current statute differs from the Carter-era authority by requiring additional detailed information in the President's message regarding implementation of a plan. President Obama's described plan may not be able to be submitted as it involves reconstituting and renaming a department, which is prohibited. However, the Administration could potentially adapt the plan to fit within the current statute if renewed without amendments. The reauthorization of the statute in 1984 was uncontroversial, passing in the House and Senate by voice vote. However, its effectiveness in carrying out congressional purposes is unknown as it was never tried. The 1984 reauthorization of the presidential reorganization authority was passed quickly in the Senate, but due to the Senate adjourning shortly after, the Reagan Administration had little opportunity to use the statute. The current Congress may not share the same views on the authority, and another approach would be for Congress to enact the President's proposal. The President's proposal, embodied in S. 2129 during the 112th Congress, aims to renew and amend the expired 1984 reorganization authority. Changes include extending the deadline for submission of plans, requiring efficiency-enhancing plans verified by the OMB director, allowing for the creation of new departments or agencies, renaming or abolishing departments, and consolidating functions. The proposed two-year extension of the reorganization authority is consistent with past extensions, with varying durations ranging from 11 months to three and a half years. Congress has also authorized shorter periods, such as approximately 15 months in 1971. The last authorization was signed into law on November 8. The legislation signed into law on November 8, 1984, specified that reorganization plans must be transmitted to Congress by December 31, 1984. S. 2129 would require submitted plans to be \"efficiency-enhancing,\" defined as decreasing agencies or saving costs. The bill aims to prioritize these purposes and ensure plans address them in specified ways. The 1984 legislation aimed to reduce expenditures and promote economy by consolidating agencies with similar functions under a single head. Reorganization plans had to be accompanied by a declaration from the President stating the necessity of the reorganization to carry out these purposes. The plans also had to estimate any reduction or increase in expenditures expected as a result of the reorganizations. The proposed efficiency-enhancing standard in S. 2129 would prioritize decreasing the number of agencies and cost savings in reorganizations. It goes beyond requiring the President's declaration of necessity, by also needing the OMB Director to determine if the specified results will be achieved. The proposed efficiency-enhancing standard in S. 2129 aims to decrease the number of agencies and achieve cost savings in reorganizations. The amendment to the 1984 statute would hold the Administration more accountable for reorganization outcomes, potentially reducing the size of the federal government. However, there is a concern that a reorganization plan could result in the creation of new independent agencies, ultimately spreading the government's functions. The proposed efficiency-enhancing standard in S. 2129 aims to decrease the number of agencies and achieve cost savings in reorganizations. However, there are concerns about potential creation of new independent agencies, which could spread the government's functions and lead to disagreements over cost savings determination. Previous delegations of presidential reorganization authority have shown few instances of documented cost savings. The amendments in S. 2129 aim to enhance efficiency by allowing for the creation, renaming, abolition, transfer, or consolidation of departments. Previous reorganization statutes did not explicitly permit the creation of a department, and there were few instances of documented cost savings. The 1932 act and President Roosevelt's reorganizations under the 1933 authority did not establish new organizations, but rather transferred, consolidated, or abolished functions within existing departments. The 1939 and 1945 statutes explicitly prohibited the creation of new departments, following unsuccessful requests for broader reorganization authority in 1937 and 1938. Disagreements during those years included the creation of a new Department of Social Welfare and a new Department of Public Works. The language in the statutes suggests a focus on maintaining or decreasing the size of government. The Reorganization Act of 1949 removed the prohibition on establishing new departments to allow for the creation of large agencies without calling them departments. This change was made to prevent the government from becoming too large and to give the President the flexibility to create organizations of departmental magnitude. The Reorganization Act of 1949 removed the prohibition on establishing new departments, allowing for the creation of large agencies without calling them departments. President Eisenhower successfully established the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1953, elevating the Federal Security Agency to department status. However, the 1964 extension of the Act reinstated the prohibition on new departments, following President Kennedy's unsuccessful attempt to create a Department of Urban Affairs and Housing in 1962. The legislative effort to create a Department of Urban Affairs and Housing was defeated due to civil rights-related issues. President Kennedy's subsequent submission of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1962 was disapproved by the House, leading to the reinstatement of the restriction on establishing new departments. This restriction continued to be part of subsequent reorganization authority statutes. The restriction on establishing new departments was dropped in the 1949 act but reinstated in 1984 in response to a controversial Carter initiative. The Administration's plan to create a new Department of Natural Resources by renaming the Department of the Interior was met with opposition in Congress. The Obama Administration's proposal to establish a new Department of Natural Resources faced opposition in Congress due to concerns about bypassing legislative processes. The Administration aimed to rename the Department of the Interior to create the new department, circumventing restrictions in the Reorganization Act. Removing limitations on reorganization authority could potentially lead to the abolition of the Department of Commerce as part of trade-related agency restructuring efforts. The 1949 act removed limitations on reorganization authority, allowing for the establishment of new departments. Previous reorganization activities required congressional action, but the act removed the prohibition on creating new departments. The 1949 act removed the prohibition on creating new departments and allowed for consolidation of existing departments. The new language in 1949 aimed to clarify that consolidation could only occur by merging two existing departments. The 1964 amendments reinstated the prohibition on creating new departments while maintaining the restriction on consolidation. The 1984 amendments to the reorganization authority included a provision that prohibited creating new agencies not part of existing departments. This provision was first considered in 1981 and later enacted. Its impact on the authority's use remains unknown as the authority was not used after 1980. The Obama Administration has requested the deletion of this limitation. The Obama Administration has requested authority similar to that under the Carter Administration, with the Senate and House committees expressing different intentions. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs highlighted the need to slow the growth of new independent agencies to improve accountability and policy coordination. The House Committee on Government Operations clarified pre-existing limitations on creating new departments and agencies. If Congress renews the presidential reorganization authority as requested by the Obama Administration, it would give the President unprecedented flexibility to establish and abolish departments. The Obama Administration's request for renewed presidential reorganization authority would grant the President unprecedented flexibility to establish and abolish departments, with some constraints such as self-certification and congressional procedures. The President may face a greater legislative burden in gaining approval for reorganization plans compared to previous Presidents. Congress could renew reorganization authority with amendments requested by the Obama Administration or make other changes to the statute's sections. Each element of reorganization authority plays a crucial role in defining the President and Congress's authority in this context. The reorganization plan contents, limitations on power, and expedited parliamentary procedures define the scope of the President's authority. For example, the 1977 act allowed consolidating agencies but prohibited consolidating departments or independent regulatory agencies. The expedited procedures are crucial in this context. Parliamentary procedures play a crucial role in defining Congress's involvement in enacting the President's reorganization plan. Congress can amend 5 U.S.C. 903 to change the scope of potential reorganizations, which include transferring agency functions, abolishing agency functions (excluding enforcement functions or statutory programs), and consolidating agencies. The reorganization plan can involve abolishing agencies, consolidating functions, delegating officer functions, or abolishing agencies without functions. Congress can amend the scope of reorganizations by changing 5 U.S.C. 903. The reorganization plan could be expanded to allow for more provisions, such as creating new agencies. Amendments proposed by the Bush Administration included allowing only one plan to be submitted at a time. Congress might amend the statute to specify the range of agencies or functions that could be included in the plan, serving as a middle ground between broad authority delegation. The reorganization plan could be expanded to allow for more provisions, such as creating new agencies. Congress has employed limitations in various versions of reorganization authority, including seven limitations in the present statute. These limitations include restrictions on creating new executive departments, continuing agencies beyond authorized periods, and continuing functions beyond authorized periods. The Obama proposal aims to amend limitations on reorganization plans, allowing for more flexibility in creating new agencies and extending office terms beyond legal limits. This would give the President additional leeway in submitting outlined plans. The Obama proposal aims to amend limitations on reorganization plans to allow more flexibility in creating new agencies and extending office terms. This could increase the likelihood of plan ratification by Congress, with potential limitations being considered. The 1945 act limited reorganizations by agency functions, not entire agencies. President George W. Bush's proposal aimed to repeal existing limitations and restrict the agencies eligible for reorganization. The Administration's plan aimed to reorganize key intelligence agencies, including the Office of the National Intelligence Director, CIA, NSA, DIA, NGA, NRO, and others within the Department of Defense, State, Treasury, FBI, and Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security's intelligence analysis elements, including the Coast Guard's Office of Intelligence, may be designated as part of the intelligence community. Congress could grant the President reorganization authority with expedited parliamentary procedures, similar to those in 1984, or modify them. Alternatively, Congress may reject fast track procedures and opt for regular parliamentary procedures for reorganization approval. When considering expedited legislative procedures for reorganization authority, lawmakers may choose between joint resolutions of approval or disapproval. Approval resolutions shift power to Congress, requiring affirmative action for reorganization plans. Disapproval resolutions give the President more power, allowing plans to proceed unless Congress can override with supermajority votes. When considering expedited legislative procedures for reorganization authority, policymakers must decide on including mandatory pre-consultation requirements for the President before submitting a plan to Congress. They also need to determine if Congress should be allowed to amend the plan once submitted. Prior versions of expedited authority did not permit direct congressional amendments. Government reorganization authority allows the President to amend or withdraw a plan within a limited timeframe. Congressional amendments during expedited procedures may hinder timely completion of legislative measures. Reorganization aims for administrative benefits like program effectiveness, efficiency, cost reduction, and policy integration. Past delegations of reorganization authority have focused on achieving administrative improvements. The objective of reorganization is to achieve administrative improvements, as required by Congress. Reorganization plans must articulate means of achieving these improvements and may have political goals. Reorganization redistributes power and resources, impacting employees and outside interests. Organizational units and functions may be moved or abolished, depending on the President's authority. A government reorganization can have disruptive effects on various stakeholders, including employees, outside interests, and Congressional committees. While it may lead to beneficial outcomes in the long run, it can upset power dynamics, create uncertainty, and interrupt workflow. Proponents argue that the President may be more effective in implementing reorganization than Congress, while critics point out Congress's challenges in consensus-building. Critics argue that Congress struggles to reach consensus on reorganization legislation, with political concerns often taking precedence. Opponents of reauthorizing the President's reorganization authority believe Congress is better equipped to handle competing interests and shape the federal government. They note that Congress has successfully reorganized the government through legislative processes and express concerns about ceding institutional power to the President. When considering reorganization plans, Congress may delegate power to the President based on factors like administrative need, collaborative history, and political context. Critics argue that Congress struggles with consensus on reorganization, preferring to handle it through legislative processes to maintain institutional power."
