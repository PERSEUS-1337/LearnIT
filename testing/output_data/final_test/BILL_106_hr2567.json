Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on mental health and student service providers. This section outlines findings related to mental health services for students. \"Congress finds that there is a significant need for mental health services for children under 18, with only 1 in 5 receiving the necessary support. Schools in the United States have a high student-to-counselor ratio, with the national average being 513:1. It is recommended that the ratio of students to counselors should be 250:1, psychologists 1,000:1, and social workers 800:1.\" In California and Minnesota, 1 counselor serves over 1,000 students, with some schools lacking counselors for crisis intervention. Colorado has a student-to-counselor ratio of 645:1. The need for school counselors is expected to increase, with over 100,000 new counselors needed to achieve a ratio of 250:1 by 2005. Federal support for reducing this ratio would lead to improved academic achievement and reduced incidents of violence and substance abuse. Improvements in students' academic achievement, graduation rates, college attendance, and employment have been observed. The purpose of SEC. 10993A is to improve students' academic achievement, graduation rates, college attendance, and employment. The purpose of this section is to help States and local educational agencies recruit, train, and hire additional school-based mental health personnel to reduce student-to-counselor ratios nationally and address the mental, emotional, and developmental needs of elementary and secondary school students. The purpose of this section is to support the emotional, behavioral, and psycho-social needs of elementary and secondary school students, enhance classroom preparedness, improve school discipline, identify early warning signs of violence, and assist parents in improving their children's school behavior and academic success. \"Definitions are provided in Section 10993B.\" The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to mental health and student services, including 'mental health and student service provider', 'mental health and student services', and 'poverty line'. These definitions clarify the roles and services provided in schools and communities. The curr_chunk defines a school counselor as an individual with documented competence in counseling children and adolescents in a school setting, possessing state licensure, national certification, or a master's degree in school counseling. The curr_chunk discusses the qualifications for a school psychologist and school social worker, including graduate semester hours, supervised internship hours, state licensure or certification, and national certification. A 'worker' is an individual with a master's degree in social work, licensed or certified by the State, or holding a school social work specialist credential. 'State' refers to the various states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. SEC. 10993C. ALLOTMENTS TO STATES. The Secretary allocates funds to States based on previous year's allocations, with a portion reserved for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and outlying areas. States can use a small percentage of funds for administrative costs. States must submit an application to the Secretary to receive funding for additional counselors, school psychologists, and school social workers. The Secretary will approve applications that meet the requirements, aiming to fund a specific number of each professional. Each State receiving funding must allocate the remaining funds to eligible local educational agencies based on the number of children in poverty in the school district served by the agency. The State must allocate funds to local educational agencies based on the number of children in poverty in the school district served by the agency, using data from the most recent fiscal year available. Adjustments can be made if necessary. The State can adjust data to accurately reflect the incidence of children living in poverty in school districts. Definitions include 'child' as aged 5-17 and 'child in poverty' as from a family below the poverty line. Local educational agencies must submit an application to the State to receive funding, including an assurance to provide the local share of costs. The use of funds is outlined in section 10993G. The local educational agency receiving funds must use them to recruit, hire, and train mental health providers for students in elementary and secondary schools for a 1-year period. The funding breakdown is 33\\1/3\\ percent federal, 33\\1/3\\ percent state, and 33\\1/3\\ percent local, with the non-federal share allowed to be provided in cash or in kind. Authorization of appropriations totaling $340,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004 is granted to support the recruitment, hiring, and training of mental health providers for students in elementary and secondary schools."
