    "content": "The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 was last reauthorized in 1994. Congress has enacted amendments to address various concerns related to marine mammal management. Legislation introduced in multiple Congresses suggests issues for reauthorization debate, including commercial fishing, scientific research, public display, and animal protection. The report identifies concerns from various interests such as commercial fishing, scientific research, public display, animal protection, Native American, and environmental groups for the reauthorization debate of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Recommendations from reports to Congress and testimony from a 1999 oversight hearing are considered, with H.R. 4075 incorporating some MMPA amendments proposed by the Bush Administration in the 109th Congress. The Clinton Administration did not release comprehensive proposals for MMPA reauthorization. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) has seen amendments proposed by the Bush Administration, with Congress actively addressing concerns of the commercial fishing industry and environmental interests. The House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation have jurisdiction over MMPA reauthorization legislation. Various groups share the goal of ensuring sustainable marine mammal populations and healthy ecosystems, but may disagree on the best approach. In the reauthorization of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), diverse groups advocate different policy proposals related to commercial fishing. The sector aims to ensure sustainable fisheries while balancing environmental protection and industry viability. Commercial fishing contributes significantly to the economy, with billions of pounds of marine fish caught annually. Conflicts between stakeholders are a key concern. Environmental groups are concerned about the lack of assessment data for managed stocks, harm to marine species, protection of biodiversity, and conflicts between marine mammals and commercial fishing. The public display community, consisting of marine life parks, aquariums, and zoos, focuses on the conservation of marine mammals and their habitats through education and research. Animal protection organizations also play a key role in protecting marine species from harm, including harassment, injury, and habitat loss. Their main concern is the protection of individual animals and species from intentional and incidental harm. Tribes and indigenous groups, represented by commissions, focus on the management of marine mammals for economic stability and resource sustainability. Cooperative management during MMPA reauthorization is crucial for economic vitality and environmental health. Scientists from various sectors are involved in this effort. Scientists from academia, the private sector, and state and federal agencies analyze the effects of MMPA provisions and marine mammal management policy. They are concerned with marine ecosystem health, resource use, funding, and data accuracy. Federal and state marine mammal managers focus on implementing the MMPA, clarity in management requirements, and funding for data collection and research. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was enacted in 1972 to address high dolphin mortality in the tuna fishery. It established a moratorium on taking marine mammals and importing them into the US. The MMPA protects marine mammals from harmful actions and allows permits for certain purposes like research and public display. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) divides responsibility for marine mammal conservation between the Department of Commerce (NMFS) and the Department of the Interior (FWS). The MMPA also established the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) and various programs for marine mammal health and conservation. Title V of the Marine Mammal Protection Act shifted marine mammal management authority to the federal government, allowing for management authority to be returned to states that adopt conservation programs consistent with the MMPA. Permits may be issued for scientific research or to enhance survival of marine mammal species. The Marine Mammal Protection Act allows for the taking of depleted species for scientific research or species recovery, while non-depleted species may be taken for public display. U.S. citizens can obtain authorization to take small numbers of mammals incidental to activities like offshore oil exploration, as long as it has a negligible impact and meets monitoring requirements. The moratorium on taking does not apply to Alaskan Natives for subsistence or creating Native handicrafts, but regulations can be imposed if necessary. The Marine Mammal Protection Act allows for regulated taking of marine mammals, with provisions for co-management by Alaska Native groups and incidental taking during commercial fishing operations. Specific regulations govern the taking of marine mammals in the eastern tropical Pacific tuna fishery. The Endangered Species Act provides additional protection for some marine mammal species. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) provides additional protection for threatened or endangered marine mammal species. The 1988 commercial fishing exemption expired in FY1993, and new provisions in P.L. 103-238 reauthorized the MMPA through FY1999, allowing for the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations. Take Reduction Plans are developed for stocks at risk. The 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) changed provisions related to public display of marine mammals, authorized imports of polar bear trophies from Canada, allowed limited lethal removal of pinnipeds, and permitted research with low levels of harassment. Implementation of these amendments by NMFS and FWS has been controversial, especially regarding the convening of Take Reduction Teams (TRTs) and the development of Take Reduction Plans. Critics argue that insufficient TRTs have been convened and plans are behind schedule. NMFS has convened nine TRTs to reduce bycatch of marine mammals in commercial fisheries, with some TRTs disbanded or renamed. Several TRTs have yet to be convened and plans developed, as fishery-related mortality exceeds PBR levels in some stocks. No new TRTs will be convened until additional funds are available. NMFS has faced challenges in meeting statutory deadlines and implementing plans for strategic stocks due to complexity and industry impacts. Despite frustrations and litigation, progress has been made in addressing serious bycatch/fishery issues. NMFS and FWS have completed reports assessing over 170 marine mammal stocks as required by the MMPA. Some stock assessments by FWS have been criticized for using outdated data, and Alaska Native concerns persist regarding the lack of information on incidental take from commercial fishing operations. The sparse information in these reports was based on data collected during the 1988-1992 exemption. The 1994 amendments directed the federal government to establish an ecosystem-based research program for the Bering Sea to address ecosystem decline. There is controversy over the fulfillment of this provision. The Alaska Native community seeks to understand Bering Sea ecological processes using traditional knowledge. They faced challenges in obtaining public funding for meetings to review the federal research plan and sought independent funding for a conference in March 1999. Several MMPA amendments were enacted after the 1994 reauthorization, including changes to the definition of \"waters under the jurisdiction of the United States\" and exemptions for freeing marine mammals entangled in fishing gear. Additionally, modifications were made to the requirements for importing polar bear parts and dolphin conservation provisions in the eastern tropical Pacific tuna fishery. Administrative provisions clarified polar bear trophy permit fees in P.L. 105-277. Title II of P.L. 106-555 authorized grants for marine mammal stranding programs, while Section 149 of P.L. 108-108 allowed the importation of polar bears from Canada harvested before final regulations. Section 319 of P.L. 108-136 modified the MMPA's definition of harassment and provisions related to taking marine mammals for military readiness and federal research. Title IX of P.L. 109-479 implemented the Agreement on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population. Compliance with the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act was ensured by the Secretary of Commerce in 1999. The NMFS established a new standard for dolphin-safe tuna in January 2000, which was later overturned by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in April 2000. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision in July 2001. The report discusses issues related to commercial fishing interactions with marine mammals, marine mammals in captivity, Native Americans and marine mammals, permits and authorizations, and program management and administration. These issues may be addressed through regulations implemented by NMFS, FWS, or the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The concept of Optimum Sustainable Population (OSP) is defined as the maximum number of animals that can be sustained in a population while considering habitat capacity and ecosystem health. However, determining carrying capacity in marine ecosystems is challenging due to population variability and unknown habitat factors. OSP is crucial for assessing population viability, although some scientists are concerned about using current population data for calculations. Some in the commercial fishing industry argue that the concept of Optimum Sustainable Population (OSP) is complex and vague, making it difficult to determine \"maximum productivity.\" They believe this complicates the development of Take Reduction Plans for marine mammal stocks. Fishing industry interests are frustrated by the challenges in declaring a species at OSP, as it hinders the transfer of management authority to states and delays fishermen from gaining authority to kill marine mammals. Additionally, commercial fishing interests are unhappy with the Marine Mammal Protection Act granting marine mammals priority access to certain fish stocks, leading to competition and detriment to the fishing industry. Environmental and scientific interests argue that marine mammals should have their prey species protected from excessive fishing, as they are part of the marine ecosystem. Commercial fishing industry wants the Marine Mammal Protection Act amended to modify the definition of Optimum Sustainable Population (OSP) for marine mammal management. Scientific, animal protection, and environmental groups believe OSP should be retained and improved, suggesting a workshop involving marine ecologists, oceanographers, and climatologists to further examine OSP determination methods. The potential biological removal (PBR) level is used to establish limits on marine mammal mortality in commercial fishing. PBR is calculated based on population estimates and productivity, with a recovery factor multiplier. Take Reduction Plans assume stocks will remain within their Optimum Sustainable Population (OSP) range. Funding may be needed for further examination of OSP determination methods by marine experts. Some scientists question the assumptions behind the PBR level and OSP range in marine mammal management. Critics argue that NMFS's restrictive PBR calculations are compromising the economic viability of certain fisheries. Managers cite a lack of critical data for precise PBR values, especially for Alaskan species. Some stakeholders are concerned about the accuracy of PBR calculations in marine mammal management, with outdated data and potential economic impacts on fisheries. There are debates on revising the definition of PBR to be less restrictive, while others emphasize its importance as a management tool for marine mammal stocks. Some scientists argue that there is a lack of monitoring and research to accurately calculate PBRs for marine mammal stocks, leading to challenges in enforcing regulations. Critics suggest setting a deadline for developing models to address these concerns. Recommendations for MMPA reauthorization include hosting a workshop involving marine ecologists, oceanographers, and climatologists to examine methods for determining OSP and PBR, considering factors like subsistence harvest, commercial fishery interactions, and industrial activities. The MMPA requires reducing incidental marine mammal mortality in commercial fishing to insignificant levels approaching zero within 7 years. NMFS defined insignificant levels as 10% or less of the PBR for any stock. The goal of approaching zero mortality must be maintained, although progress has been made in reducing marine mammal deaths in some fisheries. Funding may be necessary for this task. The MMPA requires reducing marine mammal mortality in commercial fishing to insignificant levels approaching zero within 7 years. While some fisheries have seen reductions, animal protection and environmental interests believe the ZMRG can be implemented without imposing burdensome costs on the fishing industry. They support maintaining ZMRG to encourage more risk-averse fishing methods. The fishing industry seeks a balance between marine mammal protection and economically viable fisheries. The NMFS definition of approaching the ZMRG at 10% of the PBR or less is generally supported. Several scientists and managers argue that the stock assessment process outlined in the MMPA is inadequate for assessing marine mammal populations with certainty. They believe federal funding should be increased for species-specific assessment methods, especially for Arctic species. Alaskan Native interests propose amending the MMPA to give Regional Scientific Review Groups more authority in determining research needs. They also suggest changing the timing of stock assessment reviews. Alaskan Native interests propose amending the MMPA to give Regional Scientific Review Groups more authority in determining research needs and altering the timing of stock assessment reviews to every five years instead of three. The MMPA allows the use of deterrents to discourage marine mammals from damaging fish catch or gear, but concerns exist about the long-term effects of acoustical harassment devices on marine mammals. Some scientists and animal protection advocates are concerned about the increasing use of Acoustical Harassment Devices (AHDs) on marine mammals. There are worries about the lack of research on the potential harm these devices may cause, leading to calls for only proven harmless deterrents to be used. The precautionary principle is suggested, requiring manufacturers to prove that a deterrent does not cause permanent harm to marine mammals. Some parties are concerned about the use of Acoustical Harassment Devices (AHDs) on marine mammals, calling for proven harmless deterrents to be used. Suggestions include altering the burden of proof for deterrents and requiring permits for AHD users to better monitor ocean noise levels. NMFS recommends Congress consider funding research on non-lethal pinniped deterrence techniques. Care must be taken to assess potential side effects on marine mammals and fish sensitive to noise before widespread use. Prior to 1994, commercial fishermen could kill pinnipeds as a last resort. The 1994 amendments eliminated authorization for lethal taking of pinnipeds by fishermen, replacing it with non-lethal deterrence measures. However, conflicts between fishermen and pinnipeds have increased, leading NMFS to recommend Congress consider allowing intentional lethal taking of California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals in specific areas. Critics fear this could reduce the incentive for non-lethal methods and result in accidental kills of endangered species. Critics advocate for modifying fishing practices to protect endangered species like the Steller sea lion. They propose creating marine protected areas to reduce interactions between fishermen and marine mammals. Animal protection advocates oppose any reinstatement of lethal taking, citing the risk of injuring animals. Sea otter abundance concerns Washington State sea urchin fishermen, who may seek ways to limit sea otters to benefit the fishery. The state lists sea otters as endangered, but no federal protection is afforded this population under the ESA. A 1996 stock assessment report indicated this population was below OSP. Alaskans blame sea otters for declining fish catch and may advocate for more liberal killing of sea otters. Concerns about recent declines in Alaska sea otter abundance exist. Animal protection groups oppose proposals to lethally take sea otters. Integration between management programs under the MMPA and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act could be helpful. No formal mechanism exists for interaction between Take Reduction Teams (TRTs). Currently, there is no formal mechanism for interaction between Take Reduction Teams (TRTs) and regional fishery management council committees. Marine mammal take reduction is crucial for reducing fishery bycatch. The Steller Sea Lion Recovery Team is the only quasi-TRT involved in fishery management plans. Some marine mammal scientists suggest amending the MMPA and Magnuson-Stevens Act to require TRT input in fishery management planning to address marine mammal-fisheries interaction problems. Monitoring the impacts of trap and inshore fisheries on southern sea otters in southern California is challenging due to small vessel sizes that cannot carry observers. Without evidence of significant mortality from these fishing activities, funds under the MMPA are unavailable for monitoring or evaluating trap design effects on sea otters. Some suggest amending the MMPA to allow monitoring in small vessel fisheries and funding for addressing potential interactions. Southern sea otters are expanding their range southward, which could impact their long-term survival, but the commercial fishing industry opposes changes. The commercial fishing industry opposes the expansion of the southern sea otter's range, despite scientists advocating for it. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) established an experimental population of sea otters in 1986 at San Nicolas Island, but now there are proposals to terminate the program. There are debates between commercial fishermen and environmental groups on amending the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to manage sea otter populations and their potential conflicts with existing uses. Some suggest repealing the 1986 experimental population and translocation program to allow sea otters to expand freely. The discussion involves the potential repeal of the 1986 experimental population and translocation program for sea otters, allowing them to expand naturally. Congress must decide whether to address issues under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) reauthorization, the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), or separately. Congressional oversight may be needed to refocus federal agency implementation of existing laws. The contentious relationship between animal protection interests and holders of captive marine mammals has led to a shift in authority for regulating captive marine mammals to APHIS under the Animal Welfare Act. A negotiated rulemaking process involving various stakeholders was conducted to revise requirements for the humane handling, care, treatment, and transport of marine mammals in captivity. Some in the public display community support APHIS retaining authority over captive marine mammals due to its history of developing and enforcing standards, while the animal protection community may suggest returning jurisdiction to NMFS and FWS for better monitoring. The public display community views NMFS and FWS as lacking expertise in marine mammal care. Critics argue that giving NMFS and FWS jurisdiction over the animal husbandry sector would be costly and duplicative of APHIS's existing program. They believe that regulations for captive marine mammals should better align with their needs and be enforced more strictly, with less influence from the facilities being regulated. Critics argue for stricter regulations on captive marine mammal husbandry, suggesting that Congress should make successful husbandry techniques more openly available to benefit the industry. The 1994 MMPA amendments replaced export permit requirements with a 15-day federal agency notification prior to export. NMFS interprets export provisions as needing a letter of comity from the foreign government. Some animal protection advocates and scientists argue for reinstating export permit requirements for marine mammals to ensure their welfare during transfers between foreign nations. The current status of marine mammals exported from the US since the 1994 repeal is unknown, raising concerns within the animal protection community. Critics suggest amending the MMPA to restore original export requirements, potentially requiring a permit with a public comment period. Some suggest Congress require a full accounting of past exported marine mammals before allowing further exports. Recommendations include a $25,000 surety bond per exported marine mammal for emergency costs. Animal protection advocates propose mandatory on-site inspections of foreign facilities. The public display community believes current safeguards are sufficient and may seek to eliminate the 15-day prior agency notification requirement for exports. The public display community may want to amend the MMPA to treat marine mammal imports like exports, requiring agency notification but no permit or public comment. Animal protection advocates oppose this, preferring federal agency review and public comment to better protect marine mammals. Research on captive marine mammals has provided valuable information on marine mammal biology. Research on captive marine mammals is valuable for certain disciplines like physiology, immunology, nutrition, hearing sensitivity, and cognitive abilities. Some scientists suggest more research on how human activities impact marine animals. They argue that studying captive marine mammals provides unique opportunities for research not feasible in the wild and contributes valuable data for managing wild populations. However, some believe the MMPA restricts scientific research on captive marine mammals. Some critics question the benefits of research on captive marine mammals and propose amending the MMPA to require more focus on benefits. Other scientists oppose increasing regulations that may limit research opportunities. An alternative suggestion is to impose a research requirement on all facilities holding marine mammals, with mandatory peer review to justify research. The United States does not mandate blood tests for marine mammals destined for export. Critics argue that the United States does not require blood tests for marine mammals being exported, potentially allowing disease-carrying animals to infect other populations. Animal protection advocates suggest amending the MMPA or AWA to include more safeguards against transferring pathogens. Some extreme critics propose banning transferred animals from being placed elsewhere. Scientific critics recommend prohibiting transferred animals from being placed in open enclosures and suggest treating imported and exported marine mammals like exotic birds with quarantines and medical examinations. Some public display facilities believe regulations by APHIS address these concerns adequately. Medical examinations before transporting marine mammals have been a long-standing practice in zoos and aquariums, ensuring the animals' healthy condition before transfer. Managers of public display facilities are cautious about accepting marine mammals that could pose a pathogenic threat due to investment interests and the challenge of replacing animals. They argue that there is no evidence of captive marine mammals causing epidemiological issues in the wild. Necropsies on deceased marine mammals are conducted in-house by facility veterinarians, with reports kept on file for three years as per APHIS standards. Animal protection advocates are concerned about the lack of public access to necropsy information for marine mammals in captivity. They believe that the 1994 changes in necropsy policy, which no longer make necropsies public records, hinder efforts to protect the well-being of these animals. Critics fear that captive facilities may under-report or inadequately report necropsy findings, and they advocate for amending the MMPA to require standardized necropsy reports to be submitted to a federal agency. Animal protection advocates are pushing for standardized necropsy reports to be submitted to a federal agency, ensuring public access. They also propose independent veterinarians to perform necropsies within 48 hours of a marine mammal death. Scientists caution that delays in necropsies reduce the value of the findings and suggest utilizing veterinarians from public display facilities instead. Critics may propose amending the MMPA to require necropsies on all transferred animals. They also suggest more intensive inspections for facilities with high mortality rates. Facility managers defend their care practices and argue against suspicions of negligence. The need for legislation regarding necropsies on captive animals is unclear as rules are still being implemented. Controversy arises over who should pay for more expensive necropsies, with animal protection groups suggesting captive facilities cover the costs and managers arguing the government should bear the expenses. Some federal managers criticize release programs for genetic-mixing concerns, but similar issues have not been raised about animal movement between captive facilities. The U.S. Navy's use of dolphins in open-ocean training exercises has also sparked debate. The mixing of dolphins from different oceans during open-ocean training exercises has raised concerns among scientists, animal protection advocates, and environmentalists. They question the responsible management of genetic mixing and potential release into wild populations. Suggestions have been made to amend the MMPA to address genetic mixing when captive animals are moved between facilities. Some argue for genetic diversity within captive populations, while others advocate for caution to prevent unintended consequences. Some scientists recommend maintaining genetic diversity in species with small populations in captivity to counter inbreeding and reduce the need for acquiring wild animals. There are differing claims on the lifespan of marine mammals in captivity compared to the wild. Animal protection advocates suggest amending the MMPA to review survivorship in captive and wild marine mammal populations through a government workshop. A workshop may be needed to review survivorship in captive and wild marine mammal populations, considering the impact of local environmental conditions on animal health. Animal protection advocates propose amending the MMPA to mandate a study on the effects of urban noise, vibrations, and air pollution on captive animals. This study could help define abusive levels and improve captive care standards. Some in the public display community suggest addressing concerns administratively, noting previous APHIS rulemaking. Monitoring environmental effects on marine mammals is included in AZA guidelines. Due to closures of marine parks and surplus of captive marine mammals, interest in rehabilitating and releasing them to the wild has increased. Some animal protection advocates propose MMPA amendments for oversight of rehabilitation and release activities for marine mammals, including establishing scientific research permits and rehabilitation/release facilities. These facilities could implement captive rotation programs to promote the welfare of captive and free-living marine mammals, including threatened and endangered species. Some critics argue that rehabilitation and release programs for captive marine mammals may not be effective, as animals held in captivity or born in captivity may struggle to adjust to life in the wild. They oppose efforts to release long-captive animals due to concerns about their survival. Additionally, there are worries about the federal costs of such programs and the potential for unregulated releases by animal protection advocates. Some critics argue that captive marine parks in the U.S. lack the natural environment marine mammals need, with insufficient space for normal behavior and movement. They suggest amending the MMPA to set minimum standards for environmental and social stimuli for marine mammals. Establishing standards for captive marine mammals can be complex due to differing species requirements. Some believe overall size is crucial for cetaceans, while others emphasize geotopical elements for pinnipeds. Providing complex social systems in captivity is challenging. Some facilities offer interactive programs with dolphins, but critics argue these activities pose risks to both dolphins and humans. Critics argue that interactive programs with dolphins pose risks to both dolphins and humans, and believe that APHIS regulation of such activities is inadequate. APHIS suspended enforcement of AWA regulations for \"swim-with-the-dolphin\" programs in 1999 to gather public input on expanding regulations. Animal protection groups want stricter regulations or a ban on all interactive programs involving dolphins. Critics also point out inconsistencies in policies that protect wild dolphins from harassment but promote interactions with captive dolphins. Since 1990, 21 North American marine parks have closed, raising concerns about the welfare of captive marine mammals if research programs end or parks shut down. Animal protection advocates propose amending the MMPA to require a minimum of $25,000 per marine mammal in escrow or insurance for each transfer, import, and export, as well as for each captive-born marine mammal. These funds would be used if the federal government needs to temporarily care for animals from closed parks or cover transfer costs. Animal protection advocates are pushing to amend the MMPA to ban circuses and traveling shows from using marine mammals due to concerns about their well-being. The International Union for Conservation of Nature supports this, stating that capturing cetaceans for display is harmful. The removal of live cetaceans from the wild for captive display is equivalent to killing them, as they can no longer contribute to maintaining their populations. Live capture can be fatally stressful to animals and pose a serious threat to cetacean populations. Animal protection interests support amending the MMPA to prohibit wild captures for public display. Co-management agreements with dedicated funding have improved communication among Native subsistence users, Alaska Native organizations, and FWS, but Native Alaskan interests feel NMFS has been slower to implement co-management for marine mammals in Alaska. Some Native American interests may propose amending the MMPA to increase opportunities for Native Americans to co-manage marine mammal populations in Alaska, particularly in the Bering Sea region. Concerns exist about the decline of this marine ecosystem. Critics argue that current co-management provisions are sufficient and fear overhunting by Natives for economic gain. Some critics believe co-management works well only with federal support for national programs assessing population abundance and habitat conditions, as done for bowhead whales since the 1970s. Concerns include lagging reporting of subsistence kill levels and lack of transparency in cooperative agreements. Knowledge of animals killed is crucial for resource management. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) requires marking, tagging, and reporting of animals taken for subsistence purposes. While the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has a program for polar bears, walrus, and sea otters, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) lacks a similar program for species like Steller sea lions and harbor seals. Harvest estimates accuracy has been questioned, and some Alaska Native organizations conduct biosampling programs under cooperative agreements. Some in the Alaska Native and environmental communities are calling for NMFS to develop a Marine Mammal Tagging and Reporting Program (MTRP) similar to FWS's program. While the Alaska Native community generally accepts the FWS program, some managers and environmental interests believe more detailed data on subsistence takes is needed. Scientists and animal protection interests also want improvements to the FWS program for better data collection on subsistence harvests. Some suggest amending the MMPA to require reporting, marking, tagging, and sampling of marine mammals taken by Alaska Natives for subsistence. There are differing opinions on the practicality of tagging subsistence kills, especially for species taken in large numbers like seals. Better subsistence estimates are seen as necessary for the PBR process. The MMPA may need amending to consider better subsistence estimates in the PBR process, especially when subsistence harvest exceeds PBR levels. Alaska Natives in various locales, including Anchorage, sell marine mammal meat for consumption, raising concerns about hunting for commercial markets. Some suggest amending the MMPA to restrict commercial sale of marine mammal products, while others believe regulatory action can be taken without legislation. Alaskan Natives propose dealing with the issue internally using proven models. The Makah Tribe of Washington State petitioned the International Whaling Commission in 1996 for the right to harvest eastern Pacific gray whales as part of their cultural heritage negotiated in the 1855 Treaty of Neah Bay with the U.S. government. In 1997, a bilateral agreement between Russia and the U.S. allowed the Makah access to IWC aboriginal quota to kill four gray whales on average. The Makah Tribe gained access to IWC aboriginal quota to kill four gray whales annually from 1998 to 2002, sparking domestic and international disagreement. Concerns arise over the Makah's intentions for commercial trade in whale products, potentially reversing whale recovery efforts and prompting other northern cultures to demand their cultural right to resume whaling. Some groups, including Norwegians, Icelandics, Faroese, Irish, Japanese, and Russians, assert cultural traditions in whaling. Unlike the Makah, Canadian aboriginal groups do not have a recognized \"right to whale\" by treaty. Suggestions include amending the MMPA to differentiate between subsistence and non-subsistence whaling, with stricter criteria for non-subsistence whaling. There are also proposals to ensure that the United States does not undermine the effectiveness of the IWC. The authority of Congress to take action in this regard is uncertain. Several parties suggest that policy relating to \"subsistence\" is confused and needs clarification, requiring attention to both ethics/tradition and biology/ecology for resolution. The confusion was exacerbated by the interaction of western technologies and economies on traditional beliefs and practices, leading to conflicts between federal and Alaskan laws. Reported annual walrus kills in St. Lawrence Island communities appear excessive and questionable as \"subsistence\" to some managers, scientists, and animal protection groups. FWS regulations on the use of meat, skin, etc., are minimal. Some suggest amending the MMPA to align subsistence policy with biological and ecological needs, with cultural values as secondary. Issues persist with the export of marine mammal products by Alaska Natives. In 1999, U.S. Customs seized whalebone and sealskin marionettes for violating the MMPA. The MMPA may be amended to be less restrictive on cultural exchanges involving marine mammal products, such as allowing polar bear sport hunting in Alaska under a strict quota. This proposal is supported by the sport hunting community for better polar bear management and funding for research. However, animal protection advocates oppose this idea and may seek to repeal the 1994 amendments allowing the import of polar bear trophies from Canada. Advocates disagree with the theory that sport hunting promotes sustainable management. FWS proposed listing polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. MMPA allows permits for incidental take of marine mammals, but lacks a program for large incidental takes. Regulatory burden for protecting marine mammals falls disproportionately on different industries. NMFS does not regulate large commercial vessel traffic under the small incidental take program, despite concerns about serious injury and mortality of cetaceans due to vessel strikes. Other activities that may harm marine mammals include whale-watching vessels, high-speed ferries, and recreational jet skis. Small take permits can be issued for up to five years, with an intent for renewability. NMFS claims that most permits limit harm to a small number of animals through mitigation measures. Proposed amendments to the MMPA may address this issue. Some individuals, like jet ski and whale-watching operators, may oppose modified permitting procedures that impose additional restrictions. Environmentalists suggest a separate management scheme to protect marine mammals from vessel impacts and noise pollution. Anthropogenic noise poses a unique threat to marine mammals, propagating both horizontally and vertically in the ocean. Seismic exploration, explosives trials, and acoustic harassment devices used by fishermen can impact marine life. Research is ongoing to understand the effects of noise on marine mammals, but there is still much unknown. Noise pollution poses a significant threat to marine mammals, leading to speculation and misinformation. FWS and NMFS are addressing specific concerns related to noise impacts on marine life. Some scientists propose amending the MMPA to simplify federal authorization for incidental taking from acoustic noise by regulating impacts collectively as broad categories or classes of sound-producing activity. This approach aims to address the lack of guidance or regulations concerning anthropogenic noise and the absence of systematic monitoring or enforcement programs by FWS and NMFS. Some in the scientific community argue for changes in regulations regarding anthropogenic noise, citing unregulated sources like personal watercraft and ships, disproportionate burdens on researchers, and the comparative levels of human-made sound to natural ocean activity. The impact of active sonar on marine mammals by the military is also a concern. The effects of active sonar on marine mammals, particularly beaked whales, have been a cause for concern. Mass strandings and deaths of whales have been observed in various locations coinciding with sonar testing and naval activities. The U.S. Navy uses high-powered sound waves to map the ocean floor, facing regulatory challenges and legal battles over low frequency active sonar deployment. Concerns over environmental impact have led to the preparation of a supplemental environmental impact statement. Critics highlight the harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on marine life, particularly citing mass mortalities of beaked whales linked to military sonar use. Critics are concerned about the harmful effects of military active sonar on marine mammals and believe current mitigation practices are inadequate. They advocate for a precautionary approach and oppose any actions that could relax regulations on anthropogenic noise sources, especially low-frequency sound. Critics suggest regulating non-research-related noise more aggressively to reduce harassment of marine life. A proposal to fund research on the effects of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals is supported by various groups. Federal scientists are calling for amendments to the MMPA to streamline the process of obtaining research permits, questioning the need for cumbersome procedures within federal agencies. They suggest providing blanket authorization for research to agency scientists. Some suggest granting blanket authorization for federally funded research to streamline permitting processes, including an expedited review for studies without public challenge. Nonfederal scientists and advocates emphasize the need for regular reporting and peer/public review to prevent political influence and ensure equal scrutiny for all researchers. Some scientists criticize federal management agencies for delays in processing scientific research permits, suggesting the need for committees of scientists to review applications. Critics report delays in permit processing and publication for public comment, proposing amendments to expedite the review process. Some scientists suggest the need for committees to review scientific research permit applications, citing concerns about misuse by certain operators. They also express worries about permit restrictions hindering manipulative research on marine mammals. Streamlining the permit process, especially addressing burdensome procedural requirements, is recommended. Scientists and animal protection advocates have differing views on the regulatory requirements for research permits related to marine mammal harassment. Scientists feel the requirements are overly burdensome and restrictive, while advocates argue they are necessary for invasive research. Streamlining the permitting process for low harassment potential research is suggested. The permitting process for certain research with low harassment potential or streamlined programmatic permitting for specific research types is a point of disagreement between environmental and animal protection communities. Some scientists argue that state review of federal marine mammal permits is duplicative and burdensome, potentially circumventing procedures in the MMPA. Three states require approval of federal permits under the MMPA in their coastal plans. Critics suggest that Congress should review this process for improvement. Some scientists and critics propose re-evaluating the definition of take in the MMPA to establish a more enforceable standard for interactions with marine mammals. They suggest amending the MMPA to focus on interactions likely to have adverse biological effects on individual animals or populations. However, animal protection advocates and environmental groups may oppose any changes that could be seen as reducing the scope of prohibited activities. The U.S. government faces pressure from the WTO on trade barriers in environmental statutes. Importing marine mammals into the U.S. is generally prohibited, with exceptions for research, public display, photography, and species recovery. Additional restrictions on trade come from the ESA and CITES. Some suggest amending the MMPA to allow limited trade in marine mammal products to avoid a WTO challenge. This proposal is opposed by environmental groups fearing increased kills and inconsistency in U.S. policy. The United States is facing challenges regarding the availability of foreign marine mammal products in its market, which could lead to illegal harvests of domestic marine mammals. Populations of California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals are increasing along the West Coast, causing conflicts with fishermen and the public. The National Marine Fisheries Service has delivered a report to Congress on managing these growing populations, which will be an issue during the MMPA reauthorization. The issue of managing increasing populations of California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals on the West Coast during MMPA reauthorization is a concern. Some fear over-population, while others believe populations are returning to historic levels after past exploitation. Suggestions have been made to amend the MMPA for selective culling or nuisance animal control. NMFS recommends creating a new framework for state involvement. NMFS suggests amending the MMPA to allow for the lethal removal of California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals in specific conflict situations. This streamlined approach would address harm to salmon populations and conflicts with human activities. Critics oppose culls and lethal control methods. Critics oppose the idea of culls and lethal control methods for nuisance animal control, arguing that resources should be focused on addressing other human activities contributing to fish stock declines. They believe non-lethal deterrents should be explored further and express concern that killing marine mammals conflicts with the MMPA's ecosystem management mandate. Additionally, they argue against authorizing nuisance animal control for human activities like aquaculture that can be sited to avoid conflicts with marine mammals. Limited international cooperation exists under the MMPA for marine mammal issues, with funding and research focused mainly on the dolphin/tuna industry. Proponents argue for increased cooperation, pointing out the lack of a similar program for marine mammals compared to other endangered species. For example, the North Atlantic right whale remains endangered while the southern right whale population is thriving. The right whale project aims to reduce human/whale interactions, particularly ship strikes. Cooperative activities may include sharing monitoring and collision avoidance procedures, as well as whale reproduction and population information with Latin American authorities. Marine mammal scientists suggest promoting international cooperative relationships on marine mammals by U.S. agencies. Efforts to encourage more international cooperation are supported by most marine mammal constituencies, as long as it does not promote invasive research or commercial ventures. There is a critical need for expanding international cooperative programs for Arctic species due to the decline of Russian research and management programs. The decline of Russian management efforts has hindered population assessment programs for shared marine mammal species. Critics warn that specific language is needed in Congress to prevent potential abuse of funds and ensure international efforts are reciprocal and relevant. The 1994 MMPA amendments revised the definition of harassment to distinguish between two levels of interaction. Some federal managers struggle to enforce the new definition of level B harassment under the MMPA, leading to ongoing human interaction with marine mammals. Critics call for stricter regulations on whale-watching vessels and increased fines for operators who disturb dolphins and whales. Suggestions include amending the MMPA to require better enforcement of regulations against harassment by swimmers, kayakers, and boaters, as well as providing more funding for education and enforcement efforts. Some scientists advocate for revising the definition of level B harassment under MMPA to only apply in situations posing a significant threat to entire marine mammal stocks. Changes to the harassment definition for military operations and scientific research were enacted in P.L. 108-136, defining harassment as actions that \"injure\" or have the potential to injure marine mammals. Environmental and animal protection groups oppose the modified definition, arguing it raises the burden of proof. Opponents of the modified definition of harassment in the MMPA argue that it raises the burden of proof for protecting marine mammals, while supporters believe it ensures restrictions are based on scientific evidence. The controversy surrounding these changes may be revisited during MMPA reauthorization. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) divides species management between NMFS and FWS, causing confusion in the fishing industry and Alaska Natives. Some suggest Congress should reconsider this division to promote consistency in marine mammal management. Various approaches, including an ecosystem-based strategy, are proposed to minimize conflicts of interest between marine mammals and fisheries. The MMPA does not establish a national integrated marine mammal research program, leading to a lack of direction on how research should be pursued. Specific research needs include investigations on the impacts of pinniped predation on salmonid populations and studies on the skeletal anatomies of different salmonid species for prey identification. The need for a national integrated marine mammal research program is highlighted, with specific research areas including the impacts of pinniped predation on salmonid populations, site-specific abundance and distribution of pinnipeds, and socioeconomic studies on fisheries impacts. Suggestions have been made for Congress to consider creating a research program under the Marine Mammal Commission with specific funding authorized. Some scientists suggest that conflicting federal agency interests may hinder marine mammal protection and recovery. An example of this issue is the potential for endocrine disruption in marine mammals. Critics propose amending the MMPA to have an external panel review federal management agencies for conflicting interests and recommend actions. Frustration arose over federal agency delays in implementing provisions of the 1994 MMPA amendments. Critics in conservation and animal protection communities, as well as the fishing industry, are frustrated with federal agency delays in implementing 1994 MMPA amendments. Agencies blame limited funds from Congress for the delays. Suggestions include conducting a study on agency administration and addressing the issue of repeated failure to meet deadlines. Funding concerns are also highlighted in the \"Appropriation of Agency Funding\" section. Federal agency responsibilities have expanded faster than their budgets due to declining federal appropriations. Implementing the MMPA requires coordination among NMFS, FWS, and MMC, but they claim to be underfunded. Critics and advocates argue that Congress has not provided sufficient funding for these efforts. Congress may need to amend the MMPA to increase funding for marine mammal programs of NMFS, FWS, and MMC to meet public expectations and avoid criticism. Despite challenges in implementation, Congress has enacted measures to protect marine mammals. Various concerns presented in the report await Congress's decision on funding allocation. The report presented to Congress highlights various concerns regarding marine mammal issues, including noise in the marine environment, protection for whales, Makah whaling, and captive animal welfare. Different interest groups such as Native Alaskans, fishermen, sport hunters, and animal protection organizations may bring attention to additional issues. Congressional oversight during the reauthorization process is expected to identify more issues. Despite the MMPA's authorization of appropriations expiring in FY1999, Congress has separately considered amendments to the MMPA. During the 106th Congress, hearings were held on the Marine Mammal Protection Act, focusing on implementing 1994 amendments. The 107th Congress also discussed reauthorizing the Act in 2001. During the 108th Congress, hearings were held on reauthorizing the Marine Mammal Protection Act. H.R. 2693 and H.R. 3316 were introduced to amend and reauthorize the MMPA through FY2008. Hearings were conducted on these bills in 2003 and 2004, but no further action was taken. The oversight field hearing in San Diego, California focused on the increasing interactions between marine mammals and humans. H.R. 5104 aimed to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and authorize appropriations for the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program through FY2009. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 2130 and H.R. 4075 proposed extensive amendments to the MMPA and authorized appropriations for various programs. Title IV of S. 1224 aimed to encourage the development of fishing gear that is less harmful to marine mammals and expand the fisheries participating in the MMPA incidental take program. The MMPA incidental take program was expanded to include recreational fisheries, stock assessments, and observer programs. International agreements were directed to protect cetaceans from fishing gear, and a grant program was authorized for less harmful fishing gear development. H.R. 2939 proposed transferring marine mammal management to NOAA, while H.R. 3839 aimed to amend the MMPA goals for reducing incidental mortality in commercial fishing. H.R. 6241 sought to authorize taking of California sea lions to reduce predation on endangered salmon. For more legislative updates on marine mammals in the 110th Congress, refer to CRS Report RL33813. Two ocean commissions recently released reports on marine mammals, with recommendations on various ocean policy issues including governance, education, coastal development, human health, environmental quality, energy resources, and ocean science. The Pew Oceans Commission report was released on June 4, 2003, and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy's preliminary report was issued on April 20, 2004. For more information on these reports and their recommendations, refer to CRS Report RL33603. The CRS takes no position on the recommendations of the two recent reports on marine mammals."
