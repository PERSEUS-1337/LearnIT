    "content": "The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-242) was amended in March 2011 to extend funding deadlines. Two additional amendments (P.L. 112-4 and P.L. 112-6) provided interim funding through April 8, 2011, cutting discretionary budget authority for FY2011 by $10 billion. This included reductions in funding for various programs and earmarks. The L-HHS-ED appropriations were reduced by $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Program reductions totaling $10 billion were enacted in two CRs and were originally proposed in H.R. 1. The House passed H.R. 1 on February 19, 2011, which would have reduced overall non-emergency discretionary budget authority by $61.5 billion from FY2010 levels. The Senate rejected H.R. 1 and a substitute amendment offered by Senator Inouye, with funding reductions proposed in the Senate amendment below FY2010 levels. The House passed H.R. 1255 on April 1, 2011, which included potentially controversial policy riders affecting L-HHS-ED funding. The curr_chunk discusses prohibitions on spending for health care reform laws, funding for Planned Parenthood, and Department of Education rules on federal student aid. It also mentions CRS reports on FY2011 appropriations and related bills. The President signed H.R. 3081, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, which provided temporary funding for government agencies until March 4, 2011. The law was amended multiple times to extend funding and provide for special situations. Funding levels were similar to FY2010 appropriations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3686 for FY2011 L-HHS-ED appropriations, recommending $171.1 billion in discretionary funds. The House L-HHS-ED Appropriations Subcommittee approved a draft bill but the full committee did not take further action. President Obama submitted his FY2011 budget to Congress, requesting $171.7 billion in discretionary funds for programs covered in the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill. The legislative status of FY2011 L-HHS-ED appropriations is summarized in Table 1. The report discusses the President's request and the Senate Appropriations Committee bill from the 111th Congress, with data based on the August 24, 2010, table from the Senate Committee. The FY2011 proposals are based on the August 24, 2010 table from the Senate Committee on Appropriations. Funding amounts are rounded to the nearest million, with dollar and percent changes based on unrounded amounts. FY2010 appropriations reflect enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, with some amounts affected by transfers or adjustments. Laws providing supplemental appropriations, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are not included in the FY2010 data. The FY2011 budget proposals are based on data from the Senate Committee on Appropriations, with funding amounts rounded to the nearest million. The data includes information on laws such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Supplemental Appropriations Act, and an unnamed law funding education jobs and Medicaid. The Department of Education request amounts were revised after the Senate committee table was published. The report highlights President Obama's FY2011 appropriations proposals for L-HHS-ED programs, focusing on discretionary programs. It excludes funding from other appropriations bills and entitlements outside the annual appropriations process. Mandatory programs like Medicare and Social Security are not covered. For more budget terms and resources, refer to the Appendix. The L-HHS-ED bill is a significant appropriations bill that funds various federal departments and agencies, including the Social Security Administration. It is known for its controversial nature due to funding size and program scope, with restrictions on federal funds for abortion and research on human embryos and stem cells. Discretionary funding in the bill is less than one-quarter of the total, making it the largest source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs. The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for various federal departments and agencies, including the Social Security Administration. It is known for its controversial nature due to funding size and program scope, with restrictions on federal funds for abortion and research on human embryos and stem cells. The bill includes overview tables on funding, 302(b) allocations, and advance appropriations. Table 2 summarizes appropriations enacted for FY2010 and proposed for FY2011, including discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Program level discretionary appropriations reflect total discretionary funding in the bill, including advance funding for future years. Current year discretionary appropriations represent discretionary appropriations in a given bill for the current year, plus appropriations enacted in prior years. These appropriations are measured against 302(b) allocation ceilings as the congressional appropriations process unfolds. Media reports and Administration comments typically focus on current year discretionary totals rather than program levels in the bill. Advance appropriations are funds that become available after the fiscal year for which they are enacted. Programs like Special Education State Grants included in the FY2010 act may not be spent before FY2011. Scorekeeping adjustments are made for special funding situations monitored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Appropriations may consist of budget authority enacted in various years, with program level appropriations and current year appropriations being commonly used measures. Program level funding is calculated as current year plus advances for future years, minus advances from prior years, and minus scorekeeping adjustments. Table 2 displays discretionary funding amounts, mandatory program funding levels, and the total for L-HHS-ED. Appropriations bills for L-HHS-ED include both mandatory and discretionary funds, with appropriations committees having full control. The appropriations committees fully control discretionary funds, while mandatory funding levels are modified through authorizing legislation. L-HHS-ED discretionary funds grew by 30% from $127.2 billion in FY2002 to $164.9 billion in FY2010. The annual L-HHS-ED appropriations act typically includes five titles providing appropriations and program direction for various departments. The L-HHS-ED appropriations act typically includes five titles providing appropriations and program direction for various departments, such as the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. Each title contains specific program directions, modifications, or restrictions conveyed in bill language. Title IV covers funding for 14 related agencies, with Title V containing general provisions of broader policy application. Occasionally, additional titles may be included, which could be legislative language rather than appropriations provisions. Table 4 summarizes program level discretionary spending for FY2010 and proposed for FY2011, comparing with current year totals. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees determine maximum budget authority for annual appropriations acts under procedures laid out by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Congress establishes 302(a) allocations through the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, setting maximum spending totals for the appropriations committees. The Committees then subdivide their allocations to fund their bills. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees establish 302(b) allocations for each subcommittee, enforcing budget discipline by setting maximum discretionary budget authority. These allocations can be adjusted as appropriations bills progress. The allocations for FY2011 L-HHS-ED appropriations are shown in Table 5, with comparisons to FY2010. Both 302(a) and 302(b) allocations are often contested issues. Advance appropriations occur when funds are allocated. Advance appropriations occur when funds enacted in one fiscal year are not available for obligation until a subsequent fiscal year. For example, P.L. 111-117 provided $445 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for use in FY2012. These appropriations help with long-term budget planning for recipients like state and local educational systems. However, the contentious aspect is how they are counted in budget ceilings, as they avoid current year limits but must be counted when first available for obligation. The procedure involves advance appropriations for federal discretionary programs, including L-HHS-ED programs. President George W. Bush's proposal to eliminate advance appropriations was rejected by Congress. Discretionary appropriations for the Department of Labor were $13,534 million for FY2010 and $13,972 million for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $13,907 million for FY2011. Mandatory DOL programs were funded at $3.1 billion for FY2010. In FY2010, mandatory DOL programs were funded at $3.1 billion, including various benefits and administrative expenses. President Obama's FY2011 budget request and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for DOL programs. Funding amounts are rounded to the nearest million in Table 7. The President requested $3,581 million for the Unemployment Compensation program, a 10.0% increase from FY2010. He also requested a 10.9% increase for youth training and a 5.3% increase for adult training. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to the President's request, but would provide less funding for both youth and adult training programs. The Administration requested reduced funding for the Community Service Employment for Older Americans Program and an increase in benefits and training under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to both requests. Additionally, the Administration requested increased funding for the Wage and Hour Division and the Occupational Safety. The President's request includes a $14 million increase for OSHA and a $22 million increase for ILAB. The Senate Appropriations Committee would provide $1 million more for OSHA and $2 million more for ILAB than the President's request. The budget also includes $50 million for a State Paid Leave Fund to establish paid leave programs for workers. The Senate Appropriations Committee would provide $10 million for the Career Pathways Innovation Fund, which replaced the Community-Based Job Training Grants program in FY2010. The Administration did not request any money for this fund for FY2011, instead supporting the American Graduation Initiative for community colleges. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to eliminate appropriations for the Career Pathways Innovation Fund, noting funding in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. ARRA provided an additional $4.8 billion for DOL programs in FY2009, with some funds available for FY2011. In FY2011, DOL program-specific plans for spending funds are available online. DOL budget details can be found on their website. The Obama Administration requested $74,699 million for HHS in FY2011, an increase from FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee included $75,005 million in discretionary funding for HHS, an increase over the request and FY2010. Mandatory HHS programs in the L-HHS-ED act were funded at $537.3 billion in FY2010, primarily consisting of Medicaid Grants to States and Payments to Health Care Trust Funds. In FY2011, HHS received $75,005 million in discretionary funding from the Senate Appropriations Committee, an increase from the Obama Administration's request of $74,699 million. Mandatory HHS programs in the L-HHS-ED act were funded at $537.3 billion in FY2010, including Medicaid Grants to States and Payments to Health Care Trust Funds. In FY2011, HHS received $75,005 million in discretionary funding from the Senate Appropriations Committee, an increase from the Obama Administration's request of $74,699 million. The funding amounts in Table 9 are rounded to the nearest million, and dollar changes and percent changes discussed in the text are based on unrounded amounts. The Public Health Service Evaluation Set-Aside program provides additional funding to some HHS programs beyond their regular appropriations. The Public Health Service Evaluation Set-Aside program allows the Secretary of HHS to redistribute a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations for program evaluation purposes. Congress specifies the maximum percentage for the set-aside in the annual L-HHS-ED act. Funding amounts from the set-aside are not counted in the totals of appropriated funds but are included in the calculation of a program's or agency's \"program level\" funding amount. This reflects funding available from various sources, not just the annual appropriated amount. The President requested increased funding for community health centers and workforce training programs. The Senate committee recommended level funding for NHSC and noted additional funding from PPACA. The committee increased funding for nursing programs by $48 million (20%) and Title VII programs by $104 million (41%) for FY2011. HRSA Health Care-Related Facilities and Activities received $337 million in non-competitive grants for construction and renovation in FY2010. The President requested $100 million for grants to develop medical schools in health professional shortage areas, while the Senate committee recommended $156 million for specific projects. The CDC appropriation for FY2011 saw a $130 million (2.0%) increase recommended by the Senate committee. The Senate committee recommended a $130 million (2.0%) increase in CDC's FY2011 appropriation. This increase was partially offset by a $214 million decrease in funding for certain programs. Additionally, the committee proposed transferring $663 million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund to CDC. Funding for CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) would see a 22% increase. The Senate committee recommended a 22% increase in funding for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), with a $79 million increase for the World Trade Center program. The committee also recommended a $1 billion (3.2%) increase for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to address a potential funding cliff in FY2011 due to the decrease in stimulus funding from the previous year. The committee recommended a $1 billion increase for NIH in FY2011, including $50 million for the Cures Acceleration Network. SAMHSA received a 3% increase to $3.5 billion, with a $20 million boost for Substance Abuse Prevention. AHRQ saw a proposed 54% increase to $611 million, with a focus on patient-centered health research. The Senate committee allocated $397 million for AHRQ funding, with $35 million for comparative effectiveness research (CER). CMS received a $250 million increase for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Initiative, and a $104 million increase for Program Management. The President requested a $131 million increase for CMS Program Management, but the Senate committee recommended $27 million less. The President requested a $1.8 billion decrease (35%) in discretionary funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), with a legislative proposal for additional mandatory funding if energy prices rise. The Senate committee agreed to $3.3 billion discretionary funding, assuming an additional $2.0 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $5.3 billion. For ACF Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs, the President requested $878 million, while the Senate committee recommended an increase to $835 million. The President also requested $2,927 million for the ACF Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), a $800 million increase (38%). The President requested a $2,927 million increase for the ACF Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), while the Senate committee recommended a $3,127 million funding level to maintain ARRA levels. Funding for the ACF Head Start program was increased by $990 million to $8,224 million, and the Administration on Aging (AoA) received a $143 million increase to $1,659 million for aging services programs. The President's request included a $136 million decrease in appropriations for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) account, reducing it to $1,211 million. The Senate committee recommended $1,197 million in discretionary funding, $14 million less than the request. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development funding within PHSSEF was proposed for a $136 million increase to $476 million, which the Senate committee agreed with. The Senate committee agreed to transfer funding from the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund for pandemic influenza preparedness. The President requested a decrease in funding for FY2011, with plans to use supplemental funds from FY2009 for contingencies. Funding for needle and syringe exchange programs was prohibited in FY2010 appropriations act. The FY2010 appropriations act replaced the ban on funding needle and syringe exchange programs with a prohibition on funding in locations deemed inappropriate by local public health or law enforcement agencies. ARRA provided HHS with $21.9 billion in discretionary funding for FY2009, with funds continuing to be obligated in FY2011 and beyond. HHS program-specific spending plans and Recovery Act reports can be found online. Annual L-HHS-ED appropriations regularly include restrictions on federal funds for abortions. Restrictions on federal funds for abortions, known as the \"Hyde Amendments,\" apply to L-HHS-ED funds, including Medicaid. Changes have been made over the years, allowing funding for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. The FY1998 and FY1999 appropriations extended these provisions to prohibit federal funds from buying managed care packages with abortion coverage, except in specific circumstances. The FY1998 Hyde Amendments added provisions to apply restrictions to all trust fund programs, including Medicare, and prohibited Medicare Advantage plans from requiring abortion services. The FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations added the \"Weldon Amendment\" to prevent discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide abortion services. The FY2006 through FY2010 appropriations retained the Weldon amendment and Hyde restrictions. The current provisions can be found in \u00a7507 and \u00a7508 of P.L. 111-117. The Dickey Amendment, enacted in 1996, prohibits the use of funds for human embryo research. President Bush imposed restrictions on federal funding for stem cell research in 2001, which were lifted by President Obama in 2009. NIH guidelines from 2009 govern human embryonic stem cell research. The Dickey Amendment prohibits federal funds for human embryo research. President Obama lifted restrictions on stem cell research funding in 2009. Current regulations govern human embryonic stem cell research and approval for use in federally funded research. A court case challenges the use of federal funds for this research. Appropriations details for HHS offices and programs show an increase in discretionary funding requested for FY2011. The FY2011 budget recommended $67,032 million in discretionary funding, $2,755 million more than FY2010. The Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants program received $3,085 million in FY2010. Both the President's budget and the Senate Committee recommended level funding for the program in FY2011. The original budget proposed restructuring the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but a revised budget request was made due to the lack of reauthorization. The revised budget based on the current ESEA was made available by ED. The Pell grant program is treated as discretionary for comparison purposes, although it is proposed to become mandatory in FY2011. Both the President's FY2011 budget request and the Senate Appropriations Committee's recommendations would increase funding for some programs and eliminate others. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $14,942 million in discretionary funding for ESEA Title I-A Education Grants. Funding amounts in Table 11 are rounded to the nearest million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $14,942 million in discretionary funding for ESEA Title I-A Education Grants for the Disadvantaged, an increase of $450 million (3.1%) over FY2010 funding. The President's budget proposed funding of $900 million for School Improvement Grants in FY2011, $354 million (64.9%) above FY2010 funding. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding of $625 million for School Improvement Grants for FY2011, an increase of $79 million (14.5%) above FY2010 funding. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended expanding the mission of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, and would provide funding of $1,266 million, an increase of $100 million (8.6%) over FY2010. The President's budget proposed funding for Race to the Top at $1,350 million and Investing in Innovation at $500 million in FY2011. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding Race to the Top at $675 million and Investing in Innovation at $250 million. The President also proposed increasing funding for the Teacher Incentive Fund to $800 million and the Promise Neighborhoods Initiative to $210 million in FY2011. The President proposed increasing funding for the Promise Neighborhoods Initiative to $210 million in FY2011, a significant increase from FY2010. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also recommended funding for Promise Neighborhoods, but at a lower amount of $20 million. Additionally, there were proposed increases in funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and other education programs. The Obama Administration requested a higher budget for Related Agencies in FY2011 compared to FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $15,195 million for Related Agencies in FY2011, a 7.9% increase from FY2010. Mandatory programs for Related Agencies in the L-HHS-ED bill were funded at $47.3 billion for FY2010, mainly for the Supplemental Security Income program. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested $12,378 million for administrative expenses for the Social Security Administration. The President requested $12,378 million for administrative expenses for the Social Security Administration (SSA), which is $932 million more than the amount provided for FY2010.

The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $1,366 million for the CNCS, $50 million less than the President's request. The President also requested $50,138 million for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, $2,838 million more than FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to the President's request for funding. They would provide $3 million for the National Health Care Workforce Commission, created by the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act. In FY2009, the ARRA provided an additional $1.2 billion in discretionary funding for Related Agencies, with plans developed for spending the money. Appropriations details for offices and major programs of the L-HHS-ED Related Agencies are shown in Table 13. Key budget terms used in the report are based on CRS Report 98-720, Manual on the Federal Budget Process. Advance appropriation is budget authority that becomes available in a fiscal year beyond the one for which the appropriations act is enacted. Scorekeeping counts the entire amount in the fiscal year it first becomes available for obligation. Appropriation is budget authority that allows federal agencies to incur obligations and make payments for specified purposes. Annual appropriations are provided in appropriations acts, while most permanent appropriations are in substantive law. Major types of appropriations include regular, supplemental, and continuing. Budget authority is the legal authority to incur financial obligations. Budget authority includes appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority. It also covers the subsidy cost of direct loans and loan guarantees. The budget resolution outlines the congressional budget for at least five fiscal years, including various budget totals and functional allocations. Discretionary spending is annual appropriations, while entitlement authority allows payments to eligible recipients as legally binding obligations. Entitlement authority is a legally binding obligation funded by annual or permanent appropriations acts. Forward funding allows budget authority to be available into the next fiscal year. Mandatory spending is provided in laws other than annual appropriations acts. Rescission cancels previously enacted budget authority. Scorekeeping tracks congressional budgetary actions. Supplemental appropriations provide funds in addition to regular appropriations. Websites with information on budget and appropriations can be found at various sites for House and Senate Committees, Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Congressional Research Service (CRS), Government Accountability Office (GAO), Government Printing Office (GPO), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs) can also be accessed online."
