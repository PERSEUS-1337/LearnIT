    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2007\". The purpose of the Act is outlined in the findings and purpose section. Congress finds a compelling need to establish national protection for inventoried roadless areas of the National Forest System to protect their unique social and ecological values, including benefits such as healthy watersheds, clean water supply, wildlife habitats, outdoor recreation, and drinking water provision. The protection of roadless areas is essential for maintaining undisturbed conditions, saving communities money on water filtration, preserving clean water flow, providing habitats for imperiled species, and conserving native biodiversity. Roadless areas offer various recreational activities and contain sacred sites for Native Americans. The Forest Service aims to manage these areas for both resource extraction and conservation. The Act protects social and ecological values in inventoried roadless areas while allowing for multiple uses. It establishes a national policy for their protection to consider long-term benefits, reduce controversy, and enable the Chief of the Forest Service. The Act enables the Chief of the Forest Service to focus on reducing hazardous fuel buildups in roaded areas, as fires are more likely to occur in these areas near communities and accessible watersheds. The Forest Service has a backlog of maintenance needs for the existing road system. The Forest Service has a backlog of maintenance needs for the existing 386,000 mile road system, costing millions to eliminate. Failure to maintain forest roads limits public access and causes degradation of water quality and wildlife habitat. Protecting roadless areas will have minimal impact on national timber supply and oil/gas production. The purpose of this Act is to provide lasting protection for inventoried roadless areas within the National Forest System, within the context of multiple-use management. Roadless areas only contribute a fraction of the oil and gas production in the National Forest System, compared to the United States as a whole. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a \"classified road\" is defined as a road within or near National Forest System land for long-term motor vehicle access. It includes various types of roads authorized by the Forest Service. An \"inventoried roadless area\" is an area identified in a roadless area map. A \"responsible official\" is a Forest Service officer or employee with decision-making authority. The Act grants authority to make decisions on protecting and managing inventoried roadless areas. It defines terms like \"road,\" \"road construction,\" \"road improvement,\" and \"road maintenance.\" Road maintenance involves ongoing upkeep necessary to retain or restore roads according to management objectives. Road realignment creates a new location for part of an existing road and treats the old roadway. Road reconstruction improves or realigns existing classified roads. Roadless area characteristics include high-quality soil, water, and air resources found in inventoried roadless areas. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of preserving high-quality soil, water, and air, sources of public drinking water, diverse plant and animal communities, habitats for threatened species, primitive recreation areas, reference landscapes, and natural scenic landscapes. The curr_chunk defines terms related to roadless areas, including roadless area map, Secretary, and temporary road. An unclassified road on National Forest System land is not managed as part of the forest transportation system and includes unplanned roads, abandoned travelways, or off-road vehicle tracks that have not been designated as trails. It also includes roads that were once permitted but not decommissioned after the authorization ended. PROHIBITION ON ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION IN ROADLESS AREAS. Prohibition on road construction and reconstruction in inventoried roadless areas of the National Forest System, except in cases of imminent threat to public health and safety, response actions under environmental laws, or natural resource restoration actions. The curr_chunk discusses the need for road construction or realignment in specific situations, such as natural resource restoration actions, reserved rights, or to prevent irreparable resource damage. It emphasizes the importance of essential public or private access, natural resource management, and public health and safety in road realignment decisions. The curr_chunk outlines the criteria for road reconstruction projects, including public interest, land reservation purposes, and the absence of reasonable alternatives. It also mentions the need for roads in conjunction with mineral lease renewals. The criteria for road construction or reconstruction projects in conjunction with mineral lease renewals include minimizing surface resource effects, preventing unnecessary disturbance, and complying with laws and lease requirements. Roads must be removed when no longer needed. The road must be removed when it is no longer needed for the lease or when the lease expires. Additionally, a classified road in an inventoried roadless area may be maintained. Prohibition on timber cutting, sale, or removal in inventoried roadless areas. Exceptions to the prohibition of cutting, selling, or removing timber in inventoried roadless areas include cases where it is determined to be infrequent and necessary for improving habitat for threatened species or maintaining roadless area characteristics. Exceptions to the prohibition of cutting, selling, or removing timber in inventoried roadless areas include cases where it is necessary to maintain or restore ecosystem composition and structure, incidental to a management activity, for personal or administrative use, or when roadless characteristics have been substantially altered. Exceptions to cutting, selling, or removing timber in inventoried roadless areas include cases where roadless characteristics have been substantially altered due to road construction and timber harvest, with timber activities limited to the altered portion. SEC. 6 allows the Secretary to modify roadless area maps for accuracy and inclusiveness, following specific requirements. Environmental impact statements are necessary for evaluation. SEC. 7 defines the scope and applicability of these modifications. This Act does not affect existing permits, contracts, or legal instruments for National Forest System land issued before January 12, 2001. It does not require changes to land management plans or decisions made before that date. The Act also does not apply to certain activities in the Tongass National Forest if an environmental impact statement was published before January 12, 2001. The prohibitions and restrictions in this Act cannot be revised. The Act prohibits any reconsideration, revision, or rescission of decisions made under it in future project decisions or amendments to land management plans."
