    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The \"Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act\" defines \"authorized medical research\" as studies conducted to determine the medical benefits of marijuana or cannabidiol, by registered institutions, practitioners, or manufacturers. \"Cannabidiol\" refers to the nonpsychoactive substance derived from marijuana or synthetic formulations. The \"Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act\" defines terms related to controlled substances and institutions of higher education for conducting authorized medical research on cannabidiol derived from marijuana or synthetic formulations. The \"Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act\" defines terms related to controlled substances, including the registration requirements under the Controlled Substances Act, the definition of \"drug\" under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act, the term \"registered manufacturer,\" and the definition of \"State.\" SEC. 3. PROCEEDINGS FOR CONTROL, TRANSFER, OR REMOVAL OF CANNABIDIOL. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services must complete a scientific and medical evaluation on cannabidiol within a year. If the evaluation warrants control, transfer, or removal of cannabidiol, proceedings will be initiated under the Controlled Substances Act. The Attorney General will amend regulations regarding controlled substances for research projects, requiring registrants to submit a request for increased quantities by registered mail to the DEA. Upon approval, they can purchase and use the additional quantity. Registrants conducting research projects on controlled substances must submit a request for increased quantities by registered mail to the DEA. Upon approval, they can purchase and use the additional quantity for their research. If they wish to conduct research beyond approved variations, they must submit a supplemental protocol for approval. Medical research on cannabidiol is authorized under Section 5. An appropriately registered institution of higher education, practitioner, or manufacturer may manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess marijuana or cannabidiol for authorized medical research purposes, regardless of federal laws. During the initial period after enactment, individuals or entities engaged in medical research may handle cannabidiol without restrictions until the Attorney General determines its control. Medical research can distribute, dispense, or possess cannabidiol for authorized research if registered under the Controlled Substances Act. If cannabidiol becomes a controlled substance, research can continue with proper authorization. The Attorney General will register individuals or entities engaged in authorized medical research and registered under the Controlled Substances Act to manufacture or distribute cannabidiol or marijuana for commercial production of FDA-approved drugs. The Attorney General must process registration applications for manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing controlled substances within 60 days, either granting or denying the application or requesting additional information within 30 days. If an application for controlled substances registration is denied, the Attorney General must provide a written explanation to the applicant. SEC. 6. IMPORTATION OF CANNABIDIOL FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. The Controlled Substances Import and Export Act is amended to allow for the importation of marihuana or cannabidiol for authorized medical research or for manufacturing drugs approved by the FDA. The Controlled Substances Import and Export Act is amended to regulate the import and export of controlled substances and list I chemicals, requiring registration issued by the Attorney General for such activities. The Controlled Substances Import and Export Act is amended to regulate the import and export of controlled substances and list I chemicals, requiring registration issued by the Attorney General for such activities. Paragraph (1) does not apply to the import or export of marijuana or cannabidiol approved for medical research or use by registered manufacturers to make approved drugs. SEC. 7. SAFE HARBOR. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"adult,\" \"child,\" \"intractable epilepsy,\" and \"neurologist.\" It also establishes a safe harbor provision despite the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act allows legal guardians to possess and transport cannabidiol for children with intractable epilepsy after 6 months of treatment by a neurologist. The Controlled Substances Act permits legal guardians to possess and transport cannabidiol or nonpsychoactive components of marijuana for children with intractable epilepsy, provided certain conditions are met, including monitoring by a neurologist and documentation of requirements. Adults can also possess or transport these substances if treated by a neurologist for intractable epilepsy for at least 6 months, with no significant clinical improvement from other treatments. State-licensed physicians can discuss the potential benefits and risks of using cannabidiol or nonpsychoactive components of marijuana with patients or their legal guardians. The adult must provide documentation and be monitored for adverse reactions by a neurologist. The section regarding the use of cannabidiol or nonpsychoactive components of marijuana by state-licensed physicians will expire 4 years after the enactment of this Act, unless the patient is a child. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will expand research on cannabidiol and nonpsychoactive components of marijuana through grants to institutions to determine their therapeutic effects on serious medical conditions like intractable epilepsy."
