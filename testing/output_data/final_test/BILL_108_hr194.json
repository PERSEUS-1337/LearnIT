The Medicare Market Acquisition Drug Price Act of 2003 reforms payment for drugs and biologicals under the Medicare program by specifying rules for payment based on the type of drug or biological being billed for. The Medicare Market Acquisition Drug Price Act of 2003 establishes payment rules for drugs and biologicals under Medicare based on their type, including multi-source drugs, single-source drugs, and access exceptions for necessary drugs in certain areas. The Medicare Market Acquisition Drug Price Act of 2003 sets payment rules for drugs and biologicals under Medicare, including exceptions for necessary drugs in areas where providers cannot obtain them at standard rates. If data is insufficient or prices change significantly, the Secretary can modify payment rates by up to 15 percent. The Medicare Market Acquisition Drug Price Act of 2003 allows the Secretary to adjust payment rates for drugs or biologicals based on average acquisition prices or national drug codes if necessary. The term 'average acquisition price' refers to the average final sales prices charged by the manufacturer of a drug or biological product in the United States, excluding certain sales exempt from best price calculations and sales subject to rebates under section 1927. The average acquisition price is calculated net of various discounts and concessions estimated by the Secretary, including volume discounts, prompt pay discounts, charge-backs, short-dated product discounts, free goods and services, rebates, and all other price concessions. The Secretary may adjust the average acquisition price based on updated information and differences between estimated and actual prices charged by the manufacturer for sales of the drug or biological. The average of final sales prices is determined by dividing the sum of all final prices charged by the manufacturer for sales included in the calculation. The Secretary distributes payment rates to carriers and contractors for drugs and biologicals to ensure uniform reimbursement rates. Manufacturers must report prices for payment eligibility. Manufacturers of drugs or biologicals must report their average acquisition prices and sales information by national drug code to the Secretary quarterly. They are also required to maintain records for auditing purposes. Manufacturers must provide the Secretary access to records for auditing purposes. Penalties for non-compliance include fines up to $100,000 and suspension of payment for the drug or biological involved. The Secretary must refer cases of false price representation to the Inspector General and appropriate officials. Reporting information must include the generic and brand names of the drug or biological. The form and manner of reporting are specified by the Secretary. The information to be submitted includes details such as the drug's biological and brand name, NDC and HCPCS codes, dosage form, strength, volume, and package size. A written certification by a manufacturer officer attesting to the accuracy of the reported information is required. Additionally, updated information on net price realized, considering rebates and other adjustments, must be included. This submission should be done within 30 days after the end of each quarter. The Secretary audits reported information periodically, conducting price gathering activities to verify accuracy. A dispensing fee is paid to licensed pharmacies for drugs or biologicals under this part, subject to yearly adjustments based on changes. The Secretary audits reported information periodically to verify accuracy. Payment for drugs or biologicals is subject to yearly adjustments based on changes in the consumer price index. Payment can only be made on an assignment-related basis. The amendment made by paragraph (1) applies to drugs and biologicals furnished on or after January 1, 2004. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will adjust oncologists' reported medical supply expenses to better reflect actual costs in the physician fee schedule. The Secretary will adjust the allocation of indirect expenses in the fee schedule to ensure all services receive the appropriate share. For services without direct physician involvement, payments will be calculated based on resources required, with validation of practice expenses if necessary. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on Medicare payments for blood clotting factors and other biologicals under part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act. This study aims to assess the appropriateness of the current payment methodology. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 9 months of the Security Act's enactment, with recommendations on payment methodology for blood clotting factors. The amendment's effective date will be delayed until at least 6 months after the report is submitted."
