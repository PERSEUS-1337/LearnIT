    "content": "The \"Veteran Education Empowerment Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section follows. Congress finds that over 1,000,000 veterans attended higher education institutions in 2014. Veterans encounter challenges transitioning from the battlefield to the classroom and workforce due to age differences, family obligations, time away from academic life, and service-related disabilities. The National Endowment for the Humanities' Warrior-Scholar Project highlighted the difficulty veterans face adjusting to a new academic and social environment, leading to a high dropout rate. The National Education Association noted that veteran students can feel isolated and vulnerable on campus. Connecting student veterans can ease isolation by pairing new veteran students with those who have successfully navigated college. Post-9/11 veterans face high unemployment rates, emphasizing the need for mentorship from fellow veterans. Veteran Student Centers are recognized as beneficial by Student Veterans of America. The American Council on Education and the Department of Education recommend colleges to have dedicated spaces for veterans on campus, but budget constraints often hinder institutions from doing so. The 110th Congress authorized funding for Veteran Student Centers under the Higher Education Act of 1965. These centers have improved recruitment, retention, and graduation rates for veteran students, helping them feel more connected on campus and contributing to their academic success. Title VIII of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to establish grants for Veteran Student Centers under Part T. These centers have been beneficial in improving recruitment, retention, and graduation rates for veteran students, enhancing their campus connection and academic success. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to establish grants for Veteran Student Centers to assist in their establishment, maintenance, and operation. The Secretary may award up to 30 grants to eligible institutions or consortia of institutions of higher education based on specific criteria. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to establish grants for Veteran Student Centers at institutions of higher education. Eligible institutions or consortia may receive grants based on criteria such as enrolling a significant number of veteran students or presenting a significant percentage of veteran students in undergraduate or graduate courses. The institution or consortium must present a sustainability plan for the Veteran Student Center to ensure its maintenance and operation after the grant period. Criteria for awarding grants include representing various sectors and sizes, as well as meeting specific criteria such as enrolling a significant number of veteran students. The institution or consortium must be located in a region with a significant veteran population, provide programs for veterans and their spouses, collaborate with veteran service organizations, workforce development organizations, or higher education institutions, and commit to hiring staff for veteran-specific programming. The institution or consortium commits to hiring a staff at the Veteran Student Center that includes veterans, using a portion of the grant for an early-warning veteran student retention program, and providing mental health counseling. The institution or consortium commits to providing mental health counseling to veteran students and their spouses through a grant to establish a Veteran Student Center and offer supportive instruction services. The grant awarded to institutions or consortiums for veteran support programs lasts for 4 years and cannot exceed $500,000. The Secretary will disburse funds as needed. A report on the grant program must be submitted to Congress within 3 years of the first grant award. The report to Congress on the grant program includes the number of grants awarded, institutions that received grants, amounts awarded, how funds were used, student services offered, and data on veteran student success. Best practices for veteran student success are also identified through reviewing institution data. The Secretary will review data from institutions that received grants to determine if the grant program should be extended. The authority for the grant program will end 4 years after the first grant is awarded. The Secretary will create a website with best practices for serving veteran students at higher education institutions within 3 years of the first grant being awarded. The curr_chunk details the definition of an institution of higher education and a Veteran Student Center, which is a dedicated space on campus providing services for veteran students and members of the Armed Forces. A Veteran Student Center on campus offers comprehensive support services for veteran students, staffed by trained employees and volunteers, including veterans and a full-time veterans' benefits counselor. It assists with transitioning from military to student life and the civilian workforce, as well as networking with other veteran students and community veterans. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of students understanding benefits, academic policies, course selection, and disability-related rights in higher education. The curr_chunk discusses disability-related rights and protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act, as well as academic and tutoring services for veteran students. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned for fiscal years 2016 and beyond. An institution of higher education previously awarded a grant under section 873 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 will continue to receive funds as per the original grant terms."
