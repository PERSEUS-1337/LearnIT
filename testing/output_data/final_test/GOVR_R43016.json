The plan aims to ensure broadband access for all Americans by 2020, setting six specific goals to address gaps in availability and adoption. The National Broadband Plan, released by the FCC in 2010, sets six specific goals to ensure broadband access for all Americans by 2020. These goals include providing affordable access to high-speed internet, leading in mobile innovation, and ensuring broadband access for first responders and clean energy tracking. The report examines the progress towards meeting the goals set by the National Broadband Plan, with a focus on telecommunications policies and programs initiated by the 113th Congress and the FCC. The ongoing debate over these issues will likely include discussions on the extent to which the NBP goals are being met. The National Broadband Plan aims for 100 million U.S. homes to have access to 100 Mbps download and 50 Mbps upload speeds. This goal would provide next-generation broadband to 75% of households, with deployments more likely in urban and suburban areas. Currently, fiber and DOCSIS 3.0 technology offer speeds in this range, with 63 million households already having access to speeds greater than 100 Mbps. The National Broadband Plan aims for 100 million U.S. homes to have access to download speeds greater than 100 Mbps and upload speeds greater than 50 Mbps. The cost for such high speeds ranges from $100 to $300 per month in most U.S. cities. The FCC has initiated the Measuring Broadband America Program to survey actual speeds experienced by consumers. The FCC's Measuring Broadband America Program found ISPs deliver 97% of advertised speeds. The National Broadband Plan aims for 100 million homes with 50 Mbps download speeds by 2015, which has been achieved, but the goal for 20 Mbps upload speeds is still far off. The cable industry has started rolling out DOCSIS 3.0 technology, offering 100 Mbps download speeds, surpassing the National Broadband Map data. The FCC is optimistic about meeting the goal of 100 million homes with 50 Mbps download speeds by 2015. ISPs have improved in delivering promised speeds, showing progress towards NBP goals. The FCC aims for affordable access to 50 Mbps download speeds, with a target of 100 Mbps by 2020. ISPs need to continue improving to meet these goals, with cable industry deploying DOCSIS 3.0 for speeds over 100 Mbps. Verizon plans to expand services for ultra-high definition TV and compete with fiber-based providers. Verizon and Google are offering high-speed internet services, with Verizon reaching up to 300 Mbps and Google offering 1 Gbps in Kansas City. The FCC notes the increasing availability of higher-speed broadband (10 Mbps and above) across the country. Cable providers are making progress with DOCSIS 3.0 for speeds over 100 Mbps. Consumers are demanding and subscribing to higher internet services. The FCC will assess the country's progress towards affordable access to 50 Mbps download speeds, with a target of 100 Mbps by 2020. The United States aims to lead in mobile innovation with fast wireless networks. National Broadband Map data shows availability of 3G and 4G LTE technologies to households. Deployment of 4G LTE is ongoing, with increasing access expected. The FCC notes that U.S. wireless providers have aggressively built out 4G LTE technology since 2010, with download speeds ranging from 5 to 12 Mbps. By January 2012, three mobile wireless providers had launched LTE networks covering 211 million people, securing the U.S.'s position as a world leader in LTE adoption. U.S. investment in 4G networks during 2012-2016 could be $25-$53 billion, with over 80% of smartphones globally running on U.S. operating systems. The FCC notes that U.S. investment in 4G networks during 2012-2016 could be $25-$53 billion, with over 80% of smartphones globally running on U.S. operating systems. The United States is seen as a global leader in mobile broadband, with 4G LTE technology adoption and wireless services being a key focus. However, international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks 8th in wireless broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, behind countries like Korea, Sweden, and Japan. The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure affordable access to robust broadband service for all Americans, focusing on availability and adoption. The recommended benchmark speed is 4 Mbps download/1 Mbps upload, as defined by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The recommended benchmark speed for broadband service is 4 Mbps download/1 Mbps upload, meeting the minimum threshold for broadband under section 706. The speed benchmark of 4 Mbps/1 Mbps enables users to access high-quality voice, data, graphics, and. The National Broadband Plan recommends reviewing the 4 Mbps download/1 Mbps upload benchmark every four years due to increasing consumer demand for bandwidth and services. Broadband availability in the U.S. is at 98.2%, with speeds of at least 3 Mbps download/768 kbps upload, close to the FCC's benchmark. The FCC uses 3 Mbps/768 kbps data as a surrogate for the broadband benchmark, approaching 100% availability. Broadband adoption goal is \"higher than 90%\" by 2020. FCC's semiannual report shows a 40% subscriber ratio for fixed residential connections with speeds of at least 3 Mbps down and 768 kbps up. The Pew Internet and American Life Project survey in April 2012 found that 66% of Americans have broadband connections at home, with speeds not specified. Broadband adoption rates have plateaued, with 66% in 2012 compared to 63% in 2009. The FCC reports a 40% subscriber ratio for fixed residential connections meeting the benchmark speed of 4 Mbps/1 Mbps, indicating slower progress towards the NBP goal of over 90% adoption. Progress towards meeting the \"higher than 90%\" goal of the NBP has slowed, with certain demographic groups showing lower broadband adoption rates. Factors such as affordability, relevance, and lack of computer access in households contribute to the decision not to subscribe to broadband services. The Pew Survey highlights that minorities, low-income households, the elderly, adults with lower educational attainment, and rural populations are among those with lower broadband adoption rates. Broadband affordability is a key factor in low adoption rates. Comparisons of international broadband prices show varying perspectives on affordability in the U.S. The Broadband Data Improvement Act (P.L. 110-385) addresses these issues. The Broadband Data Improvement Act (P.L. 110-385) requires the FCC to prepare international comparisons of broadband service. The FCC found that the United States is in the midprice range of countries for fixed residential broadband, with plans ranging from $23 to $199 per month. The FCC found that the United States is in the midprice range for fixed residential broadband, with plans ranging from $23 to $199 per month. The United States is one of the ten least expensive countries for mobile broadband, especially for smartphone plans. Goal No. 4 aims for every American community to have affordable access to at least 1 gigabit per second broadband service for anchor institutions like schools and hospitals. Data on how many communities have this access is currently unavailable. The National Broadband Map includes data on nearly 300,000 community anchor institutions. The FCC's Eighth Broadband Progress Report highlighted that many elementary and secondary schools lack sufficient broadband service. A survey showed that 80% of E-rate funded schools and libraries reported inadequate broadband connections. 7.8% of community anchor institutions reported download speeds greater than 1 gigabit per second. The FCC found that 78% of recipients need additional bandwidth as providers offer download speeds of at least 25 Mbps to only 63.7% of schools. Data from the American Library Association shows that 31.2% of libraries have speeds greater than 10 Mbps. Broadband stimulus grants aim to provide ultra-high-speed connections to CAIs, with 117 grants awarded by the NTIA. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) has awarded 117 grants to connect 12,000 CAIs with speeds greater than a gigabit per second. The FCC called for the development of FirstNet to provide a nationwide, wireless, interoperable broadband public safety network for first responders. FirstNet is designed to meet public safety communications needs and ensure America leads in the clean energy economy by allowing every American to track and manage their energy consumption using broadband. The FCC emphasizes the importance of broadband and advanced communications infrastructure in achieving national energy goals, including modernizing the electric grid. The integration of broadband into the Smart Grid is a central recommendation for reaching this goal. The United States is currently undergoing a significant buildout of communications and information technology for the Smart Grid, as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set the policy to support the modernization of the electricity transmission and distribution system. It included initiatives for Smart Grid investments and coordinated research efforts. The National Broadband Plan contained over 200 recommendations to achieve its goals, directed to various entities including the FCC, Congress, and nonfederal organizations. The Benton Foundation tracks the implementation of the National Broadband Plan recommendations, with 17% completed, 40.4% in progress, 15.6% started, and 27.1% not started. Key telecommunications issues in Congress focus on improving broadband deployment to achieve NBP goals, including oversight of FCC efforts on Connect America Fund, Lifeline Program expansion, and Rural Health Care and Schools and Libraries programs. The curr_chunk discusses Congressional oversight and consideration of various broadband-related programs and policies, including Universal Service Fund reform, spectrum policies for wireless broadband, FirstNet development, ARRA broadband grant programs, and potential revisions to the regulatory framework. The United States has made progress towards broadband goals, with availability closer than adoption goals. Download speeds are closer to goals than upload speeds, but affordability remains a challenge. The US leads in mobile innovation with 4G LTE, but lags in wireless broadband subscriptions compared to other countries. The US is in the middle for wireless broadband subscriptions per 100 population. Data on Community Anchor Institutions show low 1 gigabit connections. FirstNet and Smart Grid initiatives aim to reach broadband goals. Stakeholders may not agree on FCC broadband goals. Progress towards goals may not solely be due to the National Broadband Plan. Progress towards meeting the National Broadband Plan goals may not solely be attributed to the plan's recommendations, as the broadband market's natural evolution also plays a role. The ongoing progress is likely to be part of the debate in the 113th Congress on telecommunications issues such as universal service reform, wireless technology, spectrum policy, and regulatory reform."
