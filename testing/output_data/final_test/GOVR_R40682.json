    "content": "In early 2009, President Obama approved the deployment of 21,000 additional troops to Afghanistan to stabilize the situation. This decision followed a request from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and General David McKiernan. President Bush had previously approved sending 9,000 troops in January 2009. There was also a pending request for 9,000 more troops in late 2009. General McKiernan had requested a total of 35,000 combat troops and 4,000 trainers for Afghanistan. The request for additional troops in Afghanistan included 4,000 trainers, bringing the total to 39,000. Around 30,000 troops were approved by Presidents Bush and Obama. The estimated number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan was expected to reach 63,450 by the end of FY2009, with a total of 81,000 foreign troops including NATO forces. Additionally, 10,000 to 17,000 U.S. troops were dedicated to Operation Enduring Freedom in the region. President Obama announced the shift of U.S. strategy in Iraq from combat to supporting and training Iraqi security forces, with troop levels decreasing to 35,000 to 50,000 by August 31, 2010. The Security Agreement with Iraq required all U.S. combat troops to move outside of cities by June 2009 and for all troops to leave Iraq by December 31, 2011. The impact of these withdrawals on other troops deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) has not been explained. The President adopted a 19-month plan for troop withdrawal in Iraq, with considerations for increasing troop levels in Afghanistan. Decisions on troop levels reflected in FY2009 Supplemental and FY2010 war requests. The FY2009 Supplemental covers DOD's war costs for the rest of the fiscal year due to incomplete funding from the FY2009 bridge fund. The Administration plans to include a full year of war costs in the FY2010 budget, with separate displays for each war and troop levels. Decisions to reduce troops in Iraq and increase troops in Afghanistan are based on violence levels and election schedules. The report discusses the implications of troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq, including the effectiveness of security forces and cost implications. It analyzes past trends in troop levels and measures contributions and burdens of deployment for the four services. The report analyzes troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq, including security force effectiveness and cost implications. It examines past trends, contributions, and burdens of deployment for the four services. It is important to clarify which troops are included when discussing deployed troop levels. In June 2001, the U.S. had 26,000 troops in the U.S. Central Command region, mainly in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and on ships. By December 2008, there were 294,000 troops for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, a significant increase from seven years prior. In December 2008, there were 294,000 troops allocated for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, surpassing the previous total of 181,000. Military leaders and DOD officials use these figures to track troop deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. For example, Admiral Mullen stated there were 150,000 troops in Iraq in November 2008, and a proposal to add 30,000 troops in Afghanistan would double the current number. As of April 1, 2009, the Department of Defense reported 178,400 troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, with some troops withdrawn from Iraq and additional troops deployed to Afghanistan. The Boots on the Ground figures only include personnel in Afghanistan or Iraq, while the Location Report counts all military personnel involved in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, including support personnel in neighboring countries and counter-terror operations in the Philippines. CRS allocated troops to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan based on location, including support personnel in neighboring countries and counter-terror operations in the Philippines. OEF includes troops in Kyrgyzstan, Djibouti, and the Philippines, while OIF includes troops in Kuwait and Navy personnel in the region. The Defense Manpower Data Center data shows the presence of 15,000 Navy personnel in the region, with troops deployed to various headquarters in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. There are also 15,000 troops whose location is unknown. The gap between Boots on the Ground figures and the Location Report reflects differences in counting methods and personnel included. The Defense Manpower Data Center data captures all deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq, including short and long-term deployments. Different measures like \"average strength\" are used to calculate troop strength, depending on the purpose. Boots on the Ground counts may be best for troops likely to face combat, while Location Reports capture all deployed troops in the region. The Obama administration outlined troop strength plans in terms of \"Boots on the Ground\" in Afghanistan and Iraq. CRS estimates future troop levels in-country, excluding over 100,000 troops providing theater-wide support. Boots on the Ground figures capture troops likely to face combat and show the direction of change. Between FY2002 and FY2008, troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq increased from 5,200 to a peak of 172,000. Average monthly troop levels doubled from 78,100 to 162,900 between FY2003 and FY2005, with little change in FY2006. President Bush announced in January 2007 to send five more Brigade. In FY2006, troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq remained stable. President Bush then announced in January 2007 to send five more Brigade Combat Teams to Iraq for a temporary surge in troop levels. Average strength increased in FY2007 and FY2008 due to these additional troops and increases in Afghanistan, peaking at 187,900 in FY2008. Troop levels grew from 161,500 in FY2006 to 172,000 in FY2007, and further to 187,900 in FY2008. The Obama Administration's plans indicate a projected decline in troop strength to 67,500 in FY2012, a drop of 64% from the peak in FY2008. The Obama Administration's plans project a decline in troop strength from 187,900 in FY2008 to 67,500 in FY2012, a drop of 64%. Troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq are expected to decrease, with troop levels in Afghanistan being about 25,000 less than those in Iraq by FY2010. The pace of withdrawal in Iraq would quicken in FY2011 to meet the deadline of withdrawing all but 35,000 to 50,000 troops by August 31, 2009. The Obama Administration's plans project a decline in troop strength from 187,900 in FY2008 to 67,500 in FY2012, a drop of 64%. Troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq are expected to decrease, with troop levels in Afghanistan being about 25,000 less than those in Iraq by FY2010. The balance of troops between the two operations would shift with 20,000 more troops in Afghanistan than deployed in Iraq by FY2011. By FY2012, overall troop levels would fall by another 36% to 67,500 as all but the last three Brigade Combat Teams leave Iraq, and some 7 BCTs would be in Afghanistan. DOD did not include troop estimates for these years in its budget submissions. The CRS hopes to provide a tool for Congress to assess troop level changes in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as war costs from FY2009-FY2012. The Administration's plans include increasing troop levels in Afghanistan and decreasing levels in Iraq. The impact on the remaining 100,000 troops in the region is still unknown. The planned adjustments in troop levels by the Administration will impact DOD's war costs. The cost implications for FY2009-FY2012 war costs of changes in troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq are estimated by CRS. The timing of proposed increases and decreases in troop levels is crucial for estimating current and future war costs. At the beginning of FY2009, 33,450 troops were deployed in Afghanistan, with an additional 30,000 troops scheduled to deploy during the remainder of the fiscal year. The troop increases included one Brigade Combat Team in January 2009, 21,000 more troops in March and June 2009, and 4,000 additional trainers deployed in the summer. The war cost implications depend on the duration of their deployment, with a full year's cost for all 30,000 troops needed in FY2010. The cost implications of troop deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq were analyzed by CRS. The estimate considered the movement of units based on Presidential and DOD announcements. A BCT-equivalent of 9,000 troops was used to simplify the metric for estimating costs. The metric for maintaining weighted average BCT-equivalents in Afghanistan and Iraq assumes troop changes in-country affect all personnel in the region, but some personnel may adjust gradually or not at all. DOD has not provided details on this. The DOD is preparing to re-deploy equipment not currently with troops. Troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan are shifting, with Afghanistan becoming the predominant mission by FY2012. The Administration's plans may change with different pacing. The Administration's plans for troop levels in Afghanistan may increase to 63,500 by FY2010, with a total of about 95,000 foreign troops including coalition forces. Secretary Gates has cautioned against exceeding this level to avoid appearing as occupiers to the Afghans. Troop levels in Iraq nearly doubled between FY2003 and FY2004, reaching 143,800 in FY2006. During the surge initiated by President Bush, troop strength initially grew by 6% in FY2007, reaching a peak of 157,800 in the following year. Estimates suggest troop levels in Iraq will decrease to 4,100 by FY2012. The Administration plans to increase U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan from 30,100 in FY2008 to about 50,700 in FY2009, with a possible additional combat brigade deployment in FY2010. Secretary Gates expressed concerns about the American footprint in Afghanistan, with estimates suggesting troop levels could reach 63,350 in FY2010. The Administration plans to increase U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, with estimates suggesting troop levels could reach 63,350 in FY2010. If an additional brigade of 9,000 troops is added, troop levels would rise to 70,200 in FY2010 and peak at 72,450 in FY2011 and FY2012. Troop strength in Iraq declined from a peak of 170,000 in November 2007 to 147,000 by September 2008 as additional units sent for the surge were withdrawn. Administration plans call for a gradual drawdown in FY2009. The Administration plans to increase U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, with estimates suggesting troop levels could reach 63,350 in FY2010. If an additional brigade of 9,000 troops is added, troop levels would rise to 70,200 in FY2010 and peak at 72,450 in FY2011 and FY2012. Troop strength in Iraq declined from a peak of 170,000 in November 2007 to 147,000 by September 2008 as additional units sent for the surge were withdrawn. Administration plans call for a gradual drawdown in FY2009, mainly by not replacing two of three BCTs slated to re-deploy from Iraq in June 2009, as well as withdrawals of other smaller units, and some downsizing of replacement units. This could bring monthly average troop strength to about 135,600 in FY2009, a 14% decrease from the previous year, close to DOD's estimate of 140,000. Additional re-deployments would not resume until the end of January 2010 after the Iraqi elections slated for December 2009. In order to reach the target of 35,000 to 50,000 troops in Iraq by August 2010 announced by President Obama, an additional 8 average BCTs would need to be withdrawn from Iraq. Reflecting this schedule, average troop levels in Iraq would be about 88,300 in FY2010, a decrease of 35% that year. DOD estimates average troop strength in Iraq would be about 100,000 in FY2010, somewhat higher than this CRS estimate. President Obama announced that all troops would be out of Iraq by the end of 2011 as required by the Security Agreement. To meet this deadline, the last five remaining BCTs are assumed to be withdrawn in the last five months of 2011. This schedule would reduce average monthly troop strength from 88,300 in FY2010 to 42,750 in FY2011, and 4,050 in FY2012. If troops were withdrawn sooner, or the agreement with the Iraq government was re-negotiated, the timeline could change. If troops were withdrawn sooner or the agreement with the Iraq government was re-negotiated to extend DOD troop presence, average troop levels and costs would be affected. Changes in troop strength play a significant role in determining war costs, along with other adjustments in operational costs. The Obama Administration requested an additional $75.5 billion for DOD for FY2009 Supplemental Overseas Contingency Operations, abandoning the \"Global War on Terror\" label. The total request for FY2009 is $141.4 billion, with a proposed FY2009 level $45.7 billion lower than the previous year. For FY2010, $130 billion is requested for both wars. Troop strength changes, one-time expenses, policy changes, and programmatic changes also affect costs. The proposed FY2009 budget for DOD is $45.7 billion lower than FY2008, a 24% decrease. One-time decreases include $12.2 billion not related to war needs, $16.8 billion for Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, and policy changes. The new Administration's policy change reduces war-related procurement by $27 billion, adjusts troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq, and estimates DOD's FY2009 war needs at $133.1 billion, $8.3 billion below the Administration's request. Increases include a proposed $1.9 billion for training Afghan and Iraqi security forces. In FY2009, there is a $1.9 billion increase for training Afghan and Iraqi security forces, additional funding for unmanned aerial vehicles and MRAPS, $300 million for Coalition Support, and $400 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund. There are also decreases in Military Construction and the Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund. The Obama Administration requested $130 billion for war funding in FY2010, which depends on troop levels and other adjustments made by DOD. In FY2010, DOD transferred $8 billion of programs to its baseline from supplemental appropriations, anticipating reduced war funding. This included funding for increasing Army size, countering IED threats, ISR, and Global Train and Equip funds. Planned troop level changes would further reduce requirements by $7.7 billion, totaling $15.7 billion altogether. The DOD transferred $8 billion of programs to its baseline in FY2010, anticipating reduced war funding. Planned troop level changes would further reduce requirements by $7.7 billion, totaling $15.7 billion altogether. The Administration included planning figures of $50 billion each for FY2011 and FY2012 in its budget. War costs could total $92 billion in FY2011 and $70 billion in FY2012, above the planning figures. Future war requests are likely to change due to various factors. Current efforts to reduce and move U.S. troops outside major cities in Iraq may have already started the consolidation process, leading to a decrease in base support costs. The transfer of responsibility to Iraqi Security forces could also lower U.S. operating costs. The withdrawal process itself may involve additional costs, as emphasized by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has highlighted the complexity and need for coordination in re-deploying forces and equipment, without estimating the costs of a drawdown. Army leaders have mentioned that the cost of repairing and replacing war-worn equipment could remain at $16 billion annually for two years post-withdrawal from Iraq. This cost is covered by war funding and about three-quarters of Army equipment is repaired upon return to the U.S., while the remaining quarter is left in-theater for newly deploying units. Once U.S. forces fully withdraw from Iraq, this equipment will be returned to the U.S. for repair or replacement. After the U.S. forces fully withdraw from Iraq, equipment will be returned to the United States for repair or replacement, with some items left behind for the Iraqis or transferred to Afghanistan. The Army may face an additional bill of $5 to $6 billion to reset the equipment remaining in theater, which is below Army estimates. The annual cost for repairing equipment that rotates with troops is expected to decrease as troop levels fall, offsetting some of the additional expense. Similar factors would likely apply to the other services. To estimate operational costs accurately, additional information is needed on how troop levels in the region change, distribution of changes among services, and the speed at which costs adjust to troop decreases or increases. Questions also arise about the different costs associated with redeploying troops, such as sending them home and repairing or upgrading equipment. The Department of Defense (DOD) has not provided detailed information on troop levels, locations, or distribution among services in Afghanistan, hindering Congress's evaluation of war funding requests. The FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act requires separate budget displays for Afghanistan and Iraq, including assumptions on troop levels, operations, and equipment reset requirements. However, DOD has not included these details in its FY2009 budget. The FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act requires separate budget displays for Afghanistan and Iraq, including assumptions on troop levels, operations, and equipment reset requirements. However, DOD has not included these details in its FY2009 budget. The total demand for troops for the Afghan and Iraq war is not accurately captured due to missing troop deployments in the region. Average monthly troop strength for troops deployed for the Afghan and Iraq Wars was calculated using various DOD data sources. The Operations Report, Combat Pay Estimate, Average Strength Report, and Location Reports provide data on military personnel deployed for OEF and OIF. These reports capture troop numbers, funding for combat pay, and deployment locations. The activation of 50,000 reservists to support OEF and OIF operations increased the total troops associated with these missions to 344,000. Policy and cost issues arise regarding the Administration's plan to increase troops in Afghanistan and decrease forces in Iraq. The United States is considering changes in combat troops, including reducing troops in-country versus in the region. Questions arise about the overall military presence in the region and the interaction between troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trends in troop levels show similarities over time, despite differences in reported numbers. The United States is considering changes in combat troops, including reducing troops in-country versus in the region. Questions arise about the overall military presence in the region and the interaction between troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trends in troop levels show similarities over time, despite differences in reported numbers. Definitions and distinctions in troop reporting methods can impact cost and demand for troops. Average monthly troop strength for both wars in FY2008 ranged from 188,000 for DOD's Boots on the Ground to 223,000 in the Central Command's Operations. The troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq vary depending on the reporting method used, with figures ranging from 223,000 to 307,000. Average Strength Reports include all military personnel providing theater support, while Location Reports capture all deployed troops. The difference between Boots on the Ground and Average Strength Reports is not fully explained. Troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq vary based on reporting methods, with figures ranging from 223,000 to 307,000. Location Reports capture all deployed troops, including those present for short periods, leading to higher numbers than Average Strength Reports. There are significant differences in figures by service, with the Army showing a 20% higher count, the Navy 60-90% higher, the Marine Corps 30% higher, and the Air Force over 25% higher. Despite these discrepancies, overall trends in troop levels over time remain similar across DOD sources, with a sharp increase at the start of combat operations in FY2002. Troop levels sharply increased with the initiation of combat operations in Afghanistan in FY2002 and Iraq in FY2003. Levels remained stable from FY2004-FY2006, with some fluctuations in Combat Pay Estimates due to unreliable DOD war cost reporting. Troop levels moderately increased in FY2007 and FY2008 in response to the troop surge in Iraq and continued increases in Afghanistan. Despite discrepancies in reporting, troop allocation between OEF and OIF remained similar. Troop allocation between Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) has been consistently around 88% to 90% for Iraq and 10% to 12% for Afghanistan. This split remained stable even during troop surges in both countries in 2007 and 2008. The data was analyzed from various DOD sources, showing a consistent pattern over the years. The allocation of troops between Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) has remained consistent, with approximately 12% for OEF and 88% for OIF from FY2006-FY2008. Guidelines for assigning personnel to OEF and OIF by location have been adopted by JCS and Central Command, but the Office of the Secretary of Defense has not set specific guidelines for assigning war costs based on location. Troop and cost allocations for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) may not match due to lack of standardization. The Department of Defense (DOD) holds each component responsible for financial accuracy, but has not issued policy guidelines to ensure commonality. Troop levels for the Afghan war increased steadily from FY2003 to FY2008, with varying pace among DOD sources. The lowest DOD figure for Boots on the Ground tripled from 10,400 in FY2003 to 30,100 in FY2008. Troop levels in the Afghan war increased steadily from FY2003 to FY2008, reflecting different stages of military operations. The Afghan War, or Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), began on October 7, 2001 with U.S. troops launching air strikes and Special Operations forces supporting operations by the Northern Alliance against Taliban forces. The Afghan War, known as Operation Enduring Freedom, started in October 2001 with U.S. troops conducting air strikes and Special Operations forces aiding the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. President Bush declared major combat operations over in November 2001 after overthrowing the Taliban regime. A transition government was formed under UN sponsorship, followed by an elected government in November 2004. Troop levels varied in FY2002, with an average of 5,200 troops in the Boots on the Ground report and 8,800 troops in the Operations Report. After initial combat operations in November 2001, troop levels for Operation Enduring Freedom gradually increased. The Boots on the Ground report counted about 5,000 additional troops per year between FY2003 and FY2005, reaching 20,400 in FY2006. The Operations Report indicated troop levels rose from 12,500 in FY2003 to nearly 20,000 by FY2004, remaining stable for the following two years. The total number of troops involved in OEF in FY2002 was estimated at 83,400, including Navy personnel on ships and Air Force personnel. Troop levels for Operation Enduring Freedom gradually increased from 12,500 in FY2003 to almost 20,000 by FY2004, remaining stable for the next two years. OEF troop levels are typically 1,000 to 5,000 higher than Boots on the Ground reports. Variations in troop numbers in FY2008 were due to changes in reporting definitions, highlighting the need for clearer definitions. To capture all troops providing theater-wide support, CRS applied shares from the Operations Report to more complete figures in the Average Strength Reports. Troop levels for Operation Enduring Freedom increased gradually from 12,500 in FY2003 to 20,000 by FY2004, stabilizing for the next two years. The Average Strength Reports provide a more accurate measure of troop strength, with OEF troops estimated to have grown to 42,500 in FY2008. Despite potential inaccuracies in allocations between OEF and OIF, using shares from the Operations Report to estimate troop strength has been deemed reliable. In FY2006 and FY2007, violence in Afghanistan increased as Taliban insurgents adopted tactics from Iraq. Various measures showed higher levels of violence, leading to increased troop levels in FY2007 and FY2008. Troop strength rose by 10,000 after modest increases in previous years. Between FY2006 and FY2008, troop levels in Afghanistan increased significantly. The Boots on the Ground and Operations Report showed a rise of 10,000 troops, reaching over 30,000. The Average Strength and Location Reports indicated an increase from 28,000 to 42,000 troops during the same period. DOD began including monthly headcounts for OEF, revealing an average of 47,790 troops in the last months of FY2008. The reasons for the discrepancies in troop figures are unclear. The new DOD figures show current OEF troop levels, with an average of 97,000 troops in FY2009, potentially growing to 110,000 the following year. Monthly headcounts capture buildups and drawdowns, revealing an upward trend in troop levels. Troop levels in FY2003 ranged from 11,000 to 13,000, reflecting seasonal variations and planned operations. Troop levels in FY2003 to FY2008 generally rose in the winter and spring, then declined slightly in the summer and fall, settling back at somewhat higher levels each year. Operations against Taliban insurgents led to temporary spikes in troop levels, with peaks during specific operations like Mountain Viper, Operation Avalanche, and Operation Mountain Storm. Troop levels typically increased early in the year to prepare for spring offensives. Troop levels in the Gulf region increased in preparation for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan rose to over 25,000 in response to worsening conditions, reaching about 33,600 in 2008. NATO countries also increased their troop contributions, with levels growing from 20,000 in FY2007 to 31,000 in FY2009. Additional troop requests from NATO are expected to be minimal. Troop levels in Iraq peaked in 2003 after the invasion, then stabilized at 130,000 to 140,000 between FY2004 and FY2006. A surge in troops initiated by President Bush in 2007 increased levels to 158,000 before gradually decreasing. Changes in troop levels were influenced by military strategy to minimize presence and prevent insurgents from using the U.S. occupation. The U.S. military strategy in Iraq underwent changes to minimize presence and prevent insurgents from gaining support. This included a shift to \"clear, hold, and build\" strategy in 2005 and a troop surge in 2007. Troop levels peaked at 158,000 before gradually decreasing. Troop levels in Iraq peaked at 285,000 in April 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, almost twice the number of U.S. troops in-country. Some troops en route or deployed to Kuwait were not sent into Iraq, with the 1st Cavalry Division being turned back. Monthly averages show the peaks and valleys of troop deployment. Troop levels in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom fluctuated, peaking at 285,000 in April 2003. By September 2001, troop levels dropped to 130,000 from the invasion peak of 149,000. In October 2003, OIF troop levels decreased to 170,000. The gap between troops in Iraq and those part of the OIF operation narrowed from 140,000 to 40,000. In March 2004, OIF troop levels spiked to 270,000, possibly in anticipation of power transfer to an Iraqi government by June 30, 2004. Troop levels for OIF reached about 216,000 in FY2003. Troop levels for the Iraq War remained relatively stable from FY2004 to FY2006, with Boots on the Ground headcounts increasing slightly while Operations Report for OIF numbers decreased. The OIF share of average strength rose by over 20,000 during this period. The gap between Boots on the Ground and Average Strength estimates likely reflects the buildup of in-theater support as the war continued. Troop levels for the Iraq War remained stable from FY2004 to FY2006, with support increasing as the war continued. Major regional support and headquarters countries included Kuwait, ships afloat, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. Security incidents per week grew from 500 in March 2005 to 1,600 in June 2007. In response, President Bush announced a surge of 30,000 troops in January 2007. Troop levels in Iraq increased by 30,000 troops or five brigade combat teams over several months. The Army extended tour lengths for active-duty units from 12 to 15 months to carry out the troop increase. This increase was gradually implemented over seven months and then reversed over ten months. Troop levels in Iraq increased by 30,000 troops over several months, with the Army extending tour lengths for active-duty units. The increase was gradually implemented over seven months and then reversed over ten months. In FY2006 to FY2007, troop strength grew by 9,000, reaching 251,000 in FY2008. President Bush announced a return to 12-month tours in April 2008, and additional troops were deployed to Afghanistan in January 2009. Troop levels in Iraq increased by 30,000 troops from 138,000 to 169,000 in Iraq and from 185,000 to 219,000 for OIF between February and September 2007 during the surge. The increase was gradually reversed between September 2007 and September 2008, with troop levels falling back to 147,000 in Iraq and 219,000 for OIF. Troop levels in Iraq decreased from 169,000 to 147,000 and for the operation as a whole from 219,000 to 181,000. Different reports provide varying perspectives on troop numbers in Afghanistan and Iraq, with limitations in capturing all personnel involved. The Average Strength Reports are crucial for estimating manpower costs as they measure person-years and deployment durations. However, they do not allocate service members between OEF and OIF, requiring CRS to estimate these allocations. Location Reports capture all deployments for OEF and OIF but are not reliable before FY2006. Standard guidelines for allocating military personnel between OEF and OIF would improve the reliability of troop strength measures. The reliability of troop strength measures for the Afghan and Iraq Wars could be improved by standard guidelines for allocating military personnel between OEF and OIF. Concerns have been raised about the frequent deployments of units, impacting readiness and availability for future crises. The burden of frequent deployments on service members is a concern, especially in the Army. In FY2008, Army troops (active-duty, National Guard, and Reserves) made up 61% of OEF and OIF troops, with Marine Corps troops contributing 12%. Active-duty forces comprised 80% and reserve forces 20% of average strength. In FY2008, deployment rates varied among active-duty and reserve U.S. military personnel. Approximately 17% of active-duty forces were deployed, with the highest rate in the Army at 26%. In comparison, only 7% of reserve forces were deployed. The Marine Corps had a deployment rate of 16%, the Navy 12%, and the Air Force 8%. Deployment rates for reserves in other services were generally lower, around half or less than the rate for active-duty forces. Deployment rates for reserves in other services were generally half or less than the rate for active-duty forces. For example, about 7% of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve were deployed compared to 26% for active-duty Army in FY2008. Additionally, roughly twice as many troops are affected by OEF and OIF as the number deployed, with half of the active-duty Army either deployed, undergoing intensive training to deploy, or recovering from a deployment. The Army's readiness for other operations is a concern due to a large share of active-duty forces dedicated to OEF and OIF. The Administration announced the deployment of 21,000 more troops to Afghanistan in FY2009, in addition to a combat brigade approved by President Bush in December 2008, increasing troop levels by 30,000. The Administration announced the deployment of 21,000 more troops to Afghanistan in FY2009, in addition to a combat brigade approved by President Bush in December 2008, increasing troop levels by 30,000. Troop levels in Iraq are planned to decline to 35,000 to 50,000 by August 31, 2010, with a total withdrawal by the end of 2011 as required by the Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq. The CRS assumes that U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan and Iraq until the last five months of 2011 to meet the withdrawal deadline. Two BCTs will be withdrawn by the end of FY2011 and three in the first quarter of FY2012. The schedule estimates the time BCTs will be in-country, calculating the number of weighted average Brigade Combat Team equivalents in each fiscal year. Each BCT is assumed to have 9,000 troops, reflecting Marine Corps units' smaller size. Troops are added or withdrawn at the end of each month. The schedule assumes troops are added or withdrawn monthly, with Navy and Air Force supporting Army and Marine Corps. CRS validated this method by estimating troop levels in Iraq in FY2007 and FY2008, close to reported BOG figures. Estimates for FY2009-FY2012 build on reported numbers as of September 1, 2008. To estimate future war costs, budgeters look to past experience and adjust for changes in troop levels and new requirements. The cost of an average Brigade Combat Team has risen between FY2005 and FY2008 due to higher operational costs and rapid growth in investment spending. The Administration's new policy to limit war-related procurement may reduce future costs, but it is uncertain if the rise in infrastructure spending in Iraq will be duplicated in Afghanistan. The CRS only received information about future troop changes in Afghanistan and Iraq. The CRS spreads all war costs over the number of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, assuming changes in troop numbers will be proportional. War costs cover funding for additional expenses related to deploying military personnel to war zones, including special pays, bonuses, and activating reservists. Some personnel changes may not be proportional to troop changes in-country. The war costs include expenses such as paying full-time salaries to reservists, increasing the size of the Army and Marine Corps, transferring some expenses to the DOD's baseline budget, and reducing war costs in FY2010. These costs cover items like transporting personnel and equipment, repairing war-worn equipment, providing force protection gear, and setting up communication and intelligence assets. Additionally, procurement and RDT&E costs involve replacing and upgrading war-worn equipment. The DOD's modernization plans include equipment upgrades for F-22s and Stryker brigades, accelerating the Army's conversion to standardized units, restructuring Marine Corps units, and providing force protection gear like MRAPs and HMMWVs. The FY2009 Supplemental Request saw a change in reconstitution definition, leading to a decrease in DOD's procurement request. The DOD's procurement request in FY2009 was halved due to changes in war costs, including military construction in Afghanistan. Between FY2005 and FY2008, average monthly troop strength in Afghanistan increased by 58%, with overall war costs nearly doubling. The average cost of a BCT in Afghanistan rose by 19%, with operational costs rising less rapidly than investment costs. The increase in O&M costs by almost 50% was offset by an 8% decrease in military personnel costs. In Afghanistan, O&M costs more than doubled for combat-related expenses and trebled for base support costs, increasing more rapidly than troop strength. Investment costs for replacing and upgrading equipment also more than trebled in the past three years. Between FY2005 and FY2008, average monthly troop strength in Iraq increased by 10% while the cost of deploying a BCT rose by 72%. The average cost of a BCT in Iraq rose from $4.6 billion to $7.2 billion, a 57% increase. Overall operating costs in Iraq rose by about 40%, with military personnel and O&M costs growing faster than troop strength. Military personnel costs increased due to the expansion of the Army and Marine Corps, while O&M costs grew at a rate of about 50%, mainly in support expenses. The cost of base support rose by 41% while troop strength grew by 10%, with investment costs doubling over three years. Increases in average costs may be due to higher benefits for deployed personnel, combat intensity, equipment repair spending, support costs for large bases, and expanded reconstitution definitions. The steepest increase in costs has been in investment accounts, particularly procurement, reflecting changes in reconstituting units after war-related deployments. The reconstitution of units after war deployments saw significant changes between 2004 and 2008, leading to a substantial increase in war-related procurement from $5 billion in FY2004 to $45 billion in FY2008. Various organizations questioned the necessity of this funding for procurement. The definition of war-related procurement expanded to include restructuring Army and Marine Corps units. Despite claims that these changes would simplify rotations, their impact seems minimal. In 2006, the definition of war-related procurement expanded to include items needed for the \"long war\" beyond OEF and OIF. DOD also allowed for upgrading equipment to meet new threats, not just replacing war losses. Studies found that a significant portion of Army reset funding was not related to repairing war-worn equipment. The 2008 CSBA study criticized the broad scope of war-related funding requests, including the inclusion of costs for increasing the size of the Army and Marine Corps. President Bush's decision in 2007 to make these increases permanent weakened the rationale for considering these war costs. The Obama administration reversed this policy in FY2009 and limited war-related procurement to replacing war losses. The Obama administration reversed the policy of broad war-related funding requests in FY2009, limiting procurement to replacing war losses. DOD objected to Congressional additions for non-war related systems and indicated a slowdown in operational cost increases. In FY2008, additional troops were deployed outside Afghanistan and Iraq as part of OEF and OIF. Combat and security costs in Afghanistan or Iraq are generally higher than average due to hostile environments. Troop levels rising in Afghanistan have led to increased costs. The average cost of a BCT in Afghanistan could rise slightly due to increased troop levels and intensified combat. Savings from withdrawals in Iraq may not match changes in troop strength immediately, but could occur the following year. Savings from the previous year may offset current year savings delays. Costs could rise with troop redeployments from Iraq, but withdrawal costs are manageable and spread over two to three years. Congressional Budget Office projects war costs for FY2009-FY2018 with scenarios of gradual troop decreases for OEF and OIF. The Congressional Budget Office projects war costs for FY2009-FY2018 with scenarios of gradual troop decreases for OEF and OIF. CBO assumes savings initially fall slower than troop levels, catching up by the second or third year. A 9,000 troop BCT could save about $7 billion a year under the more rapid scenario, rising to $9.6 billion per BCT during a steady-state. The Congressional Budget Office projects war costs for FY2009-FY2018 with scenarios of gradual troop decreases for OEF and OIF. A 9,000 troop BCT could save about $7 billion a year under the more rapid scenario, rising to $9.6 billion per BCT during a steady-state. Withdrawal of an average BCT in Iraq would save about $7.2 billion and in Afghanistan about $8.2 billion. CBO's figures may be higher due to additional costs included. Troop strength plays a crucial role in setting DOD's future costs. The DOD has not adopted a single definition of countries included in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The Joint Staff and Central Command have developed guidelines for allocating troops to each mission, with some differences in allocations affecting about 770 military personnel. Countries may have assigned missions without deployed personnel. The Joint Staff guidelines were created to meet a congressional reporting requirement for troops deployed in support of OIF and OEF. Some concerns were raised about linking personnel and operations, as military personnel in certain locations worked on both OEF and OIF. The OEF mission primarily includes troops in Afghanistan and 5,000 to 15,000 troops in other countries. The OIF operation involves troops from various countries deployed in Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, and on ships in the region. The mission also includes troops in Afghanistan and other countries for counter-terror operations related to OEF. Troop levels are detailed in tables and figures provided by Central Command."
