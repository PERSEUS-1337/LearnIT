    "content": "Leaders in Congress prioritize immigration reform in the 113th Congress, focusing on comprehensive legislation including border security, employment verification, legal immigration revision, and solutions for unauthorized aliens. A bipartisan group of Senators proposed a framework with new temporary worker visas, supported by President Obama and former President George W. Bush. President George W. Bush made comprehensive immigration reform a top priority during his second term, focusing on increased border security, enforcement of immigration laws, and revisions to worker visas. Efforts to pass CIR legislation in the 109th and 110th Congresses failed, with some calling it a highly charged issue. The 2006-2007 CIR bills were extensive, with the major bills addressing border protection, antiterrorism, and illegal immigration control. The report provides a comparative overview of key provisions in three major Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR) bills from the 109th and 110th Congresses. It includes a narrative discussion and a table summarizing the key features of the bills. The report concludes with observations on the CIR debate during the 2006-2007 period compared to the current context. The report summarizes key provisions in major Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR) bills from the 109th and 110th Congresses, including amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) since 1952. Congress has made significant changes to immigration law over the years, but comprehensive reform has not been achieved. On November 14, 2005, H.R. 4312, the Border Security and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2005, was introduced by Representative Peter King. The House Homeland Security Committee reported H.R. 4312 on December 6, 2005. On the same day, H.R. 4437, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005, was introduced by Representative James Sensenbrenner. The House Judiciary Committee reported H.R. 4437 on December 13, 2005. The House Rules Committee met on December 14, 2005, to consider the rule for floor debate on H.R. 4437. On December 14, 2005, the Rules Committee rejected a key vote on creating a guest worker visa program for unauthorized aliens. They approved 15 floor amendments for H.R. 4437 and passed the legislation on December 16, 2005, with provisions on border security and immigration enforcement. H.R. 4437 addressed immigration fraud, worksite enforcement, alien smuggling, and migrant detention. The Senate proposed a CIR bill and the Securing America's Borders Act with similar provisions on border security and legal immigration. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported a modified version of the Chairman's mark with a broad legalization program. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on S. 2454 and the Judiciary Chairman's mark during floor debate from March 28, 2006 to April 7, 2006. Senators Chuck Hagel and Mel Martinez proposed alternative language to keep immigration on the Senate's agenda. Chairman Specter, along with Senators Hagel, Martinez, Kennedy, McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Sam Brownback, introduced a compromise bill known as the McCain-Kennedy bill (S. 2611) on April 7, 2006. This bill included provisions for a broad legalization program and reforms to legal immigration, such as expanded guest worker visas. The Senate passed S. 2611 in 2006, which included expanded guest worker visas and a pathway for unauthorized aliens to become legal permanent residents. President Bush supported comprehensive immigration reform, emphasizing the need to address all elements of the issue together for a solution. In 2006, the Senate passed S. 2611 with expanded guest worker visas and a pathway for unauthorized aliens to become legal permanent residents. However, Congressional leaders failed to form a conference committee, causing H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 to expire. In the 110th Congress, Senators Kennedy and McCain worked on a bipartisan approach to Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR) based on S. 2611. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced S. 1348 in 2007, similar to S. 2611, but lacked Republican support. In May 2007, Senators Kennedy and Specter introduced a bipartisan compromise proposal for comprehensive immigration reform. The proposal included provisions for strengthening employment verification, interior enforcement, and border security. It also aimed to revise legal immigration and temporary worker programs, allowing unauthorized aliens to become legal permanent residents under certain conditions. In June 2007, the Senate debated a modified version of the bipartisan immigration reform bill (S. 1639) under a limited amendment process. Despite initial support, the bill failed to pass cloture by a vote of 46 to 53. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on S. 1639, ending the drive for CIR legislation in the 110th Congress. A comparative analysis of key features of CIR legislation in the 109th and 110th Congress is provided, focusing on border security, interior immigration enforcement, worksite enforcement, legal immigration, and unauthorized aliens. The Appendix offers a detailed discussion of the major bills. The discussion focuses on the provisions in major bills related to border security, specifically addressing the control of entry and exit of foreign nationals through official ports and patrolling land and maritime borders to prevent illegal entries. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the U.S. Border Patrol are key agencies responsible for enforcing these provisions. The INA grants CBP and border patrol authority to search, interrogate, and arrest unauthorized aliens. Bills aimed to enhance border security with more resources, personnel, and technology. Foreign nationals need a visa to enter the US, subject to inadmissibility grounds like health, criminal history, security concerns, and illegal presence. Major bills did not propose significant changes to these grounds. The bills aimed to revise specific grounds for inadmissibility related to national security, illegal entry, and gang membership. The INA requires inspection of all aliens seeking entry into the US, with border inspections being crucial for those entering without visas. The US-VISIT entry-exit system mandates certain foreign nationals to provide biometric identifiers upon arrival. The major bills aimed to expedite US-VISIT implementation and expand DHS authority to require biometric identifiers from aliens entering the US. They also sought to broaden expedited removal for aliens lacking proper documentation or committing fraud, limiting review to cases involving U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. Additionally, the bills included new criminal penalties. The major bills in the 109th and 110th Congresses aimed to increase immigration control and enforcement by including new criminal penalties for immigration-related violations, expanding DHS detention facilities, and making more classes of aliens subject to detention pending removal. The bills also strengthened penalties for illegal entry and re-entry, as well as passport and visa offenses. The INA prohibits smuggling of aliens across the U.S. border and harboring aliens within the country, exposing both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals to criminal liability. The bills in the 109th and 110th Congresses aimed to increase immigration control and enforcement by adding new criminal penalties for immigration-related violations, expanding detention facilities, and broadening the range of acts considered alien smuggling. The bills also strengthened penalties for illegal entry and re-entry, as well as passport and visa offenses. Additionally, the bills would have expanded the definition of \"aggravated felony\" and defined unlawful presence as a criminal offense. Immigration-related document fraud includes counterfeiting, sale, and use of identity documents. The bills in the 109th and 110th Congresses aimed to increase immigration control and enforcement by adding new criminal penalties for immigration-related violations, expanding detention facilities, and broadening the range of acts considered alien smuggling. The bills also strengthened penalties for illegal entry and re-entry, as well as passport and visa offenses. Additionally, the bills would have expanded the definition of \"aggravated felony\" and defined unlawful presence as a criminal offense. Immigration-related document fraud includes counterfeiting, sale, and use of identity documents, with civil enforcement provisions in place for individuals and entities engaging in such fraud. The bills proposed increasing criminal penalties for immigration and document fraud, expanding the categories of aliens subject to mandatory detention, and specifying circumstances for alien removal from the United States. The bills in the 109th and 110th Congresses aimed to increase immigration control and enforcement by adding new criminal penalties for immigration-related violations, expanding detention facilities, broadening the range of acts considered alien smuggling, and strengthening penalties for illegal entry and re-entry. The inadmissibility grounds include violations of immigration status, criminal offenses, failure to register, document fraud, security risks, becoming a public charge, and unlawful voting. Removal proceedings involve an immigration judge determining if an alien is removable, with revisions to the grounds for removal similar to those for inadmissibility. The debate surrounding state and local efforts to deter unlawfully present aliens has raised questions about legislation aimed at deterring unauthorized aliens and the role of state and local police in enforcing federal immigration law. The House-passed bill in the 109th Congress reaffirmed states' authority to assist in enforcing immigration laws, while the Senate-passed bill focused on criminal provisions. The final Senate CIR bill in the 110th Congress did not include comparable provisions. Since the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, it has been illegal for employers to hire unauthorized aliens. Employers must verify new hires' work eligibility through paper-based or electronic systems like E-Verify. All three bills proposed mandatory electronic employment eligibility verification systems. The bills proposed mandatory electronic employment eligibility verification systems for employers, with increased penalties for worksite enforcement. Employers violating laws may face civil and criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment for knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens. Major differences in legal immigration were seen across the bills in the Senate. The House-passed legislation in the 110th Congress did not address legal immigration, except for eliminating the diversity visa category. Immigrants are legal permanent residents subject to numerical limits and preference categories based on family relationships, skills, and geographic diversity. Each year, countries are held to a 7% per-country limit of U.S. immigrant admissions. The pool of eligible immigrants typically exceeds the worldwide level set by U.S. immigration law. Each year, the number of prospective Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) waiting in the queue exceeds the worldwide level set by U.S. immigration law. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are admitted outside of numerical limits. Family-based LPRs must be related to a U.S. citizen or LPR, while employment-based LPRs must have a job offer from a U.S. employer. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows for various categories of employment-based immigrants, including those with extraordinary abilities, investors creating new jobs, and special immigrants. The INA allocates 140,000 admissions annually for these immigrants. Proposed bills in Congress aimed to increase LPR admissions, revise definitions, and replace the employment-based system with a merit-based one, while eliminating the diversity visa lottery. The proposed bills in Congress aimed to increase LPR admissions by creating a \"STEM visa\" for foreign nationals with graduate degrees in STEM fields. This visa would allow them to adjust their immigration status to LPR without waiting in the queue of numerically limited LPR visas. Additionally, the bills would have allowed foreign nationals with advanced degrees in STEM fields and work experience in the US to become LPRs. The House bill did not have similar provisions for nonimmigrants. Nonimmigrants are admitted for a specific purpose and a temporary period of time, required to leave when visas expire. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories, with the H visa being the main category for temporary workers. Professional workers use the H-1 visa, while seasonal workers have the H-2A and H-2B visas available. Efforts to reform temporary worker visas for guest workers failed in Congress. The Senate bills proposed revisions to temporary worker visas, including new Y visas. They addressed unauthorized aliens in the US, distinguishing between civil and criminal offenses. Unauthorized presence is not a crime under the INA. Unauthorized presence is not a crime under the INA. An alien unlawfully present for over 180 days but less than a year is inadmissible for three years, while over a year results in a 10-year inadmissibility. Waivers are possible for family members facing extreme hardship. The INA indefinitely bars aliens who reenter without admission after being ordered removed or unlawfully present for over a year. House and Senate bills in the 109th and 110th Congresses differed on criminalizing unauthorized presence. Senate bills in the 109th and 110th Congresses proposed \"earned legalization\" for unauthorized aliens meeting specific criteria and paying penalties. The 110th Congress bill included a transitional pathway through a Z visa, contingent on border security measures. The DREAM Act provisions in both bills aimed to grant LPR status to unauthorized aliens brought to the US as children. Legislation also targeted unauthorized agricultural workers. The AgJOBS legislation, proposed since the late 1990s, aims to reform the H-2A visa program for agricultural workers and legalize the status of farm workers. The economic recession from 2007 to 2009 has impacted efforts to address Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR) legislation, with high unemployment rates still affecting support for certain elements of CIR. Support for Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR) remains dampened by high unemployment rates, but proponents argue it is crucial for economic growth. Illegal entries to the US have decreased, with the unauthorized resident alien population stabilizing at 11.1 million in 2011. Factors such as declining birth rates in Mexico and increased border security have contributed to this trend. Investments in immigration enforcement have led to decreased unauthorized migration levels. Six laws since 2006 have strengthened border security. Increased funding post-9/11 has improved immigration control measures. Fiscal concerns contrast with the 2005-2007 period. The 113th Congress faces tough decisions on prioritizing border security and immigration control resources within fiscal constraints. The U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on state involvement in immigration policy have impacted the debate. The 113th Congress must prioritize border security and immigration control resources within fiscal constraints. The Supreme Court has limited states' ability to independently enforce immigration laws. Over 3 million LPRs have become U.S. citizens since 2007, highlighting the importance of immigration policy and the stakeholders in the CIR debate. Balancing immigration reform is a current challenge. The challenge of immigration reform today is balancing the hopes of employers for more foreign workers, families wanting to stay together, unauthorized aliens seeking legal status, and the need for migrants to follow the law. The debate revolves around whether Congress will change immigration policies through comprehensive reform or incremental revisions. The Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 (H.R. 4437) addressed border security, law enforcement roles, employment verification, alien smuggling, detention, and other enforcement issues. H.R. 4437 focused on border security, including provisions on unlawful presence, voluntary departure, expedited removal, and denying U.S. entry to nationals from countries that refused to accept deported nationals. It required a National Strategy for Border Security, adding personnel, surveillance, and infrastructure resources at ports of entry, and collaborating with the Department of Defense for increased surveillance using military equipment. It also mandated enhancements to the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT). H.R. 4437 aimed to enhance border security by making the US-VISIT Program interoperable with FBI criminal datasets and implementing a 10-fingerprint system for aliens entering the country. It also sought to involve state and local governments in immigration enforcement and conduct a border security exercise within one year of enactment. H.R. 4437 aimed to enhance border security by involving state and local governments in immigration enforcement. It required mandatory detention of apprehended aliens and reaffirmed states' authority to assist in enforcing immigration laws. The bill also mandated the creation of a training manual for law enforcement officers. H.R. 4437 aimed to involve state and local law enforcement in immigration enforcement by authorizing grants for equipment and facilities related to immigration law enforcement. It allowed states to reimburse themselves with DHS grants for activities related to preventing unlawful entry into the US. The bill also required designated sheriffs near the southern border to be reimbursed for costs associated with transferring detained aliens. H.R. 4437 aimed to establish a mandatory employment eligibility verification system for all employers, with increased penalties for violations. It also required verification of previously hired workers within six years. H.R. 4437 aimed to rewrite alien smuggling provisions in the INA, broadening the types of acts considered smuggling and establishing mandatory minimum sentences. It also enhanced penalties for carrying firearms during smuggling offenses and allowed for the seizure of property used in smuggling. The House-passed bill H.R. 4437 aimed to restrict judicial review of visa revocation, while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611) included provisions on enforcement, unlawful presence, voluntary departure, and reform of legal immigration. S. 2611, part of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, included provisions for expanded guest worker visas, increased legal permanent admissions, and allowing certain unauthorized aliens to become LPRs by paying penalty fees. It also had border security measures similar to H.R. 4437, such as a National Strategy for Border Security, adding personnel and surveillance resources at ports of entry, and collaborating with DOD for military surveillance equipment at the border. S. 2611 proposed increasing military surveillance equipment at the border, enhancing data collection for interoperability with FBI datasets, and adding 20,000 new detention beds. It also included provisions for border enforcement personnel, National Guard deployment, and broadening DHS authority on public lands. S. 2611 aimed to improve communication for DHS agents at the border, establish a \"virtual fence\" with surveillance assets, create new criminal penalties for evading inspection, enhance U.S.-Mexican cooperation on border security, and combat alien smuggling. S. 2611 aimed to improve communication for DHS agents at the border, establish a \"virtual fence\" with surveillance assets, create new criminal penalties for evading inspection, enhance U.S.-Mexican cooperation on border security, combat alien smuggling, and provide new exemptions for persons or organizations assisting unauthorized aliens on humanitarian grounds. Senate-passed S. 2611 aimed to establish mandatory minimum sentences for alien smuggling, enhance penalties for firearms possession during smuggling, and allow for property seizure related to smuggling. It also reaffirmed state authority to enforce immigration laws and directed DHS to implement a mandatory employment eligibility verification system for all employers. The Senate-passed S. 2611 aimed to establish a mandatory employment eligibility verification system for all employers, requiring them to verify the identity and employment eligibility of individuals hired after a certain date. DHS could designate critical employers based on homeland security needs or if there was reasonable cause to believe they had violated prohibitions on unauthorized employment. Individuals terminated based on the verification system's determination of ineligibility could seek administrative recourse. S. 2611 would have maintained the I-9 system with modifications and increased penalties for employer violations. It would have also allowed for compensation for lost wages if individuals were wrongly determined to be ineligible to work. In terms of family-based immigration, the bill would have removed immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from the overall family-sponsored numerical limit, potentially increasing family-based admissions by 226,000 annually. S. 2611 would have increased the annual number of employment-based LPRs to 450,000 from FY2007 through FY2016, with a limit of 290,000 thereafter. It would have reallocated employment-based visas to different categories, including priority workers, professionals with advanced degrees, skilled shortage workers, employment creation investors, and unskilled shortage workers. S. 2611 aimed to increase the annual number of employment-based LPRs to 450,000 from FY2007 through FY2016, with a limit of 290,000 thereafter. It would have reallocated visas to priority workers, professionals with advanced degrees, skilled shortage workers, and unskilled shortage workers. An amendment placed an overall limit of 650,000 on employment-based LPRs and their accompanying family annually. The bill S. 2611 aimed to increase the number of employment-based LPR visas to ease visa wait times for oversubscribed countries like China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines by raising the per-country limit and overall preference allocation. The bill S. 2611 aimed to increase employment-based LPR visas by eliminating exceptions to per-country ceilings, providing exemptions for certain workers in STEM fields, widows, and orphans. It also proposed to increase overall immigration levels by reclaiming unused visas and rolling them over to the following year. Additionally, the bill sought to expand guest worker and temporary foreign worker visas. The Senate-passed bill S. 2611 aimed to establish separate legalization pathways for immigrants, allowing the Secretary of DHS to adjust the status of eligible aliens to LPR status. The bill required aliens to prove physical presence in the U.S. before April 5, 2001, and not have departed during the period until April 5, 2006. The Senate-passed bill S. 2611 aimed to establish separate legalization pathways for immigrants, allowing eligible aliens to adjust their status to LPR status. Requirements included proving physical presence in the U.S. before April 5, 2001, establishing employment for at least three years during the specified period, and payment of income taxes. Additionally, aliens who couldn't meet all requirements could apply for Deferred Mandatory Departure (DMD) status for up to three years. The Senate-passed bill S. 2611 aimed to establish separate legalization pathways for immigrants, allowing eligible aliens to adjust their status to LPR status. Aliens granted DMD status could apply for immigrant or nonimmigrant status while in the U.S. and could exit and re-enter at certain land points of entry. Additional provisions in the bill enabled certain unauthorized aliens to apply for LPR status, including a \"blue card\" program for agricultural workers. The Senate-passed bill S. 2611 aimed to establish separate pathways for immigrants to obtain LPR status, including a \"blue card\" program for agricultural workers. The DREAM Act in Subtitle C allowed aliens who entered the U.S. before age 16 and met certain requirements to apply for LPR status without numerical limitations. S. 1639 in the 110th Congress aimed to strengthen employment eligibility verification, interior immigration enforcement, and border security. It proposed a point system for legal immigration, expanded temporary worker programs, and provided a pathway for unauthorized aliens to legalize their status by meeting requirements and paying penalty fees. The bill also included provisions for increased border enforcement personnel, infrastructure, surveillance technology, access to public lands, secure communications, and interoperability with FBI databases for the US-VISIT system. S. 1639 in the 110th Congress aimed to strengthen employment eligibility verification, interior immigration enforcement, and border security. It included provisions for increased border enforcement personnel, infrastructure, surveillance technology, access to public lands, secure communications, and interoperability with FBI databases for the US-VISIT system. The bill also proposed a point system for legal immigration, expanded temporary worker programs, and provided a pathway for unauthorized aliens to legalize their status by meeting requirements and paying penalty fees. S. 1639 aimed to increase immigration enforcement resources and personnel, expand grounds for inadmissibility and removal, encourage compliance with voluntary departure agreements, and amend criminal prohibitions for unlawful entry. Unlike H.R. 4437, S. 1639 did not criminalize illegal presence and focused on rewriting federal laws criminalizing immigration-related fraud. The bill S. 1639 aimed to expand federal laws criminalizing immigration-related fraud, facilitate cooperation between federal immigration enforcement authorities and state/local police, and establish a new employment eligibility verification system. The bill S. 1639 aimed to establish a new electronic Employment Eligibility Verification System (EEVS) that would eventually become mandatory for all employers in the United States. The Secretary of DHS would have the authority to require federal contractors, critical infrastructure industries, and those related to national security to participate in the EEVS. Within 18 months of enactment, all employers would need to use the EEVS for newly hired and certain current employees, and within three years, all employees would need to be verified through the system. Individuals who could not be confirmed by the EEVS would receive final notices regarding their employment status. Under S. 1639, the EEVS would establish a new electronic Employment Eligibility Verification System. Individuals receiving final non-confirmation notices could seek review but not compensation for lost wages due to system errors. The bill would also modify the current I-9 system and penalties for employer violations, require disclosure of taxpayer identity information, issue more secure Social Security cards, and establish a voluntary fingerprint verification program for employment eligibility. Under S. 1639, employers could use employees' fingerprints for identity verification and employment eligibility. The bill would have restricted family-based immigration by eliminating certain family-sponsored preference categories for adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens and LPRs. This would have reduced the worldwide level for family preferences to 127,000 and set a yearly ceiling of 440,000 until pending cases cleared. Immediate relatives exempt from numerical limits would have been redefined. Under S. 1639, family-based immigration would have been restricted by eliminating certain preference categories for adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens and LPRs. Immediate relatives exempt from numerical limits would have been redefined to include only spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens. Parents of adult U.S. citizens would no longer be treated as immediate relatives, with an annual cap of 40,000. Spouses and minor children of LPRs would remain capped at 87,000 annually. Employment-based immigration would have seen the elimination of the first three preference categories, replaced with a point system for \"merit-based\" immigrants based on employment, education, English and civics, and family relationships. Under S. 1639, family-based immigration would have been restricted by eliminating certain preference categories for adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens and LPRs. Immediate relatives exempt from numerical limits would have been redefined to include only spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens. The special immigrant and investor/job creation employment-based preference categories would have remained. Temporary Workers In terms of temporary workers, S. 1639 would have repealed the H-2B visa, revised the H-2A and H-1B visas, and established new temporary worker visas (Y visas). The proposed Y-1 visa would have covered aliens coming temporarily to the United States to perform certain types of temporary labor or services. The Y-1 visa would have sunset after five years. The proposed Y-2 or Y-2B visa would have covered aliens coming temporarily to the United States to perform seasonal nonagricultural labor or services. Y-2B nonimmigrants would have been granted a period of admission of 10 months. Following this period, they would have needed to be physically present outside the United States for two months before they could have been readmitted to the country in Y status. There would have been no limit on the number of times a Y-2B nonimmigrant could be readmitted. The Y-2 visa would have been capped at 100,000 for the first fiscal year, with a maximum cap of 200,000 in subsequent years based on demand. An exemption from the cap would be provided for certain individuals. The proposed Y-3 visa would cover spouses and children of Y-1 or Y-2B nonimmigrants, capped at 20% of the annual limit. S. 1639 also included pathways for unauthorized aliens to gain legal status through Z and Z-A visas. The proposed Z-1 visa would cover aliens who had been continuously present in the US since January 1, 2007, and were employed. There would be no limit on the number of aliens eligible for Z-1 status. Applicants would receive probationary benefits like employment authorization. The period of admission for a Z-1 nonimmigrant would be four years, with the option for unlimited extensions. The proposed Z-2 and Z-3 visas would cover family members of Z-1 aliens who have been continuously present in the US since January 1, 2007. There would be no limit on the number of aliens eligible for Z-2 or Z-3 status. Applicants would receive probationary benefits such as employment authorization. The proposed Z-A visa would cover aliens coming to the US for agricultural service, meeting specified requirements. The Z-A visa would have required at least 863 hours of agricultural employment in the US within a 24-month period ending on December 31, 2006. A maximum of 1.5 million Z-A visas could have been issued, with spouses and minor children eligible for dependent visas. Z-A nonimmigrants could seek multiple extensions and apply for LPR status. S. 1639 would have allowed certain unauthorized aliens to adjust to LPR status through a point system after working in the US on the Z visa. The Z-to-LPR adjustments under S. 1639 would have been based on a merit-based point system with additional factors like agricultural work experience, U.S. employment experience, home ownership, and medical insurance. These adjustments would not have counted towards worldwide ceilings on permanent admissions. The bill would have established different worldwide ceiling levels for the merit-based point system, with a set number allocated for exceptional Y visa holders and reducing the employment-based backlog. The merit-based point system under S. 1639 would have seen a gradual decrease in worldwide levels, with specific allocations for exceptional Y visa holders and reducing the employment-based backlog. When priority dates on pending cases reached May 1, 2005, adjustments for Z-to-LPR would have been triggered, outside the worldwide level. The proposal in S. 1639 included provisions for a new F-4 visa category for foreign students in STEM fields to obtain practical training in the US for up to 24 months. It also included a version of the DREAM Act tied to a new \"Z\" nonimmigrant visa category for certain unauthorized aliens to obtain legal status. S. 1639 included provisions for a new F-4 visa category for foreign students in STEM fields to obtain practical training in the US for up to 24 months. It also included a version of the DREAM Act tied to a new \"Z\" nonimmigrant visa category for certain unauthorized aliens to obtain legal status. Unlike other DREAM Act bills, S. 1639 did not completely repeal the IIRIRA provision but made it inapplicable for aliens with probationary Z or Z status. Trigger mechanisms were included to ensure effective enforcement of enhanced border security and employment verification requirements. The bill included provisions for triggers to be certified by DHS and GAO before certain worker and legalization provisions could go into effect. Triggers included achieving operational control of the Southwest border, deploying Border Patrol agents and barriers, implementing detention policies, and establishing employment verification systems. The bill included trigger provisions linked to temporary workers and legalization, requiring certification by DHS and GAO before certain provisions could take effect. These triggers focused on border control, deployment of agents, detention policies, and employment verification systems."
