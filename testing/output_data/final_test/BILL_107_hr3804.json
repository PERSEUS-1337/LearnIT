The Congress finds that various antibiotics used in humans are also given to healthy agricultural animals, leading to antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can be transmitted to humans, complicating the treatment of infections. In 1969, the Swann Committee in the UK recommended dividing antimicrobials into \"feed\" and \"therapeutic\" classes, with restrictions on using drugs for growth promotion in animal production. The World Health Organization advised in 1997 against using antibiotics for promoting animal growth if they are also used to treat humans. The National Academy of Sciences reported a link between antibiotics in food animals, bacterial resistance, and human disease. In 1998, the EU banned human-use antibiotics for animal growth promotion, effective July 1, 1999. Individual European countries had already banned specific antibiotics in animal feed prior to this action. An April 1999 study by the General Accounting Office found that resistant strains of salmonella, campylobacter, and E. coli in humans are linked to antibiotic use in animals. In October 2000, the FDA announced plans to withdraw approval for fluoroquinolone antibiotics in poultry due to increased resistance. Abbott Laboratories agreed to withdraw its product, but Bayer Corp. is contesting the FDA's decision. Bayer Corp. is contesting FDA's proposed withdrawal of approval for its product, despite urging from health organizations to comply. The American Medical Association and other groups have opposed nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials in animal agriculture. In October 2001, the New England Journal of Medicine published an editorial urging a ban on nontherapeutic use of medically important antibiotics in animals. A Federal Interagency Task Force released an Action Plan in January 2001, warning about the growing threat of drug-resistant pathogens. Scientific studies have shown that resistance traits can be transferred among unrelated species of bacteria. Resistance traits can be transferred among unrelated species of bacteria, including from nonpathogens to pathogens. SEC. 3. REQUIRING PROOF OF SAFETY OF ANTIMICROBIAL NEW ANIMAL DRUGS. Section 512(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require proof of no harm to human health from antimicrobial new animal drugs due to nontherapeutic use. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to restrict nontherapeutic use of certain antimicrobial new animal drugs, including penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincomycin, and sulfonamides. The approval of nontherapeutic use of certain antimicrobial drugs in animals is rescinded after a two-year period unless the Secretary determines no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance. The Secretary may withdraw approval of an antimicrobial new animal drug if there is a risk to human health, even before the drug would be rescinded automatically. If the Secretary grants an exemption under section 505(i) for a new animal drug, approvals for nontherapeutic use of the drug in animals are rescinded after two years unless specified otherwise. Notice must be provided within 10 days of the exemption. If the Secretary grants an exemption under section 505(i) for a new animal drug, approvals for nontherapeutic use of the drug in animals are rescinded after two years unless specified otherwise. Notice must be provided within 10 days of the exemption, as per subparagraph (C). The Secretary may inform the holder of an approved application for a nontherapeutic antimicrobial animal drug about the applicability of certain regulations, including the possibility of rescinding approval and the opportunity to submit data. Subparagraphs (A) or (B) apply unless the Secretary determines otherwise before rescinding approval. The Secretary may inform the holder of an approved application for a nontherapeutic antimicrobial animal drug about regulations, including the possibility of rescinding approval. The holder must demonstrate no harm to human health due to antimicrobial resistance from the drug. Data submitted after 180 days from notice cannot be considered. The Secretary may withdraw approval of an antimicrobial new animal drug if there is a risk to human health. A new section is added regarding the rescinding of approval for fluoroquinolones in poultry. The Human Treatment Act of 2002 states that approval of a drug for use in poultry is rescinded after 180 days unless the Secretary determines no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance. The Secretary cannot consider data on fluoroquinolones submitted by the drug holder. The Human Treatment Act of 2002 requires the Secretary to rescind approval of a drug for poultry use within 180 days unless no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance is found. The Secretary cannot accept further submissions to FDA Docket No. 00N-1571. The definition of nontherapeutic use for an antimicrobial new animal drug is clarified as any use in an animal without disease."
