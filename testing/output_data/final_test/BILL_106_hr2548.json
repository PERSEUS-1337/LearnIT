    "content": "The \"Department of Defense Anthrax Vaccination Moratorium Act\" prohibits the implementation of the mandatory anthrax vaccine program without considering its impact on morale, retention, recruiting, and budget. It also emphasizes the importance of researching and developing truly effective vaccines, antibiotics, protective equipment, detection devices, and nonproliferation measures. SEC. 3. MORATORIUM OF VACCINATION PROGRAM. The Secretary of Defense suspends the anthrax vaccination program for the Armed Forces. No further vaccinations can be administered except as allowed by this Act. SEC. 4. STUDY BY NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will conduct an independent study on the effectiveness and safety of the anthrax vaccine used in the Department of Defense program. The study will determine adverse reactions, long-term health implications, and efficacy of the vaccine against all strains of anthrax pathogens. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will conduct an independent study on the effectiveness and safety of the anthrax vaccine used in the Department of Defense program, focusing on validation of the manufacturing process, definition of vaccine components, and other necessary matters. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will conduct a study on the anthrax vaccine used in the Department of Defense program. The study will assess the vaccine's effectiveness and safety, with a focus on manufacturing process validation and vaccine component definition. The Director will submit a report to relevant committees and the Secretary of Defense, detailing the study results and determinations. The Defense anthrax vaccination program has a high systemic reaction rate. Questions remain about the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing noncutaneous transfer of anthrax and its production meeting FDA standards. SEC. 5. GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE STUDY. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the inoculation program and the use of contractor-operated facilities. The study will focus on effects on military morale, retention, recruiting, civilian costs, and accurately recording medical conditions before and after inoculation. The Comptroller General will review the Secretary's report on the inoculation program, including screening for allergens and adverse reactions, and provide comments to Congress within 75 days. Public comment on the study will also be allowed. The Secretary of Defense will expedite consideration of applications for remedies related to adverse personnel actions resulting from the anthrax vaccine program. This includes rescission of court-martial convictions, administrative discharges, retirements, restoration of flying status, back pay, expunging negative performance appraisals, and granting physical disability certificates. Additionally, there is a provision for the contingent resumption of the vaccination program. The Secretary of Defense will expedite consideration of applications for remedies related to adverse personnel actions resulting from the anthrax vaccine program, including rescission of court-martial convictions, administrative discharges, and restoration of flying status. The Director of the National Institutes of Health may allow the resumption of the Department of Defense anthrax vaccination program if specific criteria are met, such as low systemic reaction rates and effectiveness in preventing noncutaneous transfer of anthrax. The anthrax vaccine must be produced in a way approved by the FDA. If the anthrax vaccination program restarts, only newly produced vaccine can be used."
