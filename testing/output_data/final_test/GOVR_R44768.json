    "content": "Member-to-Member correspondence in Congress has a long history, with Representatives needing permission from colleagues to introduce legislation. The use of \"Dear Colleague\" letters dates back to the early 20th century, as seen in a 1913 example between Representatives Gray and Page outlining proper conduct for House Members. In 1916, Representative William P. Borland wrote a \"Dear Colleague\" letter outlining proper conduct for House Members. These letters are official correspondence widely distributed in Congress to encourage support for legislation, collect signatures, invite to events, provide updates, and share general information. \"Dear Colleague\" letters are now primarily sent electronically through internal networks in the House and Senate, replacing paper forms. The e-\"Dear Colleague\" system in the House allows tagging with policy issue terms, sending letters with graphics and hyperlinks, and subscribing based on issue terms. The system also has a searchable archive of letters sent after 2008. The report provides a comparative analysis of the use of e-\"Dear Colleague\" system in the House of Representatives between the 111th Congress (2009-2010) and the 113th Congress (2013-2014). It discusses the methodology, purpose, and characteristics of \"Dear Colleague\" letters, as well as observations on their use as internal communications in Congress. Since 2003, \"Dear Colleague\" letters have been sent electronically in the House of Representatives. The email system was replaced by the web-based e-\"Dear Colleague\" system in 2009. Data for analysis were divided into two datasets covering letters sent between January 2003 and December 2014. The first dataset includes the total number of electronic letters sent during this period, collected from the Legislative Information System archive. The second dataset covers letters sent between January 2009 and December 2014 using the e-\"Dear Colleague\" system. Paper letters were not included in the data. The dataset analyzed includes \"Dear Colleague\" letters sent through the e-\"Dear Colleague\" system during the 111th and 113th Congresses, allowing for a comparison of usage evolution since the 111th Congress. The analysis was conducted by CRS in partnership with a team. During the 2015-2016 academic year, CRS and a capstone class at Texas A&M University analyzed \"Dear Colleague\" letters from the 113th Congress. Data included the date sent, issue terms, sending office, title, and bill/resolution number. A total of 72,254 letters were coded for purpose, sender type, political party, and legislation disposition. Overall, a total of 72,254 \"Dear Colleague\" letters were analyzed, with 31,767 from the 111th Congress and 40,487 from the 113th Congress. The number of electronic letters sent between 2003 and 2014 has generally increased over time, with fluctuations in some years. Figure 1 illustrates the annual volume of electronic \"Dear Colleague\" letters sent during this period, totaling 136,331 letters. There is a trend of fewer letters being sent in even-numbered years, especially during presidential election years like 2008 and 2012. The analysis of \"Dear Colleague\" letters sent each year shows an increase in electronic distribution. Figure 2 displays the average number of letters sent monthly from 2003 to 2014, aligning with the congressional work schedule. The pattern of letters sent in the first and second sessions was similar, but varied after September. After September, the average number of \"Dear Colleague\" letters sent diverged between the first and second sessions. There was a decline in October of the second session, with a significant reduction in August due to the district work period. Members are more focused on constituent service duties during these periods. Additionally, there is a decline in letters sent during election years, especially presidential election years. The flow of internal communications, specifically \"Dear Colleague\" letters, decreases during congressional district work periods and presidential election years. The analysis focuses on letters sent by Members, committees, officers, and commissions in the 111th and 113th Congresses. House leaders also sent letters, but in smaller numbers. In the dataset for the 111th Congress, the majority of \"Dear Colleague\" letters were sent by Members to request legislative cosponsors. Committees accounted for a small percentage of these letters, but it is possible that committee members sent letters in their own name. There was variation by party in who used the e-\"Dear Colleague\" system. In the 111th and 113th Congress, Democrats sent the majority of \"Dear Colleague\" letters, even though Republicans held the majority in the latter. These letters are used to garner support or opposition for bills and resolutions. \"Dear Colleague\" letters are used in Congress to solicit support or opposition for bills and resolutions, inform Members about events or changes in House operations, and circulate important announcements. In Congress, \"Dear Colleague\" letters are categorized with up to three issue terms when sent electronically. The majority of offices assigned three categories to their letters in the 111th and 113th Congresses. The categories were created based on conversations with offices using the earlier email-based system. No updates or changes have been made to the categories. In the House of Representatives, \"Dear Colleague\" letters are categorized with up to three issue terms when sent electronically. The categories have remained unchanged since they were approved in 2008. Some categories were used more frequently than others, with healthcare and foreign affairs being the most popular in both the 111th and 113th Congresses. During the 111th and 113th Congresses, \"Dear Colleague\" letters were categorized based on issue terms, with healthcare and foreign affairs being the most popular. Family issues ranked third in the 113th Congress. The sender selects a category for each letter, reflecting the House's legislative agenda. Each letter was examined and categorized to determine its purpose. During the 113th Congress, \"Dear Colleague\" letters were categorized into seven categories to capture content more effectively: 1. solicited cosponsors for legislation 2. collected signatures for letters to officials 3. invited Members/staff to events 4. solicited membership for caucuses 5. provided general information 6. advocated specific floor action 7. announced administrative policies. During the 111th Congress, the invitation category was divided to separate requests to attend a briefing from those soliciting membership in a caucus. The information category was also split to separate letters that were purely informational from those advocating a specific floor action. For letters expressing multiple goals, the most prominent purpose was coded. During the 111th and 113th Congresses, \"Dear Colleague\" letters were mainly used to solicit cosponsors for bills and resolutions, with 53.0% and 42.0% of letters serving this purpose, respectively. These letters provide an overview of the legislation, reasons for cosponsorship, and list current cosponsors. Additionally, they are used to invite Members or staff to events, receptions, or briefings. In the 113th Congress, \"Dear Colleague\" letters included invitations to events, receptions, or briefings, accounting for 23.5% of letters sent. This increase suggests that Members of Congress may have been promoting briefings and events more frequently compared to previous congresses.

The electronic distribution system allows for linking letters to specific legislation, with a decline in the percentage of linked letters from the 111th to the 113th Congress. The percentage of \"Dear Colleague\" letters linked to legislation declined from the 111th to the 113th Congress, except for House bills which saw an increase. The number of linked letters by type of legislation mirrored the overall introduction of legislation. The adoption of the e-\"Dear Colleague\" system in 2008 led to an increase in the number of letters sent in the House. The increase in the volume of \"Dear Colleague\" letters in the House raises questions about the system's capacity to handle and archive them. Access to historic letters is important for Members and committees. Ensuring continued availability of internal communication for Members and staff to understand past actions is crucial. The increase in \"Dear Colleague\" letters poses challenges for offices in handling and receiving them efficiently. Implementing a system-level process to manage letters could help prevent issues like receiving multiple copies or missing relevant letters. The characteristics and purpose of \"Dear Colleague\" letters in the House raise questions about improving the current system. Adding information on a letter's purpose could help target the correct audience, while linking these letters to Congress.gov could assist Member and committee offices in identifying letters related to specific legislation. Adding additional issue terms to \"Dear Colleague\" letters could help senders target their audience better, but may also result in more letters being sent out. Limiting issue terms to three per letter could help manage the potential influx of letters. The current e-\"Dear Colleague\" system requires multiple letters to be sent, potentially causing subscribers to sort through numerous letters. Automating responses to cosponsorship requests could alleviate the burden on individual offices. Most letters are sent by individual House Members and committees, with a smaller percentage sent by the Committee on House Administration and House officers for administrative purposes. The e-\"Dear Colleague\" system is used for announcing administrative and operational provisions in the House. It allows for easy access to policy implementation or enforcement announcements. For example, in the 113th Congress, a new policy required the use of franked mailing labels for large items. The House may need to comply with new Postal Service regulations regarding franking. The current e-\"Dear Colleague\" system is effective for distributing and archiving letters. Changes to the system can be made if necessary to improve infrastructure or user interface. The number of electronic \"Dear Colleague\" letters sent has been increasing over the years. The report analyzed the increasing volume of \"Dear Colleague\" letters sent, which closely follows the congressional calendar. More letters are sent during the first session of a Congress than the second session, with a decline in letters and legislative activity towards the end of a Congress.

Members frequently ask colleagues to support legislative ideas through these letters. During the 111th and 113th Congresses, the number of \"Dear Colleague\" letters sent to solicit cosponsors increased. Cosponsorship remains the primary reason for sending these letters in the House, serving as a signaling mechanism to show support for legislative ideas. Members use these letters to gauge support for specific ideas and explore interest in general policy areas. Party, committee service, and caucus membership can aid Members in forming social networks and influencing others to take specific actions.
