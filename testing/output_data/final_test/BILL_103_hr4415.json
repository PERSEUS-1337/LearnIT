    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Black Lung Benefits Restoration Act of 1994\" and references amendments to the Black Lung Benefits Act. Section 2 addresses benefit overpayment. The Black Lung Benefits Restoration Act of 1994 includes amendments to the Black Lung Benefits Act regarding the repayment of benefits paid on a claim filed before final adjudication, with exceptions for fraud or deception. The trust fund is responsible for refunding payments made as reimbursement and reimbursing operators for denied claims. The Secretary's initial determination of eligibility is crucial in the claims process. The responsible operator must start paying benefits within 30 days of a determination or award. Failure to make timely payments results in the determination or award being considered final. SEC. 3. EVIDENCE. Section 422 (30 U.S.C. 932) is amended to allow up to 3 medical examinations as evidence for benefits claims. The responsible operator and trust fund can each request one medical examination at no cost to the claimant. An administrative law judge can also order a medical examination if deemed necessary. The amended Section 422 allows up to 3 medical examinations as evidence for benefits claims. Good cause is required for an examination when the judge cannot determine entitlement from existing evidence. Pulmonary evaluations and medical records can be submitted as evidence. Additionally, each party can present one interpretive medical opinion. The amended Section 422 allows up to 3 medical examinations as evidence for benefits claims, including pulmonary evaluations and medical records. A request for modification of a denied claim is treated as a new claim, and the treating physician's opinion is given substantial weight in determining eligibility for benefits. Eligibility for benefits requires a board-certified physician in a relevant specialty to diagnose total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis through a medical examination consisting of a physical exam and clinical studies. SEC. 4. SURVIVOR BENEFITS. The amendment to Section 422 of the U.S. Code now considers a miner's death as a result of pneumoconiosis if they were receiving benefits for it or were totally disabled by it at the time of death. Additionally, widows or widowers of miners married for less than 9 months can only receive survivor benefits if they were the parent of the miner's child. The widow or widower of a miner is disqualified from receiving survivor benefits if they remarry before age 50 and cannot receive increased benefits due to remarriage. SEC. 5. RESPONSIBLE OPERATOR. Section 422(h) (30 U.S.C. 932(h)) is amended to include provisions for determining operator liability under the Act. The Secretary must conduct an investigation, provide notice, and hold a hearing to determine if an operator meets the criteria for liability. If a hearing is requested, the decision must be issued within 120 days and is not subject to further review. If a hearing is deemed to be without reasonable grounds, the administrative law judge may assess penalties. The administrative law judge may assess the operator for the costs of the proceeding if a hearing is deemed to be without reasonable grounds (not to exceed $750). SEC. 6. ATTORNEY FEES. Section 422 (30 U.S.C. 932) is amended to allow claimants to receive all reasonable costs and expenses, including expert witness and attorney's fees, if entitled to benefits in any administrative or judicial proceeding. This applies to proceedings related to the claim. The court will determine and assess reasonable costs and expenses, including expert witness and attorney's fees, incurred by the claimant in a judicial proceeding. If no operator is responsible, the fund will be assessed. The determination must be made within 60 days of the claimant's petition submission, and payment should be made within 45 days unless a motion to reconsider is filed. If an operator pays costs and expenses assessed in a judicial proceeding and the claimant is later found ineligible for benefits, the fund will reimburse the operator. The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act applies to individuals receiving these payments for services rendered to a claimant. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION.\n\nNo appeal to the Benefits Review Board can be made unless ordered by an administrative law judge. The Secretary of Labor cannot delegate the authority to refuse to acquiesce in a Federal court decision.\n\nSEC. 8. REFILING.\n\nClaims filed under the Black Lung Benefits Act before the effective date of this Act can be refiled for de novo review on the merits after the effective date.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. In the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, amendments are made regarding coke ovens, including defining operations related to coke ovens and expanding protections for workers in those areas. Amendments are made to the Black Lung Benefits Act and Pneumoconiosis section to include workers who work or have worked at a coke oven or in related operations. The legislative history accompanying this Act will control if a term is ambiguous in any legal proceeding. The Act and its amendments will take effect on October 1, 1994, with some exceptions for specific claims."
