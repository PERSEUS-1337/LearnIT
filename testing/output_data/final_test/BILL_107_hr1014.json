The country leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related deaths compared to other industrialized nations. In the United States, the number of children dying from unintentional firearm injuries is alarming. However, a significantly higher number of children are treated for nonfatal gunshot wounds in emergency rooms annually. Studies have shown that most unintentional gunshot wounds involving children are caused by handguns, and even children as young as 3 years old are capable of firing commercially available handguns. The study revealed that young children have the finger strength to fire a majority of commonly available handguns. Firearms in the US lack minimum safety standards, despite 74% of the population supporting regulation. Firearms and safety locks involved in accidental discharges move across state lines. Many trigger locks are ineffective in preventing accidental firearm discharge or children accessing the firearms, which often cross state lines. REGULATION OF HANDGUN DISCHARGE PROTECTION PRODUCTS. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of injury to children. Regulations will establish a minimum safety standard for these products, including those permanently installed in handguns. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to prevent children from operating a handgun. The standard will require quality construction and a method of access approved by the manufacturer. Test protocols for poison prevention packaging may be considered. The deadline for issuing the standard is within 12 months of the enactment of the Act. The standard issued under subsection (b) must meet the requirements and will take effect 6 months after issuance. SEC. 4. ORDERS; INSPECTIONS. The Secretary has the authority to issue orders prohibiting the manufacture, sale, transfer, or delivery of a handgun discharge protection product that violates the Act. They can also require the recall, repair, or replacement of such products and provide notice of associated risks to the public. The manufacturer or dealer of a product must take actions such as bringing the product into compliance with regulations, repairing or replacing it, refunding the purchase price, recalling the product, or submitting a plan for implementation of required actions. The Secretary may inspect places where handgun discharge protection products are manufactured, stored, or transported for commercial purposes to ensure compliance with the Act and its regulations. SEC. 5. UNLAWFUL ACTS. It will be illegal for licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers to sell handguns without the required discharge protection product. There is an exception for sales to government agencies. SEC. 6. WARNING LABELS FOR HANDGUNS. SEC. 6. WARNING LABELS FOR HANDGUNS. A licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer must display a warning label on handgun packaging and materials. The label must contain a specific statement in conspicuous and legible type. The warning label on handgun packaging must prevent child access by keeping handguns locked away and unloaded. The label should be in contrast with other printed matter on the package. The warning label on handgun packaging must prevent child access by keeping handguns locked away and unloaded. The label should be affixed to the handgun by a method prescribed by the Secretary, and this section will take effect 60 days after the enactment of the Act. Licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers must report any information indicating a child's injury or death from a handgun they sold. Enforcement measures are also outlined. The Secretary can impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation of the Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act. Additionally, the Secretary has the authority to revoke a federal firearms license for violations of the Act. Individuals affected by violations can pursue damages through a private cause of action in a US district court. Private enforcement of the Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act allows any interested person to bring an action in a US district court to enforce the Act or restrain violations. The court may award attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff. Compliance with the Act is not a requirement for pursuing remedies under this provision. The Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act allows private enforcement through US district courts, with the court able to award attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff. Liability under common law or State statutory law is not relieved by compliance with the Act. Failure of the Secretary to take action authorized by the Act is not admissible in litigation. Criminal penalties include fines and imprisonment for knowingly violating provisions of the Act or regulations regarding handgun discharge protection products. SEC. 9 of the Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act clarifies that state laws remain in effect unless they conflict with the Act, with priority given to laws providing greater protection for children. SEC. 10 provides definitions.
