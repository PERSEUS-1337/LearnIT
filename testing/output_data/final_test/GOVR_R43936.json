    "content": "The FCC and its predecessor have long promoted diversity in broadcasting, supported by the U.S. Supreme Court. This includes encouraging diversity of viewpoints, programming, and outlet diversity in local broadcast media. The FCC promotes diversity in broadcasting by encouraging outlet diversity, minority and female ownership, and localism. They aim to ensure multiple independently owned media outlets in a geographic market and restrict the number of outlets a single entity can own to promote competition. The FCC also evaluates if stations are responsive to community needs and have incentives for diverse programming. Antitrust authorities focus on pricing for advertisers and cable companies. The FCC is directed by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to review its media ownership rules every four years to ensure they are in the public interest due to competition. The act also promotes diversity of media voices and economic competition. The FCC must balance this mandate with the requirement that its rules withstand U.S. Supreme Court scrutiny regarding selective application based on race or gender of owners. In August 2016, the FCC completed the 2014 Quadrennial Review of its media ownership rules, including attribution rules, media ownership limits, and diversity rules. The new rules took effect on December 1, 2016. The National Association of Broadcasters petitioned the FCC to reconsider the decision. The News Media Alliance and Prometheus Radio Project have appealed the FCC's media ownership rules in court, arguing that the rules are outdated and do not serve the public interest. The cases have been consolidated in the District of Columbia Circuit. The debate on media ownership rules is influenced by changing news consumption patterns. Surveys show a decline in local broadcast TV as a news source, while online sources are on the rise. Print newspapers are decreasing in popularity. Questions arise about the impact of common ownership on diversity of viewpoints. Characteristics of broadcast TV and radio stations play a role in determining media ownership rules. The FCC uses signal contours and media market limits to determine compliance with media ownership rules. Analog broadcast television signal contours were previously used but became obsolete with the transition to digital service in 2009. The FCC now considers digital television service contours, including the digital \"principal community contour\" (digital PCC), to define signal strength requirements for serving a station's community of license. The FCC established the digital \"noise limited service contour\" (digital NLSC) to ensure that at least 50% of residents can receive the signal a majority of the time. For FM radio, the 1 millivolt-per-meter (1 mv/m) contour provides satisfactory service to 70% of locations on the outer rim at least 90% of the time. The FCC also delineates three types of service areas for AM radio stations: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The FCC defines primary service areas for radio stations based on signal strength requirements for different population sizes. AM broadcast stations need 2 millivolts-per-meter for populations of 2,500 or more, and 0.5 mV/m for smaller communities. The FCC also uses Designated Market Areas (DMAs) for regulatory purposes. The FCC uses Designated Market Areas (DMAs) by Nielsen to define local television and radio markets. Nielsen assigns counties to specific DMAs based on viewing habits. Radio markets, called \"Metros,\" generally correspond to metropolitan statistical areas defined by the U.S. government. BIA Kelsey's database is used to determine the number of radio stations in a market. The FCC uses BIA Kelsey's database to enforce attribution rules on commercial broadcast stations to prevent undue influence. Joint sales agreements allow one station's sales staff to sell advertising for another station in the same market. In 2014, the FCC adopted rules regarding television JSAs, limiting the sale of advertising time on a competing station to 15%. The deadline for compliance was extended to September 30, 2025. In 2016, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals deemed the FCC's initial rules invalid, stating that media ownership attribution rules are tied to media ownership rules. The FCC readopted the JSA attribution rules in August 2016. In August 2016, the FCC readopted its JSA attribution rules along with the \"duopoly rule,\" limiting ownership of multiple TV stations in a market. Stations must file copies of JSAs with the commission. Transition procedures differ from those adopted in 2014. The deadline for compliance is September 30, 2025, with grandfathering provisions until then. FCC did not clarify if JSA waivers on a case-by-case basis still apply. In August 2016, the FCC adopted new disclosure requirements for joint operating agreements (SSAs) among broadcast television stations. Each station must file a copy of the SSA in its online public inspection file pending OMB approval. Licensees must report oral SSAs in writing to the FCC, with the ability to redact confidential information. An SSA is defined as any agreement where a station provides station-related services. The FCC adopted new disclosure requirements for joint operating agreements (SSAs) among broadcast television stations in August 2016. SSAs involve stations providing station-related services, and the disclosure requirements do not apply to noncommercial television stations, radio stations, and newspapers. The FCC concluded that industry-wide disclosure of SSAs is necessary. The FCC adopted new disclosure requirements for joint operating agreements (SSAs) among broadcast television stations in August 2016. Industry-wide disclosure of SSAs is necessary for evaluating their impact on competition, diversity, and localism. The FCC has rules governing ownership of multiple media outlets in a single market, including local television ownership rules and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules. The FCC may make SSAs attributable in the future. The FCC has rules governing ownership of multiple media outlets in a single market, including local television ownership rules and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules. An entity may own or control two television stations in the same television market, as long as the overlap of the stations' signals is limited and does not violate the \"top four/eight voices test.\" The FCC adopted a TV duopoly rule in 1941, with a signal overlap component added in 1964 and the \"top four ranked/eight voice\" component in 1999. The FCC has rules governing ownership of multiple media outlets in a single market, including local television ownership rules and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules. The \"top four ranked\" stations in a local market are typically the local affiliates of ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC. The rules apply to stations' ranking at the time of common ownership application. The \"eight voices\" test limits duopolies to larger television markets with more separately owned stations. In 2016, the FCC changed signal contours to digital NLSC for stations transitioning to digital television. In 2016, the FCC made changes to signal contours for stations transitioning to digital television, aiming to minimize disruption. They also prohibited \"affiliation swaps\" that would allow control over two top stations in a market. The FCC retained the \"failed station/failing station\" waiver test for local television rules. The FCC criteria for determining a failed or failing station remain strict to prevent manipulation of data. The Failed Station Solicitation Rule requires public notification and demonstration of unsuccessful attempts to find an out-of-market buyer. These rules aim to promote new entry in local television markets. The FCC's rules promote new entry in local television markets by ensuring that entities outside the DMA, including women and minorities, have the opportunity to bid. Local radio ownership rules limit ownership of stations in the same geographic area, with criteria differing from those for television ownership. FCC adopted rules for FM and AM radio station ownership in 1940 and 1943 respectively. In 1964, the FCC adopted rules using service contours of FM and AM stations to define service areas. Ownership limits for AM and FM stations serving the same area were first established in 1970 and amended in 1989. In 1992, the FCC relaxed radio ownership rules based on total commercial stations in a market. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed the FCC to revise ownership rules, with caps specified in Section 202(b) remaining in place today. The FCC retained local radio ownership rules in 2016, clarifying aspects such as assigning radio stations to Nielsen Audio Metros for compliance. In Puerto Rico, signal contour overlaps are used instead. Cross-ownership rules limit owning broadcast radio and TV stations in the same area, specifying conditions for proximity and counting media voices. The FCC determines the number of media voices in a market by using broadcast signals and market analysis. Rules were first adopted in 1970, with contour limits being less restrictive than previous ownership rules. In 1999, the \"media voice\" component was added to the rule. The FCC also implemented a waiver standard for failing stations but did not see the need for additional waivers. The FCC did not apply a FSSR for radio/TV cross-ownership waivers, using Nielsen's DMAs to count independently owned media voices. Broadcast television stations with overlapping signals are counted as a single voice, while radio stations in the radio Metro are included in the count. The FCC uses Nielsen's DMAs to count independently owned media voices for radio/TV cross-ownership waivers. They apply larger analog signal contour limits for television stations and use different broadcast television signals to trigger the rules and count voices. The FCC redefined signal contours in 2016 to reflect digital television transition, using digital PCC for rule triggers and digital NLSC for television voice count. The FCC uses digital PCC for rule triggers and digital NLSC for television voice count to ensure reliable service and prevent common ownership of broadcast television and radio stations. The FCC's rules on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership (NBCO) limit ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the same area based on radio and television markets and broadcast signals. Unlike local television and radio/television cross-ownership rules, NBCO rules do not include a voice test. The FCC defines a daily newspaper as one published four or more days per week in the dominant language of the market and circulated generally in the community of publication. The FCC's rules on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership (NBCO) limit ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the same area based on radio and television markets and broadcast signals. The FCC prohibits common ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers where their signals encompass the locality of a newspaper. The FCC stated that stations are expected to provide coverage of community issues within their signal contours, but not outside of them. The FCC's criteria for newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership (NBCO) rules focus on stations providing attention to local problems and issues within their signal contours. In 2016, the FCC retained the NBCO rules, including the prohibition on cross-ownership of newspapers and television stations. The rules now consider digital signals and relevant television and radio markets for trigger determination. The FCC uses the digital PCC for NBCO rules, unlike the television duopoly rules. The FCC prohibits cross-ownership of a full-power television station and a daily newspaper when the community of license of the television station and the community of publication of the newspaper are in the same Nielsen DMA, and the digital PCC of the television station encompasses the entire community in which the newspaper is published. This ensures that the newspaper and television station serve the same media market. The FCC prohibits cross-ownership of a full-power radio station and a daily newspaper in Nielsen Audio Markets if their communities of license and publication are in the same market, ensuring they reach the same consumers. Nielsen's radio market boundaries help determine this. Nielsen's determination of radio market boundaries is crucial for assessing media voice reliance in communities. The FCC allows exceptions to ownership rules for failing stations, waivers for diversity protection, and grandfathered status due to rule changes. The FCC favors exceptions over waivers for proposed mergers. The FCC adopted an exception standard for proposed mergers involving failed or failing broadcast stations or newspapers, stating that waivers would be considered on a case-by-case basis if applicants can prove no harm to viewpoint diversity. The FCC believes that preventing the disappearance of failed/failing entities can enhance, not diminish, viewpoint diversity. The same criteria for failed/failing stations are used for exceptions to ownership rules and waivers for television duopoly rules. The FCC adopted an exception standard for proposed mergers involving failed or failing broadcast stations or newspapers, stating that waivers would be considered on a case-by-case basis if applicants can prove no harm to viewpoint diversity. The FCC plans to evaluate waiver requests by assessing \"the totality of the circumstances for each individual transaction\" without measuring it against a set of defined rules. The FCC adopted a case-by-case waiver approach for proposed mergers, evaluating the totality of circumstances without predefined criteria. Waivers will be considered if no harm to viewpoint diversity is proven, allowing flexibility to assess important factors and determine impact accurately. The FCC adopted a case-by-case waiver approach for proposed mergers, evaluating the totality of circumstances without predefined criteria. Waivers will be considered if no harm to viewpoint diversity is proven, allowing flexibility to assess important factors and determine impact accurately. The FCC will allow waivers of the NBCO Rule[s] if applicants can show that the proposed combination will not unduly harm viewpoint diversity, signaling a recognition that enforcing the prohibition against ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station may not always be necessary for promoting viewpoint diversity. Requests for waivers must be filed before a newspaper acquisition, and existing newspaper-broadcast combinations that no longer comply with the NBCO rules will be grandfathered. The FCC will not allow licensees to transfer grandfathered newspaper-broadcast combinations due to 2016 changes, but will permit existing combinations to continue if grandfathered or approved by permanent waiver. This policy aims to ensure compliance with current rules when properties are sold voluntarily, while minimizing hardships on licensees. The FCC's dual network rule prohibits common ownership of two of the \"top four\" networks but allows ownership of multiple broadcast networks. Initially aimed at NBC in 1941 for radio networks, it was extended to television networks in 1946. The rule was revised in 1996 to prevent affiliation with multiple networks. The FCC's dual network rule, established in 1996, prohibits affiliating with an entity that controls more than one of the top four networks. In 2001, the rule was revised to allow joint ownership of emerging networks, leading to CBS Corporation's partial ownership of the CW network. The rule was retained in 2016 to promote competition and localism. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered the FCC to consider standards for defining eligible entities for exceptions to media ownership rules, citing the Communications Act of 1934. Section 309(i)(3)(A) promotes diversity in media ownership by granting preference to minority-controlled groups in license applications. In 1997, the Balanced Budget Act directed the FCC to resolve broadcast station applications by competitive bidding, promoting opportunities for minority-owned businesses. The FCC must ensure participation of small businesses, rural companies, and minority/women-owned businesses. In 1999, the FCC relaxed media ownership rules to address concerns about consolidation hindering new licensees. Studies were conducted to ensure rules withstand legal scrutiny and expand opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses in the broadcast industry. The FCC relaxed media ownership rules in 1999 to address consolidation concerns and expand opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses in the broadcast industry. In addition, the FCC implemented a notification requirement to give minorities and women a chance to bid on stations. The commission also repealed and relaxed media ownership rules in 2002, including the failed station solicitation rule, to promote efficiency in same-market station operations. The FCC deferred consideration of other proposals to advance minority and female ownership for future review. In 2004, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the repeal of the FSSR, directing the FCC to consider promoting minority broadcast ownership. The FCC reinstated the FSSR in 2007 as part of the Quadrennial Review Order. In 2003, the FCC established \"eligible entities\" to promote diversity of ownership in the broadcast industry. In 2008, the FCC allowed exceptions to radio/television cross-ownership rules for small businesses to promote diversification of media ownership and create new opportunities for women and minorities. In 2011, the Third Circuit vacated and remanded measures adopted in the 2008 Diversity Order by the FCC, ruling that the revenue-based eligible entity definition failed to increase broadcast ownership by minorities and women. The court directed the FCC to consider other definitions to advance broadcast ownership diversity. In 2016, the Third Circuit ordered the FCC to act promptly on defining eligible entities for broadcast ownership diversity. The FCC addressed its constitutional authority to target minority and female ownership, finding that promoting viewpoint diversity could pass legal tests, but lacked evidence for other elements. The FCC concluded it lacked evidence to pass other elements of the Supreme Court's tests for rules on minority and female ownership diversity. Studies commissioned did not show a direct and substantial connection, and there was no feasible way to adopt race- or gender-based measures. The FCC reinstated the revenue-based eligible entity standard in 2016. In 2016, the FCC reinstated the revenue-based eligible entity standard for small businesses owning broadcast stations with annual revenue of $38.5 million or less. This exemption allows for less restrictive media ownership rules and more flexible licensing policies. The FCC reinstated the revenue-based eligible entity standard for small businesses owning broadcast stations with annual revenue of $38.5 million or less in 2016. This exemption allows for less restrictive media ownership rules and more flexible licensing policies. The rationales for retaining and tightening these rules are outlined in other portions of the 2014 Quadrennial Review and the Media Bureau Public Notice."
