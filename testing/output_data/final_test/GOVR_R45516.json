    "content": "The TIFIA program provides low-interest loans for surface transportation projects, administered by the Build America Bureau. It was reauthorized in the FAST Act from FY2016 to FY2020 with $300 million authorized for loans in FY2019 and FY2020. State departments of transportation can also use federal-aid highway grant money to subsidize larger loans. The program aims to support large-scale transportation projects with long-term financing. The TIFIA program, established in 1998, encourages public-private partnerships and private financing in surface transportation. It has provided $32 billion in assistance to 74 projects with a total cost of $117 billion. Congress has used TIFIA as a model for other initiatives like the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program. There are proposals to expand TIFIA assistance, including the Trump Administration's $200 million plan. The Trump Administration's $200 billion infrastructure plan aims to expand TIFIA assistance by adding budget authority and expanding eligibility to ports and airports. However, there are limitations to financing projects through TIFIA, including challenges in developing revenue mechanisms, the need for grant funding, and attracting private investment to risky projects. TIFIA assistance mainly consists of loans, with only one loan guarantee provided to date. TIFIA assistance mainly consists of loans, with a maximum of 49% of project costs. Despite a higher limit in law, loans are generally limited to 33% of project costs to share credit risk. Eligible projects include highways, public transportation, and intermodal connectors. Eligible applicants include state and local governments, transit agencies, and private entities. Surface transportation projects are not evaluated based on projected benefits and costs. Projects eligible for TIFIA assistance are assessed based on creditworthiness, with a requirement for investment-grade ratings from credit agencies. The project cost threshold varies depending on the type of project, with loans needing to be repaid through a dedicated revenue stream. TIFIA financing is attractive due to its low cost and flexibility. The TIFIA financing program offers low-cost, flexible, and long-term federal credit assistance for infrastructure projects. Loans can be repaid over up to 35 years with options for repayment deferral and flexible amortization. TIFIA can reduce transaction costs associated with borrowing, making it an attractive option for projects like the I-15 Tolled Express Lanes Project in Riverside County, California. The TIFIA financing program offers low-cost, flexible, and long-term federal credit assistance for infrastructure projects like the I-15 Tolled Express Lanes Project in Riverside County, California. Using TIFIA financing can save money compared to traditional bond financing, making it easier to attract capital for projects like toll roads. TIFIA loans can be senior or subordinate debt, with a provision for the federal government to be treated equally with senior debt holders in case of project bankruptcy, known as the \"springing lien.\" TIFIA financing is considered to reduce project risk and secure private financing at lower rates. It allows for projects to be constructed earlier and accelerate project delivery. The program's cost and flexibility advantages may increase the number of projects financed and delivered on an accelerated schedule. For example, the managed lanes project on U.S. 36 in Colorado was completed 20 years earlier than expected with TIFIA assistance. The TIFIA program allows for accelerated project delivery by reducing project risk and securing private financing at lower rates. Project sponsors can apply for credit assistance from the DOT, with a fee of $250,000 required for acceptance into the program. Additional fees may be necessary if DOT's costs exceed $250,000. For projects under $75 million, DOT can use federal funds to cover costs instead of charging fees to borrowers. The TIFIA program offers credit assistance up to $2 million annually without charging fees to borrowers. DOT reviews the letter of interest, financial analysis, and project sponsor's creditworthiness. An oral presentation is required before submitting a formal application. DOT must determine application completeness within 30 days and inform the applicant within 60 days. The final decision is made by the Secretary of Transportation based on staff recommendations. The FAST Act required DOT to create an expedited application process for low-risk projects requesting $100 million or less in credit assistance with a dedicated revenue stream. Projects financed under TIFIA must comply with laws and regulations including NEPA requirements for environmental impact assessment. The TIFIA loan process for infrastructure projects is praised for predictability but criticized for being slow and bureaucratic. Transurban, an operator of toll roads, cited the slow approval process as a reason for not pursuing a TIFIA loan for a project in Virginia. Critics argue that the TIFIA program office has become more risk-averse, favoring low-risk projects. The TIFIA program is governed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) governs the TIFIA program, which covers administrative and subsidy costs for credit assistance. The subsidy cost estimate considers potential losses from loan defaults. Budget authority from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) funds the TIFIA program. When a loan is made, the subsidy cost is deducted from the budget authority and repaid to the Treasury with interest. Budgeting is done for a cohort of loans funded together. The subsidy cost estimate for credit programs is calculated for a cohort of loans funded by budget authority. If the estimate is accurate, the government incurs no additional costs. The subsidy rate determines the amount of credit assistance available to borrowers after deducting administrative costs. With a lower subsidy rate, the government can offer more credit assistance as it expects higher repayment amounts. The TIFIA program uses a subsidy rate of 5% to lend $2,000 for every $100 of budget authority. Estimates of the cost of credit assistance rely on interest rates, loan repayment, and default rates. The subsidy rate is periodically reestimated by DOT and OMB to assess risk and project performance. The TIFIA program uses a subsidy rate for loans originated in fiscal years, with rates ranging from 15.16% to 3.36%. The subsidy rate for FY2019 is estimated at 6.3%, with reestimates ranging from -8.06% to 46.12%. Negative subsidy rates indicate expected repayments exceeding loan amounts. The cost to the government is approximately 7 cents for every dollar financed, but does not consider the market value of financial risk. The TIFIA program costs 33 cents for every dollar financed, with reduced DOT capacity due to lower authorized amounts in the FAST Act compared to MAP-21. States can use funds from other highway programs to cover subsidy and administrative costs. The TIFIA program costs 33 cents for every dollar financed, with reduced DOT capacity due to lower authorized amounts in the FAST Act compared to MAP-21. States can use funds from other highway programs to cover subsidy and administrative costs. Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects Program, known as INFRA grants, and other programs can increase TIFIA financing. Unused funds accumulate yearly, with $1.65 billion unobligated budget authority in the TIFIA program at the end of FY2018. The TIFIA program has accumulated funds despite a clawback provision in MAP-21. Every credit agreement has been a loan except for one loan guarantee. TIFIA has provided loans worth $32 billion through FY2018. The average TIFIA share of project costs has been about 28%. The program has averaged about four loans per year worth $1.6 billion in FY2018 dollars. The TIFIA program has provided loans worth $32 billion through FY2018, with an average of about four loans per year totaling $1.6 billion. Two-thirds of loans have gone to highway and highway bridge projects, with user charges like highway tolls being the most common revenue pledge by borrowers. Projects have been geographically limited to 21 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, with ten states accounting for 80% of supported projects. The TIFIA program has provided loans totaling $32 billion through FY2018, with most loans going to highway projects. User charges like highway tolls are the most common revenue pledge by borrowers. 86% of TIFIA loans were performing as expected, with two projects going into bankruptcy. The San Diego Association of Governments bought the South Bay Expressway project after bankruptcy, repaying all TIFIA indebtedness. The SH-130 TIFIA loan was converted to ownership of the toll road company, with a payment to the government and remaining debt. The TIFIA program, a federal initiative to promote public-private partnerships in transportation, has provided loans totaling $32 billion. It offers low-cost borrowing, repayment flexibility, and encourages private investment in surface transportation projects. The program relies on market discipline and creditworthiness standards to stimulate projects with favorable benefits. The TIFIA program supports P3s and leverages private capital for transportation projects, with government involvement remaining crucial. About one-third of TIFIA-supported projects are P3s, with total costs of $33 billion funded by government grants, TIFIA loans, other debt, private equity, and other capital. Despite being designed for large projects, there are complaints that few projects can utilize the program due to cost thresholds and lack of revenue streams for repayment. The TIFIA program supports P3s and leverages private capital for transportation projects, with government involvement crucial. Modifications to the program aim to make financing more accessible, but the size of supported projects has not decreased. TIFIA assistance can be obtained through various federal-aid highway funds and the BUILD program. The TIFIA program, formerly known as the TIGER program, has unobligated budget authority of $1.65 billion as of the end of FY2018. States have not yet traded formula grant funding for larger loans under the BUILD program. If the TIFIA program exhausts its direct funding in the future, it remains uncertain if states will use grant funding to cover loan subsidy and administrative costs. Congress could consider capitalizing state infrastructure banks with grant funds as an alternative option. Congress could increase the lending capacity of the TIFIA program by authorizing additional funding. However, there may not be enough suitable projects to make use of significantly greater budget authority. Lowering fees for credit assistance applications could result in more projects, but would increase administrative costs and reduce lending capacity. Increasing the threshold for fee reduction is another option to consider. The TIFIA program's lending capacity could be increased by raising the threshold for credit agency ratings on senior debt and federal credit instruments. The program's subsidy cost calculation has been conservative, but a less conservative approach could allow for more lending with the same budget authority. Despite adjustments in subsidy cost estimates, there have been few defaults, possibly due to project types and economic conditions. An enlarged TIFIA program may be feasible. An enlarged TIFIA program could mean assisting riskier projects with a higher subsidy rate. The program's 20-year experience may be less informative due to the uncertainty of project performance over the long term. For example, the I-495 HOT lanes project in Northern Virginia received credit assistance in 2007, with interest payments starting in 2017 and principal repayments scheduled to begin in 2032. Ultimately, decisions about risk levels in the TIFIA program are made by stakeholders. The TIFIA program's risk decisions are made by DOT's Credit Council and the Secretary of Transportation within statutory limits. A critic suggests developing an underlying risk framework and creating a federal advisory committee. MAP-21 expanded the program and increased the federal share to 49%, but DOT typically provides up to 33%. No project has received more than 33% to date. TIFIA maximizes leveraging nonfederal resources. The TIFIA program maximizes leveraging nonfederal resources, but may limit projects that could benefit from more assistance. The American Public Transportation Association advocates for an increased federal share to support projects with large public benefits. The Trump Administration allows TIFIA loans to count as part of the nonfederal share for certain transportation projects. The Trump Administration considers U.S. Department of Transportation loans as part of all Federal funding sources for CIG evaluation. Projects with TIFIA loans may receive lower ratings, leading sponsors to seek alternatives. H.R. 731 (116th Congress) proposes TIFIA loans to be part of the nonfederal share for transportation projects. Some project sponsors find the process for obtaining TIFIA assistance discouraging, leading them to not seek TIFIA loans. Suggestions to speed up approvals include more frequent DOT credit council meetings and changes to the Letter of Interest process. The FAST Act required expedited approval for lower-risk projects requesting $100 million or less in credit assistance with a dedicated revenue stream, but only two projects have received loans of less than $100 million since its passage. Additional criteria for expedited loans for public agencies were proposed in S. 3631 (115th Congress). The Trump Administration proposed expanding TIFIA assistance eligibility to include ports and airports. S. 3647 (115th Congress) aimed to use $10 million in TIFIA funds for airport-related projects. TIFIA eligibility has been limited to surface transportation projects due to funding from the Highway Trust Fund, which has relied on general Treasury funds for a decade. Congress may need to reconsider this limitation. The HTF has relied on general Treasury funds for a decade, Congress may need to revisit this limitation. TIFIA may need expertise for new project sectors. Proposals in the 115th Congress include creating a national infrastructure bank for various projects. A national infrastructure bank, like TIFIA, would operate independently in project selection and have expertise at its disposal. However, funding projects with the highest economic returns may conflict with Congress's desire to fund various types of projects. This could lead to major transportation projects not being funded if the bank prioritizes water or energy projects with higher returns. The duplication of existing programs like TIFIA is a limitation of a national infrastructure bank, with legislative proposals not addressing how they would run in parallel. The addition of a national infrastructure bank may not increase surface transportation projects with major credit assistance without significant changes in funding and financing methods."
