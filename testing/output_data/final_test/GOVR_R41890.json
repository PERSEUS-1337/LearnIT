    "content": "In a nightmare scenario, a terrorist \"dirty bomb\" spreads radioactive material causing panic, costing billions to remediate, and forcing relocation. However, in other scenarios, security measures prevent terrorist plots from succeeding. The dispersal of radioactive material by terrorists can vary in scale and method, affecting cleanup costs and potential damage. Radiological dispersal devices (RDDs) can be explosive-driven or dispersed nonexplosively, with potential indoor or outdoor contamination scenarios. Legislation considers RDDs as weapons of mass destruction, alongside chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. The report provides background on RDDs and their potential effects, aiming to aid Congress in funding programs to counter them. It discusses the threat of an RDD attack, the relevant science, prevention, response, and recovery from an attack. This report focuses on RDDs, addressing prevention, response, and recovery from an attack. It compares RDDs to nuclear weapons, highlighting Congress's interest in RDD threats due to security vulnerabilities in radioactive materials worldwide. Terrorists could potentially create a dirty bomb using stolen radioactive material, leading to contamination of a significant area, economic disruption, and long-term health effects. Preventing and responding to such an attack are crucial for homeland security. The potential for terrorists to use radioactive material in a dirty bomb attack has raised concerns about long-term health effects and economic disruption. Despite the ease of launching such an attack, terrorists have not done so due to various challenges. The government has implemented measures to reduce the likelihood of an attack, including increasing security of radioactive material and enhancing counterterrorism efforts. The government and international organizations have taken measures to prevent terrorist attacks using radioactive material. Congress faces issues such as prioritizing counterterrorism efforts, securing radioactive sources, and preparing for decontamination after an attack. The government and international organizations have implemented measures to prevent terrorist attacks using radioactive material. Congress is addressing issues such as prioritizing counterterrorism efforts, securing radioactive sources, and preparing for decontamination post-attack. Discussions include R&D, stockpiling equipment, rapid information distribution, cost analysis for decontamination vs. reconstruction, disposal of contaminated waste, modifying access standards, security enhancements, and enhancing radiological forensics capabilities. The term \"weapon of mass destruction\" (WMD) is commonly used to refer to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons, but it may oversimplify their differences. The term \"weapon of mass destruction\" (WMD) is commonly used to refer to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons, but it may oversimplify their differences. Different approaches are required to address the threats posed by each type of WMD, and the term itself is unclear in defining \"mass\" and \"destruction.\" Many analyses prefer to use \"CBRN\" instead, which explicitly states the types of weapons meant without defining these terms. Atoms can be stable or unstable, with unstable atoms decaying into different elements through emission of particles and gamma rays. Radioactive atoms are called radionuclides, and each decays in a specific way. Radioactivity is measured in curies, with 1 Ci equal to 3.7 x 10^10 disintegrations per second. The half-life of radioactive material is the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay. Ionizing radiation can damage living cells by knocking electrons off atoms, increasing the risk of cancer or radiation sickness. Effects of radiation can be deterministic (visible in individuals) or stochastic (detectable in populations). In the United States, radiation dose is measured in rem units. The United States measures radiation dose in rem units, with the average dose for the population estimated at 620 millirem per year. An RDD attack is likely to expose few people to a dose of more than a few rem per year, with differing views on the harm from that dose. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission uses a conservative approach in setting dose standards. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have dose standards for the public and occupational workers, with varying limits. Japan raised its occupational dose limit to 25 rem per year after the Fukushima Daiichi incident. Doses greater than 25 rem can have deterministic effects, with severity increasing with dose. There is no clear line between acceptable and unacceptable doses. The Environmental Protection Agency and FEMA issued guidance on protective actions following nuclear and radiological incidents, including RDD and improvised nuclear device incidents. Protective action guides (PAGs) recommend specific actions to reduce or avoid projected doses from radioactive material releases. PAGs provide guidance on emergency actions such as sheltering in place or evacuation. FEMA divides incident response into three phases: early, intermediate, and late. The early phase requires immediate protective actions without field data. The intermediate phase begins after control of the incident source, recommending relocation for a projected dose of 2 rem. FEMA recommends relocation for a projected dose of 2 rem in the early phase. The late phase involves recovery and cleanup, with no specific PAGs provided. The IAEA revised its Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources in 2003. The IAEA revised its Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources in 2003, listing 16 radionuclides that could pose a threat. The code categorizes sources based on potential harm, with Category 1 sources capable of causing permanent injury or death if not securely managed. The NRC identified four widely used radionuclides in civilian applications: Cobalt-60, cesium-137, iridium-192, and americium-241. Cesium-137 chloride poses a significant risk due to its dispersibility, solubility, and presence in facilities across the United States. The lack of permanent disposal options for high-activity cesium sources increases the concern for potential security threats. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates security measures for Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates security measures for Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources based on their potential to cause deterministic effects. The NRC considers Category 2 sources to be risk-significant, with theft or diversion posing a threat for use in radiological dispersal devices. Category 2 quantities are very small, with cesium-137 having a concern threshold of 0.31 grams. The potential use of uranium or plutonium in a radiological dispersal device (RDD) is discussed. Uranium is not considered a viable option due to low radiation emission, while plutonium poses a biological hazard from alpha particles if inhaled. Terrorist groups seeking materials for an RDD would likely opt for radionuclides with common industrial uses, while those aiming to build a nuclear bomb would seek highly enriched uranium. A terrorist group seeking to build a nuclear bomb would likely acquire highly enriched uranium instead of plutonium. Spent nuclear fuel, containing uranium and plutonium, could be used in a radiological dispersal device (RDD) like a dirty bomb. Other methods of dispersing radioactive material include placing it in traffic or dropping it from an airplane. Terrorists could also use a radiological exposure device (RED) to expose people to radiation. The report briefly mentions Radiological Exposure Devices (REDs), which expose people to radiation without dispersing radioactive material. Unlike RDDs, REDs contaminate little to no area and are of less concern. It is important to differentiate between nuclear weapons and RDDs, as they involve different materials and processes with varying results. An effective RDD attack would contaminate a large area, forcing relocation and requiring costly cleanup, but would cause no destruction. A nuclear weapon uses uranium and plutonium to release a vast amount of energy through fission and fusion. The resulting explosion can destroy a large part of a city, kill tens of thousands of people, and generate radioactive fallout with long-term and wide-reaching effects. The impact of an RDD, on the other hand, would contaminate a large area without causing destruction or immediate casualties. A ground-burst nuclear weapon contaminates a larger area than a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD). While a terrorist-made improvised nuclear device (IND) would be more destructive, an RDD attack is seen as more likely due to easier access to radioactive materials. Terrorists would need special nuclear material for an IND, which is heavily guarded, while RDD materials are more accessible. An RDD attack is more likely than an IND due to easier access to radioactive materials. Effects of an RDD attack include prompt casualties, panic, and economic disruption. Panic potential was highlighted in a 2007 study showing high evacuation rates even without government recommendations. An RDD attack involving radioactive material in a port or city center could lead to economic damage, asset denial, and long-term casualties. Decontamination efforts would be costly, and there is a potential for terrorists to use such an attack as a recruiting tool. A study on RDD attacks on ports suggests a 10-40% chance of success with limited health effects in a small area. The economic consequences of a radioactive attack on ports could result in significant losses in the tens of billions of dollars, including decontamination costs and indirect economic impacts. Studies show potential losses of $8.5 billion for exports and $26.0 billion for imports in the event of a port shutdown. An NNSA-sponsored study found that even without weaponization, the economic cost to the nation could be in the billions of dollars due to evacuation, relocation, clean-up, and lost wages. Terrorists could acquire radioactive material for a RDD attack, with costs in the billions of dollars including evacuation, relocation, clean-up, and lost wages. Despite fears, the probability of an RDD attack is unknown, and there has been no successful attack as of May 2011. The vulnerability of facilities housing sealed sources to terrorist attacks is discussed, with the potential for theft of one device resulting in multiple RDDs. Leaders at the Nuclear Security Summit expressed concerns about the threat of 'dirty bombs' and emphasized the need for strong national and international actions to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. The threat of terrorist acts involving 'dirty bombs' is a global concern, with leaders emphasizing the need for strong actions to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. German Chancellor Angela Merkel highlighted the danger of dirty bombs in terrorist hands, stating that such weapons must not fall into the hands of groups like al Qaeda. The 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul will focus more on the security of radiological sources compared to previous summits. At the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, Cho Hyun suggested including the security of radioactive materials in the agenda. US officials expressed concern about RDDs but do not see an immediate threat. Counterterrorism actions have hindered al-Qa'ida's efforts to develop a sophisticated CBRN attack capability. Al Qaeda remains committed to conducting attacks inside the United States. Al Qaeda remains committed to conducting attacks inside the United States and seeks to access chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear material, posing a serious threat. There have been instances of theft and attempts to use radioactive material for malevolent purposes, with some successful cases in the past. In 1998, 19 tubes of cesium were reported missing from a hospital in North Carolina, deemed as theft with the cesium still unrecovered. In 1998, Chechen rebels were suspected of involvement in a plot involving radioactive materials and an explosive mine. In 1999, thieves in Chechnya attempted to steal radioactive material, resulting in one thief's death and the other hospitalized. In 2003, evidence in Afghanistan suggested Al Qaeda had built a dirty bomb, though the device was not found. Thai police were involved in another incident in 2003. The threat of dirty bombs has been highlighted through various incidents involving the attempted sale of radioactive materials, arrests of individuals plotting to create dirty bombs, and the discovery of documents on producing RDDs. However, actual successful RDD attacks have not occurred, with fears and feasibility not equating to a significant threat. The threat of dirty bombs is plausible, but the sample size is not large enough to predict the likelihood of an attack. Terrorists would face challenges in launching an effective RDD attack due to the need for knowledge about radiation and the differing ways it causes damage. This could help deter attacks by reducing the probability of success. Higher-energy radiation causes more biological damage, terrorists need to know about radiation safety for self-protection. Obtaining the wrong radioactive material could render a dirty bomb useless. Materials with very short or very long half-lives are undesirable for an RDD. Chemical characteristics also play a role in the effectiveness of a dirty bomb. Radiation causes more biological damage and some compounds bond more strongly to surfaces, making cleanup difficult. Terrorists would need to conceal their actions and obtain radioactive materials. NRC regulations enhance security for high-risk sources in the United States, but locating lost sources is challenging. Obtaining radioactive sources through bogus licensing has been tightened by NRC. Other nations have different security measures for radioactive materials. Terrorists may try to obtain radioactive material from abroad due to lower standards in other countries, risking detection during smuggling. Extracting material from its container could expose them to lethal doses of radiation. Creating a bomb with a sealed source next to explosives would be less effective, requiring careful dispersion for desired impact. Contamination from a dirty bomb could vary based on dispersion area, with wider dispersal leading to lower contamination levels. Terrorists acquiring radioactive material from abroad face risks of detection during smuggling. Dispersion of material for a bomb would require careful planning to avoid detection at U.S. ports and within the country. Emergency response measures could reduce casualties and panic. Forensic analysis could reveal the perpetrator and country of origin, deterring further attacks. An RDD attack could lead to worldwide implementation of more stringent measures to counter terrorist threats, with press articles highlighting the potential contamination and costly cleanup. Figures from a study illustrate the varying scenarios based on assumptions such as the amount of radioactive material and location of detonation. An RDD attack could result in contamination at different dose levels, with associated costs varying based on the level of exposure. The United States and other nations employ a \"layered defense\" strategy to prevent such attacks, with measures in place at international, federal, state, and local levels. These measures have been strengthened since 9/11 to increase the likelihood of disrupting a terrorist attack. Since 9/11, security measures for radioactive sources have been enhanced, including licensing, tracking, and physical security upgrades. Efforts are focused on protecting, removing, and reducing the number of sources to mitigate the threat they may pose for illegitimate uses like RDD attacks or scrap metal theft. Various programs target these categories to enhance overall security. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is responsible for licensing and regulating the civilian use of radioactive materials to protect public health and safety. Security measures have been enhanced since 9/11 to reduce the risk of RDD attacks by securing and tracking radioactive sources. The 1954 act, as amended, is the fundamental U.S. law on civilian and military uses of nuclear materials. It gave the AEC authority to regulate radioactive material for defense, security, health, and safety purposes. Special nuclear material is defined as uranium enriched in isotopes 233 or 235, plutonium, and other specified materials. Byproduct material is any radioactive material yielded in the process of producing special nuclear material. NRC can enter agreements with states to license radioactive materials. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 abolished the AEC and created the NRC, transferring licensing functions to NRC. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 defined radiation sources and required NRC to regulate exports and imports, as well as establish a tracking system. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated NRC to regulate exports and imports of radiation sources, establish a tracking system, and enhance security measures post-9/11 attacks. NRC issued orders and regulations for improved security, including fingerprinting requirements and increased controls for certain radioactive materials. The NRC issued orders and regulations to enhance security measures for radioactive materials, including requirements for trustworthy individuals to have access, monitoring unauthorized access, transportation regulations, and physical controls for mobile devices. A proposed rule in 2010 aimed to incorporate and modify previous orders as 10 CFR 37, focusing on security requirements for category 1 and category 2 quantities of radioactive material. The NRC focuses on nuclear reactors licensing, safety, and security of radioactive sources. It tracks Category 1 and 2 sources through the National Source Tracking System. Changes were made to licensing procedures for better security in response to GAO criticisms. The NNSA, a part of the Department of Energy, addresses GAO criticisms by maintaining a Nuclear Material Events Database and running the Agreement States program. Within NNSA, the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program includes the Global Threat Reduction Initiative to enhance security of radioactive sources. The budget for FY2012 includes $2,549.5 million for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and $508.3 million for GTRI, which also operates domestic programs to secure radioactive sources. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) provides security upgrades for domestic radioactive sources on a voluntary basis. NNSA funds the upgrades and initial maintenance, with facilities agreeing to provide subsequent maintenance. GTRI assesses sites for security improvements, installs equipment like iris scanners and radiation detectors, and retrofits In-Device Delay units into irradiators using cesium chloride to deter theft. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) works on recovering radioactive sources, including orphan sources, in the United States. The Off-site Source Recovery Project (OSRP) has recovered 24,029 sources totaling 801,560 curies. NNSA aims to remove at least 2,200 excess sources annually. GTRI also provides Alarm Response Training for local law enforcement officers at the Y-12 National Security Complex. Kenneth Sheely, from GTRI, emphasizes the importance of training local law enforcement on handling radioactive materials found in various facilities. This training includes classroom instruction on detecting and neutralizing threats, as well as practical exercises. GTRI, NNSA, and the FBI also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate site-specific scenarios for organizations. GTRI, NNSA, and the FBI provide tabletop exercises for organizations with NRC licenses for radioactive material. GTRI has identified 2,700 buildings with high-priority radiological materials in the US, completing security upgrades at 251 buildings with plans to finish by 2025. They have trained 1,118 law enforcement officers and installed delay devices on 238 irradiators. The NRC and NNSA have complementary programs to enhance security for radioactive materials. They have created a strong regulatory framework for licensing, inspection, and enforcement to ensure public health and safety. GTRI works with NRC to provide voluntary security enhancements. Their goal is to prevent RDD incidents. The NRC and GTRI have the same goal of preventing RDD attacks but have different roles. NRC is the regulator, enforcing rules for all licensees, while GTRI works to enhance security at partner sites through voluntary programs. GTRI can suggest security enhancements that the licensee can accept, reject, or modify based on local conditions. The NRC and GTRI have different roles in enhancing security at partner sites. GTRI can suggest security enhancements, but tensions arise between GTRI and NRC due to their distinct roles. GTRI values its independence from NRC involvement to maintain a good relationship with licensees. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a task force to evaluate the security of radiation sources in the US from terrorist threats. The task force, chaired by the NRC chairman, identified two major challenges in their most recent report released in August 2010. The task force recommended comprehensive policy changes to address challenges in disposal pathways for unused radioactive sources. It also suggested exploring alternative technologies for existing sources, focusing on cesium-137 chloride due to safety and security concerns. Increased support for developing alternative options was advised. The report recommended increased support for developing alternative technologies to replace Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources, specifically cesium-137 chloride. Other agencies like the EPA and the Department of Defense are also working on reducing the use of sealed radiation sources for security reasons. The Department of Defense (DOD) holds sealed sources in the United States, including at hospitals, protected under NRC regulations. While an RDD attack is possible, its probability is unknown. Common security procedure violations include inadequate physical protection and access restrictions. In FY2010, no Category 1 or 2 sources were lost, but three Category 3 sources were lost and recovered, and one fell into the Gulf of Mexico from an oil platform. The FY2010 Radiation Source Protection and Security Task Force report highlighted the issue of disused radioactive sources in the United States, emphasizing the importance of secure storage. While security measures have been enhanced since 9/11, there are still tasks, such as those of GTRI, that remain incomplete. Despite this, there have been no successful thefts or sabotage of Category 1 or 2 sources, and there has never been a successful RDD attack. The NRC's Nuclear Material Events Database shows that from FY2006 to FY2010, no Category 1 sources were lost, and 17 Category 2 sources were lost but all recovered. The majority of lost/stolen sources were Ir-192 in radiography cameras due to licensee failures. The short half-life of Ir-192 resulted in negligible current risk. The NRC's Nuclear Material Events Database shows no Category 1 sources were lost from FY2006 to FY2010, and 17 Category 2 sources were lost but all recovered. Most lost/stolen sources were Ir-192 in radiography cameras due to licensee failures, with negligible current risk. The record is unclear if due to security measures, terrorist ineptness, or other factors. Radioactive sources in Categories 1 and 2 require NRC licenses issued to companies, universities, or organizations. Radiation safety officers (RSOs) are responsible for source safety and security, providing \"ground truth.\" CRS conducted interviews with RSOs from various facilities, offering insights for Congress. Prior to 9/11, Radiation Safety Officers (RSOs) were primarily trained in safety, not security, often partnering with HR personnel, law enforcement, lawyers, and security consultants to learn about security. A safety culture involves protecting people through procedures like shielding and access controls. Before 9/11, Radiation Safety Officers focused on safety measures like shielding and access controls to protect people. However, post-9/11, there has been a shift towards a security culture to prevent terrorists from stealing radioactive sources to make RDDs. Security measures have improved, with sources now being more securely protected with defined security programs. The security of radioactive sources has been enhanced through orders from the NRC, such as the Increased Controls order of 2005. This order required licensees to limit access to Category 1 and 2 sources, monitor for unauthorized access, and have a response plan with law enforcement. An order in 2003 for panoramic irradiators mandated specific security measures for sources over 10,000 curies. The NRC's orders in 2005 and 2006 mandated enhanced security measures for radioactive sources. Licensees were required to limit access, monitor for unauthorized entry, and collaborate with law enforcement. The 2006 order also mandated FBI background checks for individuals needing unescorted access to Category 1 and 2 sources. This led to the installation of security equipment like cameras, radiation detectors, key cards, and stronger doors at facilities. Additionally, RSOs worked with police to ensure an armed response to potential thefts of radioactive materials. Some RSOs believed police could provide a timely armed response to thefts of radioactive sources, but response time varied depending on police priorities. RSOs provided training on terrorist theft scenarios, and some police officers took courses on the topic. Views on T&R investigations were mixed, with some finding the process cumbersome and time-consuming. The process of vetting applicants for Trustworthiness and Reliability (T&R) varied among facilities, with some finding it manageable while others faced challenges due to unclear NRC guidance. RSOs organized vetting processes, hired contractors for data collection, and convened committees to review cases. Costs for T&R investigations were minimal, but concerns were raised about extending security measures to Class 3 sources. Each institution developed its own criteria for T&R. Each institution developed its own criteria for Trustworthiness and Reliability (T&R), often in cooperation with HR and university police departments. Criteria varied and could include academic record, background checks, references, and employment history. Some focused on behavior patterns rather than specific criteria, leading to differences in T&R decisions between organizations. Foreign students and postdoctoral researchers were also part of the vetting process. Some universities struggle to gather necessary data for Trustworthiness and Reliability (T&R) evaluations of foreign graduate students and postdocs seeking unescorted access to research equipment. Challenges include verifying academic records, employment history, financial information, and credibility of personal references, especially when provided in foreign languages. There is a debate on whether NRC orders should prescribe specific security measures or be performance-based. Some RSOs expressed frustration at the lack of clarity over meeting the IC order, debating whether specific security measures should be prescribed or if a performance-based approach would be more effective. They argued that a one-size-fits-all approach could lead to unnecessary expenses and make it easier for terrorists to exploit security weaknesses. Performance-based requirements were seen as the only reasonable way to implement the program effectively. The NRC could mandate facilities to be secure against a \"design basis threat\" (DBT) specifying the type of threat they must repel, such as an attack by terrorists. Some RSOs found DBTs unnecessary and burdensome, leading to over-the-top responses and bizarre scenarios. Several RSOs expressed concerns about insider threats at facilities, highlighting the potential risks of insiders causing harm, sabotaging the facility, or aiding outsiders. They noted that traditional T&R screening may not fully address this threat. RSOs who had experience with GTRI praised the program for its thorough security assessments and alignment with US NRC requirements. GTRI staff conducted security assessments at facilities, recommended security plans, and installed various security devices such as iris scanners, cameras, and backup power systems. RSOs found the staff knowledgeable and professional, with one stating that without the program, their facility would not be upgrading. Overall, having an outside group evaluate their security situation was seen as beneficial. One RSO mentioned the importance of the security program in upgrading their facility's security measures, emphasizing the role of a robust security system in promoting a security culture. However, another RSO felt that some security measures were excessive, while others believed the added measures exceeded the actual threat. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, under the Department of Homeland Security, deploys systems to detect radioactive material at ports and border crossings. The Department of Homeland Security, including components like the Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration, deploy radiation detection equipment in the United States to detect terrorist nuclear weapons or nuclear-weapon material. The equipment includes passive radiation detection systems and radiography systems, which use x-rays or gamma rays to inspect cargo. These systems are also useful for interdicting potential RDD material. Nuclear weapon materials emit fewer gamma rays, making them easily detectable by current radiation detectors. However, shielding with lead could prevent detection, prompting efforts to improve detection technologies. Detection systems offer a high probability of detecting RDD-usable material, but terrorists may try to evade detection. Small alpha and beta sources could go undetected with little shielding. It is challenging to detect radioactive material smuggled across unguarded stretches of the U.S. border, relying on border security for interdiction. Terrorists could bypass radiation detectors at ports of entry by obtaining material within the U.S. The U.S. deploys radiation detectors along highways and choke points, but terrorists could transport RDD material along routes without detectors if they knew their locations. The U.S. takes technical and other measures in response to these threats. The United States implements technical measures to respond to the challenges of detecting and preventing terrorist attacks using CBRN weapons. Various government agencies are involved in collecting and analyzing intelligence on potential threats, although detailed descriptions and discussions of shortcomings are beyond the scope of this report. The 9/11 Commission identified intelligence failures before the attacks and recommended unity of effort in the Intelligence Community. Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, establishing the Director of National Intelligence. This act made it unlawful to acquire or possess Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs) and created the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) to analyze and integrate intelligence on terrorism, conduct strategic planning for counterterrorism activities, and serve as a central knowledge bank on known and suspected terrorists. The NCTC works to coordinate various national power instruments for counterterrorism efforts but does not direct the execution of operations. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) serves as the central knowledge bank on known and suspected terrorists and international terror groups. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the lead agency for counterterrorism intelligence in the United States, with primary investigative responsibility for federal crimes of terrorism. The FBI Director exercises lead agency responsibility in investigating crimes involving terrorist activities within the U.S. jurisdiction. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 outlines the coordination of intelligence and criminal information activities within the United States, primarily through the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI established a Directorate of Intelligence to enhance intelligence analysis and created a National Security Branch at its headquarters. The FBI established a National Security Branch at its headquarters, consisting of its Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence Divisions, and the Directorate of Intelligence. International organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, have taken steps to secure radioactive sources worldwide. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has implemented various measures to enhance nuclear security, including a Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources approved in 2001 and revised in 2003 after the 9/11 attacks. By January 2011, 101 nations had committed to this code. The IAEA also approved a Plan of Activities to Protect Against Nuclear Terrorism in 2002 and a Nuclear Security Plan for 2006-2009 focusing on material protection, detection of malicious acts, and information coordination. The 2010-2013 Nuclear Security Plan covers areas such as needs assessment, global framework enhancement, security services, and risk reduction. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has implemented measures to enhance nuclear security, including a Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. The agency provides technical assistance to countries in locating and removing orphan radioactive sources, as part of its global effort to improve security. The IAEA provides technical assistance to countries in improving the security of radioactive sources and nuclear material through training courses and maintaining databases to track incidents. The G8 Global Partnership aims to prevent terrorists from acquiring CBRN weapons. The G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction aims to raise funds for projects reducing CBRN threats. Programs include recovering radioactive generators and placing radiation detection equipment at border crossings. The 2010 G8 summit did not commit to additional funding for the Global Partnership. The 2010 G8 summit in Canada did not commit to providing added funds for the Global Partnership beyond 2012, leaving its future uncertain. The final declaration acknowledged global threats and emphasized the importance of continuing joint efforts to address them. Questions were raised about whether all G8 members fulfilled their pledged contributions. The Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, established in 2006 by 13 governments, focuses on improving nuclear security measures. The Global Partnership aims to enhance accounting, control, and protection systems for nuclear and radioactive materials. It also focuses on improving detection capabilities to prevent illicit trafficking. The National Nuclear Security Administration's Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation addresses radiological materials overseas through programs like GTRI, which aims to secure and dispose of high-risk nuclear materials globally. The NNSA's GTRI program focuses on international radiological material removal and protection. The Second Line of Defense program strengthens foreign governments' capabilities to detect illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. The Megaports initiative deploys radiation detection equipment at seaports globally. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has international programs to assist other nations in implementing safety and security measures for radioactive materials. The Department of State also has programs to support global efforts in controlling radioactive sources. In total, there are 418 non-Megaport sites with completed installations in countries such as Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and others. The Department of State has programs to reduce radiological threats and strengthen border security. The Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program assists 46 countries in detecting and interdicting illicit transfers of strategic items and radioactive materials. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism program counters terrorist CBRN attacks, and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism is supported. The Department of Defense, through USSTRATCOM, leads efforts to combat radioactive threats. The U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) work together to combat weapons of mass destruction (WMD). They synchronize efforts across military commands and address chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive threats. Nations control their own radioactive material and contribute to securing it through various means. Canada, Pakistan, Poland, and the Republic of Korea have made efforts to secure radioactive material through various means such as legislation, waste repositories, and funding. Canada, for example, funded the removal of 59 radioisotopic thermoelectric generators (RTGs) in the Russian Arctic and Far East from 2007 to 2011. In 2011, Canada funded the removal and replacement of RTGs with solar panels, as well as the development of a master plan for international donors to support the decommissioning of RTGs. Pakistan has strengthened institutions for nuclear safety and security, with the PNRA ensuring safe operation of nuclear facilities and protecting the environment from radiation. PNRA is implementing a National Nuclear Security Action Plan (NSAP) in coordination with the IAEA to manage high-risk radioactive sources, secure orphan sources, and upgrade physical security at medical centers. Pakistan has licensed blood irradiators meeting IAEA standards and offers nuclear security training courses. The country has improved nuclear security inspectorates and established a Nuclear Security Emergency Coordination Center (NuSECC). Poland has a Nuclear Security Emergency Coordination Center (NuSECC) to coordinate efforts in case of a nuclear incident. The Central Laboratory for Radiological Protection monitors food and the environment for radioactive contamination and provides emergency assistance. The Radioactive Waste Management Plant collects and disposes of low- and medium-activity radioactive waste. Poland has taken steps to secure radioactive material, including holding exercises in 2004 and 2010 to respond to illicit trafficking. In preparation for the 2012 European soccer championship, a Governmental Body against Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Threat was appointed. The RWMP has been involved in the GTRI program since 2004, upgrading security systems in over 70 institutions. In contrast, the Republic of Korea has focused on managing radioactive waste and licensing materials for security. The Republic of Korea has established the Korean Radioactive Waste Management Corporation to manage radioactive waste and operate disposal facilities. The Minister of Education, Science and Technology is responsible for nuclear safety and regulation, requiring licenses for the use, distribution, or manufacture of sources with higher dose rates or radioactivity. The number of licenses for institutions using radioisotopes and radiation generators has increased over the years, with about 3800 institutions by the end of 2008. The Korean Institute for Nuclear Safety has developed a system to trace radiation sources and manage their inventory efficiently. They also operate a real-time tracking system called START to locate industrial radiography sources in case of theft or misplacement. The Korean government has been monitoring industrial radiograph sources since 2006, with mobile terminals transferring data to a central control system. In 2008, around 1,000 mobile sources were monitored. The Partnership for Global Security (PGS) focuses on reducing CBRN threats globally, including securing high-intensity radiological sources in public buildings. The World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS) focuses on securing radiological sources, especially in major metropolitan hospitals. WINS collaborates with countries to establish regional radiological security zones. WINS provides best security practices, workshops, and information to its members. The IAEA's Illicit Trafficking Database (ITDB) is a crucial source of information on nuclear and radioactive source vulnerability. As of June 2010, 110 nations reported data to the IAEA. From July 2009 to June 2010, 222 incidents were reported to the ITDB, including unauthorized possession, theft, and loss of nuclear material. 140 incidents involved unauthorized activities unrelated to criminal activity. The U.S. Department of State reported that from July 2009 to June 2010, there were 222 incidents involving radiological and nuclear materials outside legitimate control, with most incidents occurring overseas. Roughly 10 percent of these incidents occurred in the U.S., all involving detections of radioactively contaminated materials entering the country. The IAEA highlighted a persistent issue of illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials, including thefts, losses, and unauthorized activities. The IAEA reported 1,562 confirmed incidents from 1995-2008, with 421 involving theft or loss, 336 involving unauthorized possession, and 724 involving other unauthorized activities. The report highlighted vulnerabilities in security and control systems, noting that recovered material was only 35 percent of the time. The incidents mainly involved radioactive sources and contaminated materials, indicating failures in control and security systems. Inadequate control and security systems have led to incidents involving radioactive materials. Poor protection of sources in other countries raises concerns about terrorist acquisition. In India, a cobalt-60 irradiator purchased from Canada in 1968 caused worker exposure to gamma radiation when dismantled in 2010. In Thailand in 2000, a cobalt-60 source caused a radiation accident, resulting in three deaths, seven injuries, and exposure to 1,870 people. In Spain in 1998, a cesium-137 source melted in a steel factory, contaminating 500 tons of material and causing slight contamination to six people. In Italy, slight contamination occurred with major economic, political, and social consequences costing over $25 million. In Egypt, an iridium-192 source caused deaths and hospitalizations after being taken home by a farmer. In Georgia, radioactive materials were smuggled from former Soviet military bases, leading to criminal cases against smugglers. In Georgia, radioactive materials were smuggled from former Soviet military bases and sold as scrap metal. In 2008, former high-ranking police officers were caught trying to sell stolen cesium from a nuclear reactor. This incident highlighted the need for a registry of radioactive sources to regulate their safety. The security and safety of radioactive sources, categorized as IAEA Code of Conduct Category 1 and 2 sources, are crucial for regulation. Without proper measures in place, there is a risk of theft and inadequate security. Implementing security measures, such as regulation, security equipment deployment, and source tracking, is essential but can only happen if authorities recognize the need to secure sources. Authorities must recognize the need for radiation safety and implement measures to address the threat posed by Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs). Without acknowledging the safety concerns associated with radioactive sources, there will be no incentive to treat them as a security issue. In the United States, security measures were added on top of existing safety measures, highlighting the importance of understanding radiation hazards and implementing adequate security measures to prevent terrorist acquisition of radioactive material. The federal government has devoted extensive resources to planning for a response to terrorist acquisition of material for an RDD. Key authorities for response include the Stafford Act and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 establishes the Department of Homeland Security with missions including preventing terrorist attacks, reducing vulnerability to terrorism, and aiding recovery. The act also establishes a Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and Response, with the DHS Secretary responsible for coordinating federal operations in domestic incident management. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 establishes the Department of Homeland Security with missions including incident management, coordinating federal operations in response to terrorist attacks, disasters, and emergencies. The act directs the Secretary to develop a National Incident Management System (NIMS) and a National Response Plan to integrate prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery plans. The National Response Framework (NRF) supersedes the National Response Plan and provides guiding principles for all response efforts. The National Response Framework supersedes the National Response Plan and establishes guiding principles for a unified national response to disasters and emergencies. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act directs FEMA to lead efforts in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from natural disasters, terrorism, and other man-made disasters. The National Response Framework supersedes the National Response Plan and establishes guiding principles for a unified national response to disasters and emergencies, including health and safety in natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or other man-made disasters. The NRF has annexes for emergency support functions, support, and incident types, with the Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex relevant to RDDs. The National Response Framework outlines the agencies responsible for responding to incidents involving radioactive materials. DHS would lead deliberate attacks involving nuclear/radiological facilities, with support from other federal assets like the Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center. DOE and EPA play key roles in coordinating environmental monitoring and cleanup efforts. The DOE utilizes various systems and teams for radiation monitoring and response. This includes the Aerial Measuring System for ground radiation characterization, the National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center for real-time predictions of radioactive material transport, the Radiological Assistance Program Teams for first-responder assistance, and the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center for atmospheric predictions of hazardous material concentration. The Advisory Team for Environment, Food, and Health provides advice on environmental, food, health, and animal health matters. FEMA issued guidance for response to radiological incidents. DHS-sponsored exercises like TOPOFF 4 simulate attacks to aid in planning and coordination between agencies. FEMA offers courses for first responders and emergency managers. FEMA offers courses for first responders and emergency managers, including those addressing nuclear and radiological incidents. GTRI partners with NNSA and FBI to conduct table-top exercises at nuclear and radiological sites for crisis management training. The U.S. also has an international response component through the Foreign Emergency Support Team for terrorist incidents. The FEST is a rapid response team for terrorist incidents worldwide, led by the Operations Directorate of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism. It deploys within four hours of notification and has assisted in over 20 countries since 1986. Some states and localities have their own response plans, like New York City's Counterterrorism Bureau and Washington, DC's adoption of NIMS in 2005. Missouri and Kansas City have also conducted exercises for coordinated responses to terrorist attacks. In Kansas City, various departments participated in an exercise to test emergency response capabilities. West Virginia Homeland Security Department conducted a drill involving a dirty bomb scenario. EPA, Pennsylvania DEP, and City of Philadelphia organized \"Liberty RadEx\" to assess recovery from a dirty bomb attack. This exercise focused on recovery efforts and involved federal, state, and local personnel. Response plans for RDD attacks are crucial, but their effectiveness is uncertain. State radiation emergency preparedness is lacking, with many states lacking basic plans for communication and health response. Previous disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the Gulf oil spill have shown poor response despite planning and legislation in place. Despite legislation for the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, the U.S. lacks preparedness for a public health response to a nuclear detonation. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism gave the U.S. an \"F\" for enhancing rapid response capabilities to prevent biological attacks. FEMA's guidance divides response to radiological and nuclear incidents into early, intermediate, and late phases. In the event of a radiological incident, response is divided into early, intermediate, and late phases. In the early phase, state and local first responders focus on minimizing deaths, injuries, and panic. The intermediate phase involves higher-level care for radiation injuries and relocation of people from dangerous areas. In the intermediate phase of a radiological incident, the focus is on relocating people from high radiation areas and restoring critical infrastructure. Federal resources may be available, but there is a misconception about the speed and scale of assistance that can be provided. Federal resources include Pre-Positioned Equipment Program (PEP) Pods for rapid deployment of first responder equipment. The Pre-Positioned Equipment Program (PEP) Pods contain various first responder equipment for all-hazards events, including personal protective gear, decontamination equipment, detection instruments, search and rescue gear, logistics equipment, and communication capabilities. The Nuclear Emergency Support Team (NEST) is prepared to handle nuclear or radiological terrorism with specialized response teams for search, identification, diagnostics, technical operations, and transport of nuclear materials. The Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site provides support managed by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education. The Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site, managed by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, offers 24/7 emergency medical consultation for radiation incidents worldwide. The Strategic National Stockpile, operated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides medical supplies for national emergencies in the US and its territories, including agents for radiological or nuclear attacks like prussian blue for cesium-137 contamination. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 established Project BioShield to accelerate the research, development, purchase, and availability of medical countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents. HHS contracted with Akorn, Inc. in 2006 for 475,000 doses of pharmaceuticals to treat internal contamination by radioactive particles. Dose measurement following a radiological attack is crucial for treatment, and Columbia University scientists are developing automated equipment for this purpose. Columbia University scientists are developing automated equipment funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. The equipment can determine doses for 30,000 persons per day. The Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute has a Biodosimetry Assessment Tool for identifying radiation exposure. The Department of Defense has a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear response enterprise under the operational control of the Commander, U.S. Northern Command. The Department of Defense has a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear response enterprise under the operational control of the Commander, U.S. Northern Command. This enterprise maintains assets to respond to various types of attacks in the United States, with the WMD Civil Support Team (CST) being the first to arrive on the scene in the case of an RDD attack. CSTs, operated by the National Guard, deploy within 3 hours of notification and have equipment to identify radioactive materials and advise on response measures. The Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear response enterprise under the Department of Defense includes the WMD Civil Support Team (CST) operated by the National Guard, which deploys within 3 hours of notification for RDD attacks. The next response levels include the CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP) with 17 units in the US, and the Homeland Response Forces (HRFs) with 10 units planned to be established. Additionally, there are federal assets in the form of two CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force (CCMRF) units. The Department of Defense is phasing out the two CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force (CCMRF) units and replacing them with one Defense CBRN Response Force (DCRF) with 5,200 personnel drawn from various military branches. The DCRF will have enhanced capabilities in medical care, search and extraction from contaminated environments, and command and control support. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) operates Technical Support Groups to assist in the search and recovery of RDDs and nuclear weapons. Late-phase efforts focus on recovery and restoring human activity in affected areas by reducing radiation hazards. FEMA does not provide PAGs for cleanup in the late phase. Late-phase cleanup criteria for RDDs and INDs should be determined through a site-specific optimization process considering potential future land uses, technical feasibility, costs, and public acceptability. Cleanup requirements depend on the details of the attack, such as the type of radioactive material used and how it bonds to surfaces. The cleanup plan for RDDs and INDs must consider the type of radioactive material used, how it disperses, and the impact of environmental factors like weather conditions. Factors such as wind, rain, and the location of the material will affect the cleanup strategy and the level of contamination in different areas. Recovery from an RDD attack would require careful consideration of contaminated areas and the difficulty of decontamination. Recovery from an RDD attack would require state and local resources, with federal agencies likely providing detailed planning and specialized resources. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 mandated FEMA to develop a National Disaster Recovery Strategy. President Obama directed the establishment of the White House Long-Term Disaster Recovery Working Group in September 2009. President Obama established the White House Long-Term Disaster Recovery Working Group, co-chaired by the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Housing and Urban Development. The group will deliver two strategic planning documents: the National Disaster Recovery Framework and a report focusing on long-term response to large disasters. The framework will provide an overarching strategy for all aspects of recovery, while the report will address societal consequences, infrastructure restoration, and economic development. The report on long-term response to large disasters is in the final stages of approval, with no set release date. A 2010 GAO report highlighted FEMA's lack of a national disaster recovery strategy, but the Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex of the NRF provides some guidance for response and short-term recovery. The FEMA \"Planning Guidance for Protection and Recovery Following Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) and Improvised Nuclear Device (IND) Incidents\" provides a framework for longer-term recovery after large disasters. Research has shown that washing with water may have little effect on radioactive materials like cesium that bond with concrete and tile. A solution of water with ammonium oxalate or ammonium chloride is more effective, although ammonium oxalate is toxic and corrosive. An R&D project at Idaho National Laboratory is investigating the use of lasers for decontamination by wetting surfaces to reach radioactive material in pores and using heat to bring it to the surface for removal. Argonne National Laboratory is developing a \"supergel\" to capture and dispose of radioactive elements in porous structures using a spray-on gel and nanoparticles in the event of an RDD attack. EPA's National Homeland Security Research Center conducts research on decontamination, cautioning that it is a complex process. The EPA's National Homeland Security Research Center conducts research on decontamination, highlighting the complexity of the process. Studies have shown that there is no universal decontamination approach, as efficacy depends on various factors such as contaminated material type, decontaminant concentration, contact time, and environmental conditions. Time sensitivity is crucial for fluid decontamination to prevent dilution by rain. The need for prompt availability of chemicals and equipment for fluid decontamination is crucial to prevent irreversible fixation of dissolved elements by rain or humidity. Waste fluid must be treated due to its hazardous nature, with possible methods including activated charcoal or reverse osmosis systems. The bonding potential of radionuclides with materials like concrete varies based on the chemical form, with some bonding more readily than others. Knowing the material used in an attack would benefit \"first decontaminators.\" Decontamination after a radiological attack involves various challenges such as scaling up production of decontamination chemicals, handling waste streams, protecting workers, and cost-effectiveness. The level of decontamination needed must balance safety with practicality, considering tradeoffs in cost, time, technology, and effort. The cost of cleanup and rebuilding varies depending on the required level of decontamination. The cost to clean up and rebuild after a radiological attack varies greatly depending on the required level of decontamination, ranging from a few billion dollars for a lower level to about C$70 billion for a higher level. Retaliation against perpetrators would involve identifying the source of material through a process known as attribution, which relies on evidence from intelligence, law enforcement, and scientific analysis. Nuclear forensics analyzes debris from nuclear explosions to determine characteristics like yield, materials used, and design details. Scientists can use radiochemistry techniques to analyze minute samples of material from a terrorist nuclear weapon, which may have unique signatures from impurities. Highly enriched uranium can pick up impurities that provide clues to its origin. Nuclear forensics analyzes debris from nuclear explosions to determine characteristics like yield, materials used, and design details. It matches samples of weapon material to an archive of samples from facilities producing such material, or against a library of information from manufacturers to identify manufacturing origins. Nuclear forensics analyzes debris from nuclear explosions to determine characteristics like yield, materials used, and design details. It identifies manufacturing processes and may use simulation to link evidence to missing material. Forensics can help determine the technical sophistication of terrorist groups and identify the source of material, supporting deterrence and retaliation efforts. The United States has established the Nuclear Materials Information Program (NMIP) to consolidate nuclear material data. The Nuclear Materials Information Program (NMIP) is managed by the Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence in coordination with various government agencies. Its goal is to consolidate worldwide nuclear materials information into an integrated system. NMIP also develops a national registry for tracking nuclear material samples in the U.S. Technical nuclear forensics assessments can link material to manufacturing processes and geographic locations. Technical nuclear forensics assessments can link material to manufacturing processes and geographic locations, narrowing down possible candidates. Computational modeling and simulation can help distinguish characteristics of nuclear materials, while radiological forensics can determine the age of a sample to eliminate some manufacturers as the source of the material. Non-radioactive evidence associated with RDDs is also crucial in technical forensics investigations. The RDD will play a crucial role in technical forensics investigations, both before and after detonation. Excluding candidate sources is essential in RDD forensics, similar to classical and nuclear forensics. Material databases, license information, sales records, and vendor catalogs provide valuable insights. The IAEA's International Catalogue of Sealed Radioactive Sources and Devices (ICSRS) is a comprehensive database of manufacturer's data on sealed radioactive sources and devices. The NRC maintains a Sealed Source and Device Registry (SS&DR) listing approved products worldwide. DHS funds ANL and INL to gather information on sealed sources from manufacturers, irradiators, and distributors. The collected data is stored in an ANL/INL Sealed Source Database for forensics purposes. The ANL/INL Sealed Source Database is designed for forensics purposes and contains extensive information on sealed source models worldwide. It includes commercial production details, trace element impurities, isotopic ratios, and technical information. Efforts have been made to include data on foreign-made sources as well. The database is continuously updated and considered the most detailed catalog of sealed source models globally. Radiological forensics differs from nuclear forensics in technical and political aspects. While nuclear forensics involves hundreds of radionuclides from a nuclear explosion, RDD materials typically have one or a few radionuclides with longer half-lives. Organizations like DOE, NNSA, DHS, NRC, and national laboratories do not have archives of radioactive sources or materials. Nuclear forensics can support retaliation based on the country of origin of the material, while radiological forensics may not. RDD materials can be produced in one country, distributed to others, making it difficult to trace back to the source for retaliation purposes. Tracing material to the end user country may not be valuable for retaliation efforts. Postdetonation forensics would analyze clues from radioactive material and weapon debris, while predetonation forensics with access to the device could provide more information including characteristics of the radioactive material, weapon design, and trace impurities. If an RDD attack occurred, the United States could learn lessons from it regarding failures of prevention, intelligence, material acquisition, detection avoidance, and response capability. Questions would arise about the speed and coordination of federal aid, equipment and training for first responders, effectiveness of emergency instructions, and public compliance with evacuation orders. Exercises may help prepare for an attack, but cannot provide high-confidence answers to questions about communication, decontamination, and recovery capabilities in the event of an RDD attack. Testing these aspects, including forensics techniques, would be crucial in determining the origin of the material or weapon. It is important to assess the United States' spending on countering RDDs. The United States' spending on countering RDDs is difficult to measure, making it challenging for Congress to allocate funds effectively. Metrics for determining the amount spent on prevention, response, and recovery from an RDD attack are elusive. Various agencies have programs in place, but specific data on RDD-related spending is scarce. The FY2012 NNSA budget includes funds for domestic and international radiological material removal. The NRC and DOD have challenges in tracking funds specifically for RDD-related programs. NRC's budget mainly focuses on nuclear reactors, while DOD struggles to identify resources dedicated to counterproliferation. RDD-related spending is often mixed with other programs like radiological and nuclear, making it hard to determine exact allocations. Preparedness for and response to natural or accidental disasters, counterterrorism, and intelligence programs addressing RDD attacks are often byproducts of other programs. Equipment used to detect terrorist nuclear weapons can also detect other radioactive materials. Nuclear forensics can help determine the source of materials from nuclear weapons and RDDs. Intelligence agencies focused on nuclear weapons may detect an RDD plot. Programs established for peacetime emergencies like nuclear power plant accidents provide equipment and training for first responders. The U.S. has improved its ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from RDD attacks since 9/11. However, it is difficult to determine if the country is more secure now than before. Assessing the probability of an RDD attack or how it has changed is challenging due to data limitations. Assessing the threat of RDD attacks is challenging due to data limitations and the difficulty in gathering relevant information. For example, determining the correlation between the number of unsecured radioactive sources and the actual threat is complex. Additionally, measuring terrorist intent and acquisition of expertise to make RDDs is also problematic. Predictions about terrorist threats may appear arbitrary or alarmist, making it hard to assess the actual risk. The Commission on the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism warns of the likelihood of a WMD being used in a terrorist attack by 2013. Questions arise about the accuracy of the prediction and its impact on budget decisions. Decisions on funding for CBRN-related programs would benefit from knowing the impact of various CBRN attacks. Estimating the impact is challenging, especially in terms of lives lost, due to the wide range of possible fatalities in chemical, biological, and nuclear attacks. The impact of CBRN attacks is difficult to estimate, especially in terms of lives lost. The political and financial repercussions of attacks vary, as seen in the examples of the anthrax attacks and 9/11. The cost of an RDD attack is uncertain due to varying assumptions. The potential impact of an RDD attack includes the need for decontamination at a lower cost, uncertainty regarding acceptable radiation doses, and significant psychological and societal impacts. The report highlights efforts to prevent and respond to RDD attacks but suggests that more could be done, raising issues for Congress to consider regarding resource allocation for enhancing security against RDDs. Priority for countering radiological terrorism is debated, with some arguing for more focus while others suggest less. Despite concerns, there have been no successful RDD attacks. Radiological weapons may kill fewer people compared to other CBRN weapons. Radiological terrorism has received less attention compared to nuclear, biological, and chemical terrorism. Previous summits and resolutions have mainly focused on nuclear and other CBRN threats. The debate over prioritizing funds for countering radiological terrorism includes considerations on the effectiveness of domestic vs. overseas expenditures to secure radioactive sources. The potential costs of an RDD attack could be significant, making measures like decontamination R&D and source security programs cost-effective. Kenneth Luongo, president of Partnership for Global Security, suggests securing radiological sources in public buildings, starting with metropolitan hospitals, to prevent RDD attacks. It would cost approximately $125 million to secure all 500 U.S. metropolitan hospitals. Securing sources overseas could be more cost-effective and promote a security culture, potentially leveraging U.S. expenditures to counter the RDD threat. To counter the RDD threat overseas and safeguard U.S. facilities in other nations, including military bases and embassies, a distributed network of sensors is needed to detect, locate, and identify radioactive material. This network could be mounted on buildings, police cars, or surveillance cameras, and could potentially be incorporated into cell phones or other mobile devices. The cost of developing and deploying such a detector network in major metropolitan areas is a key consideration, raising questions about federal versus state or local funding for deployment. The main physical effect of an RDD would be contamination of high-value areas, with decontamination being a complex process dependent on various factors. \"First decontaminators\" would need to be knowledgeable about effective decontamination techniques to prevent worsening the RDD's effects. Decontamination of high-value areas post RDD attack is complex. Using porous surfaces like concrete for cleanup could worsen contamination. Access to relevant information is crucial to avoid mistakes. Cities may need federal support for decontamination resources. The government's stockpile of resources for decontamination post-attack is crucial. Research and development updates are needed to address future needs. Waste disposition, including nuclear waste burial at WIPP, is a long-standing issue. Spent fuel storage is relevant to preventing RDD attacks. The urgency to dispose of radioactive waste, including spent fuel, is heightened by the possibility of an RDD attack. Political and technical obstacles have hindered burial of waste at Yucca Mountain. The lack of a clear disposal pathway for sealed sources increases the risk of terrorists obtaining materials for an attack. Deciding on a permanent disposition plan for these sources would reduce security vulnerabilities. If decontamination after an RDD attack fails, demolishing contaminated buildings and streets would create a large amount of rubble. Disposal of this rubble poses challenges such as potential water table contamination and interstate transportation issues. Planning in advance for disposal is more efficient than deciding post-attack. Background investigations are required for employees with unescorted access to radioactive sources. Some radiation safety officers view this process as flawed. Some radiation safety officers view the process of background investigations for employees with unescorted access to radioactive sources as flawed. There are no uniform standards for disqualification, with different organizations using various methods to determine trustworthiness and reliability. Evaluating foreign nationals is more challenging than U.S. citizens, leading to inconsistencies in granting unescorted access. Congress could address this issue by acknowledging the current inconsistent screening approach and allowing organizations to implement their own methods. Various organizations have implemented their own methods for background investigations on individuals with unescorted access to radioactive sources. Licensees with Category 1 or 2 sources have designated individuals to assess trustworthiness and reliability of applicants. Recommendations include training these individuals on examining background information, specifying grounds for disqualification, and referring difficult cases to the FBI. For foreign nationals, access to Category 1 and 2 sources should be permitted only when escorted by a cleared individual. Additionally, modifying the materials-protection program to enhance security at facilities is suggested. The program enhances security at facilities with high-priority radioactive material in the United States, aiming to complete upgrades by 2025. Congress could maintain, expand, eliminate, or make the program mandatory to reduce the risk of terrorists seizing radioactive material for malicious use. The NRC and state regulatory framework ensure a baseline level of security for public protection. The NNSA framework enhances security at facilities with high-priority radioactive material in the United States, aiming to complete upgrades by 2025. Congress has shown strong support for nuclear forensics, including radiological aspects. Options for strengthening radiological forensics may be of interest to Congress. Options for strengthening radiological forensics capability include recognizing the differences between nuclear and radiological forensics, requiring a separate report, supporting the buildout of archives for physical samples relevant to RDDs, and tasking an outside panel to study how the science and technology of radiological forensics can be advanced. Maintaining archives of sealed sources and radioactive materials is crucial for radiological forensics. Producers should include trace amounts of impurities to distinguish between batches, aiding in tracking the provenance of items. Collaboration with manufacturers and other countries is essential for expedited communication in the event of an RDD attack. Several bills in the 111th Congress addressed these issues. Several bills enacted into law in the 111th Congress addressed radiological terrorism, including H.R. 2647 (P.L. 111-84) and H.R. 730 (P.L. 111-140). These bills aimed to improve U.S. nuclear forensic and attribution capabilities in the event of a terrorist attack involving nuclear or radiological material. The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center (NTNFC) was established within the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office of the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate U.S. capability for forensics analysis. The FY2010 Intelligence Authorization Act provided scholarships, fellowships, and grants to develop expertise in this area. Additionally, Section 344 of the bill required a report summarizing intelligence on the threat to the U.S. from weapons using radiological materials to be submitted to Congress. Several bills in the 112th Congress also addressed radiological terrorism. Several bills in the 112th Congress address radiological terrorism, including S. 860 (Levin) and H.R. 1411 (Bilirakis). S. 860 aims to enhance screening for chemical, nuclear, biological, and radiological weapons in municipal solid waste, while H.R. 1411 focuses on strengthening detection and response capabilities. Appendix A provides technical background information on RDDs, explaining the structure of atoms, isotopes, and radiation. It serves as a tutorial for those seeking a deeper understanding of the subject. The most common form of hydrogen has no neutrons, while deuterium has one neutron and tritium has two. Atoms in the Earth's crust are mostly stable, but each chemical element has unstable isotopes that decay into different elements. Radioactive atoms, or radionuclides, emit particles and radiation during decay. The rate of decay is measured in curies (Ci), with specific activity counting disintegrations per gram. Specific activity measures disintegrations per gram of material per second in curies per gram. It allows for comparison of radioactivity between different materials. Curies and specific activity measure the number of disintegrations, not their energy. The half-life is the time for half the atoms of a radioactive material to decay. Radiation comes in various forms, including alpha particles and beta particles. Alpha particles are stopped by a sheet of paper or the skin, while beta particles are much less massive. Gamma rays are photons released during radioactive decay, with a wide range of energies. They have no rest mass and can travel long distances. Gamma rays have a wide range of energies and can penetrate the human body, causing biological damage. The higher the energy, the more material they can penetrate and the greater the damage. Gamma ray energy is measured in electron volts or keV. Different materials emit gamma rays at different energies. Cobalt-60 and cesium-137 emit gamma rays at specific energies when they decay, as shown in Figure A-1. Each radionuclide has its own unique gamma-ray spectrum, useful for identification. Strontium-90 emits beta particles, while cobalt-60 emits high-energy gamma rays and beta particles. Americium-241 decays by emitting alpha particles and low-energy gamma rays. Understanding the biological effects of ionizing radiation is crucial for assessing the potential impact of a radiological dispersal device (RDD). Understanding the physiological effects of ionizing radiation is crucial for assessing the potential impact of a radiological dispersal device (RDD). Ionizing radiation has enough energy to damage cells by knocking electrons out of atoms, leading to biological changes even with small energy deposits. The risk of effects increases with higher doses, which can result in cancer, genetic mutations, sickness, or death. Effects of radiation exposure can be deterministic, varying with dose severity, or stochastic, where the probability of an effect occurring is dose-dependent. The physiological effects of ionizing radiation from a radiological dispersal device (RDD) depend on the dose. Deterministic effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and death at high doses, while stochastic effects include cancers and genetic damage. Contamination from an RDD may not cause deterministic effects, but residual contamination could lead to stochastic effects, deterring people from reoccupying the area. Units like roentgen and rad are used to measure radiation dose. The rem, or roentgen equivalent man, corrects radiation absorbed dose for energy deposited in substances like human tissue. Different types of radiation have varying cancer risks, with 1 rad of absorbed dose from x-rays, gamma rays, and beta particles equaling 1 rem. Neutrons and alpha particles have higher weighting factors due to their harmful effects. Background ionizing radiation comes from sources like dirt, granite, radon gas, and cosmic rays. Jet airplane flights, chest x-rays, and altitude living contribute to radiation exposure. The average annual dose of radiation for the U.S. population is 620 mrem, with 48% from medical exposure. An RDD attack is unlikely to expose people to more than a few rem per year. Different standards imply varying degrees of harm from a few rem per year. EPA and NRC have standards of 25 mrem and 100 mrem per year, respectively, for radiation exposure from the nuclear fuel cycle. The NRC has a dose standard of 100 mrem per year for the public and an occupational dose limit of 5 rem per year. Japan's occupational dose limit was 10 rem per year, raised to 25 rem per year after the Fukushima Daiichi incident. Doses greater than 25 rem can have deterministic effects. Exposure to radiation from an RDD can occur through direct contact, inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. \"Skin is a good barrier against many chemicals, but radioactive materials like tritium or iodine can penetrate intact skin and enter the bloodstream. Nuclear weapons release high levels of radiation, causing sickness or death. RDDs, which do not involve nuclear explosions, can also pose radiation exposure risks through various pathways.\" An RDD contains radioactive material that can contaminate a large area, but its radiation dose is smaller than a nuclear weapon. EPA and FEMA have issued guidance for protective actions following radiological incidents, including RDD attacks. The projected dose to a reference individual from a release of radioactive material, at which protective actions are recommended before the dose is realized. PAGs provide guidance on emergency actions like sheltering or evacuation during the early phase of an incident, when field data may not be available immediately. FEMA notes that detection of a covert dispersal may be delayed. During the early phase of a nuclear incident, protective actions like sheltering or evacuation are recommended for a projected dose of 1 to 5 rem. The intermediate phase begins after the incident is under control, with FEMA suggesting relocation for a projected dose of 2 rem in the first year. PAGs assume continuous exposure, but actual doses can be reduced through sheltering, decay, weathering, and decontamination. The late phase starts during recovery. The late phase of a nuclear incident begins during recovery and cleanup, with the EPA setting a cumulative dose limit of 5 rem over 50 years. FEMA does not have a specific guideline for the late phase as it is not considered an emergency situation. Another set of guidelines covers emergency workers exposed to doses at or above 5 rem, depending on their activities. The EPA sets a cumulative dose limit of 5 rem over 50 years for the late phase of a nuclear incident. Guidelines cover emergency workers exposed to doses at or above 5 rem, with different levels for specific activities such as protecting valuable property or lifesaving efforts. Even at the 25-rem level, there are no detectable clinical effects, but a small increase in the risk of delayed cancer and genetic effects. In a nuclear incident, it is impossible to develop a single dose level for all responders due to the potential for widespread contamination from even small amounts of radioactive materials. An RDD attack using cesium-137 chloride could pose a significant health threat, with biological effects depending on factors such as the type of radiation. Gamma emitters are a primary source of direct radiation exposure. Gamma emitters like cobalt-60 and cesium-137 are a major source of radiation exposure. Neutrons and alpha emitters like americium-241 and polonium-210 can be harmful when taken into the body. Different radionuclides behave differently in the body, with iodine concentrating in the thyroid gland and strontium-90 depositing in bone and blood-forming tissue. Polonium, chemically similar to calcium, deposits in bone and blood-forming tissue. It circulates throughout the body and can remain radioactive for years, increasing dose to people. Filtering may not remove radioactive material from water, and contaminated plants can transfer radioactivity to animals. Ingesting contaminated food or water raises radiation exposure. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has established thresholds for quantities of radioactive materials requiring protective measures to prevent their theft or diversion for use in radiological dispersal devices (RDD) or radiological exposure devices (RED). Risk-significant quantities of 16 materials, often a fraction of a gram, are outlined in Table A-1 based on the International Atomic Energy Agency's guidelines. The curr_chunk discusses the categorization of radioactive sources based on their potential to cause harm if not securely managed. Category 1 sources could cause permanent injury or death, Category 2 could cause injury over hours to days, and Category 3 could cause injury over some hours. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates the use of Category 1 or 2 sources for protecting radiation sources. The Code of Conduct sets worldwide standards for protecting radioactive sources, with the United States adopting similar categories. The IAEA selected radionuclides based on availability and characteristics, while the NRC notes that only four of the 16 radionuclides are widely used in civilian settings. The NRC highlights the risk from cesium-137 chloride due to its dispersibility, solubility, and presence in facilities across the United States. This poses a greater concern for some attack scenarios compared to other radioactive sources. Additionally, there is a lack of permanent disposal options for high-activity cesium radiation sources, leading to unique risks. CsCl sources make up 3% of the IAEA Category 1 and 2 quantity sources in the U.S. The CsCl used in medical and scientific applications in the U.S. is important for blood irradiation, research, and calibration. It is in a compressed powder form for safety and security, but its solubility and dispersibility raise security concerns. Cesium-137 chloride is crucial for radiobiological and medical research. The cesium-137 spectrum is essential for radiobiological research and clinical medicine, serving as the reference standard for over 60 years. Its elimination would require years of impractical studies to establish a new standard, causing financial hardship in medical applications. The IAEA's thresholds in the Code of Conduct are based on potential deterministic effects and can also determine the relative effectiveness of materials in a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD). The curr_chunk discusses the amount of different materials needed to contaminate a specified area to a specified level in a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD). For example, a Category 2 source of cobalt-60 could contaminate 0.74 square km with 0.007 grams, while it would take 0.36 grams of cesium-137 or 16.77 grams of americium-241 to contaminate the same area. The amounts mentioned are less than 1 ounce, and a dose of 2 rem/year would not cause deterministic effects. Terrorists cannot manufacture the most concerning material for RDDs as it is made in nuclear reactors. Manufacture of radioactive materials for RDDs is a concern as they are produced in nuclear reactors. Some materials are created by bombarding stable atoms with neutrons, transforming them into radioactive forms. Cesium-137 and strontium-90 are byproducts of uranium fission in reactors, while cobalt-60 is produced by only a few reactors worldwide. Terrorists would need to steal these materials as they are not easily accessible. Terrorists would need to obtain radioactive material through theft, purchase, or transfer from sympathetic insiders, with a focus on \"sealed\" sources. Sealed sources enclose radioactive material in a metal capsule to prevent leaks and contamination. These sources have various beneficial uses such as treating cancers, irradiating food, and monitoring wells for oil. Millions of sealed sources are in use worldwide, varying in curies, with some posing a potential terrorist threat. Radioisotopic thermal generators (RTGs) in Russia, powered by several thousand curies of strontium-90, are a major concern due to their unsecured radiological material. Efforts by the United States, Russia, and other countries are underway to secure these devices to prevent terrorist use. By the end of FY2011, 646 of 851 RTGs are expected to be recovered. Uranium and plutonium are potential fuels for nuclear weapons and could be used in a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD). However, uranium is unlikely to be used due to low radiation emission, while plutonium poses a higher biological hazard. Terrorist groups may find it easier to obtain radionuclides with common industrial uses for an RDD, while those seeking to build a nuclear bomb would likely target highly enriched uranium over plutonium. Highly enriched uranium is preferred over plutonium for nuclear bombs, as only uranium can be used in the simplest type of bomb. Terrorist groups seeking to build a bomb would target highly enriched uranium. However, spent nuclear fuel, containing uranium and plutonium, could be used in a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD)."
