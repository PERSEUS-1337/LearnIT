    "content": "On October 23, 2015, the House passed a reconciliation bill, H.R. 3762, which would repeal provisions of the ACA and restrict federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. The bill's budgetary impact and policy implications are summarized in this report, which will be updated as needed to reflect legislative developments. Budget reconciliation is a legislative process that aims to bring existing spending, revenue, and debt-limit laws in line with current fiscal priorities established in the annual budget resolution. Congress adopts a budget resolution to set budgetary goals for the upcoming fiscal year and may need to enact legislation to reconcile existing laws with these priorities. The reconciliation process in Congress aims to align existing laws with current priorities by passing reconciliation bills. Reconciliation directives in the annual budget resolution instruct committees to develop legislation that changes laws related to spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Committees may exceed the specified deficit reduction amount. In response to reconciliation instructions, committees must ensure compliance with instructed levels. If legislation is not compliant, procedures allow chambers to move forward with reconciliation bills. Legislative language within a noncompliant committee's jurisdiction can be added during floor consideration to meet reconciliation instructions. Policy choices made during legislation development remain with the committee. Reconciliation directives may include specific options or assumptions for achieving targets. The committee is not bound by reconciliation targets, and the Budget Committee must report reconciliation legislation without substantive revision. Differences between House and Senate reconciliation bills must be resolved before presidential approval or veto. The Budget Committee is not required to wait for all committees to submit legislative language before sending reconciliation instructions to the President for approval or veto. The target dates in reconciliation instructions do not dictate when the Budget Committee must report an omnibus reconciliation bill. Delays in committee responses do not affect the privileged status of a reconciliation bill. The House and Senate Budget Committees have previously delayed reporting reconciliation bills, making target dates in reconciliation instructions not indicative of a timetable for consideration of reconciliation legislation. S.Con.Res. 11 established the congressional budget for FY2016 and provided reconciliation instructions for FY2017-FY2025. The reconciliation instructions in S.Con.Res. 11 required Senate and House committees to submit changes in laws to reduce the federal deficit by at least $1 billion for FY2016-FY2025. Committees were also instructed to consider repealing the Affordable Care Act and related health care provisions. The House Budget Committee voted to report a reconciliation bill, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which aimed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and related health care provisions. The House Rules Committee subsequently set the terms for consideration of the bill, amending language concerning grants to Planned Parenthood and the Independent Payment Advisory Board. The resolution was approved by the House with a vote of 240-187. The House approved H.R. 3762, a reconciliation bill to repeal ACA provisions, with a vote of 240-189. The bill would reduce federal deficits by $78.1 billion over 2016-2025, as estimated by CBO and JCT. Policy implications of the repeal are discussed in the report. H.R. 3762 would prohibit federal funds for one year to entities providing certain reproductive health services, affecting primarily PPFA and its affiliates. H.R. 3762 would restrict federal funds for one year to entities providing reproductive health services, mainly affecting PPFA and its affiliates. CBO estimated potential savings of $235 million from Medicaid. The bill would also allocate an additional $235 million for federal health centers in FY2016 and FY2017. The ACA repeal provisions in the bill would not eliminate the entire ACA, leaving intact provisions like health insurance exchanges and financial assistance. H.R. 3762 would repeal the ACA's individual mandate and associated penalty, resulting in net savings according to CBO and JCT estimates. The federal government may lose revenue from forgone tax receipts, but the savings from repealing the mandates, particularly the individual mandate, would outweigh the loss. For more information, contact CRS analysts listed in the report. Repealing the individual mandate under H.R. 3762 would reduce the number of individuals with coverage, leading to budgetary savings for the federal government. The mandate works alongside ACA market reforms to ensure coverage for preexisting conditions and limit premium variations based on health status. The House reconciliation bill would repeal the individual mandate and penalty, potentially leading to adverse selection and higher insurance premiums for remaining participants. The House reconciliation bill would repeal the individual mandate and penalty, potentially leading to adverse selection and higher insurance premiums for remaining participants. This concern is particularly salient with respect to the non-group market, where premiums for policies could increase by about 20% if the mandate were repealed. The bill would also repeal the ACA's employer mandate, affecting employers with at least 50 full-time equivalent employees. H.R. 3762 would repeal the employer mandate effective January 1, 2015 for employers with at least 50 FTE employees. This would eliminate the potential tax penalty for not offering affordable health coverage, resulting in a loss of revenue to the federal government. The net budgetary savings from repealing both the employer and individual mandate is largely due to the individual mandate. Additionally, some employers may no longer offer health insurance to their employees under the new law. The bill H.R. 3762 would repeal the ACA's excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage, known as the Cadillac tax. This tax was intended to raise revenue to offset the cost of other ACA provisions. The bill also aims to mitigate the reduction in offers of employment-based coverage by employers continuing to offer coverage to attract the best workers at lower costs. The Cadillac tax, aimed at reducing health care costs, would result in a loss of federal revenue. It incentivizes employers to shift employees to lower-cost coverage. Analysis suggests it could lead to a decline in national health expenditures by 0.6%-0.9% in 2018 and 2.5%-3.6% in 2024, potentially reducing expenditures by $7.6-$11.0 billion in 2018 and $41.0-$60.3 billion by 2024. Repealing the medical device tax under H.R. 3762 would eliminate a source of downward pressure on employer-sponsored coverage and healthcare costs. The tax, in effect since January 1, 2013, has been argued to hinder innovation and employment in the medical device industry. However, analysis suggests that the tax may be passed on to consumers through higher prices, with minimal impact on industry employment. Approximately half of U.S. medical device production is expected to be exempt from the tax. The medical device tax, in effect since 2013, may not have significant impact on industry employment but could lead to higher prices for consumers. Approximately half of U.S. medical device production is expected to be exempt from the tax due to various exemptions and regulations. The tax could be seen as a way to finance health reform, although justifications for it based on economic principles are weak. H.R. 3762 would repeal the ACA's auto-enrollment requirement for employers with more than 200 full-time employees. It would also eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) and rescind any unobligated funds appropriated to the PPHF for the fiscal year. If PPHF funds were to become unavailable, alternative funding sources would be needed. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) has provided $3.8 billion to the CDC from FY2010 to FY2015. CDC programs funded by PPHF include immunization grants, efforts to prevent infections, and programs for chronic diseases. Other agencies like ACL and SAMHSA also received small PPHF funds in FY2015. The SAMHSA received small amounts of PPHF funds for FY2015 for programs on Alzheimer's disease prevention, chronic disease management, falls prevention among seniors, and suicide prevention grants. The bill includes a one-year prohibition on federal funding for entities that meet certain criteria, impacting Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its affiliates. PPFA operates approximately 700 health centers across the United States. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) operates around 700 health centers in the US, with government funding being its main revenue source. PPFA receives approximately $450 million annually in federal funds, with $390 million from Medicaid. A one-year federal funding prohibition could impact Medicaid beneficiary access to care at PPFA affiliates. The one-year federal funding prohibition on Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) could lead to beneficiaries using nonfederal funds for services or seeking alternative providers reimbursed with federal Medicaid funds. Some Medicaid beneficiaries may go without services, potentially increasing future costs. The impact on PPFA's operations is uncertain due to varying levels of federal funding at different health centers. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated a savings of $235 million mainly from the Medicaid program with a one-year funding ban on PPFA. H.R. 3762 included a one-year ban on funding for PPFA, redirecting funds to other health centers. CBO estimates suggest reduced access to services and increased federal spending over a 10-year period."
