    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Shark Conservation Act of 2000\". The Congress finds that sharks are vulnerable to overfishing due to their slow growth and late sexual maturity. Many shark species require careful management similar to other highly migratory species. Most sharks are caught incidentally in fisheries targeting other species, leading to a lack of data on shark populations and harvesting practices. The global trade in shark products, including shark fins, contributes to overfishing and high shark mortality rates worldwide. Shark-finning, where fins are removed and the carcass is discarded, wastes about 95% of each shark by weight. This trade involves at least 125 countries, driving dramatic increases in shark fishing. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea emphasize the need to minimize bycatch, reduce waste, and ensure the sustainability of fish stocks based on scientific information. The Food and Agriculture Organization emphasizes minimizing waste, discards, and catch of non-target species in fisheries. The International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks calls for shark conservation plans to reduce waste and ensure sustainable catches by 2001. The International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks calls for shark conservation plans to be submitted by 2001. Sharks are not currently subject to specific conservation measures internationally, and the US conservation program varies by region, with a focus on banning shark finning. Prohibiting shark finning by US vessels and in US waters may not reduce the practice globally. Shark finning and trade in fins harvested by foreign fleets transshipping through the United States must be addressed comprehensively at national and international levels. The United States should lead efforts to prohibit shark finning domestically and globally through regional agreements and international conventions. The United States should lead efforts to prohibit shark finning domestically and globally through regional agreements and international conventions, including an international ban on shark-finishing in all nations' exclusive economic zones. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON SHARK-FINNING AND THE LANDING OF SHARK FINS. In General, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to prohibit shark-finning and landing shark fins. There is a presumption that shark fins found on a fishing vessel were obtained through shark-finning. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to define shark-finning as the act of taking a shark, removing its fins, and returning the rest of the shark to the sea. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to define shark-finning as the act of taking a shark, removing its fins, and returning the rest of the shark to the sea. Regulations. The Secretary of Commerce must establish regulations within 90 days of this Act's enactment to implement the prohibition on shark finning. These regulations will address shark fin landing requirements, procedures for releasing sharks caught but not retained, and documentation requirements for data collection to support shark conservation efforts. The regulations will address shark stock assessments, conservation, and enforcement efforts, as well as the circumstances for rebutting the presumption under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. SEC. 5. INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS. The Secretary of Commerce, in collaboration with the Secretary of State, is required to notify other nations engaging in shark fishing about import certification procedures, regulations, and international cooperation. They must also initiate discussions for bilateral or multilateral agreements to prohibit shark finning and engage with foreign governments involved in shark-finning or commercial fishing operations that may harm shark species. The Secretary of Commerce, in collaboration with the Secretary of State, is required to notify other nations engaging in shark fishing about import certification procedures, regulations, and international cooperation. They must also seek international agreements to ban shark-finning and harmful fishing practices, and amend existing treaties for shark conservation to align with US policies. SEC. 6. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, must provide Congress with an annual report listing nations conducting shark-finning or fishing operations affecting shark species. The report evaluates nations' efforts to comply with regulations and assesses the impact of shark imports on conservation measures. The curr_chunk outlines a plan of action for international measures to conserve sharks, including recommendations to ensure US actions align with global obligations. The curr_chunk focuses on import certification for shark conservation measures. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a procedure to determine if governments have adopted shark conservation measures comparable to those of the United States, including regulatory programs on shark finning and management plans for shark release to ensure survival. The Secretary will certify to Congress whether harvesting nations have adopted shark conservation measures comparable to those of the United States, including regulatory programs on shark finning and management plans for shark release. The Secretary will certify whether harvesting nations have shark conservation measures comparable to the US, including management plans for shark release and data gathering for stock assessments. The Secretary will establish a procedure for certifying imports from non-certified nations if harvested by approved practices. Imports of sharks must adhere to specific practices to ensure shark conservation, including releasing non-retained species in a way that maximizes survival, gathering species-specific data for conservation efforts, and following harvesting practices comparable to those of the United States. It is illegal to import sharks or products from uncertified nations more than 90 days after regulations are issued. Imports of sharks from uncertified nations are prohibited, unless the vessel is certified under specific regulations. If the Secretary fails to certify a country, restrictions on imports will apply 90 days after the certification deadline. SEC. 8 of the Act defines \"shark-finning\" as the practice of removing a shark's fin or fins and returning the rest of the shark to the sea. SEC. 9 pertains to research. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a research program for Pacific and Atlantic sharks to collect data for stock assessments, identify fishing gear to prevent shark bycatch, study fishing methods for shark survival after release, and develop methods for releasing sharks from gear safely. Research on maximizing shark utilization and developing the market for sharks not taken in violation of fishing management plans, as well as studying the international shark fin trade. SEC. 10. The National Marine Fisheries Service will collaborate with the Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council and the commercial longlining industry to conduct research activities outlined in the Act, including shark research. SEC. 11. The service may also engage in international cooperation and assistance. The Secretary of Commerce shall provide technological assistance, conduct research activities, facilitate technology transfer, and offer assistance to nations and organizations to help them qualify for certification under section 6(b)(1). The Secretary of Commerce will provide assistance to nations and organizations in designing and implementing shark harvesting plans. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 to carry out the Act."
