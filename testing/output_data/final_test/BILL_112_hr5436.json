    "content": "The Act titled \"Engaging Students Through Service Learning Act\" introduces a K-12 service-learning program under Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This program aims to enhance the effectiveness of K-12 education through service learning. The Congress emphasizes the importance of active, meaningful, and challenging learning experiences that promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Service learning involves key elements of effective teaching, such as active learning, authentic experiences, peer collaboration, and student empowerment. Students are more engaged in learning when it is personally meaningful and connected to real-life issues. In service learning, students apply their knowledge and skills to solve community problems. Service learning can have a powerful effect on students, increasing their academic engagement, civic engagement, and social-emotional development. Students connect to the community and classmates in meaningful ways, promoting behavioral growth. Service learning promotes students' educational success by increasing motivation, engagement, self-efficacy, and pro-social behaviors. Research shows that participants have higher test scores in various subjects. High-quality service learning enhances student achievement through experiential learning strategies, problem-solving, and deeper learning opportunities. Service learning positively impacts teacher satisfaction, school climate, academic achievement, and student engagement. Teachers using service learning achieve better academic and behavioral results, are more effective and energized, and are more likely to stay in their profession. Only 24% of K-12 students in the US have the opportunity for service-learning, a decline from 32% in 1999. Service learning is effective in reducing the achievement gap between affluent and low-income students, improving school attendance and grades for low-income students. There is a need for a focused initiative to promote high-quality service learning that enhances teacher effectiveness and student success. State educational agencies play a crucial role in promoting service learning. State educational agencies have statewide responsibility for the quality of learning within a State. The purpose of this part is to authorize a national elementary and secondary school service-learning program that promotes student achievement in academic subjects, incorporates 21st-century skills, integrates content knowledge and technology, enhances school climate and civic engagement, and improves post-school outcomes. The Secretary shall reserve funds for national activities, including establishing a National Center for K-12 Service Learning to improve teacher quality, school climate, and educational outcomes through service-learning efforts. The Secretary shall reserve funds for research and evaluation activities, including a study on the effects of academic service learning on instructional quality and student success in low-performing schools. The study will include a comprehensive research design and gather qualitative and quantitative data to assess the impact of service learning. The impact of service learning on students' academic, civic, and behavioral performance, including student engagement, is assessed. Tracking and measuring district-level change based on service-learning policies and practices is also evaluated. Additionally, the effectiveness of professional development leadership systems, including the impact on teaching and pedagogy, is measured. The Secretary will reserve 5 percent for training and technical assistance for State-level program development. An entity with a proven track record will continually scan the field and build a knowledge base of exemplary service-learning models. The Secretary will reserve 5 percent for training and technical assistance for State-level program development. The exemplary practices of service-learning models aim to ensure dissemination, adoption, and continuous improvement at the State and local level. Specific activities include developing and disseminating program models to advance the use of service learning as a high-quality instructional pedagogy. The curr_chunk focuses on advancing efforts for high-quality teachers and equitable distribution, as well as providing professional development models and technical assistance materials. The curr_chunk focuses on state activities related to advancing efforts for high-quality teachers and equitable distribution, as well as providing professional development models and technical assistance materials. The State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary with assurances including access to professional development, strategies for improvement in low-performing areas, establishment of effective programs, and support systems. The State educational agency must establish partnerships for systemic implementation of service learning in teacher preparation and professional development. Funds must be reserved for a service-learning specialist and state-level activities to ensure high-quality practice and sustainability. The State educational agency must establish partnerships for systemic implementation of service learning in teacher preparation and professional development, including a statewide cascade professional development model, onsite support and mentoring for local educational agencies, and dissemination of resources for quality implementation and sustainability through grants or contracts with national intermediaries or community-based organizations. \"SEC. 2505. SUBGRANTS TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.\" \"A State educational agency receiving funds under this part must use remaining funds to make subgrants to local educational agencies. Subgrants are awarded based on competitive criteria, with priority given to agencies serving high proportions of students in poverty or below grade level.\" A local educational agency applying for a subgrant under this section must submit an application to the State educational agency detailing how funds will be used to participate in professional development, replicate service-learning models, increase academic engagement and performance, civic skills, and enable students in low-performing schools to engage in high-quality service-learning experiences. Educators will receive support in using instructional practices that apply academic knowledge and skills to address relevant needs. Partnerships will be established to create a community-wide expectation that service learning is an essential part of a high-quality education, with a focus on setting measurable goals and measuring impact on students and the community. The cascade professional development model involves training specialists to then train educators, promoting effective practice and consistency in quality among all States. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2013 and beyond. The text chunk outlines the provisions of Part E, focusing on enhancing K-12 education through service learning. It includes findings, purposes, national and state activities, subgrants to local educational agencies, and the definition of the cascade professional development model.
