    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keeping out Illegal Drugs Act of 2015\" or \"KIDs Act of 2015\". Congress acknowledges the fiduciary responsibility to protect future generations of Native Americans from the harmful effects of illegal drugs. Testimony shows that drug abuse on Indian lands has had a destructive impact on all Native Americans. A report indicates high rates of substance use among Native American students living on or near reservations. According to data, a high percentage of tenth grade Native American students on Indian lands use marijuana, exceeding the national average. Starting drug use at a young age increases the likelihood of using other drugs, incarceration, and lower quality of life. American Indians and Alaska Natives have some of the highest substance use rates compared to other ethnic groups. National Institutes of Health research supports these findings. The National Institutes of Health have shown that marijuana use may cause permanent brain damage and is linked to poor educational outcomes. Illegal drug use in Indian country contributes to higher poverty, crime rates, and lower life expectancy. American Indians and Alaska Natives have the highest rate of drug-induced death among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. According to the CDC Health Disparities and Inequalities Report-United States, 2013, American Indians and Alaska Natives aged 30-40 had the highest drug-induced death rate from 1999-2010 compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the US. Federal law already prohibits marijuana production and distribution. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Defines \"Indian lands,\" \"Indian tribe,\" and \"tribal organization\" according to specific Acts. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION. It is illegal for an Indian tribe or tribal organization to cultivate, manufacture, or distribute marijuana on Indian lands, or allow others to do so.
