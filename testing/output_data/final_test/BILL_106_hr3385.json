    "content": "The Act aims to enhance research and development for technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, remove and sequester greenhouse gases, and develop practices to address climate change. It amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to establish a Climate Technology Research, Development, and Demonstration Program. The section directs the Secretary to establish a long-term Climate Technology Research, Development, and Demonstration Program to develop and enhance technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency. The Secretary is directed to establish a program to develop technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency. This includes developing new technologies to remove and sequester greenhouse gases from emissions streams and the atmosphere. The Secretary must prepare a 10-year program plan within 180 days and update it biennially. The Secretary must update and resubmit the program plan to Congress. Proposals for activities consistent with the plan must be solicited and selected within 180 days. Applicants must demonstrate technical capability and have a multi-disciplinary research staff. Proposals must demonstrate technical capability and have a multi-disciplinary research staff experienced in energy technologies, greenhouse gas emissions, or related practices. Access to facilities for testing is also required. The applicant must show industry involvement in research decisions, evaluation of progress, and financial commitment. Matching funds from non-Federal sources can be cash or the fair market value of equipment and services. The proposal must include a management plan, cost breakdown, and technology transfer mechanisms to expedite research and development activities. The proposal should expedite the research, development, and commercialization of technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, collaborate with relevant industry or organizations, and consider collaboration with Department of Energy national laboratories. The Secretary will select proposals based on evidence of the applicant's ability to complete the project, introduce the technology into commerce, and maintain financial commitment from all industrial sectors involved in technology development. The selected proposals will focus on research, development, and demonstration of technologies to assist in stabilizing global greenhouse gas emissions. The Secretary will select proposals based on evidence of the applicant's ability to complete the project, introduce the technology into commerce, and maintain financial commitment from all industrial sectors involved in technology development. The selected proposals will focus on research, development, and demonstration of technologies to assist in the stabilization of global greenhouse gas concentrations through various approaches such as improving energy technologies, developing greenhouse gas capture and sequestration technologies, reducing costs and accelerating deployment of renewable resources, developing advanced nuclear generation designs, and enhancing the efficiency of electrical generation and usage. The program focuses on processes that minimize raw material consumption, advanced co-production systems, and recycling programs. It includes research and development in specific areas identified in the program plan, industry support, technology transfer, and overall effective implementation. Annual progress reports are required to be submitted to Congress by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology. The Science and Technology department, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit an annual report to Congress certifying program objectives, avoiding duplication with other agencies, and addressing a broad range of technologies to combat climate change. This includes greenhouse gas capture, photovoltaic, coal, nuclear, and fuel cell technologies. The Science and Technology department, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit an annual report to Congress certifying program objectives, avoiding duplication with other agencies, and addressing a broad range of technologies to combat climate change. This includes coal, advanced nuclear, fuel cell, renewable resource, and distributed generation technologies, as well as improving the efficiency of electrical generation, transmission, distribution, and end use. Authorization of $200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2010 is provided for these purposes. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND IMPLEMENTING PROGRAM FOR ENERGY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION. Section 6 of the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 is amended to include solutions for managing greenhouse gas emissions in the long term through the development of technologies and practices. This includes reducing or avoiding anthropogenic emissions, removing and sequestering greenhouse gases from emissions streams, and removing and sequestering greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The amendment to Section 6 of the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 aims to pursue a long-term climate technology strategy to demonstrate various technologies for stabilizing greenhouse gases. The amendment aims to demonstrate technologies for stabilizing greenhouse gases, including low-cost photovoltaic power systems, clean coal technology, advanced nuclear power plant design, fuel cell technology, carbon sequestration practices, renewables, and electrical generation. The curr_chunk focuses on electrical generation, transmission, distribution technologies, end use technologies, and bio-energy technology. The curr_chunk focuses on defining key terms related to electrical generation, transmission, distribution technologies, end use technologies, and bio-energy technology. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to climate change, greenhouse gases, and greenhouse gas sequestration. The curr_chunk explains the process of extracting and isolating gases from the atmosphere or emissions stream, as well as the natural process of photosynthesis that stores carbon in trees and other plant materials."
