    "content": "Federal child welfare funding for FY2018 is expected to be $9.5 billion, including $8.3 billion in open-ended mandatory dollars and $1.2 billion in combined capped mandatory and discretionary funding. Most funding is authorized under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act for support of children in foster care, adoption, and legal guardianship. The budget authority for Title IV-E may exceed $8.3 billion in FY2018, with an increase tied to expected growth in adoption and kinship guardianship assistance. In February 2018, Congress passed Family First, authorizing open-ended and mandatory Title IV-E funding for substance abuse and mental health treatment services and in-home parent skills programs starting in FY2020. Additionally, funding for state kinship navigator programs was authorized as of FY2019. Funding for child welfare services and related research totaled $1.2 billion for FY2018, primarily authorized in Title IV-B and certain sections of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, as well as in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA). Additional support is provided through Adoption Opportunities and the Victims of Child Abuse Act, with most funding considered discretionary. The $1.2 billion in child welfare funding for FY2018 includes capped mandatory and discretionary funding, with an increase of $140 million from FY2017. The FY2018 omnibus bill provided additional funding for CAPTA state grants and Title IV-B programs to support kinship navigator programs and improve outcomes for children. The FY2018 child welfare funding includes increased support for grants to regional partnerships to help children affected by parental substance abuse, additional funds for Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payments, and funding for Court Appointed Special Advocates. Table 1 shows child welfare funding from FY2014-FY2018. The federal funding for child welfare programs is mainly administered by the Children's Bureau within HHS's Administration for Children and Families. Exceptions include grant programs under the Victims of Child Abuse Act, which are managed by the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice. The increase in discretionary funding for child welfare is largely attributed to addressing the opioid crisis, as substance use disorders often impact parenting and present challenges for child welfare agencies. The opioid crisis has led to an increase in infants experiencing withdrawal symptoms at birth and more children entering foster care due to parental drug abuse. In FY2016, nearly 274,000 children entered foster care, with drug abuse by a parent being a factor in one-third of cases. Child welfare administrators attribute the rise in children and families needing services to the opioid crisis. The opioid crisis has led to an increase in children entering foster care due to parental drug abuse. Research shows a link between drug overdose rates and child abuse/neglect reports. Kin caregivers help alleviate strain on child welfare agencies, but they may have limited income and their own service needs. State child welfare agencies are seeking help from kin caregivers during the opioid epidemic. Funding for CAPTA state grants was $25.3 million. Funding for CAPTA state grants increased from $25.3 million in FY2017 to $85.3 million in FY2018. States must use these funds to improve their response to reports of child abuse and neglect, with a focus on infants affected by substance use disorder. The additional $60 million in FY2018 is intended to help states prioritize plans of safe care for substance-exposed infants. Under current law, states receiving CAPTA state grant funds must have policies for developing plans of safe care for substance-exposed infants. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA) amendments to CAPTA require these plans to address the health and treatment needs of infants and affected families. States must also establish monitoring systems to ensure compliance with these requirements. Nearly half of the states initially could not assure compliance with the amended plan of safe care requirements under CARA. States receiving CAPTA state grant funds must comply with the plan of safe care requirements as amended by CARA to secure their funding. HHS's Children's Bureau confirmed in May 2018 that all states had met the compliance steps for FY2018 funding. States needed to outline their intended use of the funds in their Annual Progress and Services Report by June 30, 2018, with a focus on plans of safe care. They have until September 30, 2022, to spend the FY2018 CAPTA funds. HHS is tasked with providing necessary assistance and oversight to support states in this process. The HHS directs states to provide technical assistance and oversight for safe care plans for substance-exposed infants. States have met minimum compliance standards, but many seek additional guidance on developing and monitoring these plans. The CAPTA state grant funding is awarded to 56 jurisdictions, including states, DC, Puerto Rico, and territories, with a base amount of $50,000 each. Additional funds are distributed based on child population share, ensuring no state receives less than $150,000. There is no cost sharing requirement. Kinship navigator programs assist kin caregivers in accessing necessary services for children in their care. The FY2018 omnibus (P.L. 115-141) included $19 million in discretionary funding for kinship navigator programs to help caregivers access services for children in their care. This funding aims to support grandparents and relative caregivers facing challenges due to opioid addiction. Additionally, the funding is intended to assist states in developing programs that meet evidence-based practice standards outlined in the Family First Prevention Services Act. States can claim federal support for 50% of their kinship navigator programs under P.L. 115-123. Programs must meet evidence standards and provide information and referral systems, outreach to kinship care families, and promote partnerships. The FY2018 funds support kinship navigator activities for states with HHS-approved plans for foster care prevention and permanency programs under Title IV-E. Jurisdictions must submit documentation by July 20, 2018, outlining fund usage. Activities include increasing knowledge about kinship families and fostering partnerships. The FY2018 funding for kinship navigator activities under Title IV-E provides minimum grants for eligible states, territories, and tribes. There is no matching requirement for jurisdictions receiving this funding. HHS may be flexible on the deadline for submissions. The FY2018 funding for regional partnership grants (RPGs) under P.L. 115-141 included an additional $19 million to support collaborations between agencies to improve outcomes for children affected by parental substance abuse. Since the RPG program began in 2006, over 80 partnerships have been funded in 36 states and tribal areas, with 21 grantees currently receiving funding. The FY2018 RPG funding under P.L. 115-141 allocated $19 million to support collaborations between agencies to improve outcomes for children affected by parental substance abuse. Currently, 21 grantees in 19 states are funded, with potential for 10 more grants. Each grantee may receive $1.5 million to $1.9 million over 36 months, requiring matching funds. Applications for competitive grants are due by August 13, 2018. Strategies to enhance outcomes include expanding services, improving access to treatment, creating court-based programs, integrating services, and enhancing collaboration. The FY2018 RPG funding allocated $19 million to support collaborations between agencies to improve outcomes for children affected by parental substance abuse. Grantees learned the importance of strengthening recovery services, providing key supportive services like housing and healthcare, integrating services for adults and children, identifying child-specific needs, and addressing trauma effects. Subsequent RPG awards required grantees to implement evidence-based programs, including trauma-informed services. An ongoing evaluation of grantees funded in 2012 and 2014 tracks their progress. An ongoing evaluation of grantees funded in 2012 and 2014 tracks measures of child and parent well-being as part of assessing program impacts. $2 million of discretionary PSSF funding is reserved for HHS research and evaluation activities to identify evidence-based practices for foster care prevention services. States can earn Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payments by safely placing children in new permanent families. Funding for these services doubled in FY2018. The FY2018 omnibus doubled funding for Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payments, increasing overall funding from $37 million to $75 million. States earned $55 million in incentive payments in the most recent award cycle, exceeding the available funding of $5 million. $50 million of the FY2018 funding was used to complete full awards to states. The FY2018 appropriated funds, totaling around $25 million, are available for awards to states for increases in adoptions or legal guardianships completed in FY2017. Performance awards are expected to be announced in August or September 2018. Funding for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) programs increased to $12 million in FY2018 from $9 million in FY2017. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program receives capped mandatory funding and discretionary funding, with the majority allocated for various purposes. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program receives funding for formula grants to states, territories, and tribes for family services. Funding is also reserved for specific programs like the State Court Improvement Program, monthly caseworker visit grants, and regional partnership grants. Additional funding in FY2018 supported kinship navigator programs and increased funding for RPGs and technical assistance. The FY2018 PSSF funding totaled $445 million, with $345 million in mandatory funds and $100 million in discretionary funding. Sequestration reduced mandatory funding to $322 million, resulting in overall funding of $422 million. An additional $19 million in RPG funding will be awarded to 10 partnerships by September 2018. The RPG funding was awarded to 21 grantees in 19 states in September 2014 and 2017, with each grantee expected to receive funding over a five-year period. Incentive payments for adoption and legal guardianship were established by the Adoption and Safe Families Act, with data reported by states in August used to calculate payments for the previous fiscal year. Incentive payments earned in a fiscal year are announced for award in the following year. Funding and total incentive payments under the Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Program are shown in Table C-1. About $25 million in FY2018 funding is available for payments earned in FY2017. HHS prorated initial award amounts in previous years due to insufficient funding, using appropriations in subsequent years to make states whole. In September 2017, HHS awarded $5.3 million in program funds on a prorated basis to each state for FY2016 performance. Additional funds were awarded in April 2018 after full-year program funding was appropriated. The incentive payments for state performance in FY2016 varied by category, with the structure now included in the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act."
