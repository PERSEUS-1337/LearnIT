    "content": "Title III of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to include a limit on the amount of nonconstituent contributions and political action committee contributions that a candidate may accept. The term 'nonconstituent source' refers to individuals or political committees from outside a candidate's state or district who contribute a limited amount. The text outlines restrictions on contributions to candidates for the Senate or House of Representatives, including limits on funds from nonconstituent sources and separate segregated funds. Restrictions on contributions to candidates for the Senate or House of Representatives include a limit of 20 percent from nonconstituent sources. SEC. 325 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 amends Title III to control contributions by multicandidate political committees and separate segregated funds. SEC. 325 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 prohibits multicandidate political committees and separate segregated funds from making contributions or expenditures without a vote from contributors. Regulations require these committees to send a form to each contributor for decision-making. SEC. 325 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires committees to send a form to contributors specifying the percentages in which they want their contributions to be distributed to political parties and candidates. Contributions and expenditures must align with the specified percentages, with forms being maintained for 5 years. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires committees to send a form to contributors specifying distribution percentages for contributions, which must align with the specified percentages and be kept for 5 years. The forms can be inspected by the Commission and contributors to the committee or fund. The form for contributors to a multicandidate political committee/separate segregated fund requires specifying the percentage of contribution allocated to different political parties listed on the official ballot of the contributor's State. If the total percentage specified is not 100%, the contribution will be allocated pro rata according to the indicated choices. The form for contributors to a multicandidate political committee or separate segregated fund must be kept on file for 5 years and is subject to inspection by the Federal Election Commission and contributors. The individual contribution limit under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is increased to $1,910 and will be adjusted annually based on the price index starting from 1996."
