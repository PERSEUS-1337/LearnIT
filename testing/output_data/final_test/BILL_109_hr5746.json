Industrial bank holding companies and their subsidiaries must provide reports to the Corporation, including details on financial and operating risks, compliance with laws, and any other required information.

Examination and other reports may be shared with other federal agencies or state bank supervisors. The Corporation may use examination reports from other agencies for industrial bank holding companies. Industrial banks cannot be controlled by commercial firms, defined as entities with at least 15% of annual gross revenues. The Corporation excludes industrial banks that derived 15% of annual gross revenues from non-financial activities in 3 of the prior 4 quarters, with exceptions for pre-2003 institutions. The acquisition of control of an industrial bank after September 30, 2003, does not require registration if there is no change in control. Corporate reorganizations are permitted without being considered a 'change in control' if the acquiring company is controlled by another entity. The paragraph discusses the exclusion of certain commercial firms from regulations if they acquired control of an industrial bank between October 1, 2003, and June 1, 2006, and did not acquire control of any other depository institution after May 31, 2006.

The industrial bank must comply with specific requirements to be exempt from regulations, including engaging only in activities conducted before May 31, 2006, and not expanding operations outside of its home State or host State. Corporate reorganizations are permitted under these conditions. Corporate reorganizations are allowed for industrial banks under specific conditions, including maintaining control by an affiliate company and completing any required divestiture within a 2-year period. The 2-year period for corporate reorganizations of industrial banks includes conditions such as control acquisition by a commercial firm, industrial bank holding company becoming a commercial firm, or non-compliance with limitations leading to divestiture. Administrative provisions may require appointment of agent for service of process. The Corporation may release a registered industrial bank holding company from registration if it no longer controls any industrial bank. Enforcement provisions apply to industrial bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in the same manner as State nonmember banks. Section 10(e)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to include \"or section 50(b)(2)\" after \"subsection (b)(4)\" for State nonmember banks."
