    "title": "SB 406",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 12945.2 of the Government Code in California is amended to allow employees with over 12 months of service and 1,250 hours worked in the previous year to take up to 12 workweeks of family care and medical leave. Employers must guarantee the employee's job upon return. Employers with fewer than 50 employees within 75 miles of the worksite are not required to grant family care and medical leave requests. The definition of \"child\" includes biological, adopted, or foster children, stepchildren, legal wards, and children of domestic partners. \"Employer\" refers to those with 50 or more employees or the state and its subdivisions. Family care and medical leave cover reasons like childbirth, adoption, or foster care placement. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows employees to take leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition or for their own serious health condition. \"Employment in the same or a comparable position\" means a similar job with similar duties and pay. A \"health care provider\" is defined as certain individuals who can provide medical care. A \"health care provider\" under the FMLA includes individuals with specific medical certifications or licenses, as well as those designated by the US Secretary of Labor. The term \"parent\" encompasses various relationships, including biological, adoptive, and foster parents, as well as legal guardians and individuals who acted as a parent to the employee in their childhood. (8) \"Serious health condition\" refers to an illness, injury, impairment, or physical/mental condition requiring inpatient care or continuing treatment/supervision by a health care provider. Employers are not obligated to pay employees for leave taken under this provision, except as mandated by specific circumstances. An employee on leave can use accrued vacation, sick leave, or negotiated time off. Sick leave cannot be used for leave related to birth, adoption, or caring for a family member unless agreed upon. During FMLA leave, employers must maintain and pay for group health plan coverage for eligible employees for up to 12 workweeks. Premiums can be recovered under certain conditions. If an employee fails to return from leave after the entitled period has expired, and the reason is not due to a serious health condition or circumstances beyond their control, it may result in consequences. Any employee on leave under subdivision (a) remains entitled to participate in health plans and other benefit plans as if on unpaid leave for reasons other than those described in subdivision (a). The employer may require the employee to pay premiums at the group rate during the leave period not covered by accrued vacation. During leave, employees must pay group rate premiums to maintain coverage, without constituting a break in service for benefits or seniority. During family care and medical leave, employers are not required to make plan payments for employees, and the leave period does not count towards accrued time under the plan. However, employees can continue to make contributions to their pension plan during the leave. The employee retains their status with the employer during the leave, and it does not break service for purposes of seniority, benefits, or collective bargaining agreements. Upon returning from leave, the employee retains the same seniority for layoff, recall, promotion, job assignment, and seniority-related benefits. If an employee's need for leave is foreseeable, they must give advance notice to the employer. For planned medical treatment, efforts should be made to schedule it to minimize disruption, with approval from the healthcare provider. Employers can request certification for leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition, including details like the start date and expected duration of the condition. An employer may require certification from an employee's healthcare provider for leave due to the employee's own serious health condition. The certification should include the start date of the condition and the probable duration, as well as the need for family member care during treatment. Recertification may be required if additional leave is needed after the initial estimated time. The employer may request certification from the employee's healthcare provider regarding the start date and probable duration of a serious health condition. If additional leave is needed, recertification may be required. If the employer doubts the certification, a second opinion from a different healthcare provider can be requested at the employer's expense. (C) If the second opinion differs from the original certification, the employer can request a third opinion at their expense. (D) The third opinion will be final and binding on both the employer and the employee. As a condition for an employee's return from medical leave, the employer may require certification from a healthcare provider. It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual for taking family care and medical leave or providing information related to it. The section does not require changes in existing collective bargaining agreements until a certain date. Leave can be taken in one or more periods, running concurrently with FMLA. An employer may refuse to reinstate a highly paid employee returning from leave if necessary to prevent economic harm, with notification required. An employee's leave under this section runs concurrently with FMLA leave, except for pregnancy-related disability. The total leave under this section and FMLA cannot exceed 12 workweeks in a 12-month period. Employers cannot interfere with an employee's rights under this section."
