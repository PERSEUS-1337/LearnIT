    "content": "Congressional commissions are formal groups established by Congress to provide independent advice, make recommendations for changes in public policy, study or investigate a particular problem or event, or perform a specific duty. Commissions are composed of policy experts chosen by Members of Congress and/or officials in the executive branch, and they may hold hearings, conduct research, analyze data, investigate policy areas, or make field visits. Most commissions deliver their findings, recommendations, or advice in the form of a written report to Congress. Congressional commissions are established by Congress to provide independent advice, study specific issues, and make recommendations. They are appointed by Members of Congress, serve in an advisory capacity, and report back to Congress. Over 100 commissions have been created since 1989, serving as useful tools in the legislative process for examining complex policy issues in greater depth than may be practical for legislators. Congressional commissions are established by Congress to provide independent advice, study specific issues, and make recommendations. They are appointed by Members of Congress, serve in an advisory capacity, and report back to Congress. The non-partisan or bipartisan character of most congressional commissions may make their findings and recommendations more politically acceptable. Critics argue that many commissions are established for \"blame avoidance\" and take difficult decisions out of Congress's hands. Some see commissions as undemocratic and financially inefficient. Congressional commissions are typically policy, investigative, or commemorative. Policy commissions like the US Commission on North American Energy Freedom study public policy issues and make recommendations to Congress. Investigative commissions like the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks examine past events. Commemorative commissions like the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission oversee celebrations. Legislators must carefully craft statutes to establish these commissions due to their temporary nature and limited time for completion. Congressional commissions are established through statutes that outline their mandate, membership structure, duties, powers, funding, and termination date. The organizational choices for each commission can be tailored by legislators to meet specific goals, resulting in varied structures and powers. The term \"congressional commission\" is not legally defined, leading to confusion over whether certain entities qualify as such. A congressional commission is a multi-member independent entity established by Congress, serving in an advisory capacity, appointed by Members of Congress, and reporting to Congress. It differs from other bodies with \"commission\" in their names and includes most advisory entities within the federal government. Congressional commissions are established by Congress, usually by statute, and serve in an advisory capacity, reporting findings to Congress. They are independent of Congress in function and may be established in the executive branch by the President, department heads, or individual agencies. Congressional commissions are established by Congress for specific tasks with statutory termination dates. This excludes entities serving ongoing administrative purposes or diplomatic functions. Congressional commissions oversee government entities like the United States Holocaust Memorial Council and the John F. Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. They differ from temporary congressional commissions in lifespan, purpose, and function. Unlike regulatory commissions, they lack administrative authority and focus on producing reports with recommendations for legislative or executive action. Members of Congress, especially the leadership, are closely involved in the appointment process for these commissions. This report identifies congressional commissions established between the 101st and 114th Congresses. Numerous bills proposing commissions are introduced each session, but most are not enacted. A database search was conducted for legislation containing commissions during this period. A total of 107 congressional commissions were identified through a search to determine if legislation contained an ad hoc congressional commission. The name, public law number, Statutes-at-Large citation, and date of enactment were recorded for each commission. Identifying congressional commissions involves judgment calls due to the varying ways they are created in legislation. Some commissions may have been missed by the search algorithm. During the search for ad hoc congressional commissions, 107 commissions were identified. These commissions can be categorized as policy, investigative, or commemorative. The majority, 79%, were policy commissions established to study specific issues. Policy commissions were established by Congress to study various issues such as weapons proliferation, fuel tax enforcement, transportation policy, defense, and EMP attacks. Investigative commissions, like the 9/11 commission, are less common but receive significant public attention and have broad powers including subpoenaing witnesses. Notable investigative commissions in recent years include the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. Since 1989, Congress has established 15 commemorative congressional commissions for various purposes, including commemorating individuals and historical events, overseeing national memorials, and addressing legislative complexities. Commissions have been found to be useful tools in the legislative process throughout American history. Congress has established 15 commemorative congressional commissions since 1989 for various purposes, including overseeing national memorials and addressing legislative complexities. These commissions serve to bring together recommendations on complex policy issues that legislators may not have sufficient knowledge or expertise in, helping to efficiently obtain insight into public policy problems. A commission can provide focused attention on specific issues, bypassing institutional problems in Congress. It allows for policy solutions to avoid traditional legislative processes, potentially reducing gridlock. By creating a commission, Congress can streamline policy debates and decision-making. Creating a commission in Congress can provide a flexible environment for policy debates, free from charges of partisanship. The bipartisan or nonpartisan nature of most commissions can make their recommendations more politically acceptable and credible, allowing for negotiations and compromises to be made in good faith. A commission in Congress can help legislators solve collective action problems by allowing them to jointly agree on unpopular but necessary policy solutions. For example, the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) was established in 1988 to make independent decisions about military base closures. The Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) was established in 1988 to make independent decisions about military base closures. Congress can use commissions to bypass internal politics and provide a visible forum for important issues, with meetings and press releases receiving more media attention. Critics of congressional commissions argue that they are seen as an \"abdication of responsibility\" by legislators, undemocratic, and financially inefficient. Commissions are often created for \"blame avoidance,\" allowing legislators to distance themselves from controversial decisions. Critics argue that legislative commissions allow legislators to avoid responsibility, lack democratic representation and accountability, and operate non-transparently. Critics argue that congressional commissions have high costs, low returns, lack guaranteed action by Congress, may produce biased or mediocre results, and can create inefficiencies if used for political patronage. The establishment of congressional policy commissions involves defining the mandate, membership structure, duties, powers, funding, and termination date. Legislators have flexibility in tailoring the organizational structure based on Congress's goals. Each commission can have unique powers and composition. The Commission on Catastrophic Disaster Risk and Insurance was established with a single sentence. The bipartisan Commission on Catastrophic Disaster Risk and Insurance is established with a single sentence, clarifying its legal status based on the manner of member appointments. Congressional findings may justify the creation of such commissions. The bill proposing the Commission on Catastrophic Disaster Risk and Insurance includes specific findings related to hurricane damage and the federal government's role in catastrophe management. Congressional commissions have various membership schemes and appointment structures, which may involve designated Members of Congress or selected leaders appointing members with party balance. The appointment of members to congressional commissions involves selected leaders recommending individuals, with a balance between parties, for appointment. These recommendations can be made to other congressional leaders or the President. Data shows that the legislative branch has participated in appointing 100% of congressional commissions, while the executive branch and other sources have participated in 77% of commissions. Statutory provisions may limit autonomy in appointing commission members, requiring specific qualifications. Deadlines for appointments can range from weeks to months after enactment of the act. For example, the Antitrust Modernization Commission had a 60-day deadline, while the Commission on Wartime Contracting had 120 days. The deadline for appointment to the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States was December 15, 2002, 18 days after enactment of the act. Congressional commissions typically do not compensate members, except for reimbursing expenses related to their service, such as travel costs. Compensation levels, when provided, are usually specified by statute. Compensation for members of congressional commissions is usually set by statute, often based on federal pay scales like Level IV of the Executive Schedule, with a basic annual rate of $160,300 in 2016. Members not employed by the government receive daily pay equivalent to this level for each day of service, while government employees serve without additional pay. Members of the Commission serve without additional pay or benefits for their service. They receive travel expenses according to federal regulations. Most commissions created in the past 20 years do not pay members beyond reimbursement. Congressional commissions can hire staff as needed, with the flexibility to determine staffing requirements. Congressional commissions have flexibility in setting pay rates and hiring consultants. They can request federal agencies to detail personnel and accept voluntary services. The General Services Administration provides administrative support upon request. The General Services Administration provides administrative support to congressional commissions for carrying out specific tasks, such as assessing conditions, conducting investigations, and making recommendations. For example, the proposed Commission on Catastrophic Disaster Risk and Insurance is directed to assess the property and casualty insurance markets after natural disasters and recommend legislative changes. The majority of congressional commissions produce reports for Congress and the President, outlining activities, findings, and recommendations for legislative changes. Commissions are required to submit interim, annual, or final reports within a specified timeframe. Some commissions may also issue additional recommendations as deemed appropriate. Most congressional commissions submit their work to both Congress and an executive branch agency. The recommendations in their reports are advisory, requiring future congressional or executive action for implementation. Commissions are given statutory deadlines for their final reports, with varying timeframes ranging from less than six months to three or more years. Table 6 summarizes the deadlines for submission of final reports by congressional commissions. Deadlines range from 120 days to 4.5 years, with over 75% of commissions having a deadline of two years or less. The overall time for completion varies based on the start point, such as the enactment of legislation or the appointment of commission members. The length of time granted to a congressional commission for completing its work is crucial. Short deadlines may impact the quality of work or hinder fulfilling the statutory mandate. Policymakers should also consider the time needed to establish a new commission, including selecting commissioners and setting up logistical aspects. The selection of commissioners, recruitment of staff, and logistical arrangements for a commission may take six months or more from the date of enactment. A long deadline for the commission may hinder timely expert advice on policy matters, while a short deadline may be appropriate for addressing pressing issues. The cost of a commission increases with a longer deadline, and careful consideration is needed for setting the deadline trigger. Most congressional commissions have flexible deadlines linked to the first meeting for member selection and staff hiring, allowing for predictability in completing work but potentially delaying the final report submission. Commissions hold public meetings to discuss matters, conduct fact-finding hearings, and may subpoena witnesses for testimony. The proposed Hurricane Katrina Disaster Inquiry Commission can issue subpoenas with agreement from the chair and vice chair or a vote of eight members, with enforcement in federal court. The proposed Hurricane Katrina Disaster Inquiry Commission would have the authority to secure information from federal agencies and request information from executive departments. Congress can direct executive branch agencies to assist the commission in its work. Commissions may also have the power to contract with public agencies and private firms and use the mails like other government departments. The authority of congressional commissions includes using the mails like government departments, accepting gifts, and varying costs ranging from hundreds of thousands to over $10 million. Expenses depend on factors like staff numbers and duration, with some commissions having few staff while others employ many. Some provide compensation to members, while others only reimburse travel expenses. Commissions can finish within a year or take several years to complete their work. Additional factors affecting costs include the number of commissioners and the frequency of commission meetings. Congressional commissions can affect commission costs through factors like the number of commissioners, meeting frequency, and publication size. They are primarily funded through congressional appropriations but can also accept donations. Statutes usually do not specify internal procedures, allowing commissions to establish their own rules. Certain rules of internal procedure are commonly found in commission statutes, such as voting by simple majority and determining quorum. Commissions with subpoena authority specify who can issue subpoenas, and rules for staff hires are typically decided by the commission. For example, the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy allows the Chairman to appoint staff according to agreed-upon rules. Commissions vary in how they adopt procedures, with three models: formal written rules, informal rules, and norms. Some commissions formalize procedures for meetings and hearings, including rules for chairpersons, budgeting, staff hiring, and ethics. Changes to the rules require a majority vote of the commission. The commission's rules for hearings include procedures for the hearing structure, selection of panelists, generation of questions, opening statements, and post-hearing recommendations to Congress. Some commissions adopt informal rules for establishing procedures as needed, such as occasional votes to clarify specific procedures for meetings. The commission's rules for hearings include procedures for the hearing structure, selection of panelists, generation of questions, opening statements, and post-hearing recommendations to Congress. Many advisory commissions choose not to create formal rules for meetings, relying on collegial relationships and procedural flexibility. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China and the National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Finance Commission operate without formal rules, making collective agreements based on norms rather than formal action or votes. The choice to adopt written rules or rely on informal norms for commission procedure may depend on factors like commission size, meeting frequency, member preferences, collegiality, and statutory guidance. Regardless of procedural approach, decision-making procedures on operational issues like voting eligibility, staff hiring, meetings, expenditures, and reporting are crucial for commissions to consider. Key considerations for Congress in forming a commission include the purpose, duration, member appointment, compensation, executive director presence, staff hiring authority, labor procurement, and report production. Key considerations for Congress in forming a commission include details such as staffing, report production, subpoena power, funding, administrative support, and location. Information on 107 congressional commissions from the 101st through 114th Congresses is provided, including the commission's name, type, and the public law creating it."
