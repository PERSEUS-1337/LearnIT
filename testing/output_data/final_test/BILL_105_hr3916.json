    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud Prevention Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that Nigerian advance fee fraud, known as \"4-1-9\" fraud, has become widespread. The fraud typically involves a Nigerian claiming to be a government official seeking a foreign entity to deposit overpaid funds into their account. The Nigerian advance fee fraud, known as \"4-1-9\" fraud, involves victims providing company letterhead and bank account information to show completion of a contract. The fraudsters use the victim's letterhead to forge documents and pressure victims to send money for taxes and fees. Victims are also asked to travel to Nigeria without a visa, where airport officials may be bribed to facilitate the fraudulent transaction. The \"4-1-9\" fraud in Nigeria involves victims being coerced into releasing more funds through illegal entry into the country. Violence and threats are used to pressure victims, with some foreign businessmen being murdered. Financial losses to US citizens exceed $100,000,000, and the money from these scams funds other illegal activities. The US Secret Service has \"Operation 4-1-9\" to target these schemes. The Secret Service's \"Operation 4-1-9\" targets fraudulent schemes in Nigeria, receiving numerous calls and mail from victims daily. Perpetrators of these frauds are rarely prosecuted or jailed by the Nigerian Government, leading to little money recovery. Suspicions arise that the government may be involved in these schemes due to lack of enforcement against perpetrators. The Nigerian advance fee fraud is being targeted by the Secret Service's \"Operation 4-1-9\" due to lack of prosecution by the Nigerian Government. The Congress urges the US to collaborate with the international community to prosecute Nigerian scam artists involved in advance fee frauds and educate the public to prevent future fraud. The Secretary of State and Treasury must report on Nigerian Government's actions to cooperate in apprehending fraud perpetrators within a year of this Act's enactment. Efforts to combat advance fee fraud include informing US citizens, coordinating government activities, working with the international community to apprehend perpetrators, and imposing sanctions on Nigeria."
