    "content": "Hierarchical frameworks like convolutional neural networks are proposed for a unified treatment of classification and clustering in machine learning and computer vision. These frameworks build complex patterns on top of simpler ones and show promising results in clustering data points with overlapping shapes. The study highlights the importance of incorporating human vision mechanisms into clustering algorithms for better performance, especially in handling overlapping shapes. While methods like spectral clustering have been successful, they may still fail in certain cases. Clustering is essential in data-driven domains for grouping unlabeled patterns into meaningful clusters. Clustering is the process of grouping unlabeled patterns into meaningful clusters based on similarity. Despite the introduction of numerous clustering algorithms, challenges remain in dealing with different cluster shapes, high dimensions, determining the number of clusters, large datasets, choosing the right similarity measure, and cluster evaluation. No single clustering algorithm can consistently outperform others in all scenarios. Deep neural networks have proven successful in various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. They have been used for tasks like scene and object classification, image segmentation, attention modeling, image generation, robot arm control, playing Atari games, and beating the Go champion. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been particularly successful in vision problems due to the correlation of nearby pixels in natural scenes and the compositional nature of natural objects. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective in vision problems by applying filters across spatial locations to detect high-level patterns. This approach is appealing for clustering problems, as it allows for solving cases where clusters with different shapes overlap. Incorporating domain knowledge is not a general solution for all clustering problems, unlike the human visual system which easily solves 2D problems using learned filters. Deep CNNs show promise for clustering tasks by offering a unified solution to classification and clustering. The distinction between the two tasks blurs when considering human judgments in evaluating clustering outcomes. Human vision, with its evolved filters and learning component, provides insights often overlooked in clustering algorithms. This neglect limits algorithm strength and hinders our understanding of human vision. Deep CNNs offer a unified solution for clustering and classification tasks, blurring the distinction between the two. Human vision insights are often overlooked in clustering algorithms, limiting their strength and hindering our understanding of human vision. Our goal is to explore the use of deep learning for clustering, leveraging fully convolutional networks and recent work on edge detection and semantic segmentation. Our study explores the use of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for clustering tasks. CNNs have shown success in various vision problems and learn representations similar to how the cortex processes visual information. This enriches our understanding of clustering and its relation to classification, drawing inspiration from human vision mechanisms. Our study delves into using deep learning, specifically CNNs, for clustering tasks in the visual ventral stream. Unlike previous methods, we optimize a clustering objective using back propagation through a deep neural network without the need for specifying parameters. The proposed deep network architecture is based on the U-Net model, utilizing an encoder-decoder with skip connections for binary image input. The U-Net model utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections for binary image input. Skip connections recover spatial image information lost through convolution and pooling operations. The final cluster map is generated by applying three 1x1 filters to collapse convolutional maps to three channels. The final cluster map is created using a multiplication process to remove background pixels, focusing on points of interest. The model uses Keras Chollet platform with 128x128 binary images as inputs. Ground truth maps are generated by assigning labels to clusters from top to bottom, making labels independent of object shapes. The training scheme aims to separate objects rather than classify them, different from traditional methods. The network successfully clusters objects with the same shape despite not classifying them correctly. Mean squared error loss is used with the Adam optimizer, batch size 16, and learning rate 0.001. Synthetic data includes geometric shape stimuli parametrized with variables for shapes, number of objects, point densities, and object scales. Images are generated by randomly selecting the number of objects, choosing densities and scales, rotating clusters, and shifting them within the image. The output is a 128 \u00d7 128 pixels binary image of randomly rotated and shifted shapes for CNN input. Gaussian Mixture Density distribution is generated with random mean and covariance matrices for clusters. D \u2208 [100 400] points are sampled from each Gaussian to form input and output images. Sample images are shown in Figure 2. The stimuli in the images pose a challenge for current clustering algorithms as they struggle when clusters overlap. To evaluate clustering methods, the rand index is used instead of prediction scores. This metric compares binary matrices representing cluster membership, calculating the Hamming distance between the ground truth and predicted matrices. The prediction matrix calculates the error rate by determining the fraction of cases where clustering methods disagree. Benchmark algorithms like k-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, and Spectral Clustering are used for comparison. Spectral clustering algorithms analyze point-to-point similarities instead of data distribution models, with methods like Normalized Cut cutting the graph into subgraphs. The second algorithm, Ng-Jordan-Weiss (NJW), is a spectral clustering method that analyzes eigenvectors of the Laplacian of the similarity matrix. Mean Shift algorithm fixes a window around each data point, computes the mean within each window, and shifts the window to the mean until convergence. Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP) method seeks the modes or peaks of a distribution by computing local densities for each point. The CFSFDP algorithm computes local densities for each point, calculates distances to points with higher density, identifies outliers as cluster centers, and assigns points to clusters based on nearest neighbors of higher density. The input is a pairwise distance matrix, and outliers are found using a Gaussian cut off kernel. All algorithms are given the actual number of clusters except CNN and MS, which determine the number automatically. Euclidean distance is used in k-Means. The experiments evaluate clustering algorithms using Euclidean distance. Nine experiments are conducted, with the first six comparing the proposed method to benchmark algorithms on geometric and Gaussian data. The last three test the method's robustness. Experiment 1 studies cluster heterogeneity using 1800 training and 200 testing images. Results show CNN successfully clusters objects. In experiment 1, CNN successfully clusters data with two different objects in images, challenging other algorithms. The network trained in the first experiment focuses on clustering similar shapes. Despite a drop in accuracies compared to experiment 1, CNN still outperforms other models in clustering 3 objects from 3 shapes. The output of models in Figure 3 (A) shows CNN handling cases where objects touch, while other models bleed around the point of contact. Our model outperforms other models in assigning cluster labels to occluded objects, scoring 81.2% compared to no better than 70% for other models. Performance drops as more objects are added or shape variety increases. Experiment 5 & 6 involve images with 2 or 3 different Gaussian clusters in both training and testing data, without specifying the number of clusters to CNN. Experiment 5 & 6 include images with 2 or 3 Gaussian clusters in both training and testing data. CNN outperforms other algorithms in clustering Gaussian distributions, showing high accuracy even when trained on different numbers of objects. Experiment 8 investigates generalization power using varying amounts of training data for shapes and Gaussian distributions. Experiment 8 explores the impact of different training data sizes on model performance for shapes and Gaussian distributions. Results show that even training with a single sample can lead to better than chance accuracy, with performance improving as the training size increases. The experiment results show that the model performs well with few samples, generalizes to unseen cases, and is robust to noise. The model is compared to k-Means and FCM, showing similar performance. Noise is introduced to test the model's robustness, with pre-trained models applied to noisy test images. The effect of noise on real clusters is analyzed, and performance is measured by discarding noise pixels in evaluation. Our model shows robustness to noise, performing well even with highly degraded images. Experiments with randomly labeled clusters resulted in accuracies of 54% and 63.62%, indicating the model's ability to learn from ground truth. A user study was conducted to evaluate the clustering results against human perception. Subjects: Fourteen students from the University of [masked] (8 women, mean age 24.6) participated in an experiment where they were shown images and asked to select the clustering method that best described the data. The experiment lasted about 40 minutes with no time constraints for each trial. The experiment involved 14 university students selecting the best clustering method for images. CNN was favored over FCM and CFSFDP methods in 300 stimuli. CNN showed higher accuracy and alignment with human clustering judgments. Our results show that CNNs outperformed other algorithms in handling complex and occluded clusters, aligning well with human clustering judgments. The use of deep neural networks, especially CNNs, holds promise for data clustering tasks, blurring the distinction between classification and clustering. The supervised formulation utilized mean squared loss for training the network, highlighting the importance of a learning mechanism for capturing complex cluster shapes. The text discusses the use of CNNs for data clustering tasks, highlighting the potential of defining other loss functions for more efficient training. It also mentions the successful application of CNNs in natural image segmentation and the need for further research on extending the work to higher dimensions and different types of cluster shapes. Using CNNs trained on natural images can provide valuable insights for data clustering tasks, including identifying free form curves, Gestalt examples, and density-based clusters."
