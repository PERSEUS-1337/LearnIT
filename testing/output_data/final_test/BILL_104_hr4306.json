The Congress acknowledges that global military spending has reached $868 billion annually, with 27 million soldiers, posing a threat to security by diverting funds from essential programs like health and education. Developed nations, including the United States, are responsible for 75% of military spending and 90% of arms transfers to developing countries. The United States and other developed nations have a controlling vote in international financial institutions, subsidizing excessive military spending in various countries. Developing nations also contribute significantly to high military expenditures, surpassing foreign aid receipts. In the developing world, military spending exceeds education spending, highlighting the issue of prioritization. In the developing world, military spending is significantly higher than health spending, leading to preventable deaths and hindering efforts for good governance due to lack of transparency and military involvement in the civilian economy. Ecuador, Guatemala, and Indonesia distort prices, reduce competition, and increase the political power of armed forces, posing a threat to economic and political freedom in the developing world. Top-ranking US and international officials recognize the need to reduce world military spending. Congress and the President have made reducing world military spending a goal of US foreign policy. The US government has enacted various measures to promote reductions in military spending through international financial institutions, as part of its foreign policy goals. Despite high-level statements and legal requirements, little progress has been made in reducing military spending through international financial institutions. Despite little progress in establishing mechanisms for regional talks on mutual military reductions and verifying military budgets, Dr. Oscar Arias and 67 citizens' groups have proposed a practical plan to achieve these goals. The Year 2000 Campaign aims to redirect world military spending to human development through 6 proposals, including calling on nations to reduce military threats and expenditures by the year 2000 and appointing special envoys for demilitarization talks. The Year 2000 Campaign proposes demilitarization talks where nations present plans for regional security at reduced force levels and implement mutual force reductions to reduce military threats. Nations also implement economic reforms related to demilitarization with savings from reduced military spending. In support of demilitarization efforts in developing countries, industrialized nations condition aid to promote military conversion, debt forgiveness, funding for demilitarization programs, transparency in military budgets, and ending military involvement in the civilian economy. Arms-exporting nations agree to a Code of Conduct on arms transfers, prohibiting exports to nondemocratic governments and countries engaged in armed conflict. Citizens worldwide are supporting The Arias Peace Pledge and urging governments to redirect military spending to human development. The United Nations General Assembly is set to review a 6-point plan addressing issues such as nondemocratic governments, armed aggression, and human rights violations.
