    "content": "U.S. security sector assistance to foreign countries is primarily funded through foreign affairs and defense budgets. The 115th Congress is considering spending priorities for the upcoming fiscal year, with provisions in the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) appropriations potentially impacting security assistance funding. The Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) are key players in providing such assistance, with other U.S. agencies like USAID, DOE, DHS, DOJ, and Treasury also involved in related programs. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 established foundational authorities for U.S. security assistance programs, overseen by the Secretary of State. These programs include military assistance, international narcotics control, peacekeeping operations, antiterrorism assistance, and nonproliferation and export control assistance. The State Department's authorities are codified in Title 22 of the U.S. Code. Funds for foreign assistance programs are largely appropriated through State Department accounts, covering activities such as arms transfer, training security forces, defense institution reform, and humanitarian assistance. DOD has played a crucial role in implementing security assistance programs, with Congress granting additional authority in the 1980s. In the 1980s, Congress granted DOD authority for various programs funded by DOD appropriations, including counternarcotics, humanitarian assistance, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism. Since 9/11, DOD has prioritized building security partnerships globally, with new authorities granted by Congress for engaging in security cooperation with foreign militaries and security forces. The DOD has expanded its engagements with foreign security forces, playing a significant role in foreign policy decision-making. Congress has granted DOD crisis and wartime authorities, allowing for global engagement and specific geographic operations. This includes training and equipping foreign security forces in counterterrorism, counternarcotics, and defense institution building. DOD's security cooperation authorities were recently modified in the FY2017 NDAA, allowing for various security cooperation activities and logistical support. The expansion of DOD's engagement with foreign partner militaries has policy and budgetary implications, impacting the size and scope of U.S. security assistance activities worldwide. The 115th Congress faces challenges in tracking and comparing security assistance funding between the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Defense (DOD), as DOD lacks comprehensive data on historical funding. This hinders consistent interagency action and terminology in describing security assistance programs. Congressional oversight and funding responsibilities have shifted towards defense authorizers and appropriators, impacting the distribution of security activities. The 115th Congress is scrutinizing security assistance funding, with the Administration seeking to reduce international security assistance by $2.3 billion. Changes proposed include reducing each security assistance program by 9% to over 54% and designating 95% of the Foreign Military Financing program to four countries. Congress is also considering increasing Overseas Contingency Operations funds for defense. The 115th Congress is considering changes to security assistance funding, including a possible increase in Overseas Contingency Operations funds for defense and nondefense purposes in FY2018. There is a potential for a new consolidated budget request for all DOD's security cooperation efforts starting in FY2019. Between FY2006 and FY2016, the US government provided over $204.6 billion in security assistance and cooperation to allied countries abroad. The Department of Defense funded around $115.4 billion for security cooperation activities, while the State Department funded approximately $89.2 billion for security assistance. Funding peaked in FY2011 at $21.6 billion, mainly due to support activities in Afghanistan. Security assistance funding managed by DOS peaked at $9.4 billion in FY2015 for activities in Afghanistan and the Middle East, while DOD funding peaked at $12.8 billion in FY2008 for security in Afghanistan and Iraq. DOD typically obligated a larger portion of overall security cooperation funding compared to DOS, with State obligating nearly half of U.S. security assistance funding in FY2013, FY2014, and FY2016. In FY2016, the top 10 recipients of U.S. security assistance received $7.8 billion, with Israel receiving the largest share at 40%, followed by Egypt at 17%. Pakistan received $533 million in FY2016, a decrease from $1.3 billion in FY2011. In FY2016, the top recipients of U.S. security assistance received $7.8 billion, with Israel receiving 40% and Egypt 17%. The top five DOS/DOD appropriations accounts for security assistance from FY2006 to FY2017 are ASFF, FMF, INCLE, ISFF, and CSF. FMF is the highest-funded account for both years, along with ASFF, INCLE, CSF, and CTPF. DOS and USAID security assistance programs are authorized by FAA and AECA. The State Department and USAID receive security assistance funding from Congress, with some programs administered by the Department of Defense. FMF and INCLE are the largest accounts, representing over 80% of all DOS security assistance in FY2016. In FY2016, Israel and Egypt received 52% of State's security assistance obligations, with FMF providing $3.1 billion to Israel and $1.3 billion to Egypt. DOD security cooperation programs are authorized by Title 10 of the U.S. Code and NDAA provisions, with funding levels not always specified. Accurate accounting of DOD funding levels for security cooperation programs remains a challenge. Accurate accounting of DOD funding levels for security cooperation programs, including counternarcotics support to foreign countries, is challenging. The Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) is the largest security cooperation account, receiving over 50% of funding in most years. Coalition Support Fund (CSF) follows, receiving between 12%-17% of funds. Top recipient countries of DOD security cooperation differ from those of DOS, with Afghanistan being a significant recipient. In FY2016, the top recipients of DOD security cooperation were Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. Data on obligations for counternarcotics support to foreign security forces under DOD's authorities was not available. Terminology for military assistance to foreign countries can be inconsistent, with Security Assistance being a common term used. The term security assistance refers to budget accounts for international security assistance appropriations under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Arms Export Control Act of 1976. On the other hand, security cooperation, as defined in the FY2017 NDAA, involves DOD activities with foreign security establishments to build allied capabilities and provide access during peacetime or contingencies. The Obama Administration issued Presidential Decision Directive 23 (PPD-23) in April 2013 to overhaul U.S. security sector assistance policy and create a new interagency framework. Security sector assistance includes State Department and DOD programs, exercises, and engagements to promote specific U.S. security interests. Challenges exist in identifying funding data for security assistance. The Defense Department lacks consistent planning and budgeting for security cooperation programs at the country level, leading to challenges in comparing security assistance funding with the State Department. This report addresses difficulties in obtaining and analyzing funding information for security sector assistance programs over the past decade. The FY2017 NDAA addressed obstacles in data collection and harmonization for DOD security cooperation programs. Provisions include new mechanisms for oversight and accountability. Starting with the FY2019 budget, the President must submit a consolidated budget request for DOD's security cooperation efforts. DOD is already providing quarterly reports to Congress on some security cooperation funds. Congress may monitor DOD's progress in tracking programs and resources. The Trump Administration proposed changes to security assistance programs in the FY2018 budget, including shifting some foreign military assistance from grants to loans. Congress is exploring the feasibility of this transition, as requested in the Department of State Appropriations Act. The Administration's report on transitioning FMF from grants to loans highlighted potential challenges for recipients, including budget constraints and competition from other countries like China and Russia. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not support the transition due to lack of study. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not support the transition of the FMF program from grants to loans due to lack of study of the Administration's proposal and its unknown impact on U.S. national security interests and foreign countries receiving U.S. security sector assistance. Concerns were raised about the effects of restructuring diplomatic and development aid in the FY2018 budget proposal by the Trump Administration. The reorganization of the State Department and USAID has raised concerns among Members of Congress about predetermined targets and the role of the Office of Management and Budget. Discussions have begun on implementing security cooperation provisions, which officials note will be a lengthy process involving multiple stakeholders. A DOD-State Security Sector Assistance Steering Committee has been established to improve coordination between State Department and DOD security assistance programs, but faces challenges due to differing budget and planning timelines. Discussions are ongoing to address these issues. Discussions are ongoing to bridge the gap between planning and budget timelines for security cooperation activities. Budget planning challenges arise from the lack of a central funding account. Staffing requirements at State Department and DOD are uncertain. Congress may need to evaluate the coordination and approval of security assistance programs. Improving DOS and DOD coordination, cooperation, and data collection is crucial for oversight. The curr_chunk discusses the security assistance programs funded through the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations, specifically the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account. These programs support counternarcotics activities, anticrime programs, anti-human trafficking efforts, and rule of law programs in various countries. The coordination and oversight of these programs are crucial for improved oversight. The NADR account funds State Department-managed activities to counter weapons proliferation, support antiterrorism training, and promote demining operations. DOD may provide defense articles and services for some NADR programs, as well as other support. The PKO account funds programs for international peacekeeping operations, including training and support for foreign militaries. DOD also provides assistance to the Global Peace Operations Initiative. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) receives funding for training, equipping, and supporting foreign military troops and police for U.N. and regional peacekeeping missions. The Department of Defense (DOD) may also provide defense articles and services for other peacekeeping missions. Additionally, the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) provided assistance to countries addressing drug trafficking and economic development issues. International Military Education and Training (IMET) offers financial assistance for training foreign military and civilian personnel on U.S. military practices and standards. IMET provides training and education on U.S. military practices and standards to foreign personnel, including civilian defense personnel. The program was expanded in 1990 to include opportunities for responsible defense resource management. The State Department controls the funds, while DOD administers the program. IMET is authorized by FAA Sections 541-543. The U.S. provides military assistance to friendly foreign countries through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system or Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). The State Department determines which nations receive assistance, while the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) implements the program. The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) was authorized to support Pakistan's security forces in counterinsurgency efforts. The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) was authorized for counterinsurgency efforts. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) provides assistance for military and national security forces, including border security and counterterrorism operations. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) allows the DOD to transfer up to $200 million per fiscal year, with a cap of 80% of project costs. GSCF authority expired on September 30, 2017. It includes programs like the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) and the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund (AIF), providing assistance to Afghan security forces and infrastructure projects. The Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund (AIF) allows the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to develop infrastructure projects in Afghanistan. The authority expired in 2015, but funds from the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) can be used for existing AIF projects. AIF was authorized by the FY2011 NDAA. The Secretary of Defense can also build the capacity of foreign security forces for counterterrorism operations or military support. The Department of Defense (DOD) can authorize foreign countries' security forces to conduct counterterrorism operations through global train and equip activities. This authority was originally established in Section 1206 of the FY2006 NDAA and later codified as 10 U.S.C. 2282 in the FY2015 NDAA. It has now been incorporated into a broader authority, 10 U.S.C. 333, established by Section 1241(c) of the FY2017 NDAA. This includes the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) in Afghanistan for small-scale humanitarian and reconstruction projects. The Combatant Commanders Initiative Fund (CCIF) provides discretionary funding for various activities, including humanitarian relief, reconstruction, force training, joint exercises, and military education for foreign personnel. Up to $10 million per year can be used to sponsor foreign countries' participation in joint exercises.

Up to $10 million per year may be spent to sponsor foreign countries' participation in joint exercises. Additionally, Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) aims to eliminate and secure chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, as well as prevent their proliferation. The FY2017 NDAA authorized $325.6 million for these efforts. The FY2017 NDAA authorized $325.6 million for Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF) activities in U.S. CENTCOM and AFRICOM areas. CTPF supports foreign security forces in conducting counterterrorism and crisis response activities. Funds can be transferred to other accounts for DOD use under existing authority. Section 1510 of FY2016 NDAA authorizes funds appropriation for CTPF. The FY2016 NDAA authorizes funds for the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) to reimburse cooperating countries for support in U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Syria. The CSF has a reimbursement limit of $1.1 billion between October 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, with additional restrictions for Pakistan.
