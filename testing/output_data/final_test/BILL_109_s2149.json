    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Summer Term Education Programs for Upward Performance Act of 2005\" or the \"STEP UP Act of 2005\". Congress finds that all students experience learning losses during the summer, with students on average losing more than 1 month's worth of reading skills and 2 months or more in mathematics. The impact is greatest for children in poverty, with disparities growing as reading scores of disadvantaged students fall more than 3 months behind their middle-class peers. Summer learning losses by children in poverty accumulate over elementary school years, causing them to fall further behind their more advantaged peers. This \"summer slide\" is costly for American education, with 2 months of the school year lost in reteaching and lack of new instruction. Summer learning programs like BELL in Boston, New York, and Washington, DC have shown effectiveness, with students gaining several months' worth of reading and math skills in just 6 weeks. Summer learning programs, like the Teach Baltimore Summer Academy, have been proven to significantly improve students' reading skills by up to 80% of a full grade level over peers who did not attend. These programs help close the achievement gap in education by remedying, reinforcing, and accelerating learning. The Act aims to provide summer learning grants to eligible students to access summer learning, enroll in programs, promote collaboration between teachers and youth professionals, and encourage teachers to try new techniques. The Act defines \"educational service agency\" and \"eligible entity\" as entities that want to participate in a summer learning grant program by providing opportunities to eligible students. Eligible entities include local educational agencies, for-profit educational providers, nonprofit organizations, and summer enrichment camps approved by the State educational agency. The Act allows for various entities to provide summer learning opportunities, including educational service agencies, eligible entities approved by the State educational agency, local educational agencies, and community-based youth development organizations with a proven track record in student learning. The Act allows for different entities to offer summer learning opportunities, including educational service agencies, institutions of higher education, for-profit and nonprofit educational providers, and summer enrichment camps. An eligible student is defined as one who qualifies for free lunch under the National School Lunch Act and is served by a local educational agency. The Act allows various entities to provide summer learning programs for eligible students, including educational service agencies, institutions of higher education, for-profit and nonprofit educational providers, and summer enrichment camps. An eligible student is defined as one who qualifies for free lunch under the National School Lunch Act and is served by a local educational agency. Eligibility for enrollment in the program varies depending on the fiscal year, ranging from kindergarten to grade 3 or kindergarten to grade 5 for the following school year. The terms \"institution of higher education,\" \"local educational agency,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State\" are defined in relation to education laws. The term \"State educational agency\" is defined in relation to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Demonstration Grant Program is outlined in Section 5. The Secretary will award grants to State educational agencies for summer learning programs for eligible students. Each fiscal year, the Secretary will award up to 5 grants. State educational agencies must submit an application identifying areas and local educational agencies for the program. The Secretary will award grants for summer learning programs to State educational agencies, considering an equitable geographic distribution of the grants. The Secretary will award grants for summer learning programs to State educational agencies, ensuring equitable geographic distribution. Each State educational agency receiving a grant under section 5 must use the funds to provide summer learning grants to eligible students who wish to attend a summer learning opportunity. The amount of the grant is $1,600 for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 and $1,800 for fiscal year 2010. The Federal share of each summer learning grant is up to 50%, while the non-Federal share must be at least 50% and come from non-Federal sources. Eligible students who receive grants are called \"summer scholars\". State educational agencies disseminate information on selecting summer learning opportunities. State educational agencies that receive grants must inform families about summer learning opportunities and grants for eligible students. Parents interested in their child participating must submit an application with preferred options. The agency processes applications, determines grant eligibility, and coordinates student assignments. State educational agencies receiving grants must coordinate the assignment of eligible students for summer learning opportunities. If demand exceeds capacity, priority is given to students with low levels of school readiness or randomization is used for assignment. State educational agencies may assign eligible students to summer learning programs in areas served by different local educational agencies. An agreement must be made between the state educational agency and the eligible entity offering the program. The State educational agency will make payments to the eligible entity for a summer scholar, who will receive at least 30 days of instruction in small-group, research-based educational programs. The summer program emphasizes reading and mathematics, aims to improve literacy and numeracy, aligns with school year curriculum standards, and assesses skills with results disaggregated by race. The summer program assesses scholars by race, ethnicity, economic status, English proficiency, and disability to determine impact. It also tracks daily attendance and complies with civil rights laws. State educational agencies make payments based on predetermined amounts for each scholar. State educational agencies reduce funding for summer scholars who do not attend the full program. They are encouraged to allow eligible entities to use school facilities for summer learning opportunities. Eligible entities can request school records for scholars participating in the program. The State educational agency or eligible entity can request school records and previous assessment records for summer scholars. Administrative costs for carrying out the program should not exceed 5 percent of the funding. SEC. 7. EVALUATIONS; REPORT; WEBSITE. For each year of participation, eligible entities must submit a report to the Secretary detailing the activities and outcomes of summer learning opportunities for enrolled scholars, including program design, alignment with State standards, student assessment data, and attendance records. Additionally, the Secretary is required to provide an annual report to Congress on the summer learning grant programs. The Secretary must provide information on successful summer learning programs and best practices on the Department of Education website for parents and school staff. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2007 through 2010."
