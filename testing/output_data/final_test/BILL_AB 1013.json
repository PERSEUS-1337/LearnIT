    "title": "AB 1013",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 25402.1 of the Public Resources Code is amended to require the development of a public domain computer program for estimating energy consumption in buildings by contractors, builders, architects, engineers, and government officials. A fee may be charged for the program based on actual costs. The commission will establish a process for certifying compliance options for new products, materials, and calculation methods. Applicants must provide all necessary information for evaluation. The commission will publish annual certification decisions and guidelines for compliance with building standards. Fees may be charged to cover costs, with funds deposited in the Energy Resources Programs Account. Funds collected as a fee for an application will be deposited in the Energy Resources Programs Account and appropriated to the commission for the purposes of certification. Any remaining funds after the certification process will be returned to the applicant. The commission will provide a prescriptive method for complying with standards, including design aids like a manual, sample calculations, and model structural designs. The commission will conduct a pilot project to test residential buildings and improve the accuracy of a computer program for energy standards. They will collaborate with various stakeholders for funding and support. The Industry Association will coordinate with builders and developers for a pilot project on residential buildings. Public workshops will be held to develop plans and review progress. The commission will submit a report to the Legislature by December 31, 1988, with final results due by June 30, 1990. Recommendations on further monitoring and potential revisions to energy standards will be included in the report. The commission will certify an energy conservation manual within 180 days of approving standards for residential and nonresidential buildings. The manual will include standards, design assistance, suggestions, and a computer program for calculating energy consumption. The commission will approve a public domain computer program for use with adopted or updated standards, ensuring its usability through preliminary tests on residential and nonresidential buildings. The results of these tests will be made publicly available. The commission will establish a technical assistance program for local building departments to enforce energy conservation regulations. This program includes training for officials, development of training programs, preparation of forms and procedures, and review of building plans on a contract basis with fees to cover costs. The building department of every city, county, or city and county enforces energy conservation regulations for residential and nonresidential buildings. Detailed energy system specifications must be reviewed before a building permit is issued. If there is no local building department, the commission enforces the regulations. The commission may enforce energy conservation regulations if a local building department fails to do so, after providing 10 days' notice. Cities, counties, or city and counties can establish fees to cover enforcement costs. The Department of General Services or the relevant state agency must review and certify plans for state building construction to meet minimum standards. Certain sections apply only to new buildings where construction has not started before the effective date of regulations. The enforcement of state or local energy conservation or insulation standards does not apply to buildings where construction has already begun before the effective date of regulations. The enforcement of city or county energy conservation standards for buildings not yet under construction must be cost-effective and approved by the commission. If circumstances change significantly after two years, the city or county must update their determination upon request. The city or county must update and file a new determination that energy conservation standards are cost-effective if requested. The governing body must adopt this determination at a public meeting. If the standards are deemed no longer cost-effective, they become unenforceable, and no building permit can be denied based on noncompliance. The commission may exempt proposed buildings from certain requirements if compliance is impossible without delays and cost increases due to prior expenditures on planning. Disputes over building permit interpretations can be submitted to the commission for binding resolution. The commission shall establish criteria for a statewide home energy rating program for residential dwellings, including consistent ratings, utility bill savings estimates, training for home raters, and quality assurance procedures. Labeling procedures will be established to meet the needs of various stakeholders in the home energy rating program, including home buyers, homeowners, renters, the real estate industry, and mortgage lenders. The program will also include a centralized, publicly accessible database with a uniform reporting system for information on residential dwellings, while ensuring that specific dwelling information is not accessible without permission. The commission will adopt a home energy rating program in consultation with various stakeholders. Home energy rating services must be certified by the commission to comply with program criteria and other applicable elements. The commission will consult with stakeholders to inform the public about the statewide home energy rating program. They will report on the program's progress and evaluate energy savings. The commission will ensure approved energy assessment tools for existing residential dwellings. Ensure energy assessment tools are routinely adjusted for accuracy and provide consumers with a notice explaining assumptions and differences from actual usage patterns."
