The Congress finds that opioids caused over 42,000 deaths in 2016, with 40% involving prescription opioids. The economic burden of prescription opioid misuse is $78.5 billion annually. Over 200 million opioid prescriptions are written each year, leading to 2 million Americans with substance use disorder symptoms. 21-29% of chronic pain patients misuse opioids. Emergency departments in several States have developed innovative programs to utilize non-opioid pain treatments and reduce opioid use. SEC. 3.

The Secretary offers technical support to grant recipients for alternative pain management protocols and treatments, including non-opioid medications and non-medication options for common painful conditions. The grant recipients must provide annual evaluations to the Secretary, detailing the progress of the program funded through the grant, including descriptions of alternative pain management protocols and treatments used.
