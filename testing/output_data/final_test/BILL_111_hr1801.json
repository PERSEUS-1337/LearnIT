The new part in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a tax on excess compensation received by employees of bailout recipients, equal to 70% of amounts exceeding $1,000,000. Exceptions include amounts returned to the employer within 60 days or shares of common stock held until the employer ceases to be a relevant employer. Any amount received before or after the employer's relevant status is excluded from gross income. The provision excludes certain payments from being classified as excess compensation, such as payments made from assets held in trusts or unavailable to general creditors. It also exempts commissions received by commissioned salespersons, defined as those who spend the majority of their time directly selling products to purchasers. The provision defines a \"relevant employer\" as an entity that has received over $500,000,000 from specific acts. It also states that funds put in a trust for employees are considered paid to them. The Stabilization Act of 2008 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 allow employers to receive funds, with the condition that they repay the government in full. The Secretary will provide necessary regulations for this section. The amendments made by this section apply to compensation received after December 31, 2007, in taxable years ending after that date."
