    "content": "Iran's nuclear program began in the 1950s with the construction of the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) in 1960. By the 1970s, Iran aimed to develop a significant nuclear power program, including plans for multiple reactors and significant power production. Despite efforts to show peaceful intentions, such as signing the NPT in 1968, U.S. intelligence reports in the mid-1970s raised concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iran's nuclear program began in the 1950s with the construction of the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) in 1960. By the 1970s, Iran aimed to develop a significant nuclear power program. U.S. intelligence reports in the mid-1970s expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iran cancelled its nuclear program after the 1979 revolution but reinstated it in 1982. Tehran conducted experiments related to uranium conversion, heavy-water production, and nuclear reactor fuel fabrication during the 1980s and early 1990s. The report highlighted Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability, with estimates ranging from a decade to the late 1990s for potential weapon production. Despite limited success, Iran was believed to be continuing efforts to expand its nuclear capabilities for weapon development. Iran abandoned efforts to expand nuclear capabilities for weapons development, seeking fissile material from the former Soviet Union. Iranian agents tried to acquire nuclear materials from Kazakhstan and Turkey in the 1990s. Iran planned to expand its nuclear program. Iran plans to expand its nuclear power program to reduce oil and gas consumption and export more fossil fuels. They have begun operating the Bushehr reactor and aim to build more reactors to generate 20,000 megawatts of power in the next 20 years. The 2015 JCPOA agreement requires Iran to refrain from building heavy-water-moderated reactors for 15 years. Iran has pledged to indefinitely avoid constructing such reactors and is working on its first indigenously produced light-water reactor at Darkhovin. Iran and France agreed to construct a reactor in the 1970s, but the project was halted after the 1979 revolution in Iran. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization President mentioned signing a contract for designing a new reactor, emphasizing its peaceful purposes. The distinction between a peaceful nuclear program and a weapons program is challenging due to dual-use technology. The US and other governments had concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions before the JCPOA agreement. Some countries developing nuclear fuel capability may have intentions to acquire nuclear weapons. Past nuclear programs like France, Sweden, and Switzerland show this dual-purpose approach. Generating nuclear energy can lead to plutonium production for weapons. Iran's nuclear program has raised proliferation concerns due to its gas centrifuge uranium-enrichment facilities, which can produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. The program is also supported by a uranium-conversion facility, currently constrained by the JCPOA. German Minister of State Niels Annen highlighted these concerns in a speech on February 19, 2019. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ordered the AEOI to resume enrichment at the industrial level without any limit following the US withdrawal from the JCPOA. Iran claims it can quickly reconstitute its fissile material production capability, although it has adhered to JCPOA limits. Iran states it wants to produce LEU fuel for its nuclear power reactors. Iran wants to produce LEU fuel for its nuclear power reactors and research reactors for medical isotopes. President Rouhani ordered AEOI President Salehi to design a nuclear-propulsion system for maritime transportation. Iran informed the IAEA of its decision to construct naval nuclear propulsion in the future. Iran informed the IAEA of the government's decision to construct naval nuclear propulsion in the future. Tehran clarified that no nuclear facility would be involved for the first five years and that nuclear-fueled engines/reactors would be used for civilian purposes. Salehi mentioned that the project would take at least 15 years to complete. The reactor being constructed at Arak, moderated by heavy water, has raised concerns due to its potential for producing plutonium suitable for nuclear weapons. Iran has rendered the Arak reactor's original core inoperable pursuant to the JCPOA, committing to redesign and rebuild it based on an agreed design. Iran's inconsistent cooperation with the IAEA has raised suspicions of a nuclear weapons program, with past actions including concealing nuclear activities and providing misleading statements. In a 2008 interview, the IAEA expressed concerns about Iran's lack of cooperation in providing access to individuals and documents related to their nuclear program. While there is no definitive proof of Iran building a nuclear bomb, there are suspicions and unanswered questions regarding the possible military dimension of their program. Director-General Yukiya Amano clarified in a 2012 interview that the IAEA did not claim Iran had made a decision to obtain nuclear weapons. Iran has implemented restrictions on its nuclear program and provided information to the IAEA. A work plan was agreed upon in 2007 to clarify outstanding questions. Iran also has programs for developing ballistic and cruise missiles. The public controversy over Iran's nuclear program began in 2002. The public controversy over Iran's nuclear program began in August 2002 when the National Council of Resistance on Iran revealed Iran's undisclosed nuclear facilities at Natanz and Arak. Iran ratified the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1970 and concluded a safeguards agreement with the IAEA in 1974. The IAEA's ability to detect nuclear material diversion and undeclared activities is limited to declared facilities. Additional Protocols enhance the agency's authority to inspect and investigate clandestine nuclear activities. Noncompliance cases are referred to the UN Security Council. The IAEA expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear programs and urged cooperation in investigations. In 2003, the IAEA called on Tehran to increase cooperation and suspend uranium enrichment activities. President Rouhani identified the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran as the authority in charge. President Rouhani identified the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) as the authority handling political and technical issues regarding the IAEA's investigation of Iran's nuclear program. The Supreme Nuclear Committee was formed after the June 2003 IAEA board meeting, with Rouhani leading negotiations on Iran's nuclear program. Despite perceptions of complete prerogatives, the nuclear team had to discuss every issue before making decisions. In October 2003, Iran reached an agreement with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to suspend enrichment activities and comply with IAEA safeguards. Despite U.S. pressure, the IAEA board decided against referring the matter to the U.N. Security Council. Iranian officials feared potential military action by the U.S. if the issue was escalated. During negotiations between fall 2003 and summer 2005, Iran and the E3 offered proposals but never reached agreement. Iran engaged in clandestine nuclear activities violating safeguards, including plutonium separation and uranium experiments. The government was depicted as deeply divided. During the 2003-2005 negotiations, Iranian officials were divided over diplomatic approaches to the nuclear program. President Rouhani mentioned opposition within the government to the diplomatic track, leading to the Supreme National Security Council taking charge of diplomacy. The Foreign Ministry faced challenges in handling the nuclear issue due to disagreements with the Atomic Energy Organization. Delegating responsibility to the Supreme National Security Council aimed to create consensus and prevent friction between government agencies. Iran resumed uranium conversion in 2005 under President Ahmadinejad's leadership. In 2005, Iran was found in noncompliance with its IAEA safeguards agreement. Despite not being referred to the Security Council initially, Iran resumed centrifuge research in 2006. This led to the IAEA referring Iran to the Security Council, prompting Iran to stop implementing its Additional Protocol. The U.N. Security Council issued non-binding statements and adopted six resolutions regarding Iran's nuclear program. The UN Security Council issued six resolutions (1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, 1835, 1929) regarding Iran's nuclear program, imposing restrictions and requiring cooperation with IAEA investigations. Resolution 1929 also demanded Iran to refrain from activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Iran engaged in talks with the P5+1 countries to address these concerns. Iran's nuclear negotiations were conducted by Saeed Jalili, then-head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, and later delegated to the Foreign Ministry by President Rouhani. The AEOI handled Tehran's negotiations with the IAEA, while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i made final decisions on Iran's diplomacy regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Wendy Sherman emphasized Khamene'i's pivotal role in deciding whether Iran would agree to a comprehensive nuclear deal. The Supreme Leader retained control over Iran's nuclear program decisions after Rouhani's election in 2013. Iran and the P5+1 reached the Joint Plan of Action in November 2013, imposing limitations on Iran's nuclear activities and aiming for a long-term solution to international concerns. The P5+1 and Iran implemented the Joint Plan of Action in 2014, leading to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015. The JCPOA was finalized in 2015 and implemented in 2016, terminating previous Security Council resolutions. President Trump withdrew the US from the JCPOA in 2018, leading to the reimposition of sanctions. Other P5+1 countries reaffirmed their commitment to the JCPOA. President Rouhani pledges to uphold the JCPOA as long as Iran receives economic benefits. The IAEA began investigating Iran's nuclear program in 2002, with most issues resolved by 2008. However, one major issue remains unresolved. The IAEA raised concerns about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program in 2008. Documents suggested Iranian entities may have conducted studies related to nuclear weapons development, including uranium conversion and missile reentry vehicles. Iranian officials denied the authenticity of the documents, but the IAEA expressed enough concern to warrant further investigation. Iranian officials acknowledged some accuracy in documents related to possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program, arguing activities were for nonnuclear purposes. Tehran provided some information to the IAEA, but more substantive responses were requested. IAEA Director-General Amano reported in 2011 that Iran had not engaged with the agency on alleged studies since 2008, despite detailed evidence provided. The IAEA has credible information that Iran has engaged in activities relevant to developing a nuclear weapon, including acquiring nuclear weapons information, testing weapon components, and procuring nuclear-related equipment. These activities, some of which have civilian applications, were mostly conducted before 2003. The Board of Governors adopted a resolution in 2011 urging Iran and the IAEA to intensify dialogue on resolving outstanding issues related to Iran's nuclear program. Meetings between the IAEA and Iranian officials took place from 2012 to 2013, leading to a new approach in October 2013. A joint statement signed in November 2013 outlined a \"Framework for Cooperation\" to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. Tehran provided information to the IAEA on outstanding issues, including research on high explosives and neutron transport. The July 2015 JCPOA required Tehran to complete steps outlined in a roadmap with the IAEA to address past and present issues related to Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA, in cooperation with Iran, assessed possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program. A report to the IAEA Board of Governors confirmed that all activities in the roadmap were completed as scheduled. The board adopted a resolution acknowledging Iran's cooperation and closing the consideration of outstanding issues. Implementation Day has been verified, shifting the focus away from past compliance issues. The IAEA is monitoring Iran's JCPOA implementation in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Quarterly reports are issued on Iran's commitments under the JCPOA, with the Director General reporting any concerns to the Board of Governors and Security Council. Parchin, an Iranian military site, is under investigation for possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA requested Tehran's response to information about activity at the military site Parchin related to nuclear weapons development. Iran delayed access to a building at the site until 2015, where verification activities were conducted, but no explosives chamber was observed. Iranian officials delayed IAEA access to a building at the Parchin military site, claiming it was used for chemical material storage. Efforts to remove evidence of past nuclear activities at the site undermined verification efforts. The government's refusal to allow post-2005 access was attributed to Defense Ministry resistance. Iranian officials resisted IAEA access to Parchin post-2005, citing Defense Ministry opposition. Internal debates within Iran, including strong political opposition, delayed inspections at the military site. Despite cooperation in other areas, Iran's stance on Parchin inspections remained contentious. The IAEA verified Iran's declared nuclear facilities were not diverted for military purposes, but Iran's cooperation was inconsistent. Additional access to locations related to centrifuge manufacturing and uranium enrichment was requested by the IAEA in 2008. Full Iranian cooperation with the IAEA was emphasized in a report by ElBaradei in February 2008. The February 2008 report highlighted the need for full Iranian cooperation with the IAEA investigation and implementation of the Additional Protocol to ensure confidence in the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. The Agency cannot provide credible assurances about the absence of undeclared nuclear material without clarity on alleged studies and the Additional Protocol's implementation. Iran was also asked to reconsider its decision to stop complying with certain IAEA arrangements in March 2007. Iran's decision in March 2007 to stop complying with a portion of its IAEA safeguards agreement, specifically code 3.1, required Tehran to provide design information for new nuclear facilities. Iran invoked this decision when it withheld preliminary design information for the Darkhovin reactor until September 2009, despite the IAEA's request in December 2007. Additional clarifications were requested by the IAEA in September 2010. Iran refused to provide updated design information for the Arak reactor, impacting the IAEA's verification ability. Iran later submitted the information in February 2014 and committed to redesign the reactor as per the JCPOA. The original core of the reactor has been rendered inoperable. Iran also denied IAEA officials access to inspect the Arak reactor, which was highlighted as a concern by ElBaradei in a report to the IAEA board in June 2009. Iran's refusal to provide updated design information for the Arak reactor in June 2009 impacted the IAEA's verification ability. Satellite imagery was deemed insufficient as Iran had completed the containment structure over the reactor building. IAEA inspectors visited the reactor facility in August 2009 to verify design information. Additionally, Iran failed to notify the IAEA until September 2009 about the construction of the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant near Qom. Iran notified the IAEA about the Fordow enrichment facility in September 2009, after British, French, and U.S. officials had already developed intelligence on it. Despite Iran's letter, U.S. officials believe Iran intended to keep the facility secret. Tehran placed the facility under IAEA safeguards and is now converting it into a nuclear, physics, and technology center with no nuclear material. The IAEA requested additional information about the facility in October 2009. The IAEA requested further information from Tehran regarding the Fordow enrichment facility, including its name, location, construction status, and plans for nuclear material introduction. Tehran granted access to IAEA inspectors in late October 2009, allowing them to inspect all areas of the facility. However, the IAEA still had questions about the facility's purpose and chronology, and sought to interview other Iranian officials and review additional documentation. The IAEA requested more information from Iran regarding the Fordow enrichment facility. Amano reported in 2012 that Iran provided some requested information but more was needed. Tehran has not yet provided all the information requested. The IAEA also asked for details on Iran's heavy water production for a nuclear reactor. Inspectors observed drums of heavy water at a facility in 2009. Inspectors discovered drums of heavy water in an Iranian facility in August 2009. Tehran initially restricted access to the water but later allowed inspections and sampling. Iran also granted access to its heavy-water production plant in December 2013 after denying repeated requests since 2011. The IAEA resolved a discrepancy in material amounts at an Iranian research laboratory in August 2011. Measurements revealed Iran overstated material in a facility by almost 20 kilograms, resolved in 2013. Concerns exist that Iran could obtain fissile material from foreign sources, as stated in a 2007 NIE. Tehran's potential to produce its own fissile material is a greater concern. Iran's nuclear program froze during negotiations leading up to the JPA in 2013. Iran had enough uranium for potential weapons-grade HEU for up to eight nuclear weapons. Iran had enough uranium for potential weapons-grade HEU for up to eight nuclear weapons. Pursuant to the JCPOA, Iran has restricted and/or dismantled various portions of its nuclear program, currently lacking enough low-enriched uranium hexafluoride to produce a nuclear weapon. Iran imports items for its nuclear program through a JCPOA-established \"procurement channel\" overseen by a Procurement Working Group and the UN Security Council. The JCPOA requires Iran to provide the IAEA with access to the locations of intended use of all nuclear-related items. Iran has used three centrifuge facilities to enrich uranium: a pilot centrifuge facility and a larger commercial facility, both located at Natanz, and the Fordow centrifuge facility located near the city of Qom. Iran also has various facilities and workshops involved in its nuclear program. Iran has a facility near Qom for centrifuge production and enrichment. Former officials planned to install 50,000 centrifuges by 2015, with uranium enrichment starting in 2007. As of 2013, the facility had produced 10,357 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. Iran's facility near Qom produced uranium hexafluoride with up to 5% uranium-235, enough for eight nuclear weapons if further enriched. By October 31, 2015, 15,525 kilograms were produced, but only 8,305 kilograms remained as the rest was converted. Tehran had installed 15,400 IR-1 centrifuges by May 17, 2015, with 9,150 enriching uranium. Additionally, 1,000 IR-2m centrifuges were installed but not enriching uranium. Iran had 5,060 IR-1 centrifuges in February 2017 as part of its JCPOA commitments. Iran reported in February 2017 that, as part of its JCPOA commitments, it had 5,060 IR-1 centrifuges installed in the facility and had removed all other centrifuges. Iran had been producing enriched uranium hexafluoride not exceeding 3.67% uranium-235 and shipped most of its LEU to Russia in December 2015 to reduce its stockpile. Iran's total stockpile of enriched uranium has not exceeded 300 kilograms since implementing the JCPOA. Iran began enriching uranium up to 20% uranium-235 in the Natanz pilot facility in February 2010 for use in the Tehran Research Reactor. Iran converted its reactor to use LEU fuel in 1994 after an agreement with Argentina. Fereydun Abbasi-Davani mentioned in a 2012 interview Iran's plan to produce enriched uranium with 3.5% uranium-235. Tehran has tested advanced centrifuges in a pilot facility to increase capacity, but development has been less successful than the IR-1 centrifuge. Compliance with JCPOA limits on centrifuge research has been observed. The 2012 report from a U.N. panel of experts highlighted that sanctions limited Tehran's ability to advance its centrifuge program. The JCPOA outlines specific guidelines for Iran's centrifuge research and development, restricting it to certain facilities. Iran began enriching uranium up to 20% at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant in December 2011, as reported by the IAEA. Iran enriched uranium up to 20% uranium-235 in the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, with plans to install more centrifuges. They agreed to convert the facility into a nuclear, physics, and technology center, removing all nuclear material. Iran decreased the number of IR-1 centrifuges to 1,044 and removed all nuclear material from the facility. Iran also modified two cascades for stable isotope production for medical and industrial uses. The facility was revealed in September 2009, with evidence suggesting it was intended for enriching uranium. The facility is located in an underground tunnel complex on the grounds of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps base. The underground tunnel complex near Qom, Iran, managed by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, raised concerns about its purpose for nuclear weapons. The IAEA requested more information on the facility's construction timeline, with U.S. officials questioning its peaceful intent. President Obama noted the facility's size and configuration were inconsistent with a peaceful program. The Fordow facility in Iran raised concerns about its potential for nuclear weapons production. Despite vague statements from the Administration, it was noted that the facility could be used for centrifuge research and development or to produce weapons-grade uranium. Iran's failure to disclose the facility's existence promptly led to doubts about the presence of other covert nuclear facilities in the country. The Fordow facility in Iran, initially kept secret from the IAEA, raised concerns about potential nuclear weapons production. Tehran's shifting explanations about the facility's purpose and its capability to produce uranium enriched to different levels further heightened suspicions. Iran's Fordow facility, initially concealed from the IAEA, raised concerns about potential nuclear weapons production. Iran claimed the facility was for peaceful purposes, producing enriched uranium for research reactors and medical isotopes. Tehran argued the secrecy was to protect the facility from military attacks. Iran's Fordow facility, revealed in 2009 as a contingency enrichment plant, was not a military base and produced nearly 20% enriched uranium for research reactors. By January 2014, Iran had produced 447.8 kilograms of uranium hexafluoride at Natanz and Fordow, causing concern due to the proximity to weapons-grade HEU production. Iran would need approximately 215 kilograms of uranium hexafluoride containing 20% uranium-235 to produce approximately 27.8 kilograms of uranium containing 90% uranium-235\u2014a sufficient amount of weapons-grade HEU for a nuclear weapon. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper suggested that \"a number of factors\" could impede Tehran's ability to produce weapons-grade HEU from uranium enriched to 20% uranium-235. As of January 20, 2014, approximately 160 kilograms of the LEU described above was in the form of uranium hexafluoride and, therefore, available for use. Iran had a stockpile of uranium hexafluoride, which was either converted for use in the Tehran Research Reactor or diluted to contain no more than 5% uranium-235. AEOI spokesperson mentioned having fuel reserves for 5 years. Plans to construct 10 additional centrifuge plants were considered unachievable. Iran aims to increase its enrichment capacity by 20-fold in the next 15 years, as outlined in the JCPOA. The agreement allows for gradual evolution of Iran's enrichment program, with centrifuge-testing under strict limits for the first eight years. Iran plans to produce enough enriched uranium to fuel its nuclear program. Iran plans to increase its enrichment capacity by 20-fold in the next 15 years, aiming to produce enough enriched uranium for multiple nuclear reactors. Iran has begun the process of manufacturing critical components for centrifuges and has completed building a centrifuge assembly center in the Natanz facility. This facility provides Iran with the capability to mass-produce centrifuges if needed in the future. Iran's progress in operating centrifuges to produce enriched uranium has been inconsistent. While there was a significant improvement in 2008, data from 2015 show fluctuating performance. The sustainability of Iran's progress remains uncertain. Iran's progress in operating centrifuges to produce enriched uranium has been inconsistent. Former Pakistani nuclear official Abdul Qadeer Khan described Pakistan's first-generation centrifuges as \"unsuccessful\" in a 1998 interview. Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies noted that it can take years to determine the success of an enrichment program, citing examples of centrifuge failures in Japan. Despite challenges faced by Iran in developing advanced centrifuges, historical experience suggests that sustained operation of gas centrifuges is manageable. Some centrifuges with simple designs have operated for 30 years with a failure rate of less than one percent. Iran produced 541 metric tons of uranium hexafluoride between 2004 and 2009, using imported and domestically produced uranium ore concentrate. Despite not producing uranium hexafluoride since 2009, Iran has an ample supply for enrichment. In 2018, Iran announced the resumption of conversion operations. Iran resumed operations at the conversion facility in 2018 after almost exhausting its supply of imported uranium ore concentrate. There were concerns about Iran seeking new sources of uranium ore, but no confirmed cases of actual transfers were reported. British officials were not aware of any recent attempts by Iran to purchase foreign uranium. In late 2015, Iran imported uranium ore concentrate to reduce its stockpile to JCPOA-required levels. The IAEA verified the receipt of approximately 125 metric tons in February 2017. Iranian officials stated they imported 382-384 metric tons since the JCPOA. This material is intended for the Bushehr reactors. Iran improved its ability to produce centrifuge feedstock for reactor fuel before 2009. Iran's ability to produce feedstock for weapons-grade HEU is unclear. Iran conducted plutonium-separation experiments in 2003, raising suspicions of a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA resolved questions about Iran's plutonium activities in 2007. Iran stated it does not plan to engage in reprocessing, with no ongoing reprocessing activities confirmed by the IAEA in 2015. Iran has adhered to the JCPOA requirement regarding reprocessing activities at Iranian facilities. Iran's reactor at Arak is intended for medical isotopes production and other purposes, with plans to ship out all spent fuel for further treatment. The new reactor in Iran, designed to replace the Tehran Research Reactor, aims to reduce dependency on foreign countries, produce radioisotopes for medical and industrial use, conduct research in various fields, train specialists in the nuclear industry, and enhance local technological levels. Iran's new reactor, intended to replace the Tehran Research Reactor, is being constructed with various components like reactor vessels, heat exchangers, and pumps following nuclear standards. The original Arak reactor, a proliferation concern, was suspended in 2013 under the Joint Plan of Action. If completed, it could have produced enough plutonium for one to two nuclear weapons annually, making Iran independent of enriched uranium supplies. The JCPOA mandates rendering the Arak reactor's original core inoperable. Iran has met the JCPOA requirement to render the Arak reactor's original core inoperable and is redesigning it to prevent weapons-grade plutonium production. China will supply the reactor's first fuel load within five years. Iran will export spent fuel and refrain from building heavy-water-moderated reactors for 15 years. Iran began operating its heavy-water production plant near Arak in August 2006. Iran began operating its heavy-water production plant near Arak in August 2006. Pursuant to the JCPOA, Tehran committed to selling any excess heavy water on the international market for 15 years. Iran's stock of heavy water exceeded 130 metric tons twice since the JCPOA began implementation. Iran's stock of heavy water exceeded 130 metric tons twice since the JCPOA began implementation. Iran resolved the issue by exporting the excess heavy water to Russia, the United States, and other international buyers. The IAEA verified on February 16, 2019, that Iran had 122.8 metric tons of heavy water. Iran has 122.8 metric tons of heavy water and operates a 1,000-megawatt nuclear power reactor near Bushehr, originally constructed by a German contractor in 1975. Russia took over the project in 1995, with delays attributed to technical issues. Fuel for the reactor was supplied by Russia for 10 years starting in 2007, with the last shipment in January 2008 containing no more than 3.62% uranium-235 under IAEA seal. The United States had concerns about the Iranian nuclear reactor project, but in 2005, a deal was made requiring Iran to return spent nuclear fuel to Russia to prevent plutonium separation. Moscow argued that the reactor would not pose a proliferation risk under IAEA safeguards. Light-water reactors are considered more proliferation-resistant. Iran's nuclear reactor project faced restrictions on nuclear-related goods supply, but allowed for the export of equipment and fuel for light-water reactors. Doubts exist about Iran's ability to produce fuel for the reactor, with talks of cooperative arrangements for domestic manufacturing. Plans for a second power reactor at the Bushehr plant are in progress, with hopes for operation within six years. Iran and Russia signed a contract in November 2014 for the construction of two additional light-water nuclear power reactors in Bushehr. Construction began in September 2016 and is expected to take 10 years to complete. Iran is also negotiating with China for the construction of two 100-megawatt power plants. Additionally, Iran informed the IAEA in October 2017 about plans to design and construct a critical facility for research purposes in the near future. Iran provided design information for a fuel manufacturing plant intended for the Arak and Darkhovin reactors, producing fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor. Iran has uranium mines and mills at Bandar Abbas, Saghand, and Ardakan. Tehran plans to construct more mills as uranium deposits are insufficient for its nuclear power program. Iran has uranium reserves sufficient for its nuclear weapons program, with ongoing exploration efforts. Sanctions and sabotage have been used to hinder Iran's nuclear program. Iran aims to enhance its centrifuge program capabilities, claiming self-sufficiency in manufacturing centrifuges. However, the quality of Iranian-produced equipment is uncertain. Iranian officials admit limitations in domestic production of centrifuge components and acknowledge the need to procure items from other countries for their nuclear program. Despite efforts to enhance self-sufficiency, Iran still relies on external sources for some equipment. Since mid-2013, there has been a decrease in Iranian attempts to procure items for prohibited programs, as reported by governments to a panel. International sanctions have made it difficult for Iran to obtain components for its centrifuge program, slowing its development. International sanctions have slowed Iran's prohibited nuclear program by impeding its ability to procure critical items from abroad. U.S. and UK officials have noted the effectiveness of sanctions in hindering Iran's acquisition of technology for its nuclear activities. International sanctions have slowed Iran's prohibited nuclear program by impeding its ability to procure critical items from abroad. Former officials have cited mistakes, difficulties in Iran, and delays in deploying advanced centrifuges as obstacles to the program's progress. Reports indicate that some obstacles slowed the progress of Iran's nuclear program during certain years, but specific details were not provided. The report did not specify the obstacles hindering Iran's nuclear program. Efforts by the US and other governments to sabotage Iran's centrifuge program have unclear effects. Sabotage attempts included undermining electrical and computer systems, causing centrifuges to explode. Western governments have also tried to sabotage centrifuge components destined for Iran. Iranian officials claim Western countries tampered with components in transit and directly sabotaged enrichment facilities. The United States and Israel have engaged in covert operations, cyberattacks, and assassinations targeting Iran's nuclear program. The Stuxnet computer worm, developed in 2010, was used to attack Iran's enrichment facilities. The U.S. intelligence community believes Iran has the technical capability to produce nuclear weapons. The U.S. intelligence community believes Iran has the technical capability to produce nuclear weapons, as stated in the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate and confirmed by then-Director of National Intelligence Clapper in 2016. Iran is enriching uranium, but it is unclear if they have taken all necessary steps to produce a nuclear weapon. The IAEA has limited information on Iran's nuclear weapon design and manufacture capabilities. The IAEA has credible information that Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device, including acquiring nuclear weapons development information and working on an indigenous design of a nuclear weapon. These activities have both civilian and specific nuclear weapons applications, with the program aimed at developing a nuclear warhead for the Shahab-3 missile. The program aimed to develop a nuclear warhead for the Shahab-3 missile, with extensive evidence of past and ongoing Iranian nuclear weapons-related research. Iranian activities were structured before 2003 but abruptly halted following a senior Iranian officials' order. Iran's nuclear activities were consolidated under the \"AMAD Plan\" during 2002 and 2003. However, there are indications that some activities related to nuclear weapons development continued after 2003. Iran established the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND) in 2011, which took over some activities from Iran's undeclared nuclear program. The SPND was created to preserve the technological ability and skills of Iranian scientists in the field of nuclear weapons research. The SPND was established in 2011 to retain the skills of Iranian scientists in nuclear weapons research. A report indicated Iran had not restarted its nuclear weapons program, but had conducted activities relevant to nuclear weapons development before 2003. Some activities continued after 2003, but were not coordinated efforts. The report found that activities related to nuclear weapons development in Iran took place after 2003, but were not part of a coordinated effort. The IAEA has no credible indications of such activities after 2009. Iran presented a written assessment of the report in January 2016, acknowledging scientific studies of dual-use technologies for peaceful purposes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disclosed documents regarding Iran's past nuclear weapons program, reaffirming the IAEA's conclusion. U.S. officials expressed concerns about Iran's retention of the archive and urged Iran to end its efforts to conceal past nuclear weapons work. The United States urges Iran to address its past nuclear weapons activities and cooperate with the IAEA's assessment of the nuclear archive materials. Reports suggest Iran has the capability to produce a nuclear device based on HEU. The 2009 IAEA document compiled various unverified intelligence information on Iran's nuclear activities. The U.S. government believes Iran has not mastered all necessary technologies for a nuclear weapon, but acknowledges advancements in their capabilities since 2003. Iran has shown some advancement in developing nuclear weapons, but the activity appears uncoordinated and sporadic. Director Clapper mentioned that Iran has not yet completed certain steps to develop a nuclear weapon. Ambassador Mull stated that a portion of the Iranian Government is systematically working on nuclear weapon capabilities. Amano's report from November 2011 mentioned Iran's involvement in a clandestine nuclear supply network. Iran received nuclear explosive design information from Abdul Qadeer Khan's supply network, but it may not be enough to build a nuclear weapon. The documents provided to Libya lacked important parts for weapon production. Computer files with designs for advanced nuclear weapons were also found, but they were not complete sets. The JCPOA prohibits activities that could aid in weapon design and development. The JCPOA indefinitely prohibits activities that could aid in the design and development of a nuclear weapon in Iran. The U.S. government assesses that Tehran has not mastered all necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon. Iran is also restricted from producing or acquiring plutonium or uranium metals for 15 years. Producing uranium or plutonium metals is a crucial step in nuclear weapons production. Acquisition of fissile material remains a key factor in Iran's timeline for developing a nuclear device. Iran's production of a \"nuclear device\" is assessed to be unlikely before 2013, with the possibility of delay until after 2015. The benchmark for weapons-grade HEU is 27.8 kilograms of uranium containing 90% uranium-235. The U.S. government estimates the amount of HEU needed for a nuclear weapon is unclear. Tehran would likely need to produce more uranium-235 for its first nuclear weapon. According to reports, the time to complete an Iranian nuclear device could shrink over time. If Iran decides to build a nuclear weapon, it could take about a year to produce a bomb and another one to two years to deliver it. The United States estimated that Iran's Fordow enrichment facility could produce one weapon's worth of HEU per year. Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman stated Iran would need one year to produce a nuclear weapon if the decision was made. Iran's JCPOA-mandated shipment of LEU to Russia extended this timeline to one year, according to Director of National Intelligence Clapper. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats reaffirmed this assessment. The U.S. estimates suggest Iran could produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon at covert facilities, not declared sites. Iran would likely avoid using safeguarded facilities to avoid detection by the IAEA. IAEA would likely detect an Iranian attempt to produce weapons-grade HEU. Former officials believe that Iran is unlikely to quickly develop a nuclear bomb as IAEA inspectors would probably detect any efforts to divert nuclear material. Former Deputy Director-General Heinonen stated that Iran would likely be caught if it tried to divert significant amounts of nuclear material from its safeguarded facilities. It would be challenging for Iran to reconfigure its facilities without detection. The JCPOA has enhanced transparency of Iran's nuclear activities, making it easier for the international community to detect changes in Iran's declared nuclear facilities. Although Iran could potentially eject IAEA inspectors or withdraw from the NPT, it would be a risky and provocative move due to the inefficiency of its first-generation centrifuges. This action would be virtually unprecedented. Iran's nuclear activities have been closely monitored since the JCPOA, increasing transparency. Despite concerns about potential covert facilities, U.S. officials express confidence in their ability to detect any undisclosed nuclear sites in Iran. Iran is developing ballistic missiles that could potentially deliver nuclear weapons, but U.S. intelligence remains confident in detecting covert Iranian nuclear facilities. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair stated that Iran's missile developments do not necessarily indicate a pursuit of nuclear weapons. British officials also mentioned the development of missiles and space launch vehicles by Iran for various purposes. Iran's nuclear program raises concerns due to Tehran's secrecy, lack of full cooperation with the IAEA, and questionable need for nuclear power given its oil and gas reserves. The resumption of the program during the war with Iraq also raises doubts about its energy rationale. Iran's nuclear program raises concerns due to Tehran's secrecy, lack of full cooperation with the IAEA, and questionable need for nuclear power given its oil and gas reserves. Many countries purchase nuclear fuel from foreign suppliers, raising doubts about Iran's need for indigenous enrichment capability. Iran lacks sufficient uranium deposits for its planned nuclear power program, and experts question the necessity of the Arak reactor for producing medical isotopes. The TRR is capable of producing isotopes and has unused capacity, making the need for a new heavy-water reactor unnecessary. Iran has rendered the Arak reactor's original core inoperable pursuant to the JCPOA. Iran has rendered the Arak reactor's original core inoperable pursuant to the JCPOA, committing to redesign and rebuild it for peaceful nuclear purposes. Tehran plans to expand nuclear power for electricity generation due to difficulties in exporting oil and gas without foreign investment in energy infrastructure. Iran argues that its covert nuclear procurement was necessary to counter Western denial of technology, supported by a 1997 CIA report. Tehran cannot rely on foreign suppliers for nuclear fuel due to past unreliability. Iran's inability to obtain nuclear fuel from Eurodif, AEOI President Aghazadeh's argument for completing the Natanz facility, and evidence suggesting Iran may not have had an active nuclear weapons program after 2003. The IAEA has resolved outstanding issues with Iran and Tehran has been willing to disclose previously undeclared nuclear activities. Iran made significant changes to its nuclear program in 2003, increasing transparency with the IAEA and possibly indicating a halt to a nuclear weapons program. Iranian officials have repeatedly stated they are not pursuing nuclear weapons, citing religious reasons, including a fatwa issued by Khamene'i. This religious decree serves as operational guidance for Iran's government, with officials reaffirming in 2019 that Iran has no intention of developing atomic bombs. Iran has no intention of making an atomic bomb, citing religious reasons and arguing that nuclear weapons would not enhance its security. The 2003 invasion of Iraq may have also influenced Iran's decision not to pursue nuclear weapons. Iran has implemented its JCPOA commitments, including significant limits on its nuclear program and transparency requirements. U.S. officials argue that the Iranian nuclear program poses a less severe proliferation threat, with limitations effectively cutting off pathways to nuclear weapons. U.S. intelligence assessments since 2007 suggest Iran has not decided to develop nuclear weapons. The 2007 NIE reported that Iranian military entities were developing nuclear weapons until fall 2003, when Iran halted its program in response to international pressure. The NIE assessed that Iran is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons, but there are intelligence gaps regarding the complete halt of Iran's nuclear weapons program. Since 2003, Iran has been conducting research and development projects related to nuclear weapons. The 2007 NIE reported that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 due to international pressure. Recent assessments suggest Tehran is less determined to develop nuclear weapons. New information led to a change in assessments, including communications indicating the program had been halted. The 2007 NIE reported that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 due to international pressure. Recent assessments suggest Tehran is less determined to develop nuclear weapons. The United States obtained information from Iranian officials who defected and through penetration of Iran's computer networks. The NIE incorporated open-source information, assessing with moderate-to-high confidence that Iran did not have a nuclear weapon. The U.S. intelligence community reaffirmed that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program but is keeping its options open. The late-September 2009 revelation of the Fordow facility raised suspicions about Iran restarting its nuclear weapons program. U.S. officials indicated the facility may be intended for this purpose, but the intelligence community still assessed that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003. Director of National Intelligence Clapper stated in 2016 that Iran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities is driven by its strategic goals, which will influence its adherence to the JCPOA over time. The U.S. intelligence community continues to assess that Iran is not currently pursuing key nuclear weapons-development activities. Recent statements from officials indicate that Iran has not resumed its nuclear weapons program, and any decision to produce nuclear weapons will be made by the Supreme Leader. The IAEA report from November 2011 supports the assessment that Iranian activities related to building a nuclear explosive device were halted in 2003. The IAEA report from November 2011 supports the assessment that Iranian activities related to building a nuclear explosive device were halted in late 2003. Amano's report mentions indications of ongoing weapons-related research activities post-2003, with an organizational structure in place before the end of 2003. The IAEA report from November 2011 indicates that Iranian nuclear weapons-related activities were halted in late 2003. However, some activities took place after 2003, but were not part of a coordinated effort. The report also states that there are no credible indications of Iran developing a nuclear explosive device after 2009. Foreign intelligence agencies, including the French General Directorate of External Security, are unsure of Iran's intentions regarding nuclear weapons development. In 2012, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman confirmed reports of Israeli intelligence sharing the U.S. assessment on Iran's nuclear program. A 2012 Israeli intelligence report stated that Iran had a nuclear weapons program until 2003 for research and development purposes, but had not restarted it. German intelligence assessments also supported this view. The February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review raised concerns about Iran's long-range ballistic missile capabilities and aggressive activities destabilizing neighboring governments, questioning its commitment to forgoing nuclear weapons. National Security Adviser John Bolton expressed confidence in Iran's nuclear intentions during a January 2019 press conference. Bolton stated in a January 6, 2019 press conference that Iran is still committed to achieving nuclear weapons. The 2007 NIE suggests that Iran may develop nuclear weapons in the future, but only if they decide to abandon this objective. The U.S. intelligence community believes Iran has the capacity to produce nuclear weapons at some point, but it is not inevitable. Adherence to the JCPOA is seen as necessary for international confidence that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons. The production of fissile material is a challenging step in nuclear weapons development. Iran would face difficulties in producing nuclear weapons even if it had the ability to produce weapons-grade HEU. Developing a workable physics package and effective delivery vehicles are key challenges. Covert production of HEU-based nuclear weapons would be Tehran's preferred option, but it would face significant challenges. Iran may struggle to complete a covert centrifuge facility without detection, as hiding activities like uranium conversion and movement would be challenging. Importing uranium ore or feedstock covertly is an option, but Tehran's implementation of the JCOA has reduced the likelihood of successfully concealing a nuclear weapons program. Foreign intelligence agencies already possess significant information on Iran's enrichment program, making it harder to keep it hidden. Foreign governments discovered Natanz and Fordow facilities before they were operational. The Stuxnet computer worm suggests foreign governments have detailed knowledge of Iran's centrifuge program. U.S. officials are confident in detecting Iranian covert nuclear facilities. Iran's ability to produce nuclear weapons without explosive tests limits their complexity and deliverability. Detection of such tests is likely, according to analysts. During a 2018 National Assembly hearing, the directorate of the French Atomic Energy Commission discussed monitoring Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. They rely on the international detection system established by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to alert French authorities within 30 minutes of a nuclear test. Iranian officials claim their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i and Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hassan Qashqai, have consistently stated that Iran opposes nuclear weapons based on religious beliefs, logic, and the high costs associated with them. Khamene'i emphasized in 2012 that nuclear weapons are considered a great sin and stockpiling them is futile and harmful. Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i and Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hassan Qashqai, have consistently stated that Iran opposes nuclear weapons due to religious beliefs, logic, and high costs. Ambassador Mohammad Chasee and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif also emphasized Iran's stance against developing nuclear weapons. President Hassan Rouhani reiterated in 2018 that Iran has no intention of pursuing nuclear weapons. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) operates Iran's declared nuclear program. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) was established in 1974 and operates Iran's nuclear program, including peaceful programs in agriculture, medicine, and basic nuclear research. It has regulatory control over Iran's nuclear program, reports to the Iranian President, and is responsible for research and development in nuclear technology. The AEOI acts upon decisions made by the Supreme National Security Council and is Tehran's main interlocutor with the IAEA. The AEOI controls the country's centrifuge program through an entity called the Kalaye Electric Company. The Kalaye Electric Company, operated by AEOI, oversaw Iran's centrifuge enrichment program in three phases: 1985-1997 in Tehran, 1997-2002 at Kalaye Electric Company, and 2002-present at Natanz. Aghazadeh's presidency accelerated the program, with Rouhani leading negotiations in 2003-2005. The Supreme Council for New Technologies, formed in 1998, focused on the nuclear program. Iran's nuclear weapons program, coordinated by entities connected with Iran's Ministry of Defense Armed Forces Logistics, was given more authorities by the central government in 1999. This allowed the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran to be more active without bureaucratic obstacles. The program ended in 2003, but staff continued to document their achievements. Iran established the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND) in 2011 for the development of nuclear weapons. The SPND is separate from Iran's civil nuclear program and aims to preserve the technological abilities of Iranian scientists in R&D for nuclear weapons. Activities were conducted to allow for the renewal of these capabilities. The SPND was established in 2011 by Iran for the development of nuclear weapons, aiming to retain the skills of scientists for immediate weapon production. Despite the SPND's creation, the IAEA reported no credible indications of nuclear weapon development activities in Iran after 2009. The AEOI had connections to entities linked to the Amad Plan, including a company called Kimia Maadan. The AEOI-run centrifuge program also had ties to Iran's MODAFL. However, there are indications that the AEOI's nuclear activities may not have been part of a weapons program, as the NIE excluded the AEOI-run enrichment program. The U.S. intelligence community defined Iran's weapons activities as nuclear weapon design and covert uranium work, excluding declared civil work related to uranium conversion and enrichment. The AEOI was not part of the suspected past nuclear weapons program's management structure. The Fordow centrifuge facility's existence did not contradict previous conclusions on Iran's nuclear weapons program, as it was developed by the AEOI. Iranian missile development is currently not linked to the AEOI. Iran's missile development is overseen by Iran's MODAFL, with the Aerospace Industries Organization managing missile production. The IRGC is not associated with the AEOI, and the IAEA began investigating Iran's nuclear activities in 2002. In September 2003, the IAEA adopted a resolution urging Tehran to cooperate with its investigation and suspend uranium enrichment. Iran then reached an agreement with the E3 to halt enrichment activities and comply with IAEA safeguards. Despite U.S. pressure, the matter was not referred to the U.N. Security Council. Tehran feared potential military action if the issue was escalated. Subsequent investigations revealed Iran's past nuclear activities. After the October 2003 agreement, Iran was found to have conducted clandestine nuclear activities, including plutonium separation, uranium enrichment, and importing uranium compounds. Despite a suspension agreement in November 2004, negotiations between Iran and the E3 from fall 2003 to summer 2005 did not lead to an agreement. One obstacle was the E3's opposition to Iran's 2005 proposal for a limited enrichment program. The lack of success of Iranian officials in negotiations with the E3 discredited them. The US influenced E3 negotiations by opposing easing sanctions and preventing any agreement with Iran that included enrichment. Iran resumed uranium conversion in 2005 under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The IAEA found Iran in noncompliance in September 2005. The IAEA found Iran in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement but did not refer Iran to the Security Council, giving Tehran more time to comply. Iran resumed centrifuge research in 2006, leading to a resolution referring the matter to the Security Council. The P5+1 countries offered incentives to address international concerns about Iran's enrichment programs. The proposal urged the government to cooperate with the IAEA's investigation of Tehran's nuclear programs, suspend enrichment activities, and resume implementing the Additional Protocol. A revised offer was presented to Iran in 2008, but Iran's response was deemed unsatisfactory by the P5+1 countries. Iran mentioned implementing the Additional Protocol if the nuclear file was returned from the Security Council to the agency. Iran's proposal in September 2009 mentioned economic and security issues for discussion but did not explicitly address its nuclear program. After a meeting in Geneva, Iranian officials agreed to a proposal for LEU fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor. Iran had requested fresh fuel for the reactor in a letter to the IAEA in June 2009. Iran requested fresh fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor in a June 2009 letter to the IAEA. The reactor initially used U.S.-supplied HEU but was converted to LEU fuel in 1994. A proposal by the U.S. and Russia involved Iran transferring 1,200 kilograms of its low-enriched uranium hexafluoride to Russia, which would then be enriched to about 20% uranium-235 or produced from Russian-origin uranium. France would fabricate the fuel assemblies and deliver them to Iran within a year. Iran requested fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor in 2009. By October 30, 2009, Iran had produced 1,763 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. Discussions were held with the IAEA, France, Russia, and the United States regarding a fuel delivery proposal. Iran resisted transferring all uranium before receiving reactor fuel, seeking credible assurances. The proposal for fuel delivery for the Tehran Research Reactor in 2009 lacked credible assurances. Iranian officials suggested compromises, but they were not accepted by the United States, France, and Russia. Details of the proposals from the three countries later became public, including the IAEA taking custody of Iranian uranium and agreements on technical assistance for the reactor. The United States expressed support for Iran transferring its low-enriched uranium to a third country for escrow until fuel fabrication. President Obama offered political assurances for the agreement. The IAEA draft in October 2009 did not explicitly prohibit Iran from producing 20% enriched uranium, arguing that supplying fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor would eliminate the need for Tehran to produce its own fuel. The escrow proposal was not part of the October 2009 IAEA draft. Following a November 20, 2009, meeting, the P5+1 expressed disappointment with Tehran's lack of positive response to the TRR proposal. They agreed to remain in contact for further assessment and decision-making. Iran later accepted the Tehran Declaration in May 2010 for supplying the TRR with fuel. Iran accepted the Tehran Declaration in May 2010 to supply the TRR with fuel, agreeing to deposit 1,200 kilograms of LEU in Turkey under IAEA monitoring. The declaration did not specify the ultimate destination for the LEU, unlike the IAEA draft proposal. In June 2010, Iran conveyed a letter to France, Russia, and the United States regarding the Tehran Declaration. The three governments responded with reservations but did not reject the proposal outright. The U.S. was concerned that accepting the proposal would disrupt efforts to impose additional sanctions on Iran. Subsequent talks between Iran and the P5+1 in 2010 and 2011 did not yield results. Talks resumed in 2012 with two rounds in Baghdad and Istanbul. Iran and the P5+1 held talks in Baghdad and Moscow in 2012. Former U.S. officials mentioned dropping the demand for Iran to end its enrichment program as crucial for reaching an agreement. The P5+1 proposed a step-by-step approach during the Baghdad meeting, demanding Iran to stop producing enriched uranium at 20% and ship its stockpile to a third country. The P5+1 proposed a step-by-step approach during talks with Iran in 2012, including halting uranium enrichment to 20%, shipping stockpile to a third country, and cooperating with IAEA. Reciprocal steps offered by the P5+1 included refraining from new sanctions, providing aircraft parts, fuel for TRR, medical isotopes, and technical cooperation. Talks continued in February. After ongoing talks and meetings between the P5+1 and Iran, an agreement called the Joint Plan of Action (JPA) was reached on November 24, 2013, to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program. Implementation of the JPA began on January 20, 2014. Subsequently, a framework for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was agreed upon on April 2, 2015, and finalized later on. President Donald Trump announced the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on May 8, 2018, leading to the reimposition of sanctions. The move was criticized by other parties to the agreement, who are committed to implementing the JCPOA in good faith. The legality of the US withdrawal in relation to UN Security Council Resolution 2231 remains unclear. The JCPOA is legally binding through UNSC Resolution 2231. After the US exit, Iran and other parties negotiated to maintain economic benefits. The EU announced practical measures to uphold the JCPOA, including economic relations, oil sales, banking transactions, and transportation with Iran. The EU, along with France, Germany, and the UK, aims to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran. They are committed to preserving effective financial channels with Iran and continuing Iran's export of oil and gas. This includes provisions for export credit, financial banking, and further investments in Iran to ensure a transparent business environment. The EU, France, Germany, and the UK announced the creation of a Special Purpose Vehicle called INSTEX SAS to facilitate legitimate trade with Iran, focusing on essential sectors like pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Efforts to preserve the economic provisions of the JCPOA are conditioned on Iran's full implementation of its nuclear commitments. Iranian officials have stated their commitment to fulfilling JCPOA commitments and reject renegotiation. The participants urge Iran to continue implementing its commitments and refrain from escalatory steps. They are determined to enable legitimate trade with Iran. Iranian officials assert commitment to JCPOA, warn of rapid nuclear program acceleration if other parties fail to fulfill obligations. Iranian officials warn of rapid nuclear program acceleration in response to U.S. sanctions, emphasizing the importance of receiving benefits from the JCPOA. Iranian officials emphasize the need for Iran to benefit from the JCPOA, rejecting new negotiations following Trump's announcement. Foreign Minister Zarif calls for compensation for Iran's compliance and Supreme Leader Khamene'i vows to continue. Iran demands Europe provide guarantees to maintain Iran's oil revenue from EU countries to continue JCPOA participation. Tehran prepares to expand uranium enrichment program within JCPOA limits. Iran resumes operations at uranium conversion facility. Iran has resumed operations at its uranium conversion facility and plans to manufacture centrifuge rotors. Tehran will also use an advanced centrifuge assembly center at the Natanz nuclear facility. Iran will continue to abide by its JCPOA commitments but may produce centrifuges beyond the limits if the agreement collapses. Iran has resumed uranium conversion operations and plans to manufacture centrifuge rotors. Despite committing to JCPOA obligations, Iran may exceed centrifuge limits if the agreement fails. Multilateral meetings post-U.S. withdrawal have not secured firm Iranian commitment to the JCPOA. President Rouhani criticized the EU's proposals for lacking operational solutions. Foreign Minister Zarif expressed dissatisfaction with the E3's Special Purpose Vehicle, warning Europe to be prepared to challenge U.S. unilateralism. Iran has stopped some JCPOA measures but has not withdrawn from the agreement. It will not transfer LEU or heavy water out of the country to maintain stockpiles below mandated limits. Iran will resume full compliance if main demands are met within a 60-day period. Absent an agreement, Iran will no longer accept constraints on uranium-235 levels and may resume work on the Arak reactor. Iran will resume full compliance with the JCPOA if main demands are met within a 60-day period. If an agreement is not reached, Iran may resume work on the Arak reactor and take other steps. President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA and reimposition of sanctions on Iran. The United States, led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, is re-imposing sanctions on Iran and withdrawing from the JCPOA. The US will no longer attend meetings related to the agreement and is applying financial pressure on Iran while working with allies to deter aggression. Pompeo stated that the US is willing to lift sanctions in exchange for changes in Iran's behavior. Pompeo outlined key elements for a new agreement with Iran, including declaring past military nuclear activities, stopping enrichment, providing access to all sites, ending missile proliferation, and releasing detained citizens. Iran must end support for terrorist groups in the Middle East, respect Iraqi sovereignty, disarm Shia militias, stop supporting the Houthi militia in Yemen, withdraw forces from Syria, cease support for the Taliban in Afghanistan, and halt threatening behavior towards neighbors and allies, including Israel. The United States, along with its allies, is taking action against Iran for its threats to destroy Israel, firing missiles into Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and engaging in cyberattacks. Sanctions have been reimposed on Iran in two phases, with the plan to create a new security architecture and joint teams to address the situation globally. The United States, along with its allies, is taking action against Iran for its threats to destroy Israel, firing missiles into Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and engaging in cyberattacks. Sanctions have been reimposed on Iran in two phases, with the plan to create a new security architecture and joint teams to address the situation globally. Persons participating in various Iranian nuclear activities, including projects at Arak, Bushehr, and Fordow, transfers of enriched uranium, and storage of heavy water, were granted waivers by the US in May 2019, except for certain restrictions on transfers of enriched uranium and heavy water storage. The Trump Administration's policy towards Iran involves threatening the government with sanctions to induce political unrest and economic collapse, aiming to bring Iran back to the negotiating table. This approach is not about regime change but rather letting the Iranian people decide the future of their government. The Trump Administration's policy towards Iran involves threatening the government with sanctions to induce political unrest and economic collapse, aiming to bring Iran back to the negotiating table. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Ford stated that the U.S. reimposition of sanctions is setting the stage for a diplomatic process to resolve the crisis created by Iran's malign acts. Trump Administration officials have warned Iran of possible military action if it violates its nuclear commitments. Pompeo emphasized that if Iran ramps up its nuclear program, it will face global condemnation and economic consequences. The Trump Administration's policy towards Iran involves threatening the government with sanctions to induce political unrest and economic collapse. Pompeo emphasized that economic pressure and deterrence are key components of the U.S. campaign against Iran. President Trump believes in clear measures to discourage Iran from restarting its nuclear program or engaging in malign activities. The president's public communications serve as a deterrence mechanism, as seen in his all-caps tweet directed at Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. This strategic approach aims to prevent Iran from threatening U.S. security. The Iranian regime fears the US military might, as shown by recent rocket attacks on US facilities in Iraq. Iran supports these attacks through proxies. The US will hold Tehran accountable for any harm to American personnel or facilities. Concerns about possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program have been raised by the IAEA. The IAEA's investigation of Iran's suspected nuclear weapons-related activities revealed credible information of activities relevant to a nuclear explosive device managed by senior Iranian figures. The program's structure was established in the late 1980s, with most activities conducted before 2003. The program's activities were managed by an institution called the Physics Research Center and overseen by an Iranian Ministry of Defense entity. The center's activities were later consolidated under a new entity called the AMAD Plan. After halting the AMAD Plan's work in 2003, staff remained to document achievements, and sensitive equipment and work places were cleaned or disposed of. Some activities previously carried out under the AMAD Plan were later resumed, with some being highly relevant to a nuclear weapon program. The IAEA report from December 2015 states that Iranian nuclear weapons-related activities occurred after 2003 but were not part of a coordinated effort. There are no credible indications of Iran developing a nuclear explosive device after 2009. The AMAD Plan sought dual-use equipment and materials for nuclear weapons development, conducted studies on uranium conversion, missile reentry vehicles, and conventional explosives. Iran may have also worked on components for nuclear weapons. Iran possesses documents detailing procedures for converting uranium hexafluoride to uranium metal, machining enriched uranium into components for nuclear weapons. Iran may have received nuclear explosive design information but it may not be sufficient for weapon production. The IAEA received information that Iran conducted preparatory work for fabricating uranium metal components for a nuclear explosive device. Iran may have developed detonators and experimented with a multipoint initiation system for a nuclear explosive device. They may have also conducted high explosive testing at the Parchin military site and worked on neutron initiators for implosion-type nuclear weapons. Additionally, the IAEA assessed that Iran may have studied missile reentry vehicles for delivering nuclear warheads. Iran may have conducted studies on missile reentry vehicles for delivering nuclear warheads, including integrating a payload into the reentry vehicle of the Shahab-3 ballistic missile. Tehran may have also worked on a prototype firing system for a missile's nuclear payload to explode in the air or upon impact. The Parchin military site in Iran is a large complex dedicated to research, development, and production of ammunition, rockets, and high explosives, owned by Iran's military industry. IAEA inspectors investigated the Parchin site in 2005 after receiving information alleging high explosive testing possibly related to nuclear materials. Inspectors did not find anything relevant during their visits. Iran was requested to respond to reports of constructing an explosives containment vessel for possible weapon development experiments. The outcome of these experiments has not been publicly reported. Iran has not publicly reported whether it conducted experiments at the building identified by the IAEA as housing a containment vessel. Inspectors did not visit the building in 2005 and Iran only provided access in September 2015, where no chamber or equipment was observed. Iranian officials claimed the building was used for storing chemical material, but the IAEA's information does not support this. The IAEA also asked Tehran about other indications suggesting Iran may have pursued nuclear weapons, including a high-level meeting in 1984. The curr_chunk provides information on various key details related to Iran's nuclear program, including meetings in 1984 and 1993, work done in 2000, mathematical research with nuclear weapons applications, and preparatory experimentation for a nuclear explosive device. Additionally, it lists Iranian entities involved in manufacturing centrifuges or related components. The appendix lists entities involved in activities related to Iran's centrifuge program, excluding those solely procuring materials. IAEA inspectors had access to Iranian workshops until 2006, but knowledge deteriorated after access was ended. Iran may have moved centrifuge work to new locations and built more workshops. Tehran has provided some workshop access under international agreements. The curr_chunk discusses Kalaye Electric and 7th of Tir's involvement in Iran's nuclear program, as described in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1737. Kalaye Electric is identified as a provider to Iran's centrifuge facility at Natanz, while 7th of Tir is directly involved in Iran's nuclear program. The 7th of Tir facility in Esfahan was involved in manufacturing centrifuge components for Iran's nuclear program. Key equipment was moved to Natanz and other AEOI sites when the IAEA began monitoring in 2003. The extent of current involvement is unknown. Farayand Technique and Iran Centrifuge Technology Company have also been linked to centrifuge component manufacturing. Iran Centrifuge Technology Company, located in Esfahan, took over the activities of Farayand Technique, involved in manufacturing uranium enrichment centrifuge parts. Pars Trash and Kaveh Cutting Tools Company, both located in Mashad, were also involved in manufacturing centrifuge components. Khorasan Metallurgy Industries, part of Kaveh Cutting Tools Company, is involved in the production of centrifuge components. Entities involved in the production of centrifuge components include Khorasan Metallurgy Industries in Mashad, Sanam Electronic Industry Group in Tehran, Abzar Boresh Kaveh Company, Parto Sanat Company in Tehran, and Eyvaz Technic in Tehran. These companies have been identified by various regulations and resolutions as manufacturers or suppliers of components for gas centrifuge enrichment. The Tehran-based companies Ghani Sazi Uranium Company, Iran Pooya, Mohandesi Toseh Sokht Atomi Company, and Saman Nasb Zayendeh Rood were identified in the 2011 European Council regulation for their involvement in supplying equipment and services related to centrifuge operations in Iran. Jelvesazan Company in Esfahan supplied centrifuge piping, Iran Aluminium Company in Arak supplied equipment to Iran Centrifuge Technology Company, Simatec Development Company in Tehran provided inverters for centrifuges to Kalaye Electric Company, and Sharif University of Technology in Tehran offered laboratories for Kalaye Electric Company and Iran Centrifuge. The entities involved in supplying equipment and services to Iran's nuclear program include Zirconium Production Plant, Aluminat, Pishro Systems Research Company, and Fulmen Group. These companies provided various materials and services related to centrifuge machines and research and development efforts. Iran's Fordow enrichment facility received goods and electrical equipment from a company before 2009. Iran obtained components and expertise for its nuclear program from various foreign sources, including a clandestine procurement network run by Abdul Qadeer Khan. The Khan network was revealed by Pakistan in 2004, and the IAEA has not determined the source of material for Iran's advanced centrifuges. Post-2003 suppliers to Iran's enrichment program were reviewed by CRS using official U.S. government reports and lists of sanctioned entities. Excluded were Iranian entities, nationals, and ships under foreign flags. The methodology used by CRS to review suppliers to Iran's enrichment program has limitations, as official reports often do not provide enough information to identify specific suppliers or transactions that warranted sanctions. For example, a California-based corporation attempted to illegally export items that could contribute to Iran's nuclear activities, but further details were not provided. The fact sheet and testimonies did not clarify if exports were intended for Iran's enrichment program. Iranian-owned entities used deceptive means to acquire enrichment technology from foreign suppliers, but there is no evidence of current foreign government involvement. According to a 2009 State Department report, major suppliers, except Russia, agreed not to provide nuclear technology to Iran. Chinese entities have been flagged for transferring proliferation-sensitive equipment to Iran, as per State Department reports from 2004 to 2010. Non-Chinese entities have also tried to acquire nuclear-related materials from Chinese entities. Chinese entities have been supplying materials and equipment suitable for ballistic missile, chemical weapon, and nuclear weapon programs to North Korea, Iran, and Pakistan. Iran has established front companies in Turkey to obtain nuclear-related items. Turkish entities have also been involved in this procurement. Iran and Turkish entities have attempted to obtain nuclear-related items, including enrichment-related equipment, from various sources such as the Czech Republic, the United States, and China. This includes the export of pressure transducers and vacuum pumps. In addition to attempts by Iranian and Turkish entities to obtain nuclear-related items from various sources, a California-based firm exported vacuum pumps and pump-related equipment to Iran through a free trade zone in the UAE. This equipment has applications in uranium enrichment. An Iranian national pleaded guilty to arranging the illegal export of carbon fiber to Iran in 2008, which also has nuclear applications. Iranian entities were also trying to acquire items from Canada for Iran's nuclear program. The documents reveal Iranian procurement agents exporting items from Canada, potentially for Iran's nuclear program. UAE entities were part of the Khan network involved in shipping enrichment-related technology to Iran. The UAE was described as a trans-shipment hub for Iran, but has taken steps to curb illicit activities. The UAE entities, Modern Technologies FZC and Qualitest FZE, were implicated in procuring components for the Iranian nuclear program, without specifying if they were for uranium enrichment."
