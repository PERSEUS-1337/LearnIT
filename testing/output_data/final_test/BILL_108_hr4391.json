The \"Public Servant Retirement Protection Act\" replaces the windfall elimination provision in the Social Security Act with a formula for equalizing benefits for individuals with non-covered employment, specifically addressing individuals eligible for monthly periodic payments after 1985. The \"Public Servant Retirement Protection Act\" replaces the windfall elimination provision in the Social Security Act with a formula for equalizing benefits for individuals with non-covered employment, specifically addressing individuals eligible for monthly periodic payments after 1985. The primary insurance amount of an individual receiving certain payments will be computed or recomputed during concurrent entitlement to monthly periodic payment and old-age or disability insurance benefits. The Public Servant Retirement Protection Act replaces the windfall elimination provision in the Social Security Act with a formula for equalizing benefits for individuals with non-covered employment. For individuals eligible for monthly periodic payments after 1985, the primary insurance amount will be computed or recomputed during concurrent entitlement to monthly periodic payment and old-age or disability insurance benefits. The formula for determining an individual's primary insurance amount under the Public Servant Retirement Protection Act involves calculating the average indexed monthly earnings based on all service performed after 1950. This includes treating all relevant service as 'employment' for the purpose of computing benefits. The Commissioner of Social Security will establish a method for determining wages from post-1950 service for calculating benefits. This method will rely on employment records provided to the Commissioner and other relevant information. Following the enactment of the Public Servant Retirement Protection Act, if paragraph (1) of this subsection would apply to an individual, an amount equal to the individual's primary insurance amount will be computed. This amount will be adjusted based on the percentage of the individual's average indexed monthly earnings. Additionally, a second amount will be calculated, taking into account noncovered service performed after 1956. After 1956, a third amount is computed based on the individual's primary insurance amount. The primary insurance amount is the largest of the three amounts calculated. The percentage specified is 80.0% for individuals eligible for old-age insurance. In 1986, individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits received 80.0% of their primary insurance amount. This percentage decreased over the years for those becoming eligible in 1987 (70.0%), 1988 (60.0%), 1989 (50.0%), and 1990 onwards (40.0%). Any periodic payment not made monthly is converted to an equivalent monthly payment by the Commissioner of Social Security. For individuals with 30 years or more of coverage, Subparagraph (D) does not apply. If an individual has more than 20 years but less than 30 years of coverage, the specified percentage in Subparagraph (D)(ii) will be adjusted accordingly. A lump sum payment can be considered a periodic payment if it replaces or commutes periodic payments. If the specified percentage in Subparagraph (D)(ii) is smaller than the applicable percent in the table, it will be deemed as the applicable percent in the table. The table shows the applicable percent based on the number of years of coverage. The term 'year of coverage' is defined in paragraph (1)(C)(ii), with decreasing percentages as the years decrease. The primary insurance amount is calculated under paragraph (1) of this subsection, with a reference to '15 percent' deemed as '25 percent'. This paragraph does not apply to individuals covered under specific agreements or employees affected by the Social Security Amendments of 1983. On December 31, 1983, organizations without a waiver certificate under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 had social security coverage extended to their employees by the amendments made by section 102 of that Act. Conforming amendments were made to section 215(d)(3) of the Act. The amendments made to the Act on December 31, 1983 extended social security coverage to organizations without a waiver certificate under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Section 215(f)(9)(A) was amended by changing \"(a)(7)(C)\" to \"(a)(7)(E)\". Additionally, subparagraphs were updated in section 215(f)(9)(A) by changing \"subparagraph (E)\" to \"subparagraph (H)\" and \"subparagraph (D)\" to \"subparagraph (F)(i)\". The amendments made by this Act will apply to monthly insurance benefits starting from the 12th calendar month after the enactment date. The Commissioner of Social Security will adjust primary insurance amounts as needed to implement the changes."
