    "content": "The term MPA is used to describe spatial protection of marine resources, with ambiguities surrounding the level of protection needed for an area to qualify as an MPA. Protection can range from no protection to complete protection where all human activities are prohibited. While areas with complete protection qualify as MPAs, those closed for specific uses or species protection may not. The definition of MPAs varies depending on context, such as the resources at risk and associated threats. Definitions of MPAs are evolving with scientific understanding and institutional development. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are geographically defined places that manage systems for long-term resource protection. The definition of MPAs, as outlined in E.O. 13158, involves reserving marine areas for lasting protection of natural and cultural resources. This definition aligns with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's definition of MPAs. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are designated areas of marine or subtidal terrain, along with their overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical, and cultural features, reserved by law or other means for protection. Each MPA must be at least 1,000 hectares in size and falls under distinct categories based on management objectives, such as Strict Nature Reserve/Wilderness Area and National Park. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) specifies that at least three-quarters of an MPA must be managed for the primary category without conflict. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are designated areas of marine or subtidal terrain, along with their overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical, and cultural features, reserved by law or other means for protection. MPAs fall under distinct categories based on management objectives, such as National Park for ecosystem protection and recreation, National Monument for conservation of specific natural features, Habitat Species Management Area for conservation through management intervention, Protected Landscape/Seascape for landscape/seascape conservation and recreation, and Managed Resource Protected Area for sustainable use of natural ecosystems. The definition of MPAs can vary based on state and federal jurisdiction, emphasizing different species or the overall health of the ecosystem. The focus is on managing activities in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to protect the ecosystem. Questions include whether certain activities would be prohibited in all MPAs or if a list of permitted and prohibited activities would be developed for each area. Definitions play a key role in conveying expectations for MPA programs. The Gulf of Maine has various designated areas for protection, but many only protect specific fish species or limit certain activities. Some advocate for a broader definition of MPAs to encompass more designations. The debate over the definition of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) continues due to the various ways the concept has been used. Different terms like marine reserves and ocean wilderness are used to describe areas with high levels of protection, sometimes seen as alternatives to MPAs. Marine reserves prohibit resource removal, while ocean wilderness areas do not allow any activities that leave lasting impacts. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) include different types of designations such as fully protected marine areas, national marine sanctuaries, marine managed areas, and marine parks. Approximately 1,700 MPAs cover 34% of U.S. marine waters, managed by federal, state, and territorial agencies with varying levels of protection. Approximately 1,700 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) cover 34% of U.S. marine waters, with less than 30% managed by federal agencies. Nearly 85% of the total MPA area in U.S. waters is under federal jurisdiction. Most MPAs permit access and multiple use, including fishing, and have been established since 1970. NOAA and the Department of the Interior manage MPAs for various purposes such as fisheries management and conservation. The protection of marine resource areas through Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is not a new concept, but there is increasing interest in developing a coordinated nationwide system. This interest has been heightened by actions initiated by the Clinton and Bush Administrations, with roots among scientists and some non-governmental organizations. President Clinton responded to concerns about marine resource degradation by issuing Executive Order 13089 on coral reef protection in June 1998. In 1999 and 2000, the Administration issued action plans to expand and strengthen Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the United States. President Clinton's Marine Protected Areas Executive Order, E.O. 13158, aimed to enhance conservation of marine heritage and sustainable use of the marine environment. The order focused on increasing coordination and effectiveness of MPAs without changing existing regulations or establishing new ones. NOAA and the Department of the Interior were tasked with leading these efforts. President Clinton issued E.O. 13178 on December 4, 2000, creating the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the largest protected area in the United States at about 120,000 square miles. Within the reserve, 15 preservation areas were designated, covering about 6,200 square miles where consumptive activities are restricted. President Bush continued and expanded the initiatives started by the Clinton Administration for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve. He established the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument in 2006, encompassing the protected areas. In 2008, he ensured that recreational fishing is managed sustainably in various conservation areas. President Bush designated three marine national monuments in the Central and Western Pacific in 2009 under the Antiquities Act of 1906. These include the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, and the Rose Atoll Marine National Monument. These areas are managed as national wildlife refuges by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife. This action addresses recreational interests' concerns of being excluded from marine protected areas. The marine national monuments in the Central and Western Pacific, designated by President Bush in 2009, are managed as national wildlife refuges by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The marine areas will be managed by NOAA, totaling 195,274 square miles, larger than any existing marine protected area in the United States. President Obama established an Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force in 2009 to develop recommendations for a national ocean policy. The Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force (IOPTF) was tasked with developing recommendations for a national ocean policy and coastal and marine spatial planning. The Final Recommendations released by the CEQ outlined a national policy for the ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes, a governance structure, implementation strategy, and a framework for coastal and marine spatial planning. The CMSP framework defines it as a comprehensive, adaptive, integrated, ecosystem-based, and transparent spatial planning process. The IOPTF developed recommendations for a national ocean policy and coastal and marine spatial planning. President Obama signed an executive order to establish a National Ocean Council and implement coastal and marine spatial plans, revoking a previous executive order by President Bush. The National MPA Center was created in 2000 to develop a framework for a national system of MPAs. The National MPA Center, established in 2000, aims to develop a national system of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the U.S. In 2003, a 30-member MPA Advisory Committee was formed to provide advice on this matter. In 2008, the center released a Framework for the National System of Marine Protected Areas, which includes recommendations for the development of the national MPA system. The center is currently implementing this framework by seeking nominations for MPAs. The MPA Center is implementing a framework by soliciting nominations from federal, state, and territorial programs to join the national system. They have built an inventory of federal, state, local, and tribal MPAs to provide information for environmental assessments and to help protect marine resources. The center also offers education projects to increase knowledge about MPAs. The MPA Center is leading a pilot program in California, Oregon, and Washington to improve approaches for managing MPAs at a regional level. The National Park Service Ocean Park Stewardship Action Plan aims to establish a seamless system of ocean parks, sanctuaries, refuges, and reserves in partnership with NOAA and other agencies. This plan includes actions for mapping, enhancing protection, educating the public, and increasing technical capacity for exploration and stewardship. The Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior have agreed to collaborate on improving management efficiencies, joint planning efforts, public education, and law enforcement in marine protected areas (MPAs). California is actively developing a comprehensive program of MPAs under the Marine Life Protection Act, with 29 marine reserves established along the central coast. The central coast region in California has completed planning and implementing marine protected areas (MPAs), with 204 square miles designated, including 85 square miles as no-take marine reserves. There is opposition from fishing interests due to reduced harvest opportunities, while environmental groups see it as a positive step. Other states like Hawaii have also established marine reserves. The main motivation for MPAs is the expected growth in human activities in the marine environment, leading to use conflicts and ecosystem degradation. Proponents cite protection and restoration of ecosystems as the main benefit of MPAs. The main benefit of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is the protection and restoration of ecosystems, including valued fish populations. Other benefits include new educational and recreational opportunities, expanded tourism, protection of cultural resources, and contributions to basic science and improved environmental conditions. MPAs could also provide baseline scientific data about current and changing marine conditions, serving as a system for comparison among locations, especially as climate change impacts marine ecosystems. MPAs serve various purposes such as education, carbon sequestration, habitat improvement, and protection of cultural artifacts. The first national marine sanctuary was designated to protect the site of the Civil War ironclad Monitor. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits and challenges of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), using the example of Buck Island Reef National Monument. Commercial interests argue that current laws and programs can provide similar benefits as MPAs, and that new initiatives should not duplicate existing marine legislation. They also emphasize the need to balance the benefits of additional protection with the costs of restricting commercial activities. The benefits of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) include protecting fish populations, managing fishery populations, reducing damage to habitat, and preserving biodiversity. MPAs also help in controlling commercial and recreational harvest rates, protecting critical locations for species, and preserving rare or endangered species. MPAs are debated for their potential socioeconomic consequences, especially by fishing interests concerned about displacement of resource use. Proponents argue that MPAs can benefit fishermen by protecting fish populations, but without proper management, overuse in nearby areas may occur. Deciding on appropriate MPAs for fishery management involves contentious issues such as restoring fish populations, limiting harmful fishing techniques, integrating MPA protection with other measures, and considering the impact on coastal communities. Fishing often targets larger, older fish, leading to imbalances in fish populations. Older females produce more eggs than younger females due to fish volume. Larvae from older females have higher survival rates. MPAs benefit sedentary species by allowing fish to grow larger. Uncertainties remain about the effects of MPAs on fish populations. Studies of MPAs have shown an increase in population biomass, fish size, density, and species diversity within MPAs. Some experts argue that traditional fisheries management tools like size limits and catch limits are more effective than MPAs. Implementing a widespread system of MPAs would pose numerous challenges, as seen through experiences at NOAA's MPA Center and other organizations worldwide. The challenges in establishing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) revolve around selecting sites based on criteria like representative habitats, ecological integrity, social acceptability, and species diversity. Decisions on protecting specific species or ecosystems, determining boundaries based on geography or ecosystems, and including adjacent waterways are key considerations in MPA establishment. The challenges in establishing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) include fragmented areas, adjacent waterways, prioritizing already protected sites, human use impacts, controversy in designation process, and stakeholder debates. The success or failure of Marine Protected Area (MPA) designations is influenced by socioeconomic, cultural, and political factors rather than biological considerations. Stakeholder perceptions are positive when designations are fair, transparent, and have clearly stated goals. Local cultural, social, and economic circumstances play a significant role in the outcome of MPA designations. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are established in various aquatic habitats to assert authority over activities affecting resources. Control increases closer to shore from the Exclusive Economic Zone boundary. Governments protect environmental quality and lease surface and subsurface areas for activities like oil and gas extraction. Ownership and control differ in marine areas due to limited private ownership. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are established in ocean and coastal areas to manage activities affecting resources. The range of marine organisms and ecosystems often extends beyond jurisdictional boundaries, posing challenges for management. To effectively protect MPAs, agreements are needed to harmonize efforts across boundaries and consider zoning approaches for different levels of protection. Zoning in marine protected areas allows for different levels of protection and multiple policy objectives to be achieved. The concept of zoning, first implemented by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in the 1980s, is now being adopted in other areas like the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. This approach may be particularly useful in areas with high use pressures. However, applying zoning in aquatic environments is still a relatively new concept due to the traditional belief that the ocean is limitless and open to all uses. The management of ocean areas beyond territorial seas is a recent development, with increasing attention on zoning to reduce conflicts among different uses. Technological advances have allowed for greater access and use of marine resources, leading to the need for marine spatial planning similar to land use planning. Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is a concept related to land use planning in terrestrial areas, growing in recognition due to the increase in marine activities and degradation of the marine environment. MSP involves analyzing and allocating marine spaces for ecological, economic, and social objectives, integrating management activities across sectors and government agencies. Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is a place-based, integrated process across economic sectors and government agencies. Fanny Douvere defines MSP as a continuous, iterative process with three phases: planning and analysis, implementation, and monitoring. Decision-making involves public participation, and there is debate over limiting offshore energy activities. During the 1980s and early 1990s, oil and gas development interests expressed concerns about attempts to designate national marine sanctuaries, fearing it would hinder offshore energy development. Recent proposals for offshore wind farms have faced opposition similar to \"not in my backyard\" responses seen in suburban areas. Conflicts over multiple uses of marine areas are not new, with concerns raised about offshore energy development in frontier areas. Proposed offshore energy development in \"frontier\" areas raises questions about monitoring, addressing new categories of use, and considering public and private interests in decision-making. Recent national reports provide recommendations on marine conservation and the use of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), criticizing the current piecemeal approach to marine resource management. Many supporters of the MPA concept draw from reports criticizing the current approach to marine resource management. They endorse recommendations from the Pew Oceans Commission and U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy as a starting point for policy discussions. The 2001 NRC report on MPAs discussed the costs, benefits, feasibility, and scientific basis of MPAs and marine reserves, without making a specific recommendation for additional legislation. The NRC report recommended that MPAs can be successful with stakeholder participation, effective planning, regular monitoring, and enforcement. It endorsed using marine reserves as management tools alongside traditional measures, emphasizing the need for resources and coordination from federal and state agencies. The Pew Oceans Commission report called for establishing marine reserves to restore and maintain healthy marine ecosystems. The Pew Commission recommends establishing marine reserves to \"zone\" ocean areas for desired uses, transcending federal-state boundaries. It calls for the creation of regional ocean ecosystems councils and a new federal oceans agency. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy also supports MPAs but with a broader focus, potentially influencing congressional decisions. The Pew Commission and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommend establishing marine reserves and MPAs to manage federal waters. The National Marine Sanctuary Program currently provides the most comprehensive approach to using MPAs, while administrative actions to establish national monuments in marine areas are seen as opportunistic rather than part of a deliberate movement towards a comprehensive approach. Legislation proposed during the 110th Congress aimed to make incremental progress towards establishing marine reserves and MPAs. The Sanctuary Enhancement Act of 2008, H.R. 6537, would have reauthorized the National Marine Sanctuary Act, addressing constraints on designating new sanctuaries and integrating national monuments within the system. Hearings were held by the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans, but no further action was taken. Funding for NMSA programs continues to be appropriated annually. Several bills introduced in the 111th Congress aim to expand the boundaries of existing National Marine Sanctuaries, prohibit specific activities within them, and reauthorize the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act. H.R. 223 and S. 212 seek to expand the boundaries of Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries in California, while H.R. 905 and S. 380 aim to expand Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in Michigan. Additionally, H.R. 790 and S. 851 would prohibit oil or natural gas development activities in these sanctuaries. H.R. 790 and S. 851 would prohibit oil or natural gas development activities in any National Marine Sanctuary or marine national monument, including Georges Bank fishing grounds. H.R. 1672 and S. 668 would reauthorize the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act. Congressional debate on marine area protection may involve economic interests opposing MPAs due to resource use restrictions, while environmental and research interests advocate for more comprehensive ocean resource protection. MPA opponents argue that the benefits of marine protected areas are unproven, but restrictions on commercial activities will be costly. Balancing profitable commercial activities with environmental concerns remains a challenge for policymakers. Current federal laws do not protect marine areas as comprehensively as proponents of MPAs suggest. Commercial interests argue that MPAs should be reserved for truly special areas. The discussion on marine protected areas (MPAs) includes arguments for and against their benefits and the need for comprehensive protection. Current federal laws are deemed sufficient by some, while others suggest a more comprehensive effort. Various laws allow for the designation of protected marine areas, with the National Marine Sanctuaries Act being a key legislation in this regard. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) authorizes NOAA to designate specific sites for comprehensive management and conservation, preserving ecological, aesthetic, and recreational values. NOAA has designated 13 sanctuaries, ranging in size, for various reasons such as protecting cultural artifacts and entire ecosystems. Contentious issues arise when determining incompatible activities within these designated areas. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act authorizes NOAA to designate sites for conservation, with 13 sanctuaries established for various reasons. Management plans vary widely, with some sanctuaries allowing multiple uses like fishing and recreation. However, most prohibit oil and gas exploration. Fishing can be regulated in sanctuaries, but this is rare. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows for the designation of conservation sites, with some sanctuaries permitting multiple uses like fishing and recreation. Fishing regulations in sanctuaries are rare, with Regional Fishery Management Councils having the authority to propose and draft fishing regulations. The Secretary of Commerce must approve these proposals unless they conflict with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Some proponents of Marine Protected Areas do not see the current sanctuary system as effective for fish recovery efforts. The Coastal Zone Management Act established coastal zone regulations. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) established a program for coastal zone management and an estuarine sanctuary program, now known as the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. It allows 35 coastal and Great Lakes states and territories to participate by providing grants for development and resource protection activities. Incentives include a consistency provision for federal actions to align with state plans. Only Illinois has not participated in the program. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are mainly located in coastal and nearshore waters. Protection efforts for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are concentrated in coastal and nearshore waters, which are productive and diverse marine environments. States use federally approved coastal zone programs to address pressures in state waters, with some focusing on ocean resource management. Coastal zone enhancement grants are available for states to protect marine areas. NOAA provides coastal zone enhancement grants for states implementing programs to protect marine areas. States designate and manage protected areas in state waters, integrating them into coastal management efforts. The National Estuarine Research Reserve System is part of the federal coastal zone management program, with states managing research reserve sites in state waters. The National Estuarine Research Reserves are federally approved to represent diverse estuarine ecosystems, providing a laboratory for research and education programs. Incompatible uses are controlled to preserve the value of the reserves, which range in size from 571 acres to 365,000 acres. Each reserve operates under a management plan. The MSFCMA established federal fishery management authority in a zone extending from state coastal waters to 200 miles from the U.S. coastline. Regional Fishery Management Councils were established in 1976 to develop management plans. President Reagan's declaration of an Exclusive Economic Zone in 1983 superceded the fishery conservation zone. In 1996, Congress authorized Councils to manage essential fish habitat and regulate fishing effort, including closing areas to protect habitats from overfishing. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) imposes closures on fishing areas based on recommendations from Regional Fishery Management Councils to address overfishing. Permanent and complete closures are rare under the MSFCMA, with a shift towards creating longer-term marine reserves instead of temporary closures for individual species. Regional Councils are increasingly considering selective protection of unique habitats to benefit multiple species. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and Regional Fishery Management Councils are implementing closures and restrictions to address overfishing. This includes partial closures and marine reserves to protect habitats and promote fish population recovery. Stakeholders have differing opinions on the effectiveness of these measures. The management of U.S. marine fisheries has become more restrictive since 1996, with requirements for recovery schedules, sustainable harvest levels, and minimal bycatch. Critics argue that these changes reduce the need for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The 109th Congress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 2006, with provisions to protect deep sea corals and focus on managing marine ecosystems. The Wilderness Act established federally owned areas with restricted activities to minimize human alterations. The Wilderness Act established federally owned areas with restricted activities to minimize human alterations, including marine areas under federal jurisdiction beyond state boundaries but within 200 miles of the coastline. Goals include allowing natural processes to operate unfettered and permitting only primitive recreational activities that do not impact those processes. Commercial activities, permanent facilities, and motorized equipment are generally prohibited, but Congress has authorized exceptions. The Wilderness Act allows for limited commercial uses in federally owned areas to support recreational and wilderness purposes. There is ongoing exploration of establishing \"marine wilderness,\" with differing views on the level of protection needed. Some advocate for strong protections, while others find wilderness designations too restrictive. Discussions also focus on the balance between recreation and conservation in designated wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act allows for limited commercial uses in federally owned areas to support recreational and wilderness purposes. The National Park Service Organic Act created the NPS to preserve lands and resources while fostering public use and enjoyment. Many NPS units in coastal areas have marine components, with debates on balancing preservation and public use, including recreational and commercial fishing. The National Wildlife Refuge Administration Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 668dd) establishes the primary purpose of units in the National Wildlife Refuge System for conservation of fish and wildlife habitats. The refuges are administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, allowing activities like recreational fishing, hunting, wildlife observation, and oil and gas extraction in some units. The Antiquities Act of 1906 allows the President to designate national monuments in marine areas of scientific or historical interest. Some argue for its use in creating protected marine areas due to its expeditious nature, but it would still require negotiation, education, and consensus-building, along with congressional funding and involvement of local committees. The Antiquities Act allows the President to designate national monuments in marine areas of scientific or historical interest. The use of this act may face objections for lack of public input. The Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act established a commission for the waters of northern Puget Sound and southern Georgia Strait in Washington State. The Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act established a commission for the waters of northern Puget Sound and southern Georgia Strait in Washington State. The Commission's priorities include collecting marine resources data, coordinating marine resource protection and restoration activities, and carrying out other important activities. Seven county Marine Resource Committees advise the Commission. The initiative has generated local support for projects, increased voluntary compliance with conservation goals, and created a model of marine governance. Legislation to reauthorize the act has been introduced in both the House and the Senate. H.R. 1672 has passed the House, and S. 668 has been reported by the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Various federal laws, such as the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, and Marine Mammal Protection Act, impact marine environmental quality. Offshore areas in federal waters have been protected from oil and gas development for over two decades. In 1990, President Bush limited Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) activities to federal waters off Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and portions of Alaska. President Clinton extended this moratorium to other areas through 2012. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 opened up a portion of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. President Bush lifted the executive ban on OCS activities in 2008, and Congress allowed the ban on drilling in OCS areas to expire in 2009. Nearly 1,300 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are managed by states and territories, governed by federal, state, local laws, and international agreements."
