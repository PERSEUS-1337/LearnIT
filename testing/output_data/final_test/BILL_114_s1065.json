    "content": "The \"School Asthma Management Plan Act\" is added to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, introducing school asthma management plans under Part D. The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies for public schools to develop asthma management plans and purchase FDA-approved drugs and devices for emergency use. The Secretary may award grants to local health or education departments to carry out activities if they are the entity that would routinely do so. Local educational agencies can apply for grants by submitting an application with required information. Priority is given to agencies assisting schools with a high burden of asthma. Local educational agencies or departments with a high burden of asthma may receive grants to develop and implement comprehensive school asthma management plans based on national guidelines. These plans can include purchasing FDA-approved drugs and devices for emergency use, as well as tools for asthma education and pulmonary function measurement. The school asthma management plan includes identifying students with asthma, creating asthma action plans, educating staff on asthma basics, providing access to medication, implementing specific medication and emergency policies, and training for managing acute symptoms and ongoing asthma care. The school asthma management plan includes coordination of care, monitoring outcomes, and completion of EPA's Indoor Air Quality Profile. Grant recipients must utilize existing systems and find innovative ways to support students with asthma. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires schools to find innovative ways to encourage bidirectional communication with students' physicians, ensure trained staff for emergency asthma care, include asthma triggers in student action plans, and report asthma emergencies to the State health department. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 authorizes appropriations for innovative asthma care in schools for fiscal year 2016 and the following 4 years.
