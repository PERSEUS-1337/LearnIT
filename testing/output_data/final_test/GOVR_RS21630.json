    "content": "Permanent legal immigration to the United States is regulated by numerical limits and preference categories in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Employment-based immigration is a major category, with special immigrants like ministers of religion and religious workers. Religious workers are limited to 5,000 immigrants annually, and accompanying spouses and children are included. Before the Immigration Act of 1990, ministers of religion had no numerical limits for entry. The Immigration Act of 1990 amended the INA to include ministers of religion and religious workers, with a provision for religious workers extended multiple times. A nonimmigrant visa for religious workers, known as the R visa, was also created. Defining religious work is challenging due to theological diversity. The Immigration Act of 1990 introduced provisions for ministers of religion and religious workers, defining them as individuals who have been members of a religious denomination for at least 2 years and seek to work in the United States in a religious capacity. The Immigration Act of 1990 introduced provisions for ministers of religion and religious workers, defining them as individuals who have been members of a religious denomination for at least 2 years and seek to work in the United States in a religious capacity. Religious workers are not subject to labor certification requirements and must work for a bona fide organization affiliated with a religious denomination. The regulations define religious occupation as an activity related to a traditional religious function. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Bureau in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees immigrant admissions, with religious workers representing a small percentage of annual immigration. Religious denomination is defined as a group with ecclesiastical government, creed, worship, doctrine, and established places of worship. Interdenominational organizations exempt from taxation are also considered religious denominations. The number of nonimmigrant R visas issued has steadily increased since FY1992, but permanent admissions for religious workers have varied. Most religious workers who become lawful permanent residents adjust their status in the United States, with only a small percentage arriving from abroad. Bills have been introduced to extend the religious worker provision through September 30, 2008. Bills (H.R. 2152 / S. 1580) to extend the religious worker provision through September 30, 2008, have been introduced in both chambers. Efforts to make it a permanent immigration category have not succeeded due to concerns about fraud and potential entry of religious extremists into the United States. However, provisions in the INA guard against visa fraud and exclude aliens who may threaten public safety or national security. The largest preference grouping in immigration is family-based, with other groupings including diversity and humanitarian admissions. Special immigrants include certain employees of the U.S. government abroad, Panama Canal employees, retired employees of international organizations, aliens who served in the U.S. armed forces, and aliens declared a ward of a juvenile court. Religious workers on nonimmigrant R visas may be admitted for up to 5 years. Religious workers on nonimmigrant R visas may be admitted for up to 5 years. The regulations specify examples of eligible religious workers, such as liturgical workers, religious instructors, and missionaries. Labor certification provisions aim to protect U.S. workers from displacement by foreign workers. For further information on tax exempt status, refer to CRS Report RL31545, Congressional Protection of Religious Liberty. Other agencies responsible for immigration functions include the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in DHS, and the Bureau of Consular Affairs in the Department of State.
