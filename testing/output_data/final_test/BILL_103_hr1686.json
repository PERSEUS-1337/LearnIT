    "content": "The \"Investment Tax Credit Act of 1993\" may be cited as the Investment Tax Credit Act. This Act provides for an investment tax credit. The Investment Tax Credit Act of 1993 introduces a general investment credit of 10 percent of qualified investment for any taxable year. The Investment Tax Credit Act of 1993 offers a 10 percent credit for qualified investments, calculated based on the basis of new and used qualified investment tax credit properties placed in service during the taxable year. The applicable percentage is determined by specific sections of the law. The Investment Tax Credit Act of 1993 provides a 10 percent credit for qualified investments in tangible property used for manufacturing, production, transportation, or other specified services. The Investment Tax Credit Act of 1993 offers a 10 percent credit for qualified investments in property used for energy, gas, water, waste disposal, pollution control, research facilities, research equipment, or bulk storage of fungible commodities. This includes property eligible for depreciation with a useful life of 3 years or more. The Investment Tax Credit Act of 1993 provides a 10 percent credit for qualified investments in property used for various purposes. The credit applies to property with a useful life of 3 years or more and can offset 100 percent of the minimum tax. Coordination with other credits is required unless waived by the taxpayer. The Investment Tax Credit Act of 1993 allows a C corporation to offset 100 percent of the minimum tax with the new investment tax credit. The credit can be used against the regular limitation or the taxpayer's tentative minimum tax for the year. The limitation on the investment tax credit is determined by subtracting the portion attributable to the general investment credit from the overall limitation. The credit cannot reduce the net chapter 1 tax by less than 10 percent of the amount determined under section 55(b)(1)(A). The net chapter 1 tax is the regular tax liability plus section 55 tax, minus credits allowable under this part. Technical amendments include changes to section 49(a)(1) regarding qualified investment tax credit property. The amendment includes changes to section 50(a)(2) and paragraph (5) of section 50(a) of the Code for qualified investment tax credit property. The amendment changes the percentage in clause (iii) to 33 percent and excludes clauses (iv) and (v) in section 48 of the Code. The amendment to section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code changes the percentage to 33 percent and excludes clauses (iv) and (v). Effective after December 31, 1992, under rules similar to section 48(m) before the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990."
