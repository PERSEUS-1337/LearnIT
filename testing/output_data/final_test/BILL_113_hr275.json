    "content": "The \"End Radon in Schools Act\" establishes a grant program for radon testing in public schools. The Environmental Protection Agency will award grants to States for short-term radon testing and mitigation. Guidelines for radon testing in schools will be updated and published. The \"End Radon in Schools Act\" authorizes grant awards for radon testing in public schools. The Administrator will provide grants to States for testing, mitigation, and reevaluation. Application and priority guidelines are outlined in the Act. To be eligible for a grant under the \"End Radon in Schools Act,\" a State must submit an application to the Administrator containing required information and a certification of fund usage for testing and mitigating radon levels in public schools. Grant priority is determined by ranking States in relation to each other based on their applications. Priority for grant allocation under the \"End Radon in Schools Act\" is determined based on the percentage of a State's landmass in Radon Zone 1. States with 100% landmass in Zone 1 have the highest priority, followed by those with at least 50% landmass. The Administrator has discretion in assigning priority among States with the same percentage of landmass in Zone 1. States with less than 50% landmass in Zone 1 are assigned priority at the Administrator's discretion. States with less than 50% landmass in Radon Zone 1 are assigned priority at the Administrator's discretion. SEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS. A State receiving a grant under this Act must follow Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines, test radon levels in public schools, mitigate unsafe levels, and reevaluate mitigation if necessary. Testing must be conducted in each public school, with a report submitted to the Administrator detailing results and estimating necessary funds. The Act requires states to follow Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines, test radon levels in public schools, mitigate unsafe levels, and reevaluate mitigation if necessary. Testing must be conducted in each public school, with a report submitted to the Administrator detailing results and estimating necessary funds for additional short-term tests if needed. If initial testing indicates the need for further testing, follow-up testing must be consistent with the Administrator's guidelines. Mitigation measures must be taken in public schools where testing meets the recommendations in the guidelines. The State must mitigate radon levels at public schools by providing funds to the local educational agency if necessary, or the Administrator will carry out mitigation directly if certification is not included in the State's report. States receiving grants under the Act must seek certification from each local educational agency serving public schools to ensure mitigation measures are carried out. The local educational agency must complete specified actions if funded under section 3(2)(A) and submit a report to the Administrator including certification, test results, and estimated mitigation funds for public schools. Mitigation requirements for radon levels at public schools are outlined. Mitigation requirements for radon levels at public schools include working with a qualified professional, creating a mitigation plan within 3 months, designating a mitigation unit within a year, conducting tests every two years, and reevaluating if necessary. If follow-up testing after mitigation plan implementation still meets radon level recommendations, the school must reevaluate the plan with a professional, create an alternative plan, submit a report to the Administrator, and implement the alternative plan. If follow-up testing after mitigation plan implementation still meets radon level recommendations, the school must implement an alternative mitigation plan within 6 months. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term \"local educational agency\" is defined as in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. A \"mitigation plan\" is a plan to mitigate radon created by a qualified radon mitigation professional in consultation with the local educational agency. A \"mitigation unit\" consists of individuals designated by the local educational agency to implement the mitigation plan. The term \"public school\" is defined as in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"qualified radon mitigation professional\" refers to an individual licensed, certified, registered, or approved to mitigate radon. The term \"Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines\" describes the report produced by the Administrator in July 1993, providing information and guidance on radon testing in public schools. The term \"Radon Zone 1\" refers to areas with indoor radon levels above 4 picocuries per liter. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. A \"short-term test\" is approved by the Administrator and lasts 2-90 days to measure acceptable radon levels for human inhalation. \"State\" refers to US states and the District of Columbia."
