The Protection Against Wrongful Voter Purges Act amends the National Voter Registration Act to include notice and review requirements for removing individuals from the list of eligible voters for reasons other than a change of residence. The Protection Against Wrongful Voter Purges Act requires notice meeting specific requirements for voter removal, including sending notice by mail with reasons for removal stated, such as criminal convictions. The Protection Against Wrongful Voter Purges Act mandates sending removal notices by mail with reasons stated, including a process for review by a State election official. A registrant who receives a notice of removal may request to withdraw the notice and provide evidence to show they are eligible to remain on the voter list. The State must respond to a registrant's request for removal within 10 days, either accepting or rejecting it. Special rules apply for removal due to the death of a registrant, with the notice addressed to the occupant of the registrant's most recent address. The notice of removal includes instructions for the occupant to report any errors regarding the registrant's death. The registrant can request to withdraw the notice and remain on the voter list. If a written request is submitted, the State will notify the registrant of the decision. Registrants who believe the removal was in error have the opportunity to cast a provisional ballot. Registrants who believe the removal decision was made in error can cast a provisional ballot in a Federal election, which will be counted if the error is confirmed. No new grounds for removal can be established. Additionally, voluntary guidance on audits of computerized voter lists is addressed in the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 includes voluntary guidance on audits of computerized voter lists to ensure accuracy and security. Amendments to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 are also made to align with state laws. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to align with state laws and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. Amendments include changes related to residency, notices, and consistency with subsection (j). The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to align with state laws and the Help America Vote Act of 2002, including changes related to residency, notices, and safeguards for eligible voters. Amendments also clarify the right to cast provisional ballots and allow states to provide greater protections to individuals threatened with removal from voter lists. The amendments made by this section will apply to the general election in November 2008 and all future Federal elections. SEC. 3. CONTENTS AND TREATMENT OF VOTER REGISTRATION FORMS. Section 303(b)(4)(B) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to allow correction of incomplete voter registration forms. Additionally, completed national forms are deemed complete for all states. The State must register a voter if the voter registration application form contains all required information, regardless of the form used. There is a presumption in favor of registration for applicants meeting requirements. When determining voter eligibility for Federal elections, State election officials should presume that applicants meet the registration requirements. SEC. 4. AVAILABILITY OF UPDATED INFORMATION FOR REGISTERED VOTERS. SEC. 4 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to require States to make updated voter information available online and at polling places for Federal elections. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 amendment requires States to provide updated voter information online and at polling places for Federal elections, including a list of registered voters at polling places without addresses. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 amendment mandates that the appropriate election official must make voter lists available within 72 hours of the voter registration deadline for Federal elections, or on a weekly basis in same-day registration States during the 30-day period leading up to the election. Individuals can request to be excluded from publicly-posted voter lists. Individuals can request to be excluded from publicly-posted voter lists, and the election official must exclude their information and notify them privately of their assigned polling place. In this context, the term 'registrar's jurisdiction' refers to the meaning in the National Voter Registration Act, and 'same-day registration State' is a state where voters can register at the polling place on the day of voting. The National Voter Registration Act requires election officials to notify individuals immediately if they are assigned to a different polling place than where they were registered to vote. This amendment also updates a section of the Act to reflect this change. The amendment updates the National Voter Registration Act by adding requirements under subparagraphs (A) and (B) and redesignating subparagraph (C). SEC. 5. NONAPPLICABILITY TO CERTAIN STATES. This Act and its amendments do not apply to states where there is no voter registration requirement for federal elections under existing state law. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. Section 303(d)(2) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to include a delayed effective date for certain provisions related to wrongful voter purges. The amended provisions will apply to the next federal election held after November 2008 and each subsequent federal election."
