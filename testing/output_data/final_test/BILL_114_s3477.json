Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, resulting in a painful rash that can persist for weeks, months, or years. Older individuals are at a higher risk of experiencing complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, hospitalizations, and interference with daily activities. Postherpetic neuralgia can occur in up to one-third of untreated individuals aged 60 and older. The herpes zoster vaccine is recommended for individuals aged 50 and older, with a target coverage of 30 percent for those aged 60 and over. However, only 28 percent of adults in this age group reported receiving the vaccine in 2014. According to the 2014 National Health Interview Survey, adult vaccination rates for Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis, shingles, Hepatitis B, and pneumonia are low, with disparities among different ethnic groups. Medicare coverage for the herpes zoster vaccine has barriers to uptake due to lack of awareness and financial challenges. Challenges, including lack of awareness and financial barriers, are common reasons why Medicare beneficiaries do not get vaccinated against the varicella-zoster virus. Herpes zoster leads to a significant number of emergency room visits and inpatient admissions annually, with high costs per patient in both outpatient and inpatient settings. The provision of information regarding vaccines for seniors, including coverage of the shingles vaccine under Medicare Part D, is addressed in Section 3. The Medicare & You Handbook will now include information on vaccines for seniors, specifically coverage of the shingles vaccine under Medicare Part D. The Medicare & You Handbook will now provide information on the shingles vaccine under Medicare Part D, including educational materials on accessing the vaccine with no cost sharing. The Medicare & You Handbook will now provide information on the shingles vaccine under Medicare Part D, including educational materials on accessing the vaccine with no cost sharing. Amendments are made to ensure consistent treatment of cost sharing for vaccines under Medicare Part B. For plan years beginning on or after January 1 of the first year more than 60 days after enactment, the shingles vaccine under Medicare Part D will have no deductible, coinsurance, or initial coverage limit. For plan years starting on or after January 1 of the first year more than 60 days after enactment, the shingles vaccine under Medicare Part D will have no cost sharing above the annual out-of-pocket threshold. Amendments to cost sharing for low-income individuals are also made. For plan years starting on or after January 1 of the first year more than 60 days after enactment, there will be no cost sharing for the shingles vaccine under Medicare Part D. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prevention, in collaboration with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, will conduct a study on vaccine uptake, including herpes zoster and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines. The study will analyze ways to increase vaccine coverage rates, reduce disparities, and focus on future vaccines like respiratory syncytial virus and clostridium difficile. The Secretary will conduct a study on vaccine uptake, including herpes zoster vaccine, to facilitate vaccination for Medicare beneficiaries. A report with recommendations for legislation will be submitted to Congress within 2 years.
