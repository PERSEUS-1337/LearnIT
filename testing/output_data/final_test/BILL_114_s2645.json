    "content": "The \"Global Respect Act\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the dignity, freedom, and equality of all human beings are fundamental to a thriving global community. Rights such as life, liberty, security, privacy, freedom of expression, and association are essential. There is a concerning trend of violence against LGBT individuals worldwide, with many countries criminalizing same-sex relations. Countries like Nigeria, Russia, Uganda, and Ukraine have passed or considered legislation targeting LGBT individuals. Thousands of individuals are affected by this discrimination annually. Every year, thousands of individuals worldwide face harassment, attack, arrest, and murder based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Perpetrators often go unpunished, fueled by homophobic and transphobic statements from government officials. Authorities have been complicit in abuses against LGBT individuals, including arbitrary arrest, torture, and sexual abuse. Celebrations of LGBT individuals and communities are crucial. LGBT celebrations like film festivals and Pride events are often forced underground due to inaction or harassment by local authorities. Laws criminalizing same-sex relations hinder access to HIV/AIDS treatment for LGBT individuals. Some countries are progressing in protecting the human rights of LGBT individuals. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate. \"Foreign person\" is defined as someone who is not a United States person.

The criteria for removing a foreign person from the list of human rights violators include credible information that they did not engage in the activity, appropriate prosecution, or a significant change in behavior with a commitment to not engage in such activities. Requests for removal can be made by the Chairperson or Ranking Member of the appropriate Congressional Committees. The President must provide a response regarding the status of a foreign person to the chairperson or ranking member to determine if they meet the criteria for being added to the list. The response can be classified if necessary for national security interests. If a foreign person is removed from the list, the President must share the information that led to the decision with the appropriate congressional committees. The President may submit required information in classified form if necessary for national security interests. The list must be published without regard to confidentiality requirements for visa records. SEC. 5. INADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS.

The Secretary of State will revoke visas and the Secretary of Homeland Security will remove ineligible individuals from the US. Waivers for national security interests may be granted by the Secretaries in consultation with the President.

The Act requires the President to submit an annual report to Congress on implementing the sanctions, including coordination with other countries. Other countries may be urged to impose similar sanctions. SEC. 7. DISCRIMINATION RELATED TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY. The Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor designates officers to track violence and restrictions on fundamental freedoms based on sexual orientation or gender identity in foreign countries. Amendments are made to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for annual country reports on human rights practices.
