The Director, also known as the \"drug czar,\" is responsible for setting policies, objectives, and priorities for the National Drug Control program, overseeing the implementation of the National Drug Control Strategy, and advising the President on changes in drug enforcement. Additionally, the Director works with state and local governments and represents drug policies to Congress. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was established in 1988 to coordinate the federal government's War on Drugs. The Director, also known as the \"drug czar,\" is responsible for setting policies, objectives, and priorities for the National Drug Control program, overseeing the implementation of the National Drug Control Strategy, and advising the President on changes in drug enforcement. The ONDCP's first reauthorizing act in 1994 strengthened the Director's powers to influence fund allocation and personnel within federal drug control departments, prohibited ONDCP officials from participating in federal election campaign activities, required the Director to evaluate the effectiveness of federal drug control efforts in each National Drug Control Strategy, and mandated specific measures of effectiveness in the evaluation. The ONDCP was reauthorized in 1998 with specific goals for reducing drug consumption and crime in the US. Congress required annual reports on progress in implementing the National Drug Control Strategy. The reauthorization expired in 2003, but funds were still appropriated. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was reauthorized in 2006 through the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006. R. Gil Kerlikowske was nominated as Director of ONDCP in 2009, promising to revitalize the agency by focusing on interdiction efforts, law enforcement, treatment, prevention, and research to reduce drug use and its consequences. A. Thomas McLellan was appointed as Deputy Director of ONDCP in 2009, with a focus on evidence-based approaches to reduce drug demand through prevention and treatment. His nomination, along with that of Kerlikowske, signaled a shift towards demand reduction measures in federal drug control policy. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will continue overseeing ONDCP and its programs. ONDCP's authorization will expire in FY2010, leading to reauthorization bills likely being introduced in the 111th Congress. ONDCP appropriations fall under the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittees. Certain programs, like the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, may face scrutiny in the upcoming Congress. In the House, oversight of ONDCP falls under the jurisdiction of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Oversight of ONDCP falls under the jurisdiction of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The committee's Domestic Policy Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Kucinich, held an oversight hearing on March 12, 2008, to examine the priorities of the 2008 National Drug Control Strategy, the FY2009 national drug control budget, and ONDCP's compliance with the reauthorization act. Chairman Kucinich highlighted issues of accountability and effectiveness at ONDCP during the hearing. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee's Domestic Policy Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Kucinich, held a hearing to address the lack of transparency and accountability at ONDCP, the failure to include all funding requests in the national drug control budget, and the difficulty in determining progress in combating drug abuse due to inconsistent performance measures and policy goals. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee's Domestic Policy Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Kucinich, held a hearing to address the imbalance in the national drug control budget between supply-side and demand-side programs. Chairman Kucinich criticized the growing share of the budget allocated to supply-side programs despite research showing that demand-side approaches are more cost-effective. Former ONDCP official John Carnevale also disagreed with the emphasis on supply reduction. In the 1990s, the focus shifted from interdiction to demand reduction in drug control efforts. However, there is now a renewed belief in the effectiveness of source and transit zone interdiction, despite lack of evidence. Former ONDCP official John Carnevale criticized the agency for not meeting its obligations and suggested restructuring to regain a meaningful role in shaping drug policy. Dr. Carnevale criticized ONDCP for not meeting its obligations and suggested restructuring to focus on evidence-based drug policy. Economist Rosalie Liccardo Pacula testified that the 2008 National Drug Control Strategy supports ineffective programs. According to Dr. Pacula, efforts to decrease cocaine and heroin supplies in the United States have been unsuccessful. Research shows that prevention and education programs work best in emerging drug markets, while treatment programs are more effective in mature drug markets. Given that marijuana, cocaine, and heroin markets are mature, treatment programs for heavy users are more cost-effective. In her testimony, Dr. Pacula criticized the current supply-side strategies in the War on Drugs, stating that they are ineffective for mature drug markets like cocaine and heroin. She recommended reallocating funds from unsupported programs to proven effective areas to better address substance abuse in the United States. This feedback from the oversight hearing could influence future appropriations for the ONDCP in FY2009 and beyond. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 (H.R. 6344) was passed by the House and Senate in December 2006, reauthorizing ONDCP through FY2010. The act includes amendments to the 1998 reauthorization, potentially impacting future appropriations and oversight of the War on Drugs. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 (H.R. 6344) amends provisions of the 1998 act, primarily focusing on changes made by H.R. 6344. The amendments or repeals made by H.R. 6344 to the expired ONDCP reauthorization act constitute the current law. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 (H.R. 6344) changes definitions in the expired law, moving domestic law enforcement responsibilities from the Office of Supply Reduction to the Office of State and Local Affairs. This aligns with ONDCP's current practices and emphasizes that domestic law enforcement serves a broader purpose than just supply reduction. The act also expands the definition of demand reduction. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 (H.R. 6344) expands the definition of demand reduction to include efforts abroad and redefines \"appropriate congressional committees.\" It also requires ONDCP to evaluate effectiveness by developing specific goals and performance measurements. The act gives the ONDCP Director the same \"rank and status\" as heads of executive departments. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 reauthorizes the structure of ONDCP with deputy directors for demand reduction, supply reduction, and state, local, and tribal affairs. The Deputy Director for Supply Reduction must have expertise in drug interdiction, while the Deputy Director for State, Local, and Tribal Affairs oversees specific programs. The act strengthens the authority of the Director and adds responsibilities to support substance abuse efforts. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 adds responsibilities to support substance abuse efforts, including coordinating with the private sector for research, seeking support from state and local officials, monitoring resource allocation, and reporting to Congress on ONDCP's consultations with state and local governments. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 gives the Director the authority to issue fund control notices to ensure compliance with the National Drug Control Strategy. Agencies must follow these notices when using appropriated funds for specific activities. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 grants the Director the power to issue fund control notices to enforce compliance with the National Drug Control Strategy. It also establishes the position of U.S. Interdiction Coordinator within the Department of Homeland Security, previously existing without statutory authority. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 grants the Director power to enforce compliance with the National Drug Control Strategy. It establishes the position of U.S. Interdiction Coordinator within the Department of Homeland Security, responsible for coordinating interdiction activities and developing a National Interdiction Command and Control Plan. The Director will assign ONDCP staff to assist the USIC in carrying out responsibilities. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 grants the Director power to enforce compliance with the National Drug Control Strategy and establishes the position of U.S. Interdiction Coordinator within the Department of Homeland Security. The Director can assign ONDCP staff to assist the USIC in carrying out responsibilities and may request staff from National Drug Control Program agencies to detail or assign staff to the Office of Supply Reduction. The National Interdiction Command and Control Plan (NICCP) prepared by the USIC will outline the federal government's strategy for drug interdiction, roles and responsibilities of relevant agencies, required resources, and recommendations for changes, issued in consultation with the Interdiction Committee. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 empowers the Director to enforce compliance with the National Drug Control Strategy and establishes the U.S. Interdiction Coordinator within the Department of Homeland Security. The USIC is required to provide an annual report to Congress, including the National Interdiction Command and Control Plan, data on drug seizures and patrol hours for the past 10 years, and any classified information separately. The Interdiction Committee plays a key role in this process. The Interdiction Committee (TIC) is established by the reauthorization act to coordinate drug interdiction efforts and provide advice on strategy and policies. TIC members meet at least once a year in person to review the National Interdiction Command and Control Plan. Additional meetings can be called by the Director or the current chairman as needed. The TIC holds meetings attended by members or their delegates. The chairman submits an annual report to the Director and Congress, with classified information presented separately. The reauthorization act mandates annual reports from various departments on drug control activities. The reauthorization act mandates annual reports on drug control activities, including reports on drug violation arrests, prosecutions, and seizures to aid resource allocation and oversight. The ONDCP Director develops a consolidated National Drug Control Program budget based on agency proposals, with revised budget methods resulting in lower funding requests. The reauthorization act mandates annual reports on drug control activities, including arrests, prosecutions, and seizures. Changes in budget methods led to lower funding requests for drug control agencies, with some agencies being eliminated from the budget altogether. Critics argue that the new budget distorts the true costs of the War on Drugs by excluding certain expenses, making the budget appear more balanced between enforcement and prevention. The reauthorization act requires drug control budgets to include all funds for drug control activities, including demand reduction, supply reduction, and law enforcement. If an activity serves both drug control and non-drug control purposes, the total funds requested must be calculated. The reauthorization act mandates that drug control budgets must include all funds for drug control activities, with detailed calculations for activities serving both drug control and non-drug control purposes. The Director must consult with drug control agencies and law enforcement organizations in developing the national drug control budget proposal, and is responsible for reviewing and certifying budget requests. H.R. 6344 introduces new requirements to the budget certification process, preventing the Director from approving any agency's proposed budget that requests funding for federal law enforcement. The reauthorization act mandates detailed calculations for drug control budgets, with the Director consulting with agencies and law enforcement. H.R. 6344 introduces new requirements, preventing funding for federal law enforcement activities that do not adequately compensate for transfers of drug enforcement resources. The reauthorization act reduces the threshold for reprogramming funds in the federal drug control budget from $5 million to $1 million. It also states that if the Director does not respond to a reprogramming request within 30 days, it will be considered approved and forwarded to Congress. The reauthorization act reduces the threshold for reprogramming funds in the federal drug control budget from $5 million to $1 million. If the Director does not respond to a reprogramming request within 30 days, it will be considered approved and forwarded to Congress. The National Drug Control Strategy remains a key responsibility of ONDCP, with annual strategies now required instead of a five-year strategy. Annual strategies must include five-year projections for program and budget priorities, due to Congress by February 1 each year. The annual strategies under the reauthorization act must include coordination with private sector entities for research and development of addiction medications, clinical trials, FDA approval, marketing, physician usage promotion, and insurance reimbursement. Additionally, a supplement is required to review the activities of each National Drug Control Program agency in relation to the National Drug Control Strategy. The reauthorization act removes specific numerical targets for reducing drug use but maintains the requirement for comprehensive goals. The Director must consult with various entities in developing and implementing the National Drug Control Strategy. The reauthorization act expands the entities the Director must consult with to include tribal officials, community and faith-based organizations, and foreign governments. It also emphasizes the commitment of state, local, and tribal officials and private organizations to support the National Drug Control Strategy goals. The reauthorization act expands consultation entities to include tribal officials, community organizations, and foreign governments. It emphasizes the commitment of various entities to support National Drug Control Strategy goals. The act requires a performance measurement system to be submitted annually with two- and five-year performance measures and targets for each goal. The Control Strategy goal is to reduce drug use, availability, and consequences. It will use data to measure performance and assess treatment effectiveness in reducing illicit drug use and criminal behavior. Changes in the expired act include removing requirements for performance objectives to conform with budgets and consultation with agencies. H.R. 6344 requires the Director to submit an annual report to Congress on the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, detailing the campaign's strategy, objectives, effectiveness, advertising plans, responsible fund usage, contracts, compliance measures, and security measures. The reauthorization act mandates the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to audit the operations of ONDCP, including various programs like the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program and the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The GAO report will evaluate the policies, activities, economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of ONDCP, providing recommendations for any necessary policy or management changes to prevent fraud and abuse. The reauthorization act expands statutory requirements for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program, reflecting congressional interest in its operation. Previous legislation did not explicitly state the program's purpose, but new bills aim to enhance cooperation and intelligence sharing among law enforcement agencies at federal, state, and local levels. The HIDTA Program aims to reduce the supply of illegal drugs in designated areas and the United States as a whole, with a focus on drug trafficking problems that impact the nation. Congressional bills have emphasized the dual purpose of HIDTAs in addressing local, regional, and national drug issues. The HIDTA Program aims to reduce the supply of illegal drugs in designated areas and the United States as a whole. H.R. 6344, now law, retains the consultative process for designating HIDTAs and allows interested law enforcement agencies to petition for designation. The reauthorization act for the HIDTA Program includes provisions for regular reviews by the Director, organization of HIDTAs, and governance by an Executive Board with representatives from federal and state/local agencies. The reauthorization act for the HIDTA Program allows the Director to use resources for terrorism-related investigations while ensuring that counterterrorism assistance remains incidental to the program's main focus on reducing drug availability and carrying out drug-related law enforcement activities. The reauthorization act for the HIDTA Program ensures that program resources are not solely directed towards terrorism activities, except in exceptional circumstances. The Director must now include a representative from the DEA in each HIDTA's Intelligence Support Center. Funding for each HIDTA is now detailed in ONDCP's annual budget justification to Congress, with a breakdown of requested amounts and justifications provided. The reauthorization act for the HIDTA Program allows the Director to use up to 10% of funds to address emerging drug trafficking threats, establish new HIDTAs, or expand existing ones. The funding level is determined based on current assessments of drug trafficking threats in each HIDTA, ensuring goals are met and supporting the National Drug Control Strategy. Additionally, a portion of HIDTA funds is allocated for investigating and prosecuting methamphetamine trafficking. The HIDTA Program reauthorization act requires the Director to submit reports to Congress detailing the specific purposes, goals, and performance evaluations of each HIDTA. This is to ensure effective measures are in place to address drug trafficking threats and support the National Drug Control Strategy. The HIDTA Program reauthorization act mandates the Director to provide Congress with reports on the performance of each HIDTA in achieving its goals. This is in response to OMB's criticism of the program's lack of results. The annual report aims to address this by assessing federally funded drug enforcement task forces within each HIDTA. The HIDTA Program mandates reports on task force cooperation, information sharing, and enforcement activities to reduce illegal drug availability. Coordination with joint terrorism task forces is also assessed for efficiency and effectiveness. The HIDTA reauthorization act requires the Director to submit annual reports evaluating law enforcement intelligence systems supported by HIDTAs, ensuring access to intelligence for various law enforcement agencies. The reports also assess the sharing of intelligence information among agencies to combat drug trafficking threats and improve information sharing. The HIDTA reauthorization act mandates improved sharing of drug enforcement intelligence among law enforcement agencies participating in HIDTA, including with the OCDETF's drug intelligence fusion center. The Director must submit an annual report on HIDTA funds used to investigate and prosecute methamphetamine trafficking organizations, including the discovery of manufacturing facilities. The HIDTA reauthorization act mandates improved sharing of drug enforcement intelligence among law enforcement agencies participating in HIDTA. The Director must certify that participating law enforcement entities provide laboratory seizure data to the national clandestine laboratory database. Appropriations to ONDCP for the HIDTA Program are authorized in increasing amounts from $240 million in FY2007 to $280 million in FY2011. The HIDTA Program was appropriated $227 million, incorporating the Dawson Family Community Protection Act. At least $7 million of funds must be used each year in areas with severe drug distribution issues. The funds are to ensure neighborhood safety, prevent witness intimidation, and combat illegal drug trafficking through various methods. Urban drug traffickers are spreading into rural and suburban areas to evade law enforcement efforts. The \"balloon effect\" refers to drug traffickers moving into rural, suburban, and smaller urban areas to avoid law enforcement. The HIDTA Program will assess this effect in the New York/New Jersey HIDTA by adding new counties and evaluating its response. The reauthorization act changes the title of the head of CTAC to \"Chief Scientist\" and requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to support ONDCP in counterdrug technology assessment. The reauthorization act grants statutory authority to CTAC's counterdrug technology transfer program for the first time. The Chief Scientist coordinates and implements the program, transferring technology directly to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies based on need and effectiveness. The Director may enter into agreements with the Secretary of Homeland Security to transfer technology with counterdrug and homeland security applications to law enforcement agencies. An annual report must be submitted to congressional committees detailing technology transfer requests, fulfilled requests, criteria for funding decisions, and future program needs based on expected changes in threats and technologies. The administration's FY2008 budget proposed ending CTAC's technology transfer program despite provisions in the reauthorization act. CTAC received a reduced budget of $1 million for research activities in FY2008, down from $20 million in FY2007. CTAC no longer accepts technology transfer applications from law enforcement agencies. The Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 governed the media campaign and instructed the ONDCP. The Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 governed the media campaign, instructing the ONDCP Director to conduct a national campaign to prevent drug abuse among young people in the US. The act was repealed by a reauthorization act that expanded program requirements and changed the campaign's purpose to focus on preventing drug abuse among youth. The reauthorization act expanded the National Drug Control Strategy campaign to target adults, requiring specific limits on campaign funds for creative services. The reauthorization act mandates that ads for the National Drug Control Strategy campaign be tested for effectiveness and evaluated annually. It also sets specific limits on the use of campaign funds for advertising time and space. The reauthorization act mandates testing and evaluation of ads for the National Drug Control Strategy campaign. It sets limits on campaign funds for advertising time and space. The Director, PDFA, and media buying contractor have specific responsibilities in implementing the campaign. PDFA develops strategies to address drug threats like methamphetamine and ecstasy. The Director contracts with a media buying contractor for all advertising in the campaign, except for ads provided by other nonprofit entities under the matching requirement. This includes ads for high-priority needs, minority audiences, or when the PDFA is unable to provide. The contractor's responsibilities include reviewing advertising material and reaching out to specific audiences. The Director contracts with a media buying contractor to plan and purchase advertising for the campaign. The contractor cannot provide services that the Director deems should be provided by the PDFA. The reauthorization act prohibits campaign funds from being used for partisan political purposes or express advocacy. This is significant as the Director has been accused of using campaign ads to oppose certain voter initiatives. The reauthorization act prohibits campaign funds from being used for partisan political purposes or express advocacy. Campaign ads must promote reducing or preventing illicit drug use, with media companies required to match advertising time or space for the antidrug effort. At least 70% of no-cost match advertising must directly relate to substance abuse prevention, increasing to 85% if less than $125 million is appropriated. Remaining ads must still include an antidrug message. The reauthorization act mandates audits to prevent overcharges by campaign contractors. Ogilvy & Mather employees were accused of over-billing the government. The Director must report annually to Congress on campaign strategy and achievements. The reauthorization act mandates audits to prevent overcharges by campaign contractors, including policies to ensure responsible use of federal funds. It also authorizes the Director to focus on preventing youth marijuana use in campaign advertisements. The reauthorization act authorizes appropriations for a media campaign to reduce methamphetamine use, with funds potentially redirected to other drug reduction efforts if methamphetamine seizures decrease by 75%. Appropriations are set at $195 million for FY2007 and FY2008, and $210 million for FY2009 through FY2011. The act also allows for necessary appropriations for FY2006 through FY2010. The ONDCP reauthorization in the 109th Congress was controversial due to the sunset provision. H.R. 2829 aimed to repeal the provision, authorizing ONDCP indefinitely. An amendment for a five-year sunset provision was rejected. S. 2560 proposed a five-year extension, which was adopted in H.R. 6344, extending ONDCP's life through FY2010. The reauthorization act designates the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency as the U.S. representative responsible for coordinating with other anti-doping organizations involved in amateur athletic competitions recognized by the U.S. Olympic Committee to ensure integrity, athlete health, and prevent the use of performance-enhancing drugs. It also authorizes appropriations for the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and reauthorizes the Drug-Free Communities Support Program. The Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997 is amended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through FY2012, authorizing appropriations of $109 million for FY2008 to $129 million for FY2012. The act limits administrative costs to 3% for ONDCP and 5% for program implementation. Grantees have the right to a fair appeal process before suspension or termination. The Director must submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment detailing the appeals process. The maximum value of individual grants under the program is increased to $125,000. $2 million must be granted annually from 2008 to 2012 to the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America. The reauthorization act authorizes the operations of five counterdrug schools by the National Guard and requires an annual report to Congress on their activities. $30 million is authorized for the Department of Defense annually from 2006 to 2010. The National Methamphetamine Information Clearinghouse Act of 2006 authorizes $30 million annually for the Department of Defense from 2006 to 2010. It establishes the National Methamphetamine Information Clearinghouse within the Department of Justice, creating a National Methamphetamine Advisory Council with specific member requirements. The council members will not be compensated but will receive travel and per diem expenses. The NMIC aims to promote information sharing on successful programs related to law enforcement, treatment, and social services. The National Methamphetamine Information Clearinghouse Act of 2006 authorizes funding for successful programs related to law enforcement, treatment, and social services for methamphetamine production and use. It includes a toll-free number and website for information on methamphetamine effects, treatment programs, grants, and a platform for qualified entities to share related information. The website will have a restricted section for law enforcement organizations. The National Methamphetamine Information Clearinghouse Act of 2006 authorizes funding for successful programs related to law enforcement, treatment, and social services for methamphetamine production and use. It includes a restricted section on the website accessible only by law enforcement organizations, containing strategies and training techniques to combat methamphetamine. The advisory council will review and determine the posting of submitted items within specific timeframes. $500,000 is authorized for FY2007 to establish the clearinghouse. The reauthorization act allocates $500,000 for FY2007 to establish the clearinghouse and council, with additional funding for operation in fiscal years 2007 through 2009. It repeals outdated sections related to a Parents Advisory Council on Youth Drug Abuse and the Treasury Department's Special Forfeiture Fund. Amendments are made to the Controlled Substances Act regarding registration requirements for practitioners dispensing narcotic drugs. The Director is required to submit reports to Congress. The reauthorization act mandates the Director to submit a report to Congress within 180 days, evaluating law enforcement intelligence systems used for drug trafficking. It focuses on the compatibility of systems, information sharing among agencies, and measures to promote effective sharing. The reauthorization act requires the Director to submit a comprehensive strategy to Congress within 90 days, addressing the increased threat from South American heroin and opium poppy cultivation in Peru. The strategy includes efforts to eliminate the problem at the source, interdiction, precursor chemical controls, demand reduction, treatment, alternative development programs, citizen involvement, and assessment of funding needed to address threats from South American heroin, Colombian heroin, and Peruvian coca. The reauthorization act authorizes an appropriation of $1.5 million annually to advise states on drug issues based on model state drug laws. It also requires a study on iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesic drugs. The reauthorization act authorizes an appropriation of $1.5 million annually to advise states on drug issues based on model state drug laws. Additionally, a study on iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesic drugs in Schedules II and III of the Controlled Substances Act is required. The study aims to assess the rate of iatrogenic addiction, its impact on individuals and society, and the abuse liability of prescription opioids when used properly for medical purposes. The reauthorization act mandates a study on iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesic drugs in Schedules II and III of the Controlled Substances Act. The study aims to determine the rate of iatrogenic addiction, its impact, and abuse liability when used properly for medical purposes. A report on the study's status must be submitted to Congress within one year of enactment. Additionally, the Director is required to submit a strategy to Congress within 120 days to stop online advertisements for scheduled prescription drugs without a lawful prescription. The reauthorization act mandates a study on the illegal diversion and inappropriate uses of prescription drugs. The report will include methods to evaluate the extent and nature of potential problems associated with inappropriate uses of prescription drugs and a comprehensive strategy to address these issues. The Director must submit a comprehensive strategy to Congress within 90 days to address the increased threat from Afghan heroin. The strategy includes efforts on opium crop eradication, destruction of heroin stockpiles and production facilities, interdiction, demand reduction, and cooperation between relevant agencies. Classified information will be presented separately. Additionally, a Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy must be submitted every two years. The government's Counternarcotics Strategy aims to prevent drug trafficking across the US-Mexico border, outlining roles, resources, and ending tunnel construction. The Director will consult with relevant agencies, and may suggest changes to existing authorities or laws. Classified information will be submitted separately to Congress. The reauthorization act mandates the Director to submit a report to Congress within 90 days, detailing a plan for an expedited scientific study on the use of mycoherbicides for eliminating illicit drug crops. The study must evaluate human health and environmental impacts of mycoherbicides derived from soil fungus. Originally, H.R. 2829 required testing in a major drug-producing nation, but H.R. 6344 changed it to be conducted in U.S. territory due to public opposition. The reauthorization act now requires the Director to conduct a study on state laws regarding precursor chemical controls in consultation with the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws. A report must be submitted to Congress within six months, comparing state laws, their effectiveness, and best practices. Additionally, a report on methamphetamine-related activities by state drug-endangered children programs must be submitted within six months, including analysis of best practices and recommendations for a national policy. The reauthorization act mandates a study on drug court programs holding hearings in nontraditional public places like schools to deter drug abuse. The Director must include a report on this study in the Drug Control Strategy due to Congress. Additionally, within one year, a report on tribal government representation in High Intensity Drug Trafficking must be submitted. The reauthorization act requires the Director to submit a report to Congress on tribal government representation in the HIDTA Program, including a list of participating tribes, rationale for their representation, and recommendations for increasing tribal involvement. Additionally, reports on drug testing in schools and performance bonuses at ONDCP are also mandated. The reauthorization act mandates the submission of a report to Congress on tribal government representation in the HIDTA Program, drug testing in schools, and performance bonuses at ONDCP. ONDCP is required to include a notice of sponsorship in all paid advertisements to prevent the distribution of \"video news releases.\" The ONDCP requested an exemption from identifying sponsored advertisements for their media campaign, but the FCC denied it. Legislation was introduced in Congress to nullify the FCC order. The reauthorization act expanded the exemption to all public announcements by ONDCP and mandated competitive awards for demonstration programs. The Director will provide competitive awards to eligible partnerships for demonstration programs aimed at promoting abstinence among chronic hard-drug users in the community under criminal justice supervision. Funding will support drug testing, sanctions, and rehabilitation efforts for these individuals. Eligible partnerships must involve three or more agencies or organizations. The Director will award funding to eligible partnerships involving multiple agencies or organizations for programs promoting abstinence among hard-drug users under criminal justice supervision. The program includes drug testing, sanctions for noncompliance, and rehabilitation efforts. It also integrates data infrastructure for real-time tracking of individuals. The Director will award funding to eligible partnerships for programs promoting abstinence among hard-drug users under criminal justice supervision.
