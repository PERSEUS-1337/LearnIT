    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 236.14 of the Penal Code allows individuals arrested or convicted of nonviolent offenses while being victims of human trafficking to petition the court for vacatur relief. The court may consolidate multiple convictions from different jurisdictions into one hearing with the agreement of the petitioner and prosecutorial agencies. If the petition is opposed or deemed necessary, a hearing will be scheduled including testimony by the petitioner and supporting evidence. The court may vacate the conviction and expunge the arrests if the petitioner was a victim of human trafficking at the time of the nonviolent crime, the crime was a result of trafficking, the victim is trying to distance themselves from trafficking, and it is in the best interest of justice. The order must state that the petitioner was a trafficking victim when the offense was committed. The court may vacate the conviction and expunge the arrests if the petitioner was a victim of human trafficking at the time of the nonviolent crime. Financial restitution orders benefiting the victim of a nonviolent crime cannot be relieved unless already paid. A person arrested for a nonviolent offense while being a victim of human trafficking can petition the court for relief. If it's proven that the arrest was due to human trafficking, there is a presumption that requirements for relief have been met. If the court orders relief for a person arrested due to human trafficking, the law enforcement agencies involved must seal and destroy their records of the arrest and court order for three years or within one year after the court order is granted. The petitioner will receive a copy of the court order regarding the destruction of the arrest records. A petition under this section must be filed within a reasonable time after the person has stopped being a victim of human trafficking or after seeking services for being a victim, considering safety concerns for the petitioner and others. (m) Official documentation of a petitioner's status as a victim of human trafficking can be used as evidence that their participation in the offense was due to being a victim of human trafficking. \"Official documentation\" refers to any documentation from a federal, state, or local agency showing the petitioner's status. (n) A petitioner or their attorney may be excused from appearing in person at a hearing if the court finds a compelling reason, allowing them to participate via phone, videoconference, or other electronic means. (o) A petitioner with an order under this section can legally deny an arrest, conviction, or adjudication that is set aside. (p) Records of the arrest, conviction, or adjudication cannot be shared with state licensing boards. (q) Public records related to the petition will not reveal the petitioner's full name. (r) The court can take further action to fulfill the section's purposes. If the court denies the application due to insufficient evidence for vacatur, the denial may be without prejudice. The court can provide reasons for the denial and allow the applicant time to cure deficiencies. \"Nonviolent offense\" refers to offenses not listed in Section 667.5. \"Nonviolent offense\" refers to offenses not listed in Section 667.5. \"Vacate\" means the arrest and any adjudications or convictions are deemed not to have occurred, with records sealed and destroyed. \"Victim of human trafficking\" refers to victims of specific crimes. SEC. 2. This act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement for other mandated costs will be made if determined by the Commission on State Mandates. The Legislature adds Section 236.14 to the Penal Code, limiting public access to the full name of a petitioner seeking relief as a victim of human trafficking for privacy and recovery purposes."
