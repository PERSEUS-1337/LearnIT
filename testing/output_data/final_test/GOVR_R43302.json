    "content": "The report examines various postsecondary education issues including college costs, Pell Grants, federal student loans, bankruptcy, noncitizen eligibility for aid, tax benefits, institutional quality, college completion, and campus safety. Concerns about college affordability are rising due to increasing prices that outpace inflation. Government appropriations, gifts, endowments, and tuition payments finance postsecondary education in the US. Public four-year institutions have average tuition, fees, room, and board costs of around $17,000 for in-state students and $21,000 for out-of-state students. College costs have been a growing concern, with average tuition at public four-year institutions around $17,000 for in-state students and $21,000 for out-of-state students, and $38,000 at private not-for-profit four-year institutions. Factors contributing to the rise in college prices include declining state higher education appropriations, fluctuating institutional endowments, escalating costs of labor and technology, and the persistent demand for postsecondary education. The rising college costs are influenced by factors such as declining state funding, increasing labor and technology costs, and the persistent demand for postsecondary education. Colleges have pricing power due to durable demand, diverse institutional missions, and a focus on enhancing student experiences rather than efficient use of revenues. Other factors like faculty governance, tenure policies, and federal financial aid availability may also contribute to price increases. There is little disagreement about the trends in prices and the financial strain on families and students pursuing postsecondary education. Federal policymakers have various options to address affordability, including student aid programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Imperfect information is a common problem for students choosing among colleges. Imperfect information is a common problem for students choosing among colleges, with a lack of transparency regarding college prices due to extensive tuition discounting and governmental grants. This results in students not having a clear sense of the price they will actually pay when applying to schools. The lack of transparency in college pricing is a common issue for students, as net prices can fluctuate annually based on factors like financial need and merit. The federal government has implemented provisions to address this, requiring colleges to provide more information on net prices and offer online calculators. Net price calculators are criticized for lacking sophistication and being cumbersome to use. Suggestions include requiring more comprehensive data, different displays of data, and easier-to-use calculators. It is also recommended to provide net price estimates for the full program based on student characteristics that impact calculated need and net price over multiple years. Consumer information on college pricing and student outcomes is crucial for students to make informed decisions about their educational investments. Calls for improvements in the availability and quality of data on employment and earnings outcomes for college graduates have been made. This information is not consistently available, making it difficult for students to assess the potential return on their educational investments. Data collection and reporting on student outcomes could be supported or required by the federal government, although privacy concerns may arise. Better information on price and student outcomes could help students make better decisions about their education. Proposals have been considered to tie federal student aid programs to colleges' price increases, based on a college affordability index like the consumer price index. These proposals aim to limit access to aid for colleges with excessive price hikes and provide more aid to schools with reasonable price increases. The growth of online college courses and programs challenges the traditional labor-intensive nature of higher education. Approximately 6.7 million students are enrolled in online courses at degree-granting institutions. Online courses at degree-granting institutions are popular, with 6.7 million students enrolled. Some instructional models aim to reduce costs by using specialists for course development and lower-cost staff for coaching. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are also becoming more common, offering free versions of college courses. MOOCs, free online college courses, have around 4 million registrants, but completion rates are low. They are considered for addressing demand for introductory courses and potentially offering college credit. The role of online courses in reducing costs is still evolving, and federal involvement may include revising eligibility rules. Federal student aid, comprising roughly 75% of aid provided to students, is crucial but may contribute to rising college prices. Limiting federal financial assistance could impact access to education. Limiting federal financial assistance could potentially lower college prices by restricting students' ability to rely on federal benefits instead of personal resources. Policy makers could address concerns about aid contributing to price increases by reevaluating aid policies, such as targeting aid more effectively or reducing aid options. This could involve eliminating certain types of aid, adjusting benefit levels, or changing eligibility criteria. The 113th Congress may consider ways to address the need for additional discretionary funding for the Pell Grant program in the current fiscal year to ensure criteria for aid awards can cover educational expenses. Few proposals have been made to reduce aid on a large scale to help contain prices, with potential tradeoffs in college access and attainment. Decoupling student aid awards from institutional cost of attendance is one option for refocusing aid. The Federal Pell Grant program may need additional discretionary funding to maintain maximum benefits starting in FY2015. Congress could consider various reforms to improve the program's long-term funding outlook. The program, which provided $31.7 billion to 9.1 million undergraduate students in FY2012, is the largest federal grant aid source for postsecondary education. The Pell Grant program provided over $33.5 billion to 9.7 million undergraduate students in FY2011. Pell Grants are need-based aid for undergraduates, with no set income threshold for eligibility. In FY2011, 74% of recipients had a family income of $30,000 or less. The maximum Pell Grant award for AY 2013-2014 is $5,645, with a base award of $4,860 and a mandatory add-on award of $785. The Pell Grant program is primarily funded through annual discretionary appropriations, with some funding from indefinite mandatory appropriations. The program is exempt from budget sequestration cuts. The Congressional Budget Office projected a funding surplus in FY2014 due to lower demand and available mandatory funds. This surplus may help maintain the maximum award at $4,860 in AY2014-2015, but there could be a funding gap of $800 million in FY2015. The Pell Grant program faces a potential discretionary funding gap of $800 million in AY2015-2016. If funding levels remain the same, there could be an annual average funding gap of $5.8 billion from FY2016 to FY2023. Analysts are calling for broader reforms to address long-term funding challenges under spending limitations imposed by the BCA. Some analysts are calling for broader reforms to address long-term funding challenges in the Pell Grant program. The 113th Congress may explore reform options to ensure adequate funding in FY2015 and consider policy reforms for the program's long-term sustainability. Potential reform options include eligibility criteria for reduced Pell Grant aid and defining full-time enrollment for receiving aid. The discussion revolves around potential reforms for the Pell Grant program, including the possibility of defining full-time enrollment criteria, streamlining the application process, and targeting aid more effectively towards low-income students. Suggestions include using existing federal poverty guidelines for eligibility determination and implementing changes to the need analysis methodology to better reflect applicants' financial situations. The current funding structure of the Pell Grant program is being analyzed for potential changes to ensure students receive annual increases in the maximum award. The program may require additional discretionary appropriations to maintain the current base award, while future annual increases in the add-on award are provided through indefinite mandatory appropriations. Constraints on discretionary appropriations under the BCA could impact the Pell Grant's purchasing power in the short term. The Pell Grant program's funding structure may be affected in the short term, despite long-term increases in add-on award amounts. Questions arise about redirecting mandatory appropriations to supplement discretionary funding, converting the program to a full entitlement, and finding cost savings in federal student loan programs to support Pell Grants. Considerations include potential changes to federal loan programs, impacts on students receiving Pell Grant aid, and the continuation of administrative cost allowances for institutions of higher education. The Pell Grant program raises questions about cost allowances for institutions of higher education and potential outcome metrics for Pell Grant aid recipients. Federal student loans are a significant source of aid for postsecondary education expenses. The 113th Congress may review federal student loan policy, including loan terms, program administration, and costs. Federal student loans are administered through the Direct Loan and Federal Perkins Loan programs by the U.S. Department of Education. The FFEL program, which offers federally guaranteed student loans, is also managed by ED. A variety of federally guaranteed student loans are available through the Direct Loan and Federal Perkins Loan programs, including Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduates, graduate, and professional students, Direct PLUS Loans for graduate, professional students, and parents of dependent undergraduates, Federal Perkins Loans for undergraduates, and Direct Consolidation Loans for existing borrowers to combine multiple loans. In recent years, changes have been made to federal student loans, including extending eligibility for PLUS Loans to graduate and professional students, increasing borrowing limits for undergraduate students, introducing income-based repayment and Pay-As-You-Earn plans, and establishing a Public Service Loan Forgiveness program for Direct Loan borrowers. Federal student loan borrowing has increased substantially in recent years, with a combined total of $65 billion in federal student loans made in FY2007, increasing to an estimated $107 billion in FY2013. Direct Loans now have market-indexed, fixed interest rates, and a new Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is available. The total outstanding balance of federal student loans has increased significantly, reaching over $1 trillion by the end of the 3rd quarter of FY2013. The percentage of undergraduate students borrowing federal student loans has also increased, with an average amount borrowed rising from $5,100 in AY2007-2008 to $6,500 in AY2011-2012. The outstanding balance of federal student loans has exceeded $1 trillion, making it the nation's second-largest consumer debt after mortgages. Over 38 million individuals currently have federal student loan debt, with many struggling to repay. Delinquencies and defaults have been on the rise in recent years. The Direct Loan program is classified as a federal credit program, with costs accounted for on an accrual basis as per the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The Direct Loan program, a federal credit program, projects negative subsidy rates for student loans, indicating the government expects to earn more than the cost of making the loans. The 113th Congress may consider changes to federal student loan policies. The 113th Congress may consider reconfiguring federal student loan programs, which currently offer five types of loans to three classes of borrowers. Need-based loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, while non-need-based loans are available to all three groups. The Direct Loan program projects negative subsidy rates, indicating potential government earnings from loan costs. The availability and types of federal student loans are being questioned, including Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates and the Perkins Loan program. Loan amounts depend on various factors like the student's school cost, financial assistance, and expected family contribution. The Direct Loan program offers entitlements to qualified borrowers with annual borrowing limits ranging from low amounts for undergraduates to expansive limits for graduate and professional students and parents. Cumulative borrowing limits for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans range from $31,000 for undergraduates to $138,500 for graduate and professional students, with no specified limits for PLUS Loans. Perkins Loans have separate borrowing limits. The aim is to prevent students from over-borrowing. Existing borrowing limits aim to prevent students from over-borrowing early in their academic careers while making federal student loans available to senior students and parents. Concerns include the amount of debt incurred, rising college prices, and the potential for open-ended borrowing opportunities to drive up college costs. Questions arise about revising federal policies on loan amounts and granting financial aid administrators more authority to limit borrowing. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 made changes to student loan interest rates, setting them according to a market-indexed, fixed formula. Rates are indexed to 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes yield, with an add-on premium. Interest rate caps limit maximum rates. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 set student loan interest rates based on a market-indexed, fixed formula tied to 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes yield with an add-on premium. Interest rate caps limit maximum rates, and the rate remains fixed for the duration of the loan. Loans made prior to AY2013-2014 are not affected by the changes. Borrower rates align with market conditions at the time of loan origination, insulating borrowers from market rate fluctuations. Borrowers cannot refinance their loans if market rates subsequently change. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 set student loan interest rates based on a market-indexed, fixed formula tied to 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes yield with an add-on premium. Borrower rates align with market conditions at the time of loan origination, insulating borrowers from market rate fluctuations. However, the Act does not allow borrowers to refinance their loans if market rates subsequently drop. Interest rate deliberations involve balancing low-cost financing opportunities for students with limiting the federal government's budgetary costs. Interest rate deliberations include issues such as negative subsidy rates on federal loans, refinancing options for borrowers of fixed interest rate federal student loans, and offsetting increased costs to the government. Student loan cohort default rates are used to hold institutions accountable for loan repayment. The Department of Education uses different periods for calculating cohort default rates for various types of loans. Schools with high default rates may lose eligibility for federal loan programs. The Department is implementing \"gainful employment\" measures to assess student loan debt-to-earnings ratios. The Department of Education is implementing gainful employment measures to address issues of institutional accountability in federal student loan repayment. Questions arise about institutions' responsibility for student loan repayment, inclusion of PLUS Loans in default rate calculations, and the balance between accountability and borrowing limits. The terms and conditions of federal student loans offer flexible repayment options, including income-based plans and loan consolidation to lower monthly payments. Deferments and forbearance are also available for borrowers in need of repayment relief. Some borrowers can lower monthly loan payments by extending the repayment term or utilizing deferments and forbearance. Various loan forgiveness and repayment programs exist for borrowers, including options based on work, service, or financial circumstances. Federal student loans can be discharged in cases of total disability or death. Despite available repayment relief options, many borrowers still struggle with delinquency or default. Issues surrounding repayment relief include helping borrowers in economic hardship and concerns about the complexity of available benefits. Some issues surrounding repayment relief include streamlining benefits for a more coherent approach, extending repayment plans to a broader class of borrowers, automatic enrollment in plans, evaluating the generosity of plans, and assessing the effectiveness of loan forgiveness programs. Student loans, including private ones, are generally not dischargeable in bankruptcy since 1998. However, in certain cases, a student loan may be discharged if it imposes an undue hardship on the debtor. The main issues in this area revolve around whether all student loans should be exempt from discharge and the criteria for proving undue hardship. The 113th Congress may explore the treatment of student loans in bankruptcy proceedings, specifically regarding the \"undue hardship\" standard for discharging student loans. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 changed how private student loans were handled in bankruptcy, with some arguing that these loans may cause greater financial distress due to higher interest rates and less flexible repayment options. Private student loans are different from other unsecured debt and making them dischargeable in bankruptcy could lead to fewer lenders and higher interest rates. The 113th Congress may address the definition of \"undue hardship\" for discharging student loans, as it is not explicitly defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Currently, courts use the \"Brunner test\" to determine undue hardship, but there is inconsistency in its application. The Brunner test is used to determine undue hardship for discharging student loans in bankruptcy, but its application varies among courts. The First and Eighth Circuit Courts have not adopted the Brunner test, with the Eighth Circuit using a \"totality of the circumstances\" test. The eligibility of non-U.S. citizens for federal student aid is a contentious issue. The eligibility of non-U.S. citizens for federal student aid has been a contentious issue for decades, especially in educational policies. While the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a Texas statute restricting unauthorized student aliens from free public education, federal laws limiting noncitizen access to higher education financial aid remain unchallenged. Noncitizens, who made up 25 million in the U.S. in 2010, are less likely to have a high school education compared to native-born citizens. The 1996 immigration and welfare laws restricted federal benefits eligibility for noncitizens, including lawful permanent residents (LPRs) and unauthorized aliens. The Higher Education Amendments of 1986 limited federal student aid programs to U.S. citizens and LPRs. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 established comprehensive restrictions on eligibility for federal assistance programs. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) established restrictions on noncitizens' eligibility for federal public benefits, barring unauthorized aliens from most benefits. The U.S. Department of Education did not classify Higher Education Act (HEA) programs as means-tested benefits, allowing lawful permanent residents access while maintaining the bar on unauthorized aliens and temporary residents. Since the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Department of Education verifies the immigration status of federal financial aid applicants through the SAVE system, including international students. Unauthorized alien students, also known as \"DREAM Act kids\" or \"DREAMers,\" pose policy challenges. In January 2011, there were 1.4 million unauthorized alien children under 18, 1.6 million aged 18-24, and 3.7 million aged 25-34 in the U.S. These individuals are ineligible for federal benefits. Individuals aged 25 to 34 are ineligible for federal student financial aid due to a provision enacted in 1996. In 2012, DHS announced deferred action for certain individuals brought to the US as children. They may be considered \"lawfully present\" for specific purposes under the INA. Foreign nationals with temporary EADs can legally obtain SSNs. Foreign nationals with temporary EADs can legally obtain SSNs, but this does not make them eligible for federal programs. Immigration reform is a legislative priority, focusing on revisions to legal immigration and addressing unauthorized aliens. The issue of HEA student aid programs being considered a means-tested federal benefit may arise in comprehensive immigration reform discussions. Proponents argue that allowing DREAM Act or CIR beneficiaries to access HEA aid programs would benefit the national economy by increasing their human capital. Opponents believe it would reward illegal behavior and attract more unauthorized aliens. The public charge ground of inadmissibility is cited as a concern for potential increase in LPR admission. The public charge ground of inadmissibility under 212(a) excludes aliens likely to become a public charge. Advocates propose allowing DREAM Act or CIR beneficiaries access to student loans and work-study programs but not federal grants. This option aims to promote higher education without a significant federal investment. The 113th Congress may consider policy options for English language and civics tests for immigrant integration and naturalization. This includes expanding, conditioning, or barring eligibility for federally assisted programs for foreign nationals obtaining provisional legal residence. These issues are relevant for legislation scoring and may also be examined in the context of postsecondary education tax benefits. Tax benefits for postsecondary education have evolved over nearly 60 years, now including tax credits that directly reduce tax liability. There are currently fourteen tax benefits available for college students and parents, including credits, deductions, and exclusions. Tax credits reduce taxes owed on a dollar for dollar basis, with nonrefundable credits limited to taxes owed. Tax deductions reduce taxable income, while tax exclusions exclude certain income from taxation. Higher education tax benefits fall into three categories. Higher education tax benefits fall into three categories: incentives for current year expenses, preferential tax treatment of student loans, and incentives for saving for college. The cost to the federal government for these benefits is estimated to be $187.8 billion between 2013 and 2017. The 113th Congress may consider modifying postsecondary education tax provisions, especially in the context of tax reform, taking into account factors like the effectiveness of the benefits in achieving their goals, such as increasing college attendance. Tax-based aid impacts college attendance, but 93% of recipients would attend college without it. Policy goals, payment timing, income levels, and complexity affect tax benefits' effectiveness compared to student aid. Consolidating similar tax benefits may reduce complexity. Deductions and exclusions benefit middle- and upper-income taxpayers. Tax incentives for postsecondary education raise questions about targeting benefits, coordination with federal student aid, simplification of administration, and changes to tax treatment of student loans. Deductions and exclusions favor middle- and upper-income taxpayers, while partially refundable credits benefit low-income taxpayers. The current discussion revolves around the tax treatment of student loans, including deductions for interest paid and the taxability of forgiven debt. There is a question of whether distinctions in tax treatment should be maintained and if there should be increased coordination between the IRS and the Department of Education regarding loan repayment based on borrower income. The 113th Congress may explore issues related to the quality of educational programs at institutions of higher education and how this impacts eligibility for federal student aid programs. The Higher Education Act does not establish specific educational quality standards for institutions. The Higher Education Act does not set specific educational quality standards for institutions of higher education, but it does have requirements that indirectly reflect an institution's ability to offer a quality education. Institutions must meet standards related to accreditation, program length, and funding sources to participate in Title IV federal student aid programs. There is a focus on whether students are receiving a quality education and if the federal investment in postsecondary education is prudent. The 113th Congress may consider topics related to institutional accreditation for Title IV aid programs. Accreditation by an ED-recognized agency is crucial for accessing federal funds, indicating institutional quality and financial stability. Congress may debate whether to shift accreditation focus to student achievement rather than administrative measures. The 113th Congress may consider shifting accreditation focus to student achievement measures, such as graduation or job placement rates, rather than administrative processes. There are concerns about accrediting agencies establishing separate standards for distance education and issues related to identifying student identity fraud, inconsistent accreditation standards, and lack of resources for distance education program reviews. Many programmatic accrediting agencies accredit individual programs within IHEs, although it is not a requirement for Title IV eligibility. Employers often require graduates from accredited programs, and some state licensure requirements mandate graduation from an accredited program. Congress may need to address federal student aid availability for students in programs without accreditation. Undergraduate programs at various institutions must meet minimum instructional time requirements for Title IV federal student aid eligibility. Programs are typically measured in credit hours. Undergraduate programs at institutions must meet minimum instructional time requirements for Title IV federal student aid eligibility, typically measured in credit hours defined by ED regulations. There is no implicit \"seat time\" requirement, allowing institutions to set their own academic standards. With the rise of online courses, Congress may need to consider applying instructional time requirements to online education. Congress may need to consider applying instructional time requirements to online course offerings for Title IV eligibility, including exploring alternative criteria like student outcomes. Additionally, there is a 90/10 rule for proprietary institutions to derive at least 10% of revenue from non-Title IV sources. The 90/10 rule for proprietary institutions requires them to derive at least 10% of revenue from non-Title IV sources, such as earnings, savings, private education loans, and military benefits. Congress may address issues related to this rule, including whether to eliminate, maintain, or modify the percentage of funds allowed from Title IV sources. The gainful employment rules and states' authorization of schools are under court review. The Department of Education is developing new regulations for programs preparing students for gainful employment. Concerns about low college completion rates, especially among certain groups, are raised. Increasing postsecondary completion is argued to maintain living standards and compete globally. The importance of increasing postsecondary education levels is highlighted for maintaining living standards, competing globally, supporting the labor market, promoting economic well-being, enhancing democracy, and achieving a return on federal investment. Concerns arise about the competitiveness of the U.S. workforce against foreign countries with higher educational attainment levels. Domestic employers are raising skill and credential expectations. Federal government funding has been significant in improving access to education. The federal government has allocated billions of dollars to improve access to postsecondary education through college preparation programs and federal student aid. Policy discussions are now focused on increasing postsecondary completion. Potential policy approaches include supporting postsecondary education preparation, institutions, and students. Efforts to support preparation within secondary schools and ease the transition to postsecondary institutions are recommended. Efforts are being made to improve postsecondary completion rates by supporting adults returning to education, increasing public understanding of college costs, incentivizing programs that decrease time to completion, and holding institutions accountable for student outcomes. Additionally, there is a focus on improving student retention and completion through research, evaluation, and implementation of methods to measure and increase college completions. Efforts to increase college completions include granting maximum credit for prior experience and coursework, providing student support services, offering incentives for completion, and accommodating diverse student needs. Security concerns in postsecondary education are a top priority for governments and institutions. The Obama Administration and ED are examining school and IHE security following tragic events. The Clery Act requires institutions to report campus crime statistics to participate in federal student aid programs. IHEs must provide campus security information and crime statistics to students and employees. Concerns exist that FERPA may hinder efforts to improve campus safety by restricting the release of student education records. Some commentators question if FERPA's exception for releasing education records in emergencies is too narrow. After the Virginia Tech shootings, Congress amended the HEA to clarify rules for disclosing information about students posing a risk of harm. Institutions disclosing such information in good faith are not liable. Bullying and harassment are also linked to school safety, but current federal law does not address this issue. Current federal law does not explicitly prohibit bullying in schools, but federal civil rights statutes can be used to combat it under certain circumstances. Discrimination or harassment based on race, color, national origin, disability, or sex in educational programs receiving federal funds is prohibited, including peer harassment (bullying) that creates a hostile environment and is encouraged, tolerated, or ignored by school officials. In 2010, the Department of Education issued guidance on how student bullying or harassment may violate federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title IX for sex discrimination and Title VI for national origin discrimination. The 113th Congress may consider legislative options, such as providing federal funding to assist schools in addressing bullying. The 113th Congress may consider providing federal funding to assist IHEs in developing emergency management plans, increasing access to mental health services for students, reducing bullying and harassment, prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion, and enhancing campus security. Additionally, there may be amendments to FERPA regarding the disclosure of student mental health records without consent."
