The \"Health Care Price Transparency Promotion Act of 2006\" aims to increase transparency of hospital charges and provide consumers with estimates of out-of-pocket costs for health care services. The \"Health Care Price Transparency Promotion Act of 2006\" requires states to disclose hospital charges and provide access to information, as well as provide estimates of out-of-pocket costs for future health care services. The \"Health Care Price Transparency Promotion Act of 2006\" mandates states to disclose hospital charges and provide access to information for individuals seeking health services. It also requires health insurance issuers to provide estimated out-of-pocket costs upon request. The Act does not authorize the Secretary to set uniform standards for state laws or impose requirements on states with existing laws meeting the Act's criteria. The Act prohibits states with existing voluntary disclosure programs on hospital charges from enacting laws to codify the program, except for its voluntary nature. It also ensures that individuals' out-of-pocket costs do not exceed the estimated costs provided by health insurance issuers. The term 'health insurance coverage' and 'health insurance issuer' are defined in the Public Health Service Act. This includes medicaid managed care organizations and Medicare Advantage organizations. State laws can still apply to Medicare Advantage organizations and plans. The term 'hospital' is defined as an institution meeting specific requirements. The effective date for amendments made by subsection (a) is October 1, 2007, with exceptions for State plans requiring legislation to meet additional requirements. The State plan is not considered non-compliant with title requirements solely for not meeting additional requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's regular session following the enactment of the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is treated as a separate regular session. SEC. 3. Research on charges and out-of-pocket costs for health care services.
