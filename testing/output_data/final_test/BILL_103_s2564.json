    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has failed to adequately consider alternative programs to centralized vehicle emission testing programs and provide adequate credit to States for these programs. The purpose of this Act is to require the Administrator to reassess determinations regarding the equivalency of centralized and decentralized programs and issue new regulations governing these programs. The Act requires the Administrator to issue new regulations for programs that minimize disruption to State compliance with the Act and allow States a reasonable opportunity to implement decentralized testing programs. SEC. 2. IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED VEHICLE INSPECTION PROGRAMS. The text discusses the postponement of implementing an enhanced vehicle inspection program under the Clean Air Act until March 1, 1996. It also mentions the rescinding of regulations related to the program and reassessment of determinations by the Administrator. The regulations under consideration allow States the option of operating the program on a centralized or decentralized basis, in line with the Clean Air Act. The regulations provide States with the option to operate their program on a decentralized basis and establish criteria for demonstrating effectiveness. States are given the opportunity to submit new plan revisions based on the regulations, with a schedule for implementation. The regulations allow States to operate programs on a decentralized basis and submit plans for review. Judicial review may set aside unsupported regulations. The Administrator cannot impose sanctions until program implementation is completed. The regulations permit decentralized state programs and prohibit adverse actions against states for non-compliance. The Administrator must complete program implementation before imposing sanctions. The Administrator can deem emission reductions achieved through state inspection and maintenance plans or consider decentralized program operation equivalent to centralized operation if a State demonstrates reasonableness."
