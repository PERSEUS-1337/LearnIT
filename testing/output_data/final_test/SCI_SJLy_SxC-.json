    "content": "Skip connections are used in deep neural networks to enhance accuracy and efficiency. DenseNet, a recent model, connects each feature layer directly to all previous ones, leading to state-of-the-art predictions. However, its extreme connectivity may limit scalability in deep networks and make it costly for applications like fully convolutional networks. Log-DenseNet is a new connection template that utilizes skip connections to reduce backpropagation distances among layers, improving prediction accuracy. It requires fewer total connections compared to DenseNet, making it easier to scale and eliminating the need for careful GPU memory management. Log-DenseNet outperforms DenseNets in tabula rasa semantic segmentation and achieves competitive results in visual recognition tasks. Continued advancements in machine learning have led to the development of more complex neural networks like VGG, ResNet, and Inception. Increasing network depth can improve representation power, but training effectiveness is crucial. Scaling up network depth can decrease performance due to vanishing/exploding gradients. Fine-tuning pre-trained networks is common in tasks like semantic segmentation due to the difficulty and cost of training from scratch. Overcoming the vanishing gradient problem and effective training are active research areas. Recent works are addressing the vanishing gradient problem and training from scratch difficulties by introducing skip connections in deeper networks. DenseNet concatenates all previous layers to form the input of each layer, but this incurs high run-time complexity. To combat scaling issues, proposals include cutting connections from mid-depth and halving the total channel size multiple times. To address the scaling issue in deep neural networks, proposals include halving the total channel size and cutting 40% of channels in DenseNets while maintaining accuracy. The study focuses on the placement of skip connections in networks with limited computation resources, showing that performance varies based on where the skip connections are placed. This leads to a design principle formalized in Section 3.2. Log-DenseNets are designed based on a principle to minimize distance among layers during backpropagation. They have a runtime complexity of L log L, scale well to deeper and wider networks, outperform DenseNets on semantic segmentation tasks with fewer parameters, and achieve comparable performance on visual recognition datasets. The proposed Log-DenseNets aim to minimize distance among layers during backpropagation, achieving small between-layer distances with few connections. They outperform DenseNets on semantic segmentation tasks and achieve comparable performance on visual recognition datasets. Skip connections in the network involve adding features from different layers together to improve performance. FractalNet, DualPathNet, and DenseNet utilize different methods for incorporating skip connections in deep networks. FractalNet constructs shortcut networks recursively, DualPathNet combines DenseNet and ResNet insights, and DenseNet connects each layer to all previous layers. However, DenseNet's quadratic complexity may hinder scalability, so it applies block compression to reduce the number of channels in previous layer concatenations. DenseNet connects each layer to all previous layers, but for FCNs in semantic segmentation, skip connections from mid-depth layers are cut to fit limited GPU memory. DenseNet's quadratic memory requirement can be reduced with custom implementations for memory efficiency. Our work focuses on custom implementations for memory efficient Densenets, recognizing the importance of skip connections in DenseNet's architecture. We advocate for the use of compositional skip connections to shorten distances among feature layers during backpropagation. Additionally, various methods for network compression have been proposed to reduce redundancy and computational costs, such as decomposing convolutions at spatial and channel levels and training networks with smaller costs to mimic expensive ones. This work proposes a network design principle to intelligently place skip connections in DenseNet to minimize between-layer distances. It advocates for compositional skip connections to reduce redundancy and computational costs in memory-efficient DenseNets. The DenseNet architecture features layers with bottleneck structures and block compression for downsampling. Direct connections among layers introduce deep supervision and alleviate gradient issues. This design principle aims to optimize skip connections in DenseNet for efficiency. The proposed Log-DenseNet design principle aims to minimize connection distance among layers by increasing the maximum backpropagation distance (MBD) to 1 + log 2 L while using only O(L log L) connections. This is in comparison to DenseNet, which has a MBD of 1 with O(L 2 ) connections. The Log-DenseNet is efficient for networks with less than 1000 depths. In a proposed Log-Dense Network, each layer takes input from a limited number of previous layers exponentially apart in depth. The overall complexity of a Log-DenseNet is significantly smaller than that of a DenseNet. Layers are organized into blocks with the same resolution, and a transition layer is used between blocks. In Log-DenseNet V2, the map side is halved after each block with a pooling transition involving a 1x1 conv and 2x2 average pooling. Each early layer is independently processed to reduce complexity, resulting in a total transition cost of O(L log L) with O(log L) transitions. In Log-DenseNet V2, a block compression technique is proposed to speed up transitions and reduce memory bandwidth. This involves compressing newly finished feature layers into g log L channels using 1x1 conv, concatenating previous compressed features, and downsampling with 2x2 average pooling. This process helps maintain the number of channels while reducing computational costs. In Log-DenseNet V2, a block compression technique is proposed to speed up transitions and reduce memory bandwidth. The compressed features are used when n block = 3, with total connections and run-time complexity still O(L log L). The total channel from the compressed feature is at most (n block \u2212 1)g log L + 2g, assuming n block \u2264 4 is a constant. The transitions cost O(L log L) connections and computation in total, with DISPLAYFORM4 in LogDenseNet increasing the MBD among layers to 1 + log L. Proposition 3.1 states that the maximum backpropagation distance between feature layers x i and x j in Log-DenseNet is at most log |j \u2212 i| + n block. Log-DenseNet V2 introduces a block compression technique to reduce memory bandwidth and speed up transitions. It shows that having additional training signals at intermediate layers improves performance. LD2 outperforms other models due to its low MBD and deep supervision. Log-DenseNet V2 (LD2) outperforms other models with its low memory bandwidth (MBD) and deep supervision. Supervision BID20 for early layers aids network convergence. Auxiliary predictions are placed at the end of each block, with weighting split between final prediction and evenly spread. One extra epoch of training optimizing only the final prediction results in lower validation error rates. Experimental results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and ILSVRC2012 datasets show promising performance. The study experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and ILSVRC2012 datasets using a training procedure optimized with stochastic gradient descent. The proposed Log-DenseNet V1 design principle is compared against other connection strategies, showing the importance of short MBD. The study compares the Log-DenseNet V1 design principle with other connection strategies on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and ILSVRC2012 datasets. Log-DenseNet outperforms NEAREST and EVENLY-SPACED methods, with a significant decrease in error rates. The Log-DenseNet design principle outperforms NEAREST and EVENLY-SPACED methods on various datasets, showcasing advantages of small MBD and efficient connection patterns. The MBD values for different connection strategies are highlighted, with N+LD showing significant improvement over N due to additional connections. The Log-DenseNet design principle, with a MBD of 2, outperforms NEAREST and EVENLY-SPACED methods on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. NEAREST can be improved by adding shortcuts to reduce the MBD, resulting in a scheme called NearestHalfAndLog. This scheme drastically reduces error rates to the level of EVENLY-SPACED with minimal additional connections. Semantic segmentation assigns labels to every pixel in input images, crucial for tasks like autonomous driving. Training fully convolutional networks (FCNs) from scratch is challenging due to overfitting, but DenseNets show promise in this regard. Fully convolutional DenseNets (FC-DenseNets) achieve state-of-the-art results without additional data. FC-DenseNets achieve state-of-the-art predictions without additional data, but drawbacks are seen in applications on small images. To address memory constraints, BID14 proposes a connection strategy for FC-DenseNets. However, FC-Log-DenseNet outperforms FC-DenseNet in experiments. FC-Log-DenseNet V1-103 is formed with 11 Log-DenseNet V1 blocks, featuring downsampling and upsampling of feature maps. Transitions are applied after each block to transform and downsample or upsample the previous layers as needed. The Log-DenseNet connection strategy is used for input, with sparse connections to early layers for high resolution details. Log-DenseNet connections are sparse to early layers for high resolution semantic segmentation. Feature layer x 4 is added to subsequent layers, maintaining overall complexity. No additional skip connections are formed. FC networks are not used in Log-DenseNet V2 due to increased computational cost. FLOPS breakdown by blocks is shown in the appendix. Training parameters are similar to FC-DenseNet BID14, with a growth rate of 24 for comparable computational cost. The growth rate was set to 24 instead of 16 to match the computational cost of FC-DenseNet. Auxiliary predictions at the end of each dense block reduce overfitting and show progression in predictions. These predictions use 1x1 conv layers for semantic segmentation. The final two blocks of FC-DenseNet and FC-Log-DenseNet cost half of their total computation due to fine resolutions. FC-DenseNets BID14 forgo mid-depth shortcut connections in upsampling blocks. FC-Log-DenseNet achieves 67.3% mean IoUs, slightly higher than FC-DenseNet's 66.9%. It performs similarly among the 11 classes with 50% fewer parameters and similar computations in FLOPS. The study explores the trade-off between computational cost and network accuracy in visual recognition, suggesting that minimizing mid-depth shortcut connections can improve performance. Log-DenseNet variants outperform DenseNet in image classification due to low resolution in the final block. Log-DenseNet V2 shows similar performance to DenseNet on CIFAR100. The within block distance in Log-DenseNet V2 is bounded by the logarithm of the block size. Log-DenseNet V1 has slightly worse error rates compared to the other two variants. The performance gap between Log-DenseNet V1 and DenseNet widens with network depth, as Log-DenseNet has a higher Mean Backpropagation Distance (MBD). Log-DenseNet can reach the same accuracy as DenseNet with similar computational cost, but can scale to much higher depths. DenseNets have difficulty fitting in RAM, while Log-DenseNet can fit models with larger parameters. Log-DenseNet V2 is more computationally efficient than ResNet without bottlenecks, achieving lower prediction errors with the same cost. However, it is not as efficient as ResNet with bottlenecks or DenseNet, suggesting a trade-off between shortcut connection density and computation efficiency. Shallow networks with dense connections may suffice for good predictors, eliminating the need for very deep networks with sparse connections. Log-DenseNet offers a reasonable balance between accuracy and efficiency. The proposed Log-DenseNet offers a trade-off between accuracy and scalability for deep networks with shortcut connections. It uses a total of O(L log L) shortcut connections on a depth-L network to achieve improved performance and scalability on various datasets. This design provides insights for future network designs that require high depths but cannot afford full dense shortcut connections. The Log-DenseNet model utilizes shortcut connections to improve performance and scalability on deep networks. It aims to strike a balance between accuracy and scalability by incorporating O(L log L) shortcut connections on a depth-L network. The model is optimized using RMSprop on random cropped images followed by fine-tuning on full images, with specific learning rates and batch sizes for training and fine-tuning. The Log-DenseNet model uses shortcut connections to improve performance on deep networks. It is trained for 300 epochs with a batch size of 6 during training and 2 during fine-tuning on two GTX 1080 GPUs. Median class weighting is used for class balance. Computational efficiency comparison between Log-DenseNet and DenseNets on CIFAR10 and SVHN shows similar performance with error rate differences around 5%. The LogLog-DenseNet model's performance is affected by factors beyond just the Mean Binary Distance (MBD). Despite having a small MBD, it performs worse than Log-DenseNet and DenseNet in terms of accuracy and even shows an increasing test error rate with network depth. This suggests that factors other than MBD hinder the convergence of deep LogLog-DenseNet networks. The LogLog-DenseNet model's performance is impacted by factors beyond Mean Binary Distance (MBD). It performs worse than Log-DenseNet and DenseNet in accuracy, with increasing test error rate as network depth increases. The layers in LogLog-DenseNet have different shortcut connection inputs, leading to information loss in hub layers with high in-degrees and out-degrees. Increasing the channel size of hub nodes improves performance to match Log-DenseNet. The LogLog-DenseNet model's performance is influenced by factors beyond Mean Binary Distance (MBD) and performs worse than Log-DenseNet and DenseNet in accuracy. Increasing the channel size of hub nodes improves performance to match Log-DenseNet. The computation in FC-DenseNets and FC-Log-DenseNets is distributed unevenly, with more than half coming from the final two blocks due to their high resolutions."
