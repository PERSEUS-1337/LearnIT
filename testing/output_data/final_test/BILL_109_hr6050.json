The US current account deficit has reached $791 billion in 2005, leading to job losses.

MANDATORY PRESIDENTIAL ACTION WHEN US CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT EXCEEDS 2% OF GDP. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 is amended to include a new subsection (c) which mandates a Presidential proclamation of a temporary import surcharge whenever the United States current account deficit exceeds 2 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. The Trade Act of 1974 is amended to include a new subsection mandating a temporary import surcharge when the US current account deficit exceeds 2 percent of GDP. The President must proclaim the surcharge within 30 days and it will last until the deficit is eliminated or is below 1 percent of GDP. The surcharge amount has a minimum threshold. The surcharge proclaimed under the Trade Act of 1974 must be at least 20 percent ad valorem and adjusted to ensure a period of not more than 24 months. The President can increase the surcharge by at least 1 percent if deemed inadequate. Each determination is based on specific data. The determination for a surcharge under the Trade Act of 1974 is based on the most recent data compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Country and product exemptions apply to the surcharge to the same extent as import restricting actions."
