The Secretary must notify states of their right to request conveyance of submerged land within 120 days of the Act's enactment.

The Act and its amendments do not impact existing rights to expanded submerged land. Submerged land within a State's seaward boundaries is subject to Federal oil and gas mineral rights, considered part of the Federal outer Continental Shelf, and subject to leasing and revenue distribution laws. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 does not affect existing Federal oil and gas leases. If a lease is divided due to conveyance, the new portion will not take effect until the original lease expires. This section does not apply to future interests granted by the State in expanded submerged land. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 allows States to tax within their seaward boundaries, excluding existing Federal oil and gas leases. Federal leases remain taxable by the State. SEC. 6. FISHERY MANAGEMENT RIGHTS. The Secretary of Commerce grants each State exclusive fishery management authority over reef fish in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean in expanded submerged land. Additionally, each State is granted temporary exclusive fishery management authority over red snapper fish in specific areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The Governor of a State must certify to the Secretary of Commerce in writing that they are confident in the accuracy and scientific basis of stock assessments for red snapper fish within the State's authority granted by the Act."
