    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) require all students with disabilities to participate in state assessments for accountability. The 113th Congress is considering amending the ESEA to address the inclusion of students with disabilities in accountability systems. Some students with disabilities may not fully participate in general state assessments due to the severity of their disability. They may require alternate assessments tailored to their needs. There are five assessment options available for measuring the achievement of students with disabilities. Some students with disabilities may require alternate assessments tailored to their needs. There are five assessment options available, with restrictions on how scores may be counted in AYP calculations, outlined by the U.S. Department of Education. In August 2013, regulations were proposed to transition away from one of the assessment options. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) established requirements for teacher qualifications and funding flexibility in exchange for meeting four principles set by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). As of March 5, 2014, 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico had been approved for ESEA flexibility packages. States must offer alternate assessments based on academic achievement standards for students with disabilities. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 established requirements for teacher qualifications and funding flexibility in exchange for meeting principles set by the U.S. Department of Education. States must offer assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities, aligned with college- and career-ready standards. By the 2014-2015 school year, states under the ESEA flexibility package must include eligible students in grade-level assessments, discontinuing modified academic achievement standards assessments. The report focuses on current ED regulations allowing states to use alternate assessments for AYP calculations. It discusses issues with proposed regulations and the ESEA flexibility package, state implementation challenges, policy proposals for measuring student achievement, and ESEA reauthorization activity. Including students with disabilities in state assessments is a recent practice, as they were previously excluded in the 1990s. The Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 and IDEA of 1997 mandated the participation of students with disabilities in state assessments to increase access to the general education curriculum and raise expectations and achievement. Alternate assessments were introduced in 1997 to provide a more accurate measure for students with disabilities who couldn't take the general state assessment. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 increased emphasis on student assessment, particularly for students with disabilities. It required states to develop alternate assessments for students with disabilities to participate in state assessments, but did not specify how these assessments should be used in the accountability system. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 emphasized student assessment for students with disabilities, leading to the need for accurate assessments for all students. Alternate assessments were developed to accommodate students with significant cognitive disabilities. Questions arose regarding eligibility for alternate assessments and how scores should be incorporated into state accountability systems. The Education Department (ED) released regulations for alternate assessments for students with disabilities to be included in state accountability systems. Two types of alternate assessments are outlined: AA-AAS and AA-MAS. These assessments are designed for students with disabilities who cannot take the general state assessment even with accommodations. They provide a more accurate measure of students' knowledge and abilities. An alternate assessment is tailored to meet the needs of students with disabilities, using various methods like teacher observation, work samples, and performance tasks. It adapts content and achievement standards from general state assessments to measure student proficiency in academic areas like reading, math, and science. Achievement standards define proficiency levels in a content area, setting cut scores to categorize students. Understanding the difference between content and achievement standards is crucial for developing alternate assessments. Different methods for developing alternate assessments vary based on when it is appropriate to adapt and extend content standards and achievement standards, or when it is appropriate to adapt only the achievement standards. In AA-AAS, both content and achievement standards are adapted and extended, while in AA-MAS, only achievement standards are adapted. The ED issued regulations in 2003 and 2007 allowing states to use results from AA-AAS and AA-MAS in accountability calculations for students with disabilities. The ED issued regulations in 2003 and 2007 for the development and use of AA-AAS and AA-MAS in state accountability systems. AA-AAS are assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities, requiring alternate achievement standards aligned with state content standards. Technical standards for validity must be met. The AA-AAS assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities must meet professional and technical standards for validity and reliability. The content standards may be extended or substantially simplified, and achievement standards may differ from grade-level expectations. Alternate achievement standards must align with state content standards. Alternate achievement standards, known as AA-AAS, are aligned with state academic content standards and describe three levels of achievement. These standards include competencies for each level and assessment scores to differentiate among the levels. AA-AAS are used to assess students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, without a federal definition provided by IDEA. Students in any disability category may be eligible for AA-AAS participation. Approximately 9% of students with disabilities, around 1% of all students, may qualify to participate in AA-AAS due to the most significant cognitive disabilities. States define this disability and set criteria for eligibility, determined by the student's IEP team. Parents must be informed of their child's participation in AA-AAS. The state must inform parents about their child's participation in alternate achievement standards and report the number of students taking alternate assessments to the Department of Education. The \"1% rule\" limits the number of proficient and advanced scores based on AA-AAS to 1% of all students in the state accountability system, approximately 9% of students with disabilities. This rule applies to both LEAs and states but not individual schools. The 1% rule limits proficient and advanced scores based on AA-AAS to 1% of all students in the state accountability system. An exception can be requested by an LEA to exceed this cap. The 0.5% cap was established based on scientific estimates of mental retardation levels, with an operational definition for students with significant cognitive disabilities. Many objections were raised regarding the 0.5% cap on students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, leading to a proposal to raise the cap to 1% of all assessed students. The operational definition of these students, which relied on IQ tests, was removed due to concerns about its validity. States are now allowed to develop their own criteria for identifying students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Many states struggled to meet the requirements for modified achievement standards for students with disabilities, as they are allowed to develop their own criteria for identifying students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Developing expectations for modified achievement standards for students with disabilities, specifically the AA-MAS, was challenging due to the lack of a clear definition of the eligible student population. This led to some states deciding not to implement AA-MAS. These standards must align with grade-level content standards and meet technical standards for validity and reliability. While they may differ in achievement expectations from the general state assessment, they must still represent grade-level content standards. Modified achievement standards, such as the AA-MAS, cover the same grade-level content as general state assessments but may have less difficult questions and modified expectations for proficiency. These standards must align with state academic content standards, describe different achievement levels, include competencies for each level, and have assessment scores that differentiate among the levels. States must develop modified achievement standards for each grade where AA-MAS is implemented. The AA-MAS are modified achievement standards used to assess students with disabilities under IDEA who may not achieve grade-level proficiency within a year. States must establish criteria for IEP teams to determine eligibility, including evidence of disability impact on proficiency and student progress. The AA-MAS are modified achievement standards for assessing students with disabilities under IDEA who may not reach grade-level proficiency within a year. Eligibility criteria include evidence of disability impact on proficiency, student progress, and standards-based IEP goals. ED regulations do not limit participation in AA-MAS but restrict the number of proficient and advanced scores used in AYP calculations. The \"2% rule\" or \"2% cap\" limits the number of students with disabilities assessed in reading/language arts and mathematics to 2% of all students. This represents around 20% of all students with disabilities. States and LEAs can exceed this cap under certain circumstances. Studies show that approximately 15-22% of students with disabilities may not reach grade-level proficiency in a year, aligning with the 2% cap. The 2% cap on students with disabilities in assessments was a topic of debate during the public comment period. While some felt it was too low, others cited data supporting that it was too high. Despite the need for more studies, ED maintained that the 2% cap is appropriate to protect students from being inappropriately assigned to alternate assessments. The following sections delve into how alternate assessments impact AYP calculations in state accountability systems. Exceptions to the 1% and 2% caps for students with disabilities in assessments are discussed, along with the process of redistributing scores if the caps are exceeded. State reporting requirements for student participation in alternate assessments are also covered. The 1% cap refers to proficient and advanced scores from AA-AAS, while the 2% cap refers to scores from AA-MAS. LEAs or states may exceed these caps under certain circumstances, but individual schools are not subject to them. Exceptions to the 1% cap may be granted for an LEA. Exceptions to the 1% and 2% caps for students with disabilities in assessments are discussed. An LEA may be granted an exception to the 1% cap if the incidence of students with significant cognitive disabilities exceeds 1%. The state must review this exception regularly. An exception to the 2% cap can only be granted if the LEA is below the 1% cap. LEAs are not allowed to exceed a total of 3% of proficient and advanced scores from alternate assessments for AYP purposes. The regulations allow for exceptions to the 1% and 2% caps for students with disabilities in assessments. States and LEAs may exceed the caps under certain conditions, but must not exceed the 3% total cap. Scores exceeding the caps must be counted in AYP calculations, with proficient and advanced scores treated as \"non-proficient\" for AYP purposes. States must redistribute proficient and advanced scores exceeding the 1% or 2% cap as non-proficient scores for AYP calculations. Four methods are provided in non-regulatory guidance for redistributing scores, with no mandated procedure in regulations. The non-regulatory guidance provides four methods for redistributing proficient and advanced scores exceeding the cap: random assignment, proportional, strategic, and predetermined school cap. Random assignment selects scores at random to become non-proficient, ensuring fairness over time. The proportional method redistributes proficient and advanced scores based on the number of students who took alternate assessments, aiming to prevent overtesting. However, it may unfairly penalize schools with a high number of students with disabilities. The strategic method redistributes proficient and advanced scores to benefit schools in meeting AYP, but it may be perceived as unethical. The predetermined school-cap method redistributes scores based on a school's historical percentage of students with disabilities. The predetermined school-cap method for redistributing proficient scores based on historical percentage of students with disabilities may face challenges due to fluctuations in student attendance and perpetuation of inappropriate identification practices. Appendix B outlines pros and cons of different redistribution methods, suggesting that states may benefit from using a combination of methods. States and LEAs may use a combination of methods to redistribute scores for AYP purposes. The 1% cap is calculated based on the number of students enrolled in grades 3 through 8 and one grade in high school. If an LEA has 10,000 students, no more than 100 proficient scores based on AA-AAS may count for AYP. The 2% cap is enforced similarly. For AYP purposes, proficient scores from AA-AAS can count towards the calculation. If an LEA has 150 students participating in AA-AAS, two scenarios may occur. In one scenario, all 150 students score proficiently, but only 100 scores can count as proficient for AYP. The remaining 50 scores must be redistributed as non-proficient. If no exception is granted, these redistributed scores must be included in AYP calculations for each subgroup. For AYP purposes, proficient scores from AA-AAS can count towards the calculation. In a hypothetical LEA, scores must be redistributed as non-proficient for AYP purposes. Schools A, B, C, and D must redistribute scores using random or proportional methods. In a hypothetical LEA, scores from schools A, B, C, and D must be redistributed to meet AYP goals. The redistribution methods, random-assignment, and proportional, determine the number of scores to be redistributed. LEAs may use a strategic method to maximize their chances of meeting AYP goals. The interaction of the 1% and 2% caps at the state level can complicate the redistribution of scores. States must report separately on the participation of students with disabilities in state accountability systems, including general state assessments, assessments with accommodations, alternate assessments based on grade-level standards, AA-AAS, and AA-MAS. They must prepare a report card with sections for assessment data and accountability data, reporting actual scores received by students in alternate assessments even if proficient scores are redistributed as non-proficient for AYP purposes. States and LEAs must apply the 1% and 2% caps when reporting proficient and non-proficient scores for AYP purposes. They are required to provide individual student reports to parents, teachers, and principals, including actual scores from alternate assessments, even if a proficient score is redistributed as non-proficient. The state and LEA must report to parents, teachers, and principals if a student scored \"proficient\" outside of the 1% or 2% cap. ED released a report on states' implementation of AA-AAS based on surveys from 2004-2007. ED regulations for AA-MAS were not finalized at the time of data collection, but interim policy options were offered. The finalized ED regulations regarding AA-MAS included a transition provision for modified achievement standards. States could use the 2% interim policy options until 2008-2009 with approval. All 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico had alternate assessments in reading and math in 2005-2006. States had the option to keep existing assessments, develop new ones, or modify them to comply with new regulations. In 2006-2007, states either kept, developed, or modified alternate assessments. By August 2008, most states had ED approval for their AA-AAS. However, 15 states faced challenges with alignment of standards, technical quality, and documentation. By April 2007, 50 states provided participation guidelines for IEP teams. States used a checklist or worksheet method for AA-AAS eligibility. Evidence of significant cognitive disability and modified curriculum was required. Criteria for defining \"most significant cognitive disability\" included subaverage intellectual functioning, deficits in adaptive behavior, and early onset of cognitive deficits. In school year 2005-2006, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used scores from AA-AAS to calculate AYP. Twenty-two states granted exceptions to the 1% cap to LEAs, while twenty-six states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico did not grant exceptions. The number of exceptions granted to LEAs varied among states. The number of exceptions granted to LEAs by states varied, with some granting approximately 2 exceptions and others up to 100 exceptions. States typically exceeded the 1% cap by a small amount, but LEAs with low student enrollments often exceeded it by a larger margin. Some states tested a higher proportion of students with disabilities using AA-AAS than allowed under ED policies, with estimates suggesting up to 9% of students with disabilities were assessed using AA-AAS. In some cases, over 30% of students with disabilities participated in AA-AAS. 10 states had problematic data for the 2005-2006 school year. Fewer data is available for AA-MAS development. ED released final regulations in April 2007, with states adapting their systems over the next two years. By January 2009, 8 states administered AA-MAS and 20 were in the process of developing it. NCEO survey shows 9 states have participation guidelines for IEP teams. The survey reports that nine states have guidelines for IEP teams to determine eligibility for AA-MAS. Criteria for eligibility varied across states, with common factors including having an IEP, learning grade-level content, and decisions based on multiple performance measures. Some states also had exclusionary criteria, such as not basing eligibility on disability category or excessive absences. States face challenges in developing and implementing alternate assessments, including issues with eligibility criteria such as disability category, excessive absences, social, cultural, language, economic, or environmental factors, and educational placement. Participation rates for AA-MAS are not widely available, making it difficult to assess if states are testing students with disabilities appropriately or exceeding the 2% cap. Despite most states incorporating AA-AAS into their assessment systems, many are still in the process of implementing AA-MAS. The challenges faced by states in developing alternate assessments under NCLB included limited statutory language, delays in approval due to technical adequacy issues, and the absence of specific guidelines for alternate assessments. The NCLB allows for adaptations and accommodations for students with disabilities in testing, but they must be tested based on state academic standards. Regulations issued in July 2002 required states' assessment systems to include at least one alternate assessment for students with disabilities in reading/language arts and science. The regulations issued in 2002 required states to include alternate assessments for students with disabilities in reading/language arts and science. In 2003, regulations allowed states to develop alternate achievement standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities and set a 1% cap on proficient and advanced scores for accountability purposes. The 2007 regulations introduced modified achievement standards for students with disabilities and a 2% cap on proficient and advanced scores for AYP purposes, following a period of gradual information dissemination to states on developing and using alternate assessments. States sometimes had to adjust their policies to align with subsequent ED regulations. The 2007 regulations introduced modified achievement standards for students with disabilities and a 2% cap on proficient and advanced scores for AYP purposes. States that adopted policies inconsistent with regulations had to redevelop alternate assessments, achievement standards, and testing practices to align with ED requirements. Alternate assessments must meet technical adequacy requirements and be consistent with professional and technical standards. However, there are no recognized standards for individualized alternate assessments for students with disabilities. Alternate assessments, such as portfolios and teacher observations, require validity and reliability evidence on a case-by-case basis. While traditional assessments use standardized tests, collecting evidence for individualized alternate assessments is not well-established. In 2001, a research collaborative was formed to address key issues in creating technically defensible alternate assessments for state accountability. The collaborative of experts developed a model framework to study the validity of alternate assessments, which 10 states applied by early 2008. However, it is uncertain if the framework is improving states' approval rates during peer review. Common issues during the review process included insufficient evidence linking alternate assessments to grade-level standards and lack of validity and reliability evidence. Some states also failed to document the adoption of alternate assessment standards. The report highlighted that some states lacked documentation on how alternate assessment standards were adopted, how alternate achievement standards were set, and how results would be reported. The inclusion of students with disabilities in state assessment systems is a new practice, evolving since NCLB's enactment. The reauthorization of ESEA may address issues related to assessing students with disabilities and holding schools accountable for their academic achievement. Recommendations for reauthorization have been collected and synthesized by the Education Commission of the States from 15 national education organizations. The Education Commission of the States collected recommendations on assessing students with disabilities from 15 national education organizations. Some organizations suggested improving current practices, while others proposed more significant changes, such as reconsidering caps and increasing the role of IEPs in assessment systems. Analysis of these proposed changes is provided in the following sections, with potential issues for the reauthorization of NCLB. One possible issue for the reauthorization of NCLB may be the reconsideration of the 1% and 2% caps on alternate assessments for students with disabilities. Congress may revisit including statutory language to adjust these caps, with implications for accountability in schools. One recommendation is to maintain the 1% cap and decrease the 2% cap to 1%, limiting the number of proficient scores based on alternate assessments. This change would reduce flexibility for states. Decreasing the 1% and 2% caps on alternate assessments for students with disabilities may discourage inappropriate identification and promote access to general education curriculum. Increasing the caps could provide more flexibility to states and protect schools from failing to meet AYP solely due to students with disabilities. Increasing the caps on alternate assessments for students with disabilities may offer more flexibility to educators in setting academic goals. However, this could lead to inappropriate identification of students and exclusion from the general education curriculum, denying them equal access to challenging academic standards. The current Administration supports the use of AA-AAS for students with significant cognitive disabilities but not AA-MAS for other students. In 2013, ED proposed regulations to phase out the use of AA-MAS. In August 2013, ED proposed regulations to transition away from the use of AA-MAS towards \"college and career ready standards and general assessments aligned to those standards accessible to all students.\" Education organizations suggest increasing the role of IEPs in state assessment and accountability systems, as outlined in IDEA for students with disabilities. Advocates propose using IEP annual goals and progress measurement methods in assessment systems, but there is disagreement on the level of state independence and flexibility. Several organizations proposed granting states flexibility to direct IEP teams in determining curricula, standards, and assessments for students with disabilities. States could count students meeting AYP if they completed their IEP goals, and determine the percentage participating in alternate assessments based on the IEP. This approach allows for individualized starting points for AYP projections based on each student's present level of achievement. The proposed methods aim to provide flexibility for states and IEP teams in developing individualized education plans for students with disabilities. However, there is a concern that focusing on meeting IEP goals for AYP may result in lower expectations for students with disabilities, which goes against the original intent of increasing access to the general education curriculum and raising achievement expectations. States may have the flexibility to guide IEP teams in selecting curricula and assessments, but the standards would still be determined by the state. In this scenario, states could require the use of a \"standards-based IEP\" document, linking IEP goals to academic content standards. Traditional IEP goals focused on developmental goals, but the shift towards academic achievement led to including academic goals on IEPs. This allows for a connection between goals for students with disabilities and state academic content standards. A \"standards-based IEP\" aligns annual goals for students with disabilities with state academic content standards, providing a structured academic focus. While offering flexibility in curriculum and assessments, it may limit individualization for students with significant cognitive disabilities. IEP teams may struggle to align state content standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities. Increasing the role of the IEP in assessment and accountability systems could streamline goal-setting and reporting, but the variability in setting goals may limit their usefulness. Using IEP goals for accountability may hinder comparing student achievement across schools. Several education organizations propose expanding the use of growth models in AYP determinations for students with disabilities to reflect academic progress independently of proficiency goals. Individual student growth models are suggested to track progress over time and reward schools for improving achievement, even for students below proficiency levels. In November 2005, the Secretary announced a growth model program for states to implement. In 2005, the Secretary introduced a growth model program for states to use in making AYP determinations. In 2009, 15 states participated in the pilot program with restrictive requirements for proposed growth models. States had to meet seven criteria, including ensuring all students are proficient by 2013-2014 and closing the achievement gap for all student groups. The growth model program introduced in 2005 for AYP determinations had seven criteria for states to meet, including tracking student progress, ensuring proficiency for all students by 2013-2014, and closing the achievement gap for all student groups. It is uncertain if the growth models would credit states for improving the achievement of students with disabilities under these requirements. The growth model program introduced in 2005 had criteria that made it challenging for schools and LEAs to meet AYP by improving the achievement of students with disabilities. Significant gains in achievement might still lead to failure to meet AYP goals, especially for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities participating in AA-AAS. Some criteria, like assessments in grades 3-8 producing comparable results, may be inconsistent with the use of alternate assessments for these students. The development and use of AA-AAS allow for \"out of level\" testing and alternate achievement standards for grade clusters, making it challenging to define annual growth for students with disabilities. This approach may not adequately capture the annual growth of students participating in AA-AAS. Increasing the role of IEPs and growth models are key considerations for assessing students with disabilities for AYP purposes. Policy flexibility in AYP determinations includes options like allowing extended time for students in the \"students with disabilities\" subgroup, even if they are no longer eligible for special education due to academic improvements. Allowing \"declassified\" students who were previously identified as having a disability but no longer receive special education services to be counted in the \"students with disabilities\" AYP subgroup for an additional two years may incentivize schools to move students in and out of special education based on academic performance. This provision could be seen as giving credit to a school's effort to successfully educate students with disabilities. Another option could be to maintain the \"safe harbor\" provision of NCLB. The \"safe harbor\" provision of NCLB allows schools or LEAs to be deemed to have made AYP if certain conditions are met, providing flexibility but not focusing on developing appropriate assessments or achieving higher levels of achievement for students with disabilities. During the 113th Congress, legislation to reauthorize the ESEA was considered by both the House and the Senate. The Senate HELP Committee ordered reported the Strengthening America's Schools Act (S. 1094) by a partisan vote of 12-10, while the House Education and Workforce Committee ordered reported the Success for All Students Act (H.R. 5) by a partisan vote of 23-16. H.R. 5 was passed on the House floor by a vote of 221-207, but it is uncertain if S. 1094 will be considered on the Senate floor. Both S. 1094 and H.R. 5 aim to modify Title I-A accountability requirements related to assessments for students with disabilities. S. 1094 allows for alternate assessments aligned with alternate academic standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities, limiting their use to 1% of all students. It does not permit alternate assessments aligned with modified achievement standards. H.R. 5 also allows for alternate assessments but does not mandate their development. H.R. 5 authorizes the development of alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities but does not limit their use in the accountability system. It does not explicitly address alternate assessments aligned with modified achievement standards for other students with disabilities. LEA B is under the 1% cap by 0.3% and over the 2% cap by 0.3%. LEA C exceeds the 1% cap by 0.4% but is under the 2% cap by 0.5%. LEA D exceeds both the 1% and 2% caps by 0.3% and 0.6% respectively. LEA D has 0.9% of its proficient and advanced scores that must be redistributed as non-proficient. LEA D has 0.9% of proficient and advanced scores that need to be redistributed as non-proficient, with 0.3% from AA-AAS scores due to exceeding the 1% cap."
