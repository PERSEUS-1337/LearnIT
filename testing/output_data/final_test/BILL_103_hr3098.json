Problems with crime are worsened by the interstate movement of drugs, funds, and criminal gangs. Firearms, particularly handguns, easily cross state lines, as evidenced in congressional hearings. Criminals move freely between states, causing fear among ordinary citizens traveling through certain areas due to concerns about violent crime. Violent crime in the United States is a concern, with a link to the use of illicit drugs. States and localities struggle to control the problem on their own. The Congress has the power to combat illicit drug activity and violent crime that crosses state lines. It aims to assist states in controlling crime by regulating the commerce of handguns with juveniles nationwide. Prohibition of juveniles possessing handguns or ammunition and private transfer of such items is regulated by Congress to combat illicit drug activity and violent crime across state lines. The term \"handgun\" is defined as a firearm designed to be held and fired with a single hand, including any parts that can assemble such a firearm. It is unlawful to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun or suitable ammunition to a juvenile. Additionally, juveniles are prohibited from knowingly possessing a handgun. Juveniles are prohibited from knowingly possessing a handgun or ammunition suitable for a handgun, except in specific circumstances like employment, ranching, farming, target practice, or hunting.

They must have the written consent with them at all times and follow state and local laws. Juveniles can also transport an unloaded handgun in a locked container to and from the activity location.
