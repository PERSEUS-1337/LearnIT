    "content": "The Act titled \"Commercial Mortgage Capital Availability Act of 1993\" establishes capital requirements for insured depository institutions when transferring mortgage loans. The Act \"Commercial Mortgage Capital Availability Act of 1993\" sets accounting principles and capital requirements for insured depository institutions transferring mortgage loans with recourse. The principles must align with generally accepted accounting principles, and institutions must establish a reserve to cover liabilities and only consider the maximum amount at risk as an asset for capital standards. Qualified insured depository institutions must meet specific criteria to transfer mortgage loans with recourse, including being well capitalized or adequately capitalized with approval. The total amount at risk for such transfers should not exceed 15 percent of the institution's risk-based capital or a greater amount set by the appropriate Federal banking agency. The Federal banking agency requires qualified insured depository institutions to meet criteria for transferring mortgage loans. If an institution no longer qualifies or exceeds limits, the section still applies to past transfers. This section does not affect Prompt Corrective Action. Federal banking agencies must create regulations for this within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Federal banking agency may implement final regulations for transferring mortgage loans. An alternative system is allowed if capital and reserves requirements are not exceeded. Existing transactions are not affected by this section. Definitions are provided for clarity. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to banking regulations, such as \"adequately capitalized\" and \"insured depository institution,\" in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The curr_chunk defines terms related to banking regulations, including \"recourse\" and \"mortgage loan,\" as per the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and generally accepted accounting principles. The term \"well capitalized\" is defined in section 38(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include commercial structures on real estate for mortgage related securities. Additionally, there is authority to exempt commercial mortgage related securities transactions from prohibited transaction rules. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, may exempt transactions involving commercial mortgage related securities from certain restrictions and taxes under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
