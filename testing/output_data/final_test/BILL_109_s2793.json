    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pharmaceutical Technology and Education Enhancement Act\". Congress finds that developing medical products for public health needs, rare diseases, and genetic conditions is increasingly challenging due to high costs and slow product development in crucial areas like antibiotics. The cost of developing an approved therapy has risen to approximately $1.7 billion, with many new drug candidates failing in late-stage clinical studies. Problems in design, manufacturing, and quality control often lead to delays in patient access to new treatments. The transition from laboratory prototype to industrial product is a common cause of product failures during development. The investment required to launch a new therapy has increased by 55 percent in the last 5 years. The productivity of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries is declining while the costs of developing treatments are rising. The number of new drug and biologic applications submitted to the FDA has significantly decreased, along with innovative medical device applications. Industry hesitancy to adopt advanced science and technology in manufacturing processes has led to high inventories, low factory utilization, product waste, and compliance issues, driving up costs and reducing productivity. Improved design methods are crucial. Improved design methods are crucial for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries to reduce costs and increase productivity. United States academic institutions can assist in establishing science-based standards for product manufacturing. Federal investments in a pharmaceutical technology initiative led by the FDA and university research partners will benefit healthcare quality and access. Federal investments in a pharmaceutical technology initiative led by the FDA and university research partners will benefit healthcare quality and access. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will expand and intensify research and education programs in pharmaceutical science and engineering through the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Technology and Education (NIPTE) and its member institutions. The Commissioner will coordinate research and education programs with NIPTE member institutions and other federal agencies. The focus will be on medical therapy development, manufacturing, analytical technologies, modeling, and informatics. The Commissioner will allocate funds to NIPTE for medical technology development. A Coordinating Committee will be established to assist with research and strategies, consisting of 15 members appointed by the Commissioner. The Coordinating Committee, consisting of 7 public representatives, will be headed by a Chair appointed by the Commissioner for a 2-year term, with the possibility of reappointment for one additional term. Administrative support will be provided to the Committee. The Coordinating Committee will receive administrative support from the Food and Drug Administration and will meet as determined by the Commissioner in consultation with the Chair. Within one year of the Act's enactment, the Committee will develop a plan to support research and education efforts for medical technology manufacturing and development. The Coordinating Committee, with administrative support from the FDA, will develop a plan within one year to support research and education for medical technology. The plan will involve Federal agencies and input from various interests, and include elements such as research, education programs, and reports to Congress. The Commissioner will also gather public input. The Commissioner will provide a means for the public to access information on programs and activities under the Act and receive public comments. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2012 for carrying out the Act, in addition to other appropriations for medical technology development and research activities through the FDA."
