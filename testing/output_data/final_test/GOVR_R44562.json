    "content": "The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA) was passed by Congress in response to concerns about access to medical care at VA hospitals. The act has been amended multiple times since its enactment, with the Veterans Choice Program (VCP) allowing eligible veterans to receive care in the community. President Trump signed the John S. McCain III on June 6, 2018. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 established the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) to replace the Veterans Choice Program (VCP). The new program is set to be operational by June 6, 2019, as per the act's stipulations. This report details the implementation of VCP until VCCP becomes operational. The VCP program is still active until the new VCCP program starts in June 2019. Information in this report is based on regulations, meetings with VHA staff, and materials from the VA Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs. The report does not cover the new VCCP program established by the VA MISSION Act of 2018. Eligible veterans can receive necessary treatment and services under the VCP, similar to their standard medical benefits package at a VA facility. The Veterans Choice Program (VCP) provides a range of medical services including outpatient care, pharmaceuticals, pregnancy services, dental care, and durable medical equipment. However, long-term care and emergency care in non-VA facilities are not covered. Enrollment in the VA health care system is required to access VCP services, and eligibility can be obtained through different pathways. The VCP does not guarantee unlimited health care coverage. The Veterans Choice Program (VCP) offers various medical services, but does not cover long-term or emergency care in non-VA facilities. Eligibility for VCP services can be obtained through different pathways, including a 30-day wait list and living 40 miles or more from a VA medical facility. The Veterans Choice Program (VCP) provides medical services for veterans who reside more than 20 miles from a VA facility in certain locations or face traveling burdens. Eligibility is confirmed before receiving care through the VCP. Eligibility for care through the VCP is confirmed by local VA staff within 10 business days. Ineligible veterans receive instructions on how to appeal. Two options for receiving health care services are available under the Veterans Choice Program. Under the Veterans Choice Program (VCP), veterans can choose to receive medical care from a VA provider or a VA community care provider (VCP provider). If a VA appointment is not available within 30 days or 40 miles, veterans can opt for care from a VCP provider. Eligibility is confirmed within 10 days, and veterans can appeal if deemed ineligible. Under the Veterans Choice Program (VCP), veterans can choose to receive medical care from a VA provider or a VCP provider of their choice. Eligible entities to provide care include federally qualified health centers, Department of Defense medical facilities, Indian Health Service outpatient health facilities, hospitals, physicians, and nonphysician practitioners participating in Medicare or Medicaid programs. VA employees are excluded from providing care under VCP, unless acting outside their VA employment scope. The Veterans Choice Program (VCP) allows veterans to receive care from local providers instead of waiting for a VA appointment. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system receive a VCP card, but it is not an insurance card and cannot be used to pay for medical services. The VCP does not guarantee eligibility or provide health insurance-like benefits. The VCP, not health insurance, allows veterans to access non-VA healthcare through contracts with Health Net and TriWest. These companies manage appointments, counseling, card distribution, and oversee VCP providers. Health Net covers Regions 1, 2, and 4, while TriWest covers Regions 3, 5A, 5B, and 6. The VCP contract with Health Net ended in September 2018. The VA announced the end of the VCP contract with Health Net in 2018 due to low patient volume, customer service issues, and delayed payments. TriWest's contract would continue. Guidance has been issued for next steps after the contract ends, with activities now managed directly between VA medical centers and community providers. Eligible non-VA providers can join the VCP through the PC3 or Choice network. Providers interested in joining the VA community care network must contact TriWest to determine eligibility. They must have a valid state license, VA credentials, not be on the CMS exclusion list, meet Medicare CoPs and CfCs, accept Medicare/Medicaid rates, and comply with federal/state regulations. There are two statutory authorities for care under VCP and PC3 networks. Eligible veterans can receive care under PC3, while Choice network providers can only treat VCP-eligible veterans. Providers interested in joining the VA community care network must meet eligibility requirements and submit medical records to the TPA for inclusion in veterans' VA electronic medical records. Once approved, they can enroll as VCP providers and establish reimbursement agreements. VA Medical Centers can also enter into agreements with eligible community providers for care coordination. VA community care consults/referrals can be initiated by VA physicians through the Computerized Patient Record. Physicians can submit VA community care consults/referrals for veterans in need of timely medical services. Veterans can also request these consults/referrals for timely medical care. All consults/referrals are processed by VA Community Care Coordination staff based on the urgency of the care needed. If a consult/referral is not approved, the veteran will be notified by their local VA facility staff. If a VA community care consult/referral cannot be approved, the veteran's local VA facility staff will notify the veteran. The veteran's VA provider will continue coordinating medical services within the VA and explore other community care options. Veterans can decline enrollment in the VCP, with the TPA documenting the reason. The VA provider will then continue coordinating medical services within the VA and explore other community care options. The VHA provider may explore community care options through the VCP. If eligible, VA Community Care Coordination staff uploads consult/referral and medical documentation for TriWest. The veteran confirms choice to receive care under VCP, selects a provider, schedules an appointment, provides insurance info, and is informed of possible costs. Veterans with clinical needs for service-connected conditions have their screening information reviewed by R-UR nurses. Appointments are scheduled through the Contractor Portal and managed by VA Community Care Coordination staff. Environmental factors, geographic challenges, and medical conditions are considered in assessing veterans' care requirements. The Veterans Choice Program (VCP) authorizes medical services for veterans based on their needs and frequency of care. Unauthorized services may not be reimbursed, with over 5.9 million authorizations made from November 2014 to August 2018. An episode of care (EOC) is defined by the VA as a necessary treatment lasting up to one year from the first appointment with a non-VA provider. The Veterans Choice Program (VCP) authorizes medical services for veterans based on their needs and frequency of care. An episode of care (EOC) lasts for one calendar year from the first appointment with a non-VA provider. VA community care providers can request an extension for a veteran's current EOC through their third-party administrator (TPA). Appointments should be scheduled based on clinical appropriateness, and VCP-eligible veterans will receive assistance from their TPA in scheduling appointments with organization-provided information. Urgent care authorizations are to be done promptly, and VA facility staff will cancel VA appointments once notified. Veterans can cancel VA appointments and schedule their own under the VCP. They need to provide appointment details to the TPA for upload to the Contractor Portal. VA Community Care Coordination staff check the portal daily for updates. Prescriptions can be filled at local VA pharmacies, non-VA pharmacies, or CMOP. If VA cannot fill a prescription promptly, veterans may seek alternatives. Veterans can fill prescriptions at local VA pharmacies, non-VA pharmacies, or CMOP. If VA cannot fill a prescription promptly, veterans may seek alternatives. Non-VA pharmacies may fill an initial 14-day supply for prescriptions not in the VA formulary. VCP prescribing clinician must fill remaining supply at VA pharmacy. Medications from non-VA pharmacies require prior authorizations. VA reimburses veterans for out-of-pocket expenses for service-connected conditions. Veterans submit prescriptions, authorizations, and receipts to local VA Community Care Office for reimbursement. The VA allows non-VA pharmacies to process medication claims for veterans through the Veterans Choice Program (VCP). Claims are managed by third-party administrators like TriWest, who upload and process claims through a web portal. The VA reimburses TPAs for care received by veterans, who then reimburse community care providers in their networks. Under the Veterans Choice Program (VCP), the VA processes payments to third-party administrators (TPAs) who then reimburse community care providers. VA is the primary payer for authorized medical care, and non-VA providers cannot bill the veteran or any other party. Claims for unauthorized non-VA services can be submitted to VA for payment consideration, with required documentation. Veterans enrolled in VA health care do not pay premiums, deductibles, or coinsurances for medical services. They may need to pay a fixed copayment for nonservice-connected conditions. Copayment rates are determined by the VA after services are provided. Veterans can submit claims for unauthorized care outside the VA with specific documentation to the VA for payment consideration. The Veterans Choice Program (VCP) allows veterans to receive care for service-connected or nonservice-connected conditions with no out-of-pocket costs, similar to care received at VA facilities. Copayments may apply for nonservice-connected conditions, with rates varying based on Priority Groups. Veterans are exempt from copayments for services related to service-connected disabilities. Other health insurance (OHI) is defined as commercial insurance not funded by federal and state taxes. Other health insurance (OHI) is commercial insurance offered by companies like Blue Cross, Aetna, Cigna, and Kaiser Foundation. Veterans with OHI may have cost-sharing responsibilities like copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance. Congress enacted P.L. 115-26 to make VA the primary payer for veterans with OHI seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions through the VCP, effective April 19, 2017. VA will coordinate with OHI, recover costs, and bill the veteran. The VA coordinates with a veteran's OHI to recover costs and bill the veteran for any copayments. Community care providers no longer collect copays from veterans with OHI. Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE are not considered OHI plans under the VCP. Reimbursement rates for providers are outlined, with VA reimbursing the third-party administrator. Providers under the PC3 network may receive lower reimbursement rates than Medicare, but can negotiate for similar rates under the Choice network. Providers in the Choice network can negotiate for similar rates as under the PC3 Network. Veterans and VA community care providers can contact the Community Care Call Center for billing issues, including debt collection and inappropriate billing. Appendices A and B provide information on the Veterans Choice Program and the end of the contract with Health Net."
