    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"YWCA Retirement Plan Preservation Act of 2005\" and clarifies benefit accrual standards. The \"YWCA Retirement Plan Preservation Act of 2005\" clarifies benefit accrual standards, including rules related to the reduction in accrued benefits due to age attainment. Pension plans must ensure that a participant's accrued benefit is equal to or greater than that of any similarly situated, younger individual. The Act clarifies benefit accrual standards, ensuring that a participant's accrued benefit is equal to or greater than a similarly situated, younger individual, except for age. The subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining the accrued benefit. The Act clarifies benefit accrual standards to ensure that a participant's accrued benefit meets certain requirements. This includes treatment of interest accrued on a hypothetical account in a pension plan, as well as allowable offsets. The Income Security Act of 1974 allows offsets against benefits based on employer contributions from various sources, including Social Security, Railroad Retirement Act, and other retirement plans. Allowable offsets can be actual benefit payments, projections, or actuarial equivalents. The pension plan described in subsection (c) is not considered to fail to meet certain requirements solely because it provides a disparity in contributions or benefits, as long as the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code are met. Additionally, the plan is not considered to fail if it does not meet pre-retirement indexing criteria. The plan described in subsection (c) is not considered to fail to meet requirements solely because it provides pre-retirement indexing of accrued benefits, which involves adjusting benefits to protect against inflation before distribution. Accrued benefits in a pension plan expressed as a hypothetical account balance for participants do not fail to meet certain requirements if the distribution amount is based on a market rate of return, regardless of the actual amount available. The Secretary of the Treasury may regulate the calculation of a market rate of return for pension plans, including methods of crediting interest. A pension plan described in this subsection is a defined benefit plan maintained by the Young Women's Christian Association Retirement Fund. The amendments made by this Act will apply to periods before, on, or after the enactment date."
