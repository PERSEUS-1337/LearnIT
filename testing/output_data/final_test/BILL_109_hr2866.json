    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act of 2005\". The United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 species of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. They lease 240 acres of wetland habitat and are in the process of purchasing the land to protect the endangered species habitat. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has identified approximately 800 acres of high-value wildlife habitat owned by the estate of James Campbell for inclusion in the Refuge. The land features coastal dunes, wetlands, and strand that support biological diversity for endangered species, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, and native plant species. Expanding the Refuge will provide increased opportunities for wildlife-dependent public uses, including wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education. Acquisition of the land will create a single, large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts on the Refuge and reduce flood damage to surrounding areas. Heavy rainfall in Kahuku caused damage to residences, businesses, and public buildings. The Act defines key terms such as Director, Refuge, and Secretary. The Refuge refers to the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge. The James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge is expanded by approximately 1,100 acres, with the Secretary having the authority to make minor boundary revisions within 90 days to achieve conservation goals or facilitate property acquisition. The map depicting the expansion will be available for inspection at a designated office of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Secretary will publish a notice in the Federal Register and local publications about the availability of the map for the expansion of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge. The Secretary may acquire land and water for the Refuge as described in section 4(a), subject to available funds. Any acquired land, water, or interest will become part of the Refuge and be managed according to the law."
