    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"USA Jobs Protection Act of 2003\". Congress finds that the H-1B and L-1 visa programs were established to allow US employers to hire skilled workers and transfer employees from companies with operations outside the US. These programs have been used to fill numerous positions in US firms, particularly in information technology, with median annual salaries of $45,000 in 1999. In 2001, Congress prohibited the displacement of US employees by H-1B visa holders. The H-1B visa program prohibits the displacement of US employees and requires employers to pay prevailing wages. US unemployment in IT has made it harder for employers to justify hiring H-1B workers. Concerns have been raised about the exploitation of the L-1 visa program by allowing workers to be employed by other companies. The Immigration and Naturalization Service was reviewing the L-1 visa program. The Naturalization Service is reviewing the L-1 visa program to prevent companies from using it to bypass H-1B visa restrictions. The purpose of the Act is to ensure both visa programs are used as intended and not to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Historical weaknesses in the H-1B program caused delays and made it susceptible to abuse. The Naturalization Service is reviewing visa programs to prevent abuse and strengthen enforcement. The Naturalization Service is reviewing visa programs to prevent abuse and strengthen enforcement, including the L-1 nonimmigrant visas. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include wage requirements and limitations on placing intracompany transferees with other employers. The employer must file an application with the Secretary of Labor stating that the nonimmigrant will not work at other employers' worksites and that there is no employment relationship with them. The employer must make available a copy of each application filed for public examination, with the Secretary of Labor compiling a list of applications by employer and occupational classification. The Secretary of Labor will review applications for completeness and obvious inaccuracies before certifying them. The Secretary of Labor certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security within 7 days of application filing if requirements are met. Employers must offer wages to nonimmigrants that match those of other employees with similar experience. The employer must meet specific qualifications or pay the prevailing wage level for the occupation. They cannot displace a US worker within 180 days before or after filing a visa petition. Section 212(n)(2) provisions apply to any failure to meet these conditions. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to specify the Department of Labor as the appropriate agency for nonimmigrant workers. The Secretary of Homeland Security must consult with the Secretary of Labor annually to ensure procedures for processing blanket petitions do not undermine labor enforcement efforts. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to involve the Department of Labor in enforcing provisions related to nonimmigrant workers. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, may extend the 30-day period for implementation if necessary. Additionally, the employment history requirement is changed to \"2 of the last 3 years\" and the period of admission is modified. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to reduce the required years for certain clauses. Employers petitioning to import specialized knowledge aliens must show good faith recruitment efforts in the US. The Secretary of Labor imposes a fee on employers filing petitions to import nonimmigrant aliens to cover administrative costs. The Secretary may investigate employers who employ nonimmigrants if there is reasonable cause to believe they are not in compliance. Employers are considered to displace US workers if they lay them off. The law states that an employer displaces a US worker if they lay off the worker from a job that is essentially the same as the one sought by a nonimmigrant. The job must have the same responsibilities, be in the same area, and require similar qualifications and experience. \"Lays off\" means causing a worker's loss of employment, excluding certain situations like inadequate performance or voluntary departure. The term 'United States worker' refers to an employee who is a US citizen, national, lawful permanent resident, or immigrant. This definition does not apply if the worker is offered a similar job with the same employer at equal or higher pay and benefits. This provision does not limit employee rights under a collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to replace \"Attorney General\" with \"Secretary of Homeland Security\" in Section 214. SEC. 4. TEMPORARY NONIMMIGRANT WORKERS. The H-1B Dependent Employers section of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to replace references to H-1B-dependent employers with employers that hire H-1B nonimmigrants. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to replace references to H-1B-dependent employers with employers that hire H-1B nonimmigrants. This includes changes to the definition and displacement of workers provisions. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to extend the time frame for certain terms from 90 days to 180 days. The Secretary of Labor is granted the authority to investigate employers hiring nonimmigrants under specific categories for compliance. Additionally, an administrative fee provision is updated by removing a specific date reference. The Comptroller General of the United States will investigate the implementation and impact of amendments made by the Act on employers and workers. The investigation will also assess if further changes to existing law are needed to protect American workers from displacement by certain nonimmigrants and to meet the needs of U.S. employers."
