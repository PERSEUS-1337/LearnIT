    "content": "The Act titled the \"One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2011\" is cited in Section 1. Congressional findings and purpose are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that the fiscal crisis faced by the Federal Government demands immediate action due to the dramatic growth in spending and debt in recent years, threatening economic and national security. Federal spending has increased from 18% to 24% of GDP from 2001 to 2010, with total Federal debt exceeding $14 trillion and projected to rise to $24 trillion by 2021. Interest payments on this debt will soon make balancing the budget unattainable for Congress. The purpose of this Act is to address the fiscal crisis by balancing the Federal budget, reducing spending, and reforming entitlement programs to ensure long-term fiscal stability and balance. Federal revenues are projected to return to 18% of GDP within the next decade, but without reform, the growth of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will consume all projected tax revenues. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF SPENDING CAPS. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include a new section for establishing outlay caps. The term 'outlay cap' is defined as the aggregate outlays for each fiscal year, with a one percent reduction each year starting from 2012. The outlay cap for fiscal years 2015 to 2017 is calculated with a one percent reduction each year, while for fiscal year 2018 and beyond, it is set at 18 percent of the gross domestic product as estimated by OMB. Beginning with fiscal year 2019, projected outlays must not be lower than the previous fiscal year. Sequestration is conducted by OMB within 45 days of the fiscal year start to eliminate excess outlays exceeding the cap. The excess outlay amount is defined as the difference between total projected Federal outlays and the outlay cap. For fiscal year 2018 and beyond, the term 'excess outlay amount' refers to the difference between total projected Federal outlays and the outlay cap. Sequestration procedures involve reports issued by CBO and OMB in August and October of each year. For fiscal year 2018 and beyond, the excess outlay amount is the difference between total projected Federal outlays and the outlay cap. A Presidential order must detail uniform spending reductions equal to this amount. Congressional action may be taken to achieve the necessary spending reductions outlined in the August 20 report. Section 255 and section 256 do not apply, except for payments for net interest. For fiscal year 2018 and beyond, excess outlay amounts resulting from enacted bills causing excess outlays will increase the next fiscal year's outlay cap. Sequestration preview reports will outline projected outlays for budget years, with uniform spending reductions required to meet the outlay cap. The final sequestration reports for budget year 2018 and beyond will include the estimated GDP, required reductions under section 253A, and the sequestration percentage needed to achieve the reductions. Additionally, these reports will provide estimates of the baseline level of sequestrable outlays for each account to be sequestered. The sequestration reports will include estimates of sequestrable budgetary resources, outlays, and the amount to be sequestered for outlay reductions. Section 275 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is repealed, and enforcement measures are added to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The enforcement procedures under SEC. 316 are added to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, repealing Section 275 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The text chunk outlines the restrictions on including provisions that breach outlay caps in budget-related legislation in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It also details the process for waiving or suspending these restrictions with a two-thirds majority vote. Additionally, it mentions the point of order protection in the House to prevent breaches of outlay caps. The House has a point of order protection to prevent the consideration of rules that waive outlay cap restrictions. The Speaker cannot entertain a motion to suspend this section. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The table of contents in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 are amended to include new enforcement procedures and establishing outlay caps. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments apply to fiscal year 2012 and subsequent years."
