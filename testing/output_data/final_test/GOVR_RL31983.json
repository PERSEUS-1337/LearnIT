    "content": "In the 108th Congress, both the House and Senate passed versions of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, but no further action was taken before adjournment in December 2004. In March 2005, the Senate HELP Committee approved a new patient safety bill (S. 544) aimed at encouraging voluntary reporting of medical errors with federal confidentiality protections. This legislation addresses healthcare providers' reluctance to report errors due to fear of damage to their reputations and malpractice lawsuits. Patient safety became a significant health policy issue after the Institute of Medicine's report \"To Err Is Human\" in late 1999. The Institute of Medicine's report \"To Err Is Human\" in late 1999 highlighted preventable medical errors causing up to 98,000 deaths annually. It recommended a national mandatory reporting system for serious errors, emphasizing the need for voluntary, confidential reporting systems to identify system vulnerabilities and develop preventive strategies. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act aimed to implement these recommendations. The IOM report on preventable medical errors led to numerous patient safety initiatives in both the public and private sectors, prompting federal and state legislators to consider new reporting systems. Currently, 22 states have taken steps to expand mandatory reporting systems. Currently, 22 states have mandatory reporting systems to hold hospitals and healthcare providers accountable for serious mistakes. Most states protect reporting system data from malpractice attorneys to encourage error reporting. Legislation to promote medical errors reporting has been introduced in Congress, with patient safety at the center of the debate on malpractice reform. Many trial attorneys defend the tort system for promoting safer medical practices, but health care quality experts argue that improving healthcare systems is the key to enhancing patient safety. The conflict arises from the discouragement of physicians reporting medical errors due to the tort system. The report provides an overview of medical errors reporting, including the differences between mandatory and voluntary reporting systems, and discusses legal and policy issues facing state mandatory reporting. The report discusses legal and policy issues facing state mandatory reporting systems and national voluntary reporting systems, as well as effective reporting program design features. It defines medical errors as failures in planned actions or using the wrong plan, which can occur at any stage of care. Adverse events are injuries related to medical interventions, not the patient's underlying condition, and may be preventable. The Institute of Medicine estimated that over 1 million medical errors occur annually in the United States, with 44,000 to 98,000 being fatal. These errors can cost the nation up to $29 billion each year in direct medical costs and lost income. Some researchers dispute these numbers, but agree that the issue is serious. The true incidence of medical errors may be underestimated as the IOM only considered errors in hospital patients, a small portion of the at-risk population. Many patients receive complex care in ambulatory settings. The Institute of Medicine highlighted that medical errors are primarily a systemic issue, not individual negligence. Health care lags behind other industries in addressing factors that affect performance. While there are few studies on adverse events in hospitals, there is abundant literature on adverse drug events. Adverse drug events, the most common type of adverse events in hospitals, result in up to 7,000 American deaths annually. These events are divided into adverse drug reactions and injuries caused by medication errors. Examples of errors include prescribing drugs to patients with allergies and improper administration of intravenous solutions. Studies show that adverse drug events occur in 6.5% of cases. Studies show that adverse drug events occur in 6.5% to more than 20% of hospitalized patients, with one-quarter to one-half being due to medication errors. Newly published research suggests that Medicare patients may experience up to 180,000 life-threatening or fatal adverse drug events annually. The majority of medication errors do not lead to adverse events, often caught before administration. The IOM recommends a nationwide mandatory reporting system for medication errors stemming from complex systems rather than individual negligence. The IOM recommended a nationwide mandatory reporting system for adverse events in healthcare settings to hold providers accountable and ensure appropriate follow-up actions. Organizations that continue unsafe practices risk penalties, sanctions, and loss of business. The IOM also proposed voluntary reporting systems for errors with little or no harm. The IOM recommended a nationwide mandatory reporting system for adverse events in healthcare settings to hold providers accountable. Voluntary reporting focuses on systemic problems to prevent serious errors. State adverse event reporting systems have been in place since the 1970s, with many states introducing legislation to address medical errors. Twenty-two states have laws requiring hospitals to report medical errors, with reporting requirements varying widely. For example, Washington mandates reporting medication-related errors, while Tennessee requires reporting of any unusual events. Florida requires reporting errors resulting in specified injuries, and Pennsylvania mandates reporting any situation compromising quality assurance or patient safety. Arizona requires healthcare facilities to review reports made by medical practitioners. Arizona requires healthcare facilities to review reports made by medical practitioners regarding violations of professional standards or the law. New Jersey mandates hospitals to report \"serious medical errors\" to regulators and patients. States struggle to analyze the reports they receive, with few hospitals receiving feedback. Designing reporting systems is challenging as states aim to motivate prompt error reporting while ensuring accountability through public disclosure. The public has a right to error information according to the IOM. The IOM emphasized the public's right to error information in healthcare. Providers are hesitant to report adverse events due to fear of increased malpractice lawsuits. The balance between data protection and public disclosure leans towards data protection, with legal processes like Freedom of Information requests being used to compel disclosure of confidential information. States have implemented legal options to protect mandatory reporting system data, such as exempting it from public disclosure laws or relying on peer review statutes. However, individual rights in personal lawsuits can sometimes override peer review protection. Most reporting systems have specific data protections in place to prevent discovery or subpoena. Legal protections for reporters in mandatory reporting systems include protection from discovery, subpoena, search warrant, and civil or administrative proceedings. These protections may also extend to exclusion from lawsuits, monetary liability, antitrust lawsuits, compelled testimony, and whistleblower protection. System design features like de-identifying data and anonymous reporting can reduce the need for strong legal protections but may limit the information's utility to analysts. Despite efforts to shield error information, states struggle with underreporting adverse events, which can impact healthcare quality. Failure to inform patients of medical errors can delay treatment and expose physicians to liability. Underreporting hinders research on error prevalence and causes, impacting quality improvement initiatives. Legal fears contribute to underreporting, but other factors include lack of internal systems, medical culture, and fear of institutional sanctions. The fear of legal repercussions, damage to reputation, and lack of clear benefits may discourage reporting of medical errors. Legal protection alone may not be enough to promote reporting. The IOM recommends public disclosure of all investigation findings to drive improvements in healthcare, but current disclosure practices are inconsistent. The disclosure of adverse event information is often sporadic and inconsistent across states. Some states are prohibited from releasing certain data, while others refrain from disclosure due to concerns about data completeness and reliability. States may also be reluctant to disclose information to alleviate concerns of hospitals and practitioners. Only seven states with mandatory reporting systems release incident-specific data, while the rest issue aggregate reports. Accessing public information on adverse events is often difficult and may lack accompanying analysis for interpretation. Overall, state reporting systems have had a modest impact on improving patient safety, with evidence of improvement largely anecdotal. Most state programs suffer from underreporting and lack data aggregation and analysis. Limited resources and the absence of standard reporting requirements hinder the synthesis of information for broad system improvements. State programs focus on investigating specific events rather than identifying general trends or communicating alerts and concerns. The IOM recommended that state regulatory programs continue to operate mandatory reporting systems to investigate specific cases and issue penalties. To establish a nationwide mandatory reporting system, Congress should designate the National Quality Forum to issue reporting standards, require healthcare institutions to report standardized information on adverse events, and provide funds and expertise to improve error reporting systems at the state level. The National Quality Forum (NQF) was established in May 1999 to develop a national strategy for measuring and reporting healthcare quality. In 2002, NQF released a list of 27 preventable adverse events for reporting by healthcare facilities. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended that the Department of Health and Human Services collect error reports if states do not implement mandatory reporting systems. Currently, HHS does not require healthcare providers to report medical errors. The IOM recommended establishing a Center for Patient Safety within AHRQ for states to share information and expertise on medical errors. They also suggested implementing voluntary reporting systems to collect information on less serious mistakes to identify vulnerabilities in healthcare systems and prevent serious errors. The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) was highlighted as a potential model for national voluntary reporting systems for medical errors. The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) allows individuals in the civilian airline industry to report incidents compromising aviation safety. ASRS analyzes these reports to identify system deficiencies and human performance errors, contributing to improvements in aviation safety over the past 28 years. The data is used to support policies, planning, and human factors safety research in the national aviation system. ASRS provides feedback through alert messages and analytical reports to address immediate issues. The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) provides various resources such as alert messages, analytical reports, an online database, a safety newsletter, and a safety bulletin. It is administered by NASA in agreement with the FAA, with an annual budget of $2.5 million. Reporters are protected with confidentiality and limited immunity from disciplinary action for potential violations. The FAA does not penalize individuals who submit incident reports to ASRS within 10 days of the violation. The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) allows individuals to submit incident reports within 10 days of a violation, as long as it was inadvertent, not deliberate, and not criminal. Reporters are protected from disciplinary action and the program is administered by NASA independently of the FAA. The success of the program is attributed to its confidentiality, simplicity of reporting, timely feedback, and perceived value by users. The ASRS complements the NTSB in investigating aviation accidents. Other voluntary reporting systems for medical errors include the VA Patient Safety Information System and the Medication Error Reporting program. The FDA encourages reporting of adverse events involving drugs. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) manages a large healthcare network and is a leader in patient safety. In 1999, the VA established the National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) to develop a culture of safety. They created the Patient Safety Information System (PSIS) for employees to report adverse events and close calls without fear of punishment, except for intentionally unsafe acts. The National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) emphasizes the importance of non-punitive reporting systems in healthcare to identify vulnerabilities and systemic problems. They argue that punitive accountability systems hinder patient safety improvement by discouraging reporting. The Patient Safety Information System (PSIS) supplements VA's accountability systems by focusing on prevention through root cause analysis of adverse events. Root cause analysis identifies underlying causal factors, primarily focusing on systems and processes. The National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) focuses on root cause analysis to identify systemic issues in healthcare. They implemented the Patient Safety Information System (PSIS) which led to a significant increase in reporting of close calls and adverse events. The PSIS has been recognized for its impact on patient safety and has been emulated by other healthcare programs. Additionally, the VA collaborated with NASA to develop the Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS) to further enhance reporting and safety measures. The VA collaborated with NASA to develop the Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS) in 2002, modeled after the ASRS, to provide a confidential reporting system for close calls and adverse events. JCAHO, an independent organization, also has a Sentinel Events Reporting System for healthcare organizations in the US. JCAHO established a sentinel event reporting system for hospitals in 1996 to address unanticipated deaths or major permanent losses of function. Sentinel events include patient suicide, rape, infant abduction, major blood transfusion reactions, and wrong patient or body part surgeries. Accredited hospitals must conduct root cause analyses, implement risk-reducing improvements, and monitor their effectiveness without fear of accreditation status penalties. The accreditation status of an organization reporting sentinel events to JCAHO is mandatory to avoid risk of losing accreditation. Despite efforts to analyze error-related information and provide recommendations, hospitals are hesitant to report sentinel events due to concerns about confidentiality, reputation damage, and potential legal consequences. The Medication Errors Reporting Program was initiated in 1975 by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices. The Medication Errors Reporting (MER) program, started in 1975 by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), is now owned by the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP). It receives voluntary reports from pharmacists about adverse drug events, which are then shared with ISMP, the FDA, and the pharmaceutical company involved. The Medication Errors Reporting (MER) program, owned by the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), receives voluntary reports from pharmacists about adverse drug events. Errors reported include administering the wrong drug, strength, or dose, confusion over look-alike drugs, and incorrect route of administration. ISMP provides an independent review and publishes biweekly reports with recommendations. Additionally, USP's MedMARx program, started in 1998, allows hospitals to report medication errors anonymously through a standardized form. Management can retrieve compiled data on their facility and obtain comparative information on other hospitals. Information is not shared with the FDA. The MedMARx program, owned by USP, allows hospitals to report medication errors anonymously through a standardized form. A national report released in December 2004 summarized medication error data collected by MedMARx in 2003. The analysis was based on 235,159 errors reported by 570 hospitals and health care facilities. MedMARx has received positive reviews for its design features and is viewed as safe and straightforward by hospital employees. Unlike JCAHO's system, MedMARx does not rely on hospitals to report events with serious outcomes. MedMARx relies on individual employees submitting anonymous reports of all types of medication errors, whether or not they result in harm. The data are analyzed by experts, and reporters receive timely feedback of useful information. The FDA regulates manufacturers of drugs, devices, and biological products, monitoring safety through postmarketing surveillance. Adverse event reporting is a key component of this surveillance. Healthcare facilities and users must report deaths and serious injuries to manufacturers and the FDA. Reporting adverse events associated with drugs is mandatory for manufacturers. Healthcare professionals and consumers can voluntarily report adverse drug events and device problems through FDA's MedWatch program. FDA receives around 235,000 reports annually for adverse drug events and over 80,000 reports on device problems, deciding on corrective actions case by case based on various factors. The FDA pursues three strategies for corrective action: negotiation with manufacturers, regulatory action, and informing healthcare professionals and the public about drug risks. A final rule in 2004 required bar codes on prescription and over-the-counter drugs to prevent adverse events and save costs. The FDA proposed new reporting requirements for medication errors to improve safety and monitoring. Manufacturers must submit reports of actual and potential errors within 15 days, using internationally agreed definitions and formats for submission to regulatory agencies. The FDA proposed new reporting requirements for medication errors to improve safety and monitoring, allowing companies to submit a single report to major regulatory agencies worldwide. An effective reporting program encourages reporting, analyzes data for vulnerabilities, and promotes preventive strategies for patient safety. The IOM report advised against a comprehensive national voluntary reporting system due to existing systems and the high volume of potential reports. The IOM recommended promoting existing reporting systems within healthcare organizations, focusing on specific areas of medical care, and sharing information across different systems to manage the potential volume of reports and match expertise to problems. The IOM recommended establishing a federal Center for Patient Safety to set national goals, fund research, evaluate methods for preventing medical errors, and disseminate best practices. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act aims to protect information about medical errors voluntarily submitted to patient safety organizations for analysis and recommendations on improving patient safety. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (H.R. 663) aims to provide legal protection for patient safety work product developed by healthcare providers for reporting to Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs). This work product would be privileged and not subject to subpoenas, discovery, or disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Patient safety work product, under the House-passed bill, would be protected and not subject to subpoenas, discovery, or disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. It includes information specifically created for Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs) and does not encompass traditional medical record keeping documents or communications. PSOs would be certified to collect and analyze this work product submitted by providers. The House-passed bill aims to protect patient safety work product submitted by providers and establish criteria for PSO certification. PSOs must have qualified staff, operate independently, and submit de-identified information to a national database. AHRQ would develop national standards for health information technology interoperability. The House-passed bill focuses on promoting health information technology interoperability and establishing standards for patient safety work product. H.R. 663 aimed to support voluntary reporting of medical errors, implement unique product identifiers for drugs, authorize grant programs for electronic prescribing, and create a Medical Information Technology Advisory Board. The Senate passed a similar bill (S. 720) with some key differences. Senator Jeffords reintroduced the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (S. 544) on March 8, 2005, which was unanimously approved by the Senate HELP Committee on March 9, 2005. The bill defined \"patient safety work product\" and provided legal protection for it. The bill defined a patient safety evaluation system as a process for collecting, managing, or analyzing information submitted to or by a PSO. Legal protections in S. 544 apply to all \"patient safety data,\" with concerns raised about the broad definition of patient safety data during the 108th Congress. Critics argued that it would extend evidentiary privilege and confidentiality protections to a wide range of quality-related data. The bill's confidentiality protections extend to patient safety data related to quality and outcomes, potentially preempting state laws on reporting infection rates and adverse events. Patient safety data is defined as information collected by providers for reporting to a PSO within 60 days. The separate data provision in S. 544 has been criticized as circular, stating that information not classified as patient safety data is not patient safety data. The bill also includes provisions to protect mandatory state reporting laws, allowing reporting of non-patient safety data to governmental agencies for public health purposes. H.R. 663 had similar language to protect patient safety work. H.R. 663 and S. 544 differ in their approach to protecting patient safety work product in legal proceedings. H.R. 663 would shield this information from discovery and admission as evidence in civil and administrative cases, while S. 544 would only allow access if a judge deems it relevant to a criminal act directly harming the patient. The IOM emphasized the importance of safeguarding voluntarily reported patient safety information in legal proceedings. The bills H.R. 663 and S. 544 aim to protect patient safety data in legal proceedings. S. 544 encourages voluntary reporting of near misses and other issues to identify healthcare system vulnerabilities. Patient safety data is designated as confidential, with civil fines for negligent disclosure. H.R. 663 specifies circumstances for disclosure of patient safety work product and imposes penalties of up to $10,000 per violation for unauthorized disclosures. The bill does not explicitly state work product confidentiality but implies it. Violations are subject to fines for negligent or knowing breaches of confidentiality. Disclosures violating HIPAA privacy rule are subject to HIPAA penalties. Providers can voluntarily submit patient safety data under the legislation. Under the patientsafety legislation, providers would voluntarily submit information on medical errors to designated PSOs for analysis and dissemination of evidence-based information to improve patientsafety. H.R. 663 would have required AHRQ to certify PSOs based on specific criteria, excluding entities like the Department of Veterans Affairs. H.R. 663 and S. 544 propose different approaches to patient safety organizations (PSOs). H.R. 663 requires PSOs to protect patient safety work product confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. In contrast, S. 544 relies on PSO self-certification without criteria on entity types or conflict of interest. Both bills allow for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000. Both H.R. 663 and S. 544 propose civil penalties of up to $10,000 for disclosing patient safety information. S. 544 allows employees to sue for wrongful adverse employment actions, including reinstatement and back pay, and specifies that providers include state-run facilities. S. 544 includes a provision for state hospitals to be subject to civil action, while H.R. 663 mandates unique product identifiers on drug packaging. Both bills require national health IT standards, but H.R. 663 includes additional provisions for grants to physicians and hospitals. The patient safety legislation includes grants for electronic prescription programs and health IT systems for hospitals. It also proposes the creation of a Medical Information Technology Advisory Board to improve electronic information exchange for patient safety and healthcare quality. Congress and the Administration have already taken steps to promote IT systems for patient information exchange. The Commission on Systemic Interoperability was established to develop a strategy for health IT data standards and grants for physicians. The National Coordinator for Health Information Technology released a 10-year Framework for Strategic Action to transform healthcare delivery through electronic health records and a national health information infrastructure. Adopting interoperability standards will allow local networks to connect and form a nationwide health information infrastructure. The National Coordinator for Health Information Technology released a 10-year Framework for Strategic Action to transform healthcare delivery through electronic health records and a national health information infrastructure, allowing local networks to connect and form a NHII."
