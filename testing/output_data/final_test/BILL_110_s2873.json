The Secretary must provide a purpose and need statement within 90 days of receiving a complete application.

No environmental impact statement can begin without the Secretary's assessment. The Secretary must provide a purpose and need statement to permit applicants before starting a water storage project. A record of decision outlining permit conditions must be given before issuing the permit. A Corps of Engineers board of appeals will be established by the Secretary. The Corps of Engineers Board of Appeals, established by the Secretary, consists of 5 members who make determinations on appeals related to permits for water storage projects. Three members represent State water development agencies, and two represent the Corps of Engineers. The Corps of Engineers Board of Appeals, consisting of 5 members, makes determinations on appeals related to permits for water storage projects. Appeals must be based on a purpose and need statement, a record of decision, or a final decision of the Secretary. The Board must make a determination within 90 days of the appeal being filed. The Board evaluates field decisions of the Corps of Engineers, permit conditions, and permit denials for water storage projects.
