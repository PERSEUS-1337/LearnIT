    "content": "The \"Brownfields Redevelopment Act of 1996\" is also known as the Environmental Remediation Tax Credit Act. It introduces a new subpart in the Internal Revenue Code for environmental remediation credits. This Act aims to provide tax credits for environmental cleanup efforts. The Environmental Remediation Tax Credit Act offers a 50 percent credit for costs incurred by a taxpayer for environmental cleanup on a qualified contaminated site owned by them, following an approved remediation plan. The Environmental Remediation Tax Credit Act requires certification from the EPA for the completion of an environmental remediation plan on a qualified contaminated site. The tax credit will be spread out over 5 years if the plan is certified, and there is a special rule for cost increases. The taxpayer may stop an environmental remediation plan if costs exceed 200% of estimates, with approval from the state or local official, and receive a credit spread over 5 years. A taxpayer is not eligible for any credit under this section for a qualified contaminated site if they were the owner or operator of a business on the site before the enactment of this subpart, arranged for disposal of hazardous materials at the site, accepted hazardous materials for transport to the site, or are related to a taxpayer meeting these criteria. The term 'qualified contaminated site' refers to a site that is unlikely to be redeveloped without participation in an environmental remediation credit program, has not been in use for at least 1 year before program participation, and shows a strong likelihood of redevelopment. The term 'qualified contaminated site' refers to a site with a strong likelihood of redevelopment for industrial or commercial use, leading to job creation and tax base expansion. Environmental remediation and redevelopment are expected to be completed within a reasonable timeframe. \"SEC. 54A. DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULES.\" The term 'contaminated site' refers to a site with environmental conditions like release of hazardous substances, storage tanks with toxic substances, or illegal waste disposal. Hazardous substances are defined under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Environmental remediation under this subpart includes removal or remediation activities, restoration of natural resources, health assessments, and studies related to the site. Materials such as petroleum, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, and lead paint are considered hazardous substances. Environmental remediation under this subpart includes health assessments, off-site contamination remediation, and other specified costs such as demolition, site security, permit fees, and environmental audits. Related persons are defined based on regulatory or specified relationships. The tax code is amended to include an environmental remediation credit under section 54(a). There is a limitation on carrying back this credit before the effective date, and a deduction for unused credit is also addressed. The tax code is amended to include an environmental remediation credit under section 54. A clerical amendment is made to the table of subparts for part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section regarding the use of redevelopment bonds for environmental remediation will apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act. The amendment allows for the costs of environmental remediation for qualified contaminated sites to be included as a redevelopment purpose under the Internal Revenue Code. The government agency designated by the Administrator carries out functions under this clause. Certain requirements do not apply to redevelopment bonds for environmental remediation. The requirement of paragraph (2)(B)(ii) for payment security can be met through taxes or approval by the elected representative of the issuing governmental unit. Subparagraphs (C) and (D) of paragraphs (2) and (4) do not apply in this case. In the case of financing for costs described in section 144(c)(3)(A)(v), no deduction for interest on such financing is allowed during any period with a determination by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the head of any State. The amendments made by this section apply to bonds issued after the enactment of this Act."
