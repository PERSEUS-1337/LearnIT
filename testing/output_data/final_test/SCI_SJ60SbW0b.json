    "content": "Deep neural networks can solve tasks in various domains, but understanding their mechanisms and failure modes is challenging. A method for visualizing neural networks' inner mechanisms and attention masks is presented, improving interpretability by highlighting critical input attributes. The framework is effective across different network architectures in computer vision and natural language processing, providing unique insights into the network's operations. Machine-learning systems, driven by recent advances in deep learning, are used in safety-critical areas like self-driving cars and healthcare. Deep neural networks offer the advantage of learning their own feature representation for tasks, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The use of deep learning models in critical applications highlights the importance of understanding their decision-making processes. Various methods have been developed to increase the interpretability of these systems, including visualizing network relationships and eliciting explanations for decisions. Our method aims to capture and comprehend the focus and disregard of neural networks. The method focuses on attention mechanisms in neural networks, specifically highlighting key attributes of input data through explicit attention mechanisms. These mechanisms act as filters on the input, allowing for selective replacement of irrelevant components without significantly impacting the network output. This insight leads to the evaluation of \"selective replaceability\" to enhance interpretability of network decision-making. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to indirectly measure latent attention mechanisms in neural networks using selective replaceability. A Latent Attention Network (LAN) is trained to generate masks indicating the replaceability of input components with noise. This method enhances interpretability of network decision-making by evaluating the property of selective replaceability. The Latent Attention Network (LAN) framework is used to analyze pre-trained networks by identifying critical components of input data. It provides insights into how classifiers localize digits before determining their class, predicting regions where digits are less likely to be properly classified. The framework visualizes latent attention mechanisms of classifiers, enhancing interpretability of network decision-making. The framework visualizes latent attention mechanisms of classifiers in image and natural language classification domains, highlighting important visual features and relevant words. Attention is applied to neural networks to improve performance by providing informative priors, easing the burden of learning complex output spaces. Existing content-based attention models are surveyed in relevant literature. BID4, BID32, and BID10 explore attention models in various supervised learning tasks like speech recognition, machine translation, and image caption generation. They visualize network focus on visual content for answering questions. BID33 distinguishes dataset-centric and network-centric visualization methods for neural networks. Visualization methods for neural networks can be dataset-centric or network-centric. Dataset-centric methods have the advantage of being network agnostic, treating the network as a black box. Prior work focused on specific network architectures like convolutional networks, with methods like visualizing input patterns that activate feature maps. This approach uses Deconvolutional Networks to project node activations back to the input pixel space, creating interpretable feature visualizations. Ongoing research continues to improve these visualization techniques. The curr_chunk discusses different methods for increasing interpretability in machine learning systems, including strategies for eliciting explanations and visualizing attention in network architectures. It also mentions sensitivity analysis as a way to understand input variables' contribution to decisions made by the network. This dataset-centric approach is considered unique and the first of its kind in this regard. The approach discussed involves minimal knowledge about the network, utilizing a Latent Attention Network to identify critical input components through an attention mask. This method allows for probing the network at its input or output without access to the network architecture. The Latent Attention Network framework involves using an attention mask to corrupt input components based on noise probability density, allowing for comparison of the output with the original using a loss function. The Latent Attention Network framework trains the LAN A by minimizing a training objective for each input x, where A(x) corrupts input components to maximize distortion while minimizing the reproducibility error with respect to the loss function L F. The LAN is specified by the loss function L F and the noise distribution H, chosen based on the visualization task. The noise distribution H in the Latent Attention Network framework should reflect the expected space of inputs to the network F. It is important to ensure that the noise vector \u03b7 lies near the manifold of the input samples, especially in structured spaces like images or text. Two methods of defining H are proposed: constant noise \u03b7 const and generating process for \u03b7. In structured spaces like images or text, the noise distribution in the Latent Attention Network framework should be near the manifold of input samples. Two methods of defining the noise distribution are proposed: constant noise \u03b7 const and bootstrapped noise \u03b7 boot. The latter approach is effective in domains where data occupies a small manifold of the input space, such as natural images. Randomly selecting an image ensures proximity to the manifold, simplifying the network to a single trainable variable for each input. The Latent Attention Network framework aims to condense a whole network into a single trainable variable of the same shape as the input. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in various learning tasks, including digit and object classification. The framework's flexibility is showcased in a topic modeling task, with a focus on fully-connected LANs for now. Future work may explore more expressive LAN architectures. Our LAN implementations involve 2-5 fully-connected layers with fewer than 1000 hidden units. Tasks include training deep networks for digit classification, CNNs for object detection, and bag-of-words neural networks for topic classification using various datasets. The text discusses training a bag-of-words neural network for document classification into twenty categories. A Latent Attention Network is then trained on the network F to visualize the attention mechanism on input samples. Results are provided with visualizations of samples from the Translated MNIST dataset and their corresponding attention maps produced by the LAN network. The attention maps produced by the LAN network show a blob of attention around the digit and a constant grid pattern in the background. The grid pattern indicates two phases of the classifier network: detecting the digit's presence and focusing attention on the digit for classification. Classification accuracy is expected to decrease in areas without the grid pattern. Testing this idea involved estimating classifier errors on digits at different locations in the image. The study involved rescaling digits to 7x7 pixels to fit them in regions not covered by the constant grid. The normalized accuracy decreased around the edges of the image where the grid was less present, especially with smaller digits. An experiment with a modified version of the Translated MNIST domain confirmed this, showing the absence of the grid pattern in areas where digits never appeared during training. The LAN's attention masks reveal common visual features in images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, indicating the classifier's ability to learn canonical representations for classification. The absence of grid patterns in certain regions leads to decreased accuracy, highlighting the importance of attention masks in diagnosing potential failure modes. The LAN demonstrates the ability to compose high-level concepts for classification, particularly evident in distinguishing between horse and deer classes based on attention regions. Important words highlighted in documents aid in topic classification, with the LAN ignoring irrelevant words due to noise choice. The LAN effectively composes high-level concepts for classification, distinguishing between horse and deer classes based on attention regions. Important words highlighted in documents aid in topic classification, with the LAN ignoring irrelevant words due to noise choice. Future work will explore the use of LANs in natural language tasks. The attention mask generated for a document in the Newsgroup-20 Dataset labeled \"soc.religion.christian\" contains the word UNK, likely due to references from Abrahamic texts. The attention masks are correlated with pre-trained network outputs and retain class-specific features. Results on the same datasets show sample-specific attention masks closely tracking image subjects. The attention masks generated for documents in the Newsgroup-20 Dataset closely track specific features related to the content, such as religious references. This approach allows for a more nuanced representation of individual samples, making it easier to optimize attention masks for each sample compared to a full network. Visualizations of sample-specific attention masks show highlighted words present in both the document and the attention mask. In this work, Latent Attention Networks are proposed as a framework for capturing the latent attention mechanisms of neural networks. The analysis of these attention measurements can diagnose failure modes in pre-trained networks and offer insights into how networks perform tasks. There are potential research directions that draw parallels with Generative Adversarial Networks. The Latent Attention Networks framework explores parallels with Generative Adversarial Networks, suggesting the possibility of training F and A as adversaries to enhance learning in challenging domains. Two types of noise for input corruption were explored, with potential for integrating noise generation into the network itself. Better mechanisms for capturing noise could enhance the LAN's ability to identify regions of attention without the need for specific noise selection. In the experiment subsections, network architectures are described with abbreviated notation for layers. Attention masks produced by a LAN trained on a digit classifier are investigated, providing insight into neural network methods and failure modes. A \"translated MNIST\" domain is constructed to scale down digits and analyze their positioning. The experiment subsections describe network architectures using abbreviated notation for layers. A latent attention network (LAN) trained on a digit classifier is used to investigate attention masks, providing insight into neural network methods and failure modes. The LAN framework is demonstrated to illuminate the decision-making process of the classifier in a \"translated MNIST\" domain. The LAN framework is used to analyze the decision-making process of a classifier based on the Alexnet architecture for natural images. The CIFAR-10 dataset is augmented to prevent overfitting by applying random affine transformations during training. The pre-trained network F has a specific architecture with dropout and local response normalization at each layer. It is trained with the Adam Optimizer for 250,000 iterations using a one-hot vector for image class indication. The latent attention network A has a different architecture and its output is reshaped to a 32x32x1 image. In this experiment, the LAN framework is extended for non-visual tasks, specifically for analyzing a bag-of-words document classifier. A Deep Averaging Network (DAN) is trained on the Newsgroup-20 dataset, consisting of 18,821 documents divided into training and test sets. Each document belongs to one of 20 categories such as religion, sports, computer hardware, and politics. The DAN Architecture is used for analyzing a bag-of-words document classifier on the Newsgroup-20 dataset with stop words removed. Each document is represented by a bag-of-words histogram vector, multiplied with an embedding matrix and passed through hidden layers to produce a distribution over 20 classes. The model is trained for 1,000,000 mini-batches with specific layer sizes and batch size. The DAN Architecture is utilized for analyzing a bag-of-words document classifier on the Newsgroup-20 dataset. The latent attention network, A, has a specific architecture and is trained with the Adam Optimizer for a set number of iterations. Sample specific experiments involve training masks with different learning rates for Newsgroup-20 and CIFAR-10 datasets. The role of the \u03b2 hyperparameter in these experiments is illustrated. The role of the hyperparameter \u03b2 in sample specific experiments is to control the trade-off between input corruption and similarity to uncorrupted inputs in a pretrained network. High values of \u03b2 encourage more input corruption, while low values aim to identify critical input dimensions affecting network output. This balance is crucial for reconstructing network outputs accurately. The hyperparameter \u03b2 controls input corruption in a pretrained network. High values make output reconstruction difficult. Attention masks were visualized on Inception network for image classification. Different \u03b2 settings were used to learn sample-specific masks. The masks showed richer patterns on larger images with more classes compared to CIFAR-10 dataset. In a real-world application of machine learning, a neural network failed to detect camouflaged tanks due to biased training data. The dataset only included positive tank examples on cloudy days, leading to a classifier that relied on weather patterns instead of tank presence. The study focuses on training an image classifier to detect tanks in forests using synthetic images with trees, clouds, and tanks. The dataset is designed to highlight the impact of biased training data on classifier performance. Despite high accuracy on testing data, the classifier struggles to detect tanks without clouds, similar to the real-world scenario where weather patterns influenced tank detection. The image classifier trained to detect tanks in forests struggles to identify tanks without clouds, highlighting the impact of biased training data. The attention mask reveals that the classifier wrongly associates tank detection with the presence of clouds, emphasizing the importance of visualizing the network's rationale for its outputs."
