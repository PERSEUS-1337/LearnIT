The mortgagor must demonstrate that prior delinquency was due to financial hardship beyond their control. If found ineligible, they cannot reapply for assistance until 6 months unless there is a material change in their financial circumstances. Financial hardship is determined by a reduction in income or an increase in expenses. The Secretary may consider various circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control, such as loss of job, salary reduction, injury, divorce, or death of a household member. Nonprofit housing counseling agencies are designated to assist in implementing the program. Nonprofit housing agencies approved under this subsection must assist eligible mortgagors for the entire duration of their assistance under this Act. SEC. 3. LEGAL ACTION.

SEC. 4. APPLICATION FOR ASSISTANCE. To apply for assistance under this Act, a mortgagor must attend a face-to-face meeting with the mortgagee or approved counseling agency within 30 days of receiving notice. The meeting aims to restructure the mortgage payment schedule to prevent legal action. If the mortgagor meets with the counseling agency, they must send notice of the meeting to the mortgagee within 5 business days. If the mortgagor cannot resolve the default within 30 days of the meeting, they can apply for mortgage assistance under this Act. An approved counseling agency will help prepare and submit the application to the Secretary within 30 days. The Secretary may pay counseling agencies a fee for their assistance. The approved counseling agency must notify the mortgagee within 5 business days of submitting the application for assistance. The application must include a financial statement detailing all assets, liabilities, and household income. Intentional misrepresentation of financial information may result in denial of assistance and repayment requirements. The mortgagor must repay any assistance received promptly, and the mortgagee can enforce the mortgage without further restrictions. An application for assistance can be obtained from an approved counseling agency. The Secretary must determine eligibility within 60 days and notify the mortgagor and mortgagee of the decision within 5 business days.

An application for assistance can be obtained from an approved counseling agency. Eligibility is determined within 60 days, with notification to the mortgagor and mortgagee within 5 business days. The Secretary pays the full amount due to the mortgagee for eligible mortgagors without acceleration, including principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and attorneys' fees. Monthly assistance payments are made to the mortgagee on behalf of the mortgagor as per the Act. The mortgagor must make monthly payments to the Secretary, ensuring their total housing expense does not exceed 35% of their net income. The Secretary then sends the total mortgage payment directly to the mortgagee. If the mortgagor fails to pay, the Secretary reviews the delinquency. The Secretary will review the mortgagor's financial circumstances if there are any delinquencies in payments. If the delinquency is not due to a change in financial circumstances, future mortgage assistance payments will be terminated. If there is a change, the Secretary will modify the required payments. Payments under this Act can be provided for up to 36 months, consecutively or nonconsecutively. The Secretary will periodically review the mortgagor's financial situation to determine if payment continuation, termination, or adjustment is necessary. SEC. 6. REPAYMENT OF ASSISTANCE. The Secretary provides assistance payments to the mortgagee, with any excess amount becoming a loan to the mortgagor. The mortgagor must repay the assistance loan, including interest, through monthly payments to the Secretary. The repayment agreement starts once mortgage assistance payments are no longer needed. The mortgagor must repay the assistance loan based on their housing expense relative to their net effective income. If housing expense is less than 35 percent, the mortgagor pays the difference to the Secretary. If housing expense is more than 35 percent, repayment is deferred until housing expense decreases. The mortgagor must repay mortgage assistance if housing expense is less than 35% of net effective income. Repayment continues until the mortgage is paid in full, with interest accruing monthly at the current average yield on 30-year bonds. Repayment is secured by a lien. Repayment of assistance to the Secretary is secured by a mortgage lien on the property and other obligations as required. The lien does not take priority over existing secured liens. Repayment must be made within 14 days after each mortgage payment is due or when the mortgage is paid in full. Subordination of the mortgage lien may be allowed for home improvement loans necessary to preserve the property.
