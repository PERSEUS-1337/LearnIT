This Act aims to allocate amounts specifically for the conservation of endangered species. Taxpayers can designate overpayments of tax for endangered species conservation when filing their tax return. The overpayment designated will be treated as refunded to the taxpayer.

The Endangered Species Conservation Trust Fund allows taxpayers to designate overpayments for conservation when filing their tax return. This is part of the Endangered Species Conservation Incentives Act of 1995. The Endangered Species Conservation Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to receive appropriations and credits for conservation purposes. Amounts designated under section 6097 are transferred to the fund, and the Secretary pays the Interior Secretary from the fund quarterly for conservation efforts. The Endangered Species Conservation Trust Fund is used to pay administrative expenses of the Treasury related to tax forms, fund operations, and processing payments. Amendments are made to the table of parts for subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Code. The Endangered Species Conservation Trust Fund is established, and amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code regarding real property subject to endangered species conservation agreements.

The value of the taxable estate for the tax imposed by section 2001 is determined by deducting the value of any endangered species agreement property from the gross estate. Endangered species agreement property refers to real property where all owners have entered into a conservation agreement and written agreement with the Secretary. The executor of the decedent's estate can elect to apply a section that requires filing an endangered species conservation agreement with the Secretary. This agreement commits individuals to carry out conservation activities on their property, certified by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, to assist in species conservation. The endangered species conservation agreement, designated by the Secretary under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, must last at least 10 years. No tax credit is allowed under section 30A if an election is made. Recapture of tax benefits may occur in cases of interest disposition or material breach. If a person disposes of property or breaches an endangered species conservation agreement within 10 years, an additional estate tax is imposed. The tax amount is the lesser of the adjusted tax difference.

The tax amount is the lesser of the adjusted tax difference attributable to such interest or the amount realized with respect to the interest. An exception applies if the transferee assumes obligations of the transferor under the agreement. An additional tax is imposed if a person disposes of property or breaches an endangered species conservation agreement within 10 years. The tax becomes due 6 months after the disposition or breach. If a taxpayer incurs this tax liability, a statute of limitations applies. The additional tax imposed for property disposition or breach of an endangered species conservation agreement must be assessed within 3 years of notification to the Secretary. The election for this tax must be made on the tax return under section 2001, as per regulations provided by the Secretary. The Secretary will provide regulations.
