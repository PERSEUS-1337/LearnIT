    "content": "The Reauthorization Act changes federal capital case procedures, including those for air piracy cases before 1994 and habeas procedures for state capital petitioners. In the 1970s, the Supreme Court deemed capital punishment procedures unconstitutional. Congress established new procedures for death penalty cases in 1974 and updated them in 1994. The Act now explicitly addresses retroactive application of procedures to air piracy cases. The Reauthorization Act adds provisions to federal capital case procedures, including expedited habeas corpus procedures for state death row inmates. States can opt-in based on qualifying assistance of counsel mechanisms determined by the Attorney General. The act establishes a de novo standard for these procedures. The Reauthorization Act adds provisions to federal capital case procedures, including expedited habeas corpus procedures for state death row inmates. States can opt-in based on qualifying assistance of counsel mechanisms determined by the Attorney General. The act establishes a de novo standard of review for the Attorney General's determination before the D.C. Circuit. The Streamlined Procedures Acts in the House and Senate, H.R. 3035 and S. 1088, would make similar changes in the opt-in procedure. S. 956, H.R. 2388, and H.R. 3132 contain a common amendment governing federal habeas cases of an individual convicted under state law of killing a child. The proposed bills aim to expedite judicial consideration of claims meeting specific criteria and change the venue for capital cases. They suggest trying capital cases in the district where the offense occurred or where it began, continued, or was completed, replacing the current county trial system. The proposed 18 U.S.C. 3235 allows prosecution in any district for offenses affecting interstate commerce. The death penalty in federal capital cases requires consideration of specific factors listed in 18 U.S.C. 3592. H.R. 3860, among other bills, aimed to adjust these factors but failed to pass. H.R. 3860, H.R. 3060, and H.R. 5040 proposed adding various offenses to the list of aggravating factors in federal capital cases, including sexual abuse resulting in death, receipt of military training from a foreign terrorist organization, obstruction of justice, and other crimes. H.R. 3060 also suggested allowing capital sentencing juries with fewer than 12 members under certain circumstances. The bill proposed changes to capital sentencing procedures, including allowing for a capital sentencing jury with fewer than 12 members and increasing the number of alternate jurors. Additionally, the bill aimed to strike the provision outlawing the execution of the mentally retarded, although this was deemed inconsequential due to constitutional restrictions. The bill proposed changes to capital sentencing procedures, including allowing for a capital sentencing jury with fewer than 12 members and increasing the number of alternate jurors. It aimed to strike the provision outlawing the execution of the mentally retarded, which is constitutionally prohibited. The bill also included requirements for notice to the government and the option for an independent mental health examination when mental retardation is used as a mitigating factor in capital sentencing. H.R. 5040 proposed changes to capital sentencing procedures, including a new sentencing jury if unable to agree on a capital recommendation. It also aimed to grant the Attorney General regulatory authority without exclusive reference to state facilities and clarified the application of two assigned counsel in capital cases. The federal appellate courts are divided on the interpretation of these changes. The proposal in question involves the debate over whether a defendant is entitled to two attorneys in all capital cases or only when the death penalty is actively sought. It also includes language allowing the government to strike potential jurors in capital cases based on their views on the death penalty. Additionally, the Reauthorization Act introduces three new federal capital offenses. The proposed legislation includes new federal capital offenses related to the transportation of dangerous materials, destruction of vessels or maritime facilities, and gang violence prevention. Proposed legislation to counter gang violence includes new federal death penalty offenses, such as using interstate facilities for multiple murders and committing crimes of violence during drug trafficking. Other bills would make killing a police officer a federal capital offense under various circumstances. Proposed new federal capital offenses include agroterrorism resulting in death, interference with federal disaster relief efforts leading to death, death from trafficking in persons involving rape or kidnapping, evading immigration inspection resulting in death, and death from federal crimes of terrorism or weapons violations. The Reauthorization Act merges existing train wreck and mass transit offenses into a new capital offense under 18 U.S.C. 1992. Proposed death penalty sentencing options for crimes involving child safety are included in various bills like S. 956, H.R. 2388, H.R. 3132, H.R. 4472, and H.R. 3860. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act amended 18 U.S.C. 2245 to make murder a federal capital offense in cases of federal child sexual abuse offenses. Various bills proposed rewriting the federal criminal gang statute to allow capital punishment for certain offenses, including H.R. 1279, S. 155, H.R. 4472, and others. Several proposed bills aimed to make capital offenses of certain terrorism-related offenses, including participating in foreign nuclear programs, possessing anti-aircraft missiles, using radiological dispersal devices, possessing smallpox virus, and receiving military training from a foreign terrorist organization. These offenses could potentially result in the death penalty under the proposed legislation. Section 3591(a)(1) of federal capital punishment procedures allows for death penalty for treason or espionage based on aggravating factors listed in section 3592. H.R. 3060 proposed amending this to include violations of sections 2381 (treason), 794 (espionage), or 2339D (terrorist training) as punishable by death. The proposed amendment to federal capital punishment procedures would have added a fourth aggravating factor related to substantial planning by the defendant. However, there is uncertainty regarding the imposition of the death penalty for violations of section 2339D without involving first-degree murder. The Eighth Amendment prohibits imposing the death penalty for certain offenses, such as rape or murder, under specific circumstances. The proposed federal amendment would have repealed death penalty provisions for federal crimes, not state crimes. Another bill proposed a ten-year moratorium on capital punishment in states where an innocent person was sentenced to death."
