The Secretary of Transportation will establish a National Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund. The Commission's functions include investigating alternatives to replace the fuel tax as the main revenue source for the Fund over the next 30 years, consulting with relevant authorities, and considering State transportation agency views on revenue sources. The National Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund will investigate alternative revenue sources to replace the fuel tax over the next 30 years. Specific matters to be addressed include advantages and disadvantages of alternative revenue sources, time frame for transition, and recommendations for alternative revenue sources. The investigation by the National Commission on Future Revenue Sources will focus on alternative revenue sources for long-term Federal surface transportation financing. This includes developing a transition strategy from the current tax base to new funding mechanisms, recommendations for additional research, and considering the relative use of the highway system in determining revenues. The investigation will take into account recent studies on alternatives to the fuel tax and prior research by the Department of Transportation. The National Commission on Future Revenue Sources will consider various factors in developing recommendations for long-term surface transportation financing, including revenue generation, government and private sector roles, administrative costs, taxpayer privacy concerns, technological advances, alternative transportation vehicles, equity, economic efficiency, and flexibility of options. The National Commission on Future Revenue Sources will consist of 9 members appointed by the President, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and majority leader of the Senate. Members must have experience in public finance, transportation program administration, managing transportation organizations, academic research, or related activities. The National Commission on Future Revenue Sources will consist of 9 members appointed for life, with vacancies filled in the same manner. Members will serve without pay but receive travel expenses. The Chairman will be elected by the members, and the Commission may engage an organization to conduct investigations. The Commission will receive strategic guidance for the investigation and may request personnel from the Secretary for assistance. The Secretary will provide administrative support services upon request. The Commission must submit a final report to Congress by September 30, 2006 on the investigation results and recommendations. The Commission will terminate 180 days after submitting the final report to Congress. All records will be transferred to the National Archives. $2,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004 from the Highway Trust Fund for this section. The funds will be available for obligation as if apportioned under Title 23. The Federal share of the cost of the investigation and the Commission under this section shall be 100 percent, with funds available until expended."
