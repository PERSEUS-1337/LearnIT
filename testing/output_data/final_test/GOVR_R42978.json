The Supreme Court decision in 2012 impacted the connection between Medicaid and exchanges, potentially affecting the rate of uninsurance. The ACA expands health insurance coverage through Medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges. The Supreme Court decision in 2012 made the ACA expansion \"optional,\" leading to some states choosing not to expand Medicaid. This decision resulted in 12 million individuals covered under Medicaid and CHIP by 2022, 26 million individuals obtaining insurance through exchanges, and 29 million nonelderly individuals remaining uninsured. The Supreme Court's decision in 2012 made the ACA expansion \"optional,\" resulting in 29 million nonelderly individuals remaining uninsured. Post the Court's decision, 5 million fewer individuals would be covered under Medicaid and CHIP, and 3 million more individuals would be enrolled in the exchanges in 2022. This report analyzes the implications for those who may become eligible for subsidized exchange coverage due to their state choosing not to expand Medicaid. The report discusses the potential impact of Medicaid and exchange coverage differences on individuals eligible for subsidized coverage through the exchanges, current Medicaid beneficiaries at risk of losing coverage, and those who may experience \"churning\" between Medicaid and exchange coverage. Minimizing the effects of churning is crucial for maintaining health coverage for affected individuals and families. This report compares federal beneficiary benefits and costs of Medicaid and exchanges for individuals under 65. It focuses on non-disabled children, pregnant women, non-disabled adults, and individuals with chronic disabling conditions. Medicaid's eligibility classifications determine benefits and cost sharing. The analysis excludes impacts on Medicaid's 65+ populations. This report analyzes the impacts on Medicaid's age 65+ populations who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. It compares federal requirements that will shape states' program choices, without focusing on state-specific details. The analysis highlights the complexities in the interactions between Medicaid and the exchanges, noting that the coverage and regulatory landscape is evolving. The report reflects how the Administration may implement certain aspects of the ACA based on available regulations and guidance. This section provides a description of benefits under Medicaid and the exchanges, comparing the comprehensive package of mandatory and optional benefits offered by states. It includes primary, preventive, acute medical services, long-term services, and supports, as well as items like eyeglasses and prosthetic devices. Medicaid benefits vary by state, with coverage including services provided by physicians and hospitals, pregnancy-related services, and managed care arrangements. Some states also offer non-medical benefits like habilitation services for individuals with disabilities. States define specific features within federal guidelines, leading to variability in coverage limits such as inpatient hospital stays. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to offer alternative Medicaid plans with benchmark benefit packages, potentially covering fewer benefits than traditional Medicaid. These alternative plans may include benefits from sources like Blue Cross/Blue Shield or state employee plans. Beginning in 2014, alternative health plans offered through the exchanges must cover essential health benefits, family planning, and mental health services. All plans must comply with ACA private market reforms and provide a comprehensive set of covered benefits, including coverage for essential health benefits. The law identifies 10 broad categories of benefits that must be included in essential health benefits. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that essential health benefits (EHBs) must include 10 broad categories of benefits, such as ambulatory patient services, hospitalization, prescription drugs, and pediatric services. The Secretary of HHS has the authority to define and update EHBs to ensure they are equal to benefits in employer-sponsored health plans. HHS must consider diverse consumer needs when defining EHBs, as outlined in a bulletin published on December 16, 2011. The HHS bulletin from December 16, 2011, required states to define Essential Health Benefits (EHB) using benchmark plans. Four benchmark plan types were identified, including plans from the state's small group market, state employees, national plans, and the largest non-Medicaid health maintenance organization. Final regulations on EHB standards were issued on February 25, 2013, listing the EHB benchmark plan for each state. If a state did not choose a benchmark plan, the default option would apply. The benchmark plan types for different states include small group plans, state employee plans, FEHBP plans, and commercial HMOs. Each state's benchmark plan will apply to their respective exchanges for plan years 2014 and 2015, with HHS revisiting the issue for the 2016 plan year. Medicaid's alternative set of benefits will align with essential health benefits and may align with exchange benefits for certain individuals. The definition of \"benchmark\" varies between the Medicaid program and ACA exchanges. The definition of \"benchmark\" varies between health insurance plans in Medicaid and ACA exchanges. Table 1 shows potential overlap between Medicaid alternative plans and EHB benchmark plans. Table 2 summarizes benefits differences for Medicaid-eligible populations. Children in Medicaid receive more services than those in private insurance through EPSDT program. The EPSDT program for children in Medicaid covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services. States must provide all necessary treatment, even if not covered by Medicaid, and extend EPSDT to populations under 21. This benefit is not typically included in private health insurance plans. States can choose to provide full Medicaid coverage for pregnant women or limit services to pregnancy-related care. Medicaid coverage for pregnant women is limited to pregnancy-related services and ends 60 days after childbirth. Exchange plans cover maternity care and cannot restrict services. Unauthorized immigrant pregnant women may face limitations in services. Unauthorized immigrant pregnant women may only receive emergency Medicaid services for labor, delivery, and limited post-delivery care. They are not allowed to purchase insurance through exchanges, even if they can afford it. States offering alternative Medicaid benefits must cover the same Essential Health Benefits as exchange plans, resulting in closer alignment between Medicaid and private market benefits. However, the actual benefits provided in exchanges may vary by state. The ACA allows states to choose the model for Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) in their exchanges, leading to differences across states. Medicaid and exchange benefits may align due to ACA provisions, such as expanded coverage for preventive services. Medicaid alternative plans must offer preventive health services, but coverage varies across states. The ACA provisions address coverage of preventive health services in Medicaid alternative plans, mental health, and substance use disorder services. Certain Medicaid beneficiaries may not receive all preventive services or federal mental health parity protections. ACA provisions also limit coordination between Medicaid and private health insurance markets. Medicaid provides coverage for individuals with chronic conditions, including mental health concerns and multiple chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The types and amount of services available depend on the state's Medicaid covered benefits. Exchange plans must cover chronic disease management, but individuals eligible for exchange subsidies may not have access to this coverage. Exchange plans must cover chronic disease management, but they may not include additional services like non-emergency transportation or family planning that are required under Medicaid. Medicaid covers a broader range of services for individuals with chronic conditions, while exchange plans focus on essential health benefits like prescription drugs and ambulatory patient services. Medicaid covers individuals with chronic disabling conditions, including physical disabilities, intellectual impairments, and cognitive impairments. Some enroll as children with disabling conditions, while others enroll as working-age adults or later in life when they can no longer care for themselves. Traditional Medicaid offers services for those eligible for LTSS. State Medicaid programs offer care in institutional and home and community-based settings for individuals with chronic disabling conditions eligible for LTSS. Coverage varies among states, with options for nursing facility services, other institutional settings, and home and community-based services. Medicaid benefits for LTSS may not be comprehensive for individuals eligible through the ACA expansion and exchange plans. States have the flexibility to continue providing coverage to medically needy individuals, including children, until the MOE requirements expire in 2019. Eligible adults in states that cover medically needy groups will have access to LTSS. In 2019, eligible adults in states covering medically needy groups can spend down to the income standard and receive benefits, or enroll in the ACA expansion group. Benefits may vary depending on the pathway chosen. Some individuals with chronic disabling conditions may qualify for Medicaid under the ACA expansion group. ACA expansion individuals are entitled to Medicaid alternative coverage, with exemptions for individuals with disabilities. Without access to LTSS, individuals may seek long-term care insurance, pay for services out of pocket, or rely on informal caregivers. Lack of options may lead to people with disabilities forgoing care altogether. States can require beneficiaries to share in Medicaid service costs, with limitations on the amount. The DRA provided states with options for beneficiary obligations for Medicaid services, with limitations on the amount and beneficiary groups. Enrollment-related costs vary by income level: those below 150% FPL are exempt, while others may be charged nominal amounts. Enrollment fees under Medicaid can vary based on income levels, with nominal amounts ranging from $1 to $19 per month. Certain groups, such as families transitioning from welfare to work and pregnant women, may qualify for transitional assistance. Other specific groups may have enrollment fees exceeding nominal amounts, with exceptions for non-aged individuals with chronic disabling conditions. Additionally, under the DRA alternative plans, there is no limit on enrollment costs, but there is an annual cap on cumulative maximum cost-sharing. Cost-sharing under traditional Medicaid includes nominal fees for services based on type, with exceptions for certain groups. Children under 18, pregnant women, institutionalized individuals, emergency services, and family planning services are exempt. Non-institutional services have limits on deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Different cost-sharing rules apply for non-emergency services in an emergency room and institutional services. Cost-sharing rules under the DRA alternative plans vary based on beneficiary income levels. Individuals with incomes below 100% FPL have limits on deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments for non-institutional services. Individuals with income from 100% through 150% FPL also have cost-sharing limits for non-institutional and certain institutional services. States may specify a cumulative maximum for cost-sharing for certain services and populations. Cost-sharing under the DRA alternative plans varies based on income levels. For individuals below 100% FPL, cost-sharing for services is limited. Those with income between 100% and 150% FPL have higher cost-sharing limits. Certain groups like pregnant women and children are exempt from some cost-sharing rules. Other exemptions may apply, but cost-sharing may still be required for specific services like non-emergency care in an emergency room and non-preferred prescription drugs. Cost-sharing for services under the DRA alternative plans varies based on income levels. Maximum allowable copayments range from $3.90 to \"no limit\" in emergency rooms and for prescription drugs. Institutional services have a cost-sharing limit of 50% for the first day of care per admission. A cumulative maximum of 5% of monthly or quarterly income is set for all costs. Medicaid beneficiaries in nursing homes may retain a personal needs allowance (PNA) of at least $30. The federal law sets a minimum personal needs allowance (PNA) of $30 for Medicaid beneficiaries in nursing homes. States may choose to have higher PNAs. Those enrolled in HCBS waivers may have a monthly maintenance needs allowance (MMNA) that varies by state. Exchange enrollee costs include premiums and cost-sharing for healthcare services. Some may receive federal tax credits for premiums and subsidies for cost-sharing. Eligibility for premium credits requires household income between 100% and 400% FPL, not being eligible for Medicaid or Medicare, and being enrolled in an exchange plan. The premium credit under the ACA depends on the tax filer's income, the cost of the exchange plan, and local area costs. It may cover the entire premium or require the tax filer to pay a portion, capped as a percentage of income. Cost-sharing provisions apply to exchange coverage, including prohibiting deductibles for preventive health services. The ACA imposes cost-sharing requirements on small group health plans, including limiting deductibles and prohibiting annual cost-sharing limits exceeding federal tax code limits. Exchange plans must cover preventive health services with no cost-sharing, and eligible individuals can receive subsidies for cost-sharing. Premium credits are based on income and plan type, with cost-sharing subsidies available for those enrolled in a silver plan. The ACA imposes cost-sharing requirements on small group health plans, including limiting deductibles and prohibiting annual cost-sharing limits exceeding federal tax code limits. Exchange plans must cover preventive health services with no cost-sharing, and eligible individuals can receive subsidies for cost-sharing. Premium credits are based on income and plan type, with cost-sharing subsidies available for those enrolled in a silver plan. When premium credits become available in 2014, some non-elderly individuals with income at or below 133% FPL may be eligible for Medicaid, making them ineligible for premium credits in the exchanges. In states that do not expand Medicaid up to 138% FPL, eligibility for subsidies will depend on income, leaving some individuals without health insurance due to lack of Medicaid eligibility or private insurance subsidies. Several states have indicated they will not expand Medicaid programs, making it optional. If a state reduces eligibility criteria after the MOE expires, some individuals may lose Medicaid eligibility but could qualify for premium credits in exchanges based on income. Differences in costs for individuals covered by Medicaid versus exchange plans are outlined in Table 3. Children, pregnant women, and non-disabled adults in Medicaid are exempt from enrollment costs, while eligibility for premium credits in exchanges depends on income relative to the federal poverty level. Individuals with income at or above 100% FPL may qualify for premium credits in states where Medicaid is not accessible. Enrollees may be required to contribute up to 6.3% of household income towards exchange coverage, which could amount to approximately $121 per month. Based on 2013 data, individuals may need to pay $121 towards monthly premiums for premium credits, contrasting with Medicaid where costs range from zero to around $96 per month. Medicaid prohibits cost-sharing for children under 18 and pregnant women, with nominal amounts for others. If a state reduces adult eligibility in 2014, it could impact costs and benefits for individuals and families. If a state were to scale back Medicaid eligibility for adults in 2014, former beneficiaries may face higher costs under exchange plans. This could impact their ability to afford healthcare, even with insurance. For example, comparing costs for a non-disabled family of four at the ACA expansion income threshold, Medicaid may have lower costs compared to exchange plans. Under Medicaid's alternative rules, a non-disabled family of four with annual income at 138% FPL could face a maximum cost of $5,236 for covered services if they switch to an exchange plan. This represents a potential additional cost of $3,611 per year compared to Medicaid, which is approximately 11% of the family's 2013 income. The spending difference between Medicaid and exchange plans for a non-disabled family of four at 138% FPL could be $3,611 per year, representing approximately 11% of their 2013 income. Actuarial value comparisons show that Medicaid plans had an average AV of 97% in 2011, while employer plans had an average AV of 86%. Plans offered through exchanges will have varying actuarial values. In 2011, exchange plans will offer actuarial values below average Medicaid AV. Plans must meet AV levels of 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%. Lower-income individuals in a silver plan may receive cost-sharing subsidies. For individuals with income above 100% FPL, Medicaid costs vary. Non-aged individuals with chronic disabling conditions are exempt from enrollment-related costs. Individuals transitioning from Medicaid to exchange plans may qualify for premium credits based on specific enrollment-related cost requirements. Premium credit amounts vary by income and individuals may still have to pay a portion of the premium. Those with chronic disabling conditions may see an increase in cost-sharing for services under exchange plans, but could qualify for federal cost-sharing subsidies. The amount of subsidy received will determine the variation in cost-sharing for services. Individuals transitioning from Medicaid to exchange plans may qualify for premium credits based on specific enrollment-related cost requirements. Even with generous cost-sharing subsidies, exchange enrollees could still be responsible for up to $2,000 ($4,000 for a family) in annual cost-sharing expenses. Those with chronic disabling conditions may see a drop or increase in their service-related cost-sharing, depending on their previous cost-sharing levels. A 2010 Health Affairs study found variation in cost-sharing for services among non-institutional Medicaid adult enrollees with chronic disabling conditions. Enrollees with chronic disabling conditions faced varying cost-sharing for services, with median annual spending at $87 in 2004 dollars. Costs rose significantly for individuals at the 75th and 90th percentiles of spending distribution. Medicaid beneficiaries can retain assets and still be eligible for care, unlike private health insurance plans. Private health insurance plans do not cover long-term services and supports (LTSS), leading individuals to rely on private long-term care insurance or pay out-of-pocket. This can deplete their assets, making them eligible for Medicaid, which provides coverage for a diverse low-income population, including those with chronic disabling conditions and the elderly. Medicaid differs fundamentally from private insurance plans in its coverage and entitlement program structure. Medicaid offers coverage for individuals with chronic disabling conditions, the elderly, and low-income populations. It provides benefits not typically covered by private insurance plans, with states defining specific features of each covered benefit. States must ensure services are sufficient in amount, duration, and scope to achieve their purpose, with appropriate limits based on medical necessity. The Medicaid program ensures equal coverage for various needy groups, following comparability and statewideness rules. Beneficiaries have freedom of choice among providers. Special providers like FQHCs and RHCs offer services in underserved areas with preferential reimbursement. The Medicaid program provides coverage for low-income and Medicaid patients through Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments to compensate for low payment rates and uncompensated care. Health insurance exchanges, on the other hand, are marketplaces for purchasing private health plans, with plans reflecting typical employer offerings. ACA allows for state options in implementing these exchanges. The ACA allows for a bridge program between Medicaid and exchanges, including the establishment of a Basic Health Program (BHP) for individuals with income between 133% and 200% FPL. States have the option to implement BHP to provide federal funding for coverage, which would be offered instead of obtaining coverage through a health insurance exchange for this population. Exchange establishment is still required in every state by 2014, regardless of BHP implementation. The ACA established a mandatory expansion of Medicaid to include individuals with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The effective date for this expansion was January 1, 2014, to align with the establishment of health insurance exchanges. The Supreme Court decision in 2012 has the potential to impact the connection between Medicaid and exchanges, as well as the rate of uninsurance. The Supreme Court decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional, allowing states to choose not to expand their Medicaid program. This decision affects individuals with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level, as they may not be eligible for Medicaid or premium tax credits. The Supreme Court decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional for states. Table B-1 shows Medicaid income eligibility thresholds for non-disabled adults by state. Residents below 100% FPL may lack access to subsidized coverage without expansion. Individuals below 100% FPL can enroll in exchange plans but must cover the full cost. Individuals and families in the low to middle income group may find premiums and cost-sharing unaffordable, potentially leaving some of the poorest residents without insurance. Lawfully present immigrants with income below 100% FPL are an exception and can qualify for premium credits. After five years, they may be eligible for Medicaid if their income remains below 100% FPL."
