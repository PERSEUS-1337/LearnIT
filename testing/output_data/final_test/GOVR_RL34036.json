    "content": "The 2008 farm bill, also known as the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, authorizes various programs for agriculture, including commodity price support, farm credit, conservation, research, and food programs. It became law on June 18, 2008, after a successful veto override. Subtitle E of Title I contains provisions for dairy policy tools such as the dairy price support program and the Milk Income Loss Contract program. These programs were previously authorized by the 2002 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill authorized various agriculture programs, including dairy policy tools like the Dairy Price Support Program (DPSP) and Milk Income Loss Contract program (MILC). The DPSP provides price support through government purchases of surplus dairy products, while the MILC program offers direct payments to dairy farmers when milk prices fall below a target price. These programs were reauthorized with modifications in P.L. 110-246 through 2012. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized various agriculture programs, including the Dairy Price Support Program and Milk Income Loss Contract program. Federal orders for farm milk set minimum prices based on end use, with changes made administratively by USDA. The bill also authorized a forward contract program and a commission to review milk marketing order policies. Additionally, it reauthorized the Dairy Export Incentive Program and required Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico to contribute to a dairy promotion program. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized various agriculture programs, including the Dairy Price Support Program and Milk Income Loss Contract program. It also required Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico to contribute to a dairy promotion program supported by mandatory assessments on dairy producers. Congress provided over $32.5 billion in emergency spending for USDA farm commodity support programs in FY1999-FY2001 to help farmers recover from low commodity prices. In response to low farm milk prices, dairy farmers received $1 billion in supplemental payments over three years. Some groups advocated for a permanent direct payment program for dairy farmers in the 2002 farm bill to stabilize income. The Northeast Dairy Compact, which provided price premiums to New England dairy farmers, expired in 2001. In response to falling milk prices, the Northeast Compact sought an extension, while southeastern states wanted a separate compact. The 2002 farm bill introduced the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program as an alternative to regional compacts, providing federal payments when milk prices drop. The MILC program's authority initially expired in 2005 but received short-term extensions. The MILC program was introduced in the 2002 farm bill to provide federal payments to dairy farmers when milk prices fell below a certain threshold. The program was extended multiple times, with the 2008 farm bill extending it until September 30, 2012. Eligible farmers received payments based on the difference between the target price and the market price, with limits on annual milk production per dairy operation. The 2008 farm bill extends the MILC program until September 30, 2012, with a base target price of $16.94 per cwt. Changes include increasing the payment percentage rate to 45% from October 1, 2008 through August 31, 2012, resulting in larger payments to eligible farmers. The rate reverts to 34% in the final month to minimize long-term budget outlays. The 2008 farm bill increased the production payment limit for the MILC program to 2.985 million pounds from October 1, 2008, to August 31, 2012. This change was made to address concerns from large dairy farm operators whose production exceeded the previous limit of 2.4 million pounds. The limit will revert back to 2.4 million pounds in September 2012 to avoid increasing baseline budget costs. The 2008 farm bill increased the production payment limit for the MILC program to 2.985 million pounds from October 1, 2008, to August 31, 2012. Any excess production receives no federal payments. The final level is below the Senate-passed level of 4.15 million lbs. A provision adjusts the target price based on feed prices above $7.35 per cwt to soften the impact of rising feed costs. The MILC program's budget increased by 45% to $9.50 per cwt in September 2012. The CBO estimated a $395 million increase over five years due to changes in the program. However, higher milk prices offset these costs through FY2012. The Bush Administration supported continuing MILC payments at $16.94 per cwt with a gradual reduction in payment rate to 20% by FY2013. NMPF also proposed a direct payment program for farmers to avoid WTO challenges. NMPF proposed direct payments of $0.50 per cwt. to dairy farmers regardless of market prices, up to $40,000 per farm. IDFA opposed the MILC program, suggesting a dairy farm revenue insurance program instead. USDA started accepting MILC Program applications in August 2002. In September 2007, farm milk prices reached a record high of $25.16 per cwt. Farm milk prices were well above the MILC trigger price in 2007 and 2008, eliminating the need for MILC payments. However, recent price drops have increased the likelihood of payments in 2009. Dairy economists predict that prices will continue to fall, triggering MILC payments for the rest of the year. Producers can choose when to start receiving payments, considering potential rates and production limits. USDA updated the MILC program in December 2008, adjusting payment rates and production limits. The MILC program was updated in December 2008 to change the payment rate formula, production limit, and include feed cost adjustment. Payments are subject to adjusted gross income provisions, with farms ineligible if nonfarm AGI exceeds $500,000. Program signup began on December 22, 2008, and will continue until September 30, 2012. The cumulative cost of the MILC program over five years is $2.5 billion, with five states accounting for over half of the total payments. The Dairy Price Support Program (DPSP) was established in 1949 to support milk prices. It has been regularly amended by Congress through farm acts. The program was extended in 2002 until 2007 at a support price of $9.90 per hundredweight of milk. Short-term extensions were enacted to allow Congress to work on a new farm bill. The USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation supports milk prices by purchasing surplus dairy products from processors to indirectly support milk prices for all dairy farmers. Prices paid to processors were set administratively to ensure dairy farmers received at least the federal support price of $9.90 per hundredweight of milk under the 2002 farm bill. The USDA administratively set prices for dairy products, including $1.05 per pound for butter, $0.80 for nonfat dry milk, $1.13 per pound for block cheddar, and $1.10 per pound for barrel cheese. Government purchases of surplus dairy products have decreased since late 2003 due to market prices remaining above the support price of $9.90 per hundredweight of milk. The support price has gradually declined from $13.10 in the early 1980s to $9.90, reducing program costs. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Dairy Product Price Support Program resumed purchases of dairy products due to declining prices. The program was extended for five years under the 2008 farm bill, now directly supporting prices of manufactured dairy products at mandated levels. USDA estimated removing 115 million pounds of nonfat dry milk in 2008 and plans to remove 320 million pounds in 2009, along with small amounts of cheese and butter. The minimum prices for purchased products are set at $1.13/lb. for block cheese, $1.10/lb. for barrel cheese, $1.05/lb. for butter, and $0.80/lb. for nonfat dry milk. The 2008 farm bill established a dairy product price support program to indirectly support farm milk prices at $9.90 per cwt. The National Milk Producers Federation proposed this shift to address concerns about the previous program's effectiveness and trade distortions in the WTO. The 2008 farm bill established a dairy product price support program to indirectly support farm milk prices. The law allows USDA to temporarily reduce mandated prices for dairy products when government purchases exceed specified levels. For example, the purchase price for cheese can be reduced by up to $0.20 per lb. when purchases exceed 400 million lbs. The butter purchase price can be reduced by $0.20 per lb. when purchases exceed 650 million lbs, and the nonfat dry milk purchase price can be reduced by up to $0.10 per lb. when purchases exceed 800 million lbs. The Bush Administration supported extending the dairy price support program to stabilize farm milk prices. Dairy processor groups are concerned that the program, along with MILC payments, leads to surplus production and discourages investment in dairy ingredients in demand. The dairy price support program may need modifications under new trade agreements due to concerns about compliance with WTO rules. Current U.S. trade obligations measure support based on the difference between domestic and world reference prices, resulting in an imputed subsidy applied to all domestic milk production. The United States has notified the WTO of its dairy price support program, classified as \"amber box\" with an annual support of over $4.8 billion. The current proposal aims to reduce total amber box support from $19.1 billion to $7.6 billion. There is interest in shifting policy towards WTO-compliant direct payments decoupled from price and production. Supporters suggest notifying only milk used for supported products under a revised program. The USDA issued a final rule in 2009 to adjust milk price support regulations, specifying that support purchases will only be made from manufacturers. Federal milk marketing orders regulate the farm price of two-thirds of the nation's fluid milk, with some states having their own regulations. The federal milk marketing orders regulate dairy handlers by requiring them to pay minimum class prices for Grade A milk based on its end use. This includes higher prices for milk used for fluid consumption (Class I) compared to milk used in manufactured dairy products like yogurt and cheese. Blend pricing ensures all farmers receive a blend price for their milk. Blend pricing in federal milk marketing orders allows dairy farmers to pool their milk receipts and be paid a single price based on order-wide usage. This equitable system shares revenues for raw milk directed to both the higher-valued fluid market and the lower-valued manufacturing market. Class I prices for fluid consumption vary by geographical area, with a differential that increases with distance from milk surplus regions. Manufacturing class prices are the same nationwide and calculated monthly by USDA. Class I differential pricing ensures adequate milk supplies for fluid use at consumption centers, with protection for local dairy farmers against lower-priced milk. Federal orders aim to address competitive disadvantages for dairy farmers in price determination. Critics argue federal orders are outdated and complex, placing dairy processors at a disadvantage. Forward contracts involve a seller delivering a commodity to a buyer in the future. A forward contract is an agreement between a seller and a buyer for the delivery of a specific commodity at a set price in the future. Prior to the 2008 farm bill, dairy farmers and milk handlers faced challenges with forward contracts due to minimum pricing regulations. A pilot dairy forward pricing program was implemented from 2000 to 2004, and the 2008 farm bill authorized a dairy forward pricing program. The 2008 farm bill authorized a dairy forward pricing program similar to the pilot program from 2000-2004. It allows dairy farmers to enter into forward contracts with milk handlers, satisfying minimum price requirements. The program applies to milk for manufactured products, not fluid consumption, and new contracts can be made until September 30, 2012, but not beyond September 30, 2015. USDA issued a final rule for the program on October 31, 2008. The 2008 farm bill authorized a dairy forward pricing program allowing dairy farmers to enter into contracts with handlers exempt from minimum pricing requirements. Proponents argue it is a risk management tool, while critics fear it may undermine the federal order pricing system. The federal milk marketing orders are permanently authorized and do not require periodic reauthorization by Congress. Changes to these orders are handled administratively by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service through formal rulemaking procedures. Interested parties can petition USDA to create or amend orders, with terms developed through public participation in hearings. USDA then recommends the terms, and if two-thirds of voting producers approve, a new or amended marketing order is implemented. Some dairy producer groups are concerned about the lengthy rulemaking procedure for creating or amending marketing orders, which can take months or years. The International Dairy Foods Association believes that federal milk marketing orders hinder competition and should be reviewed by a blue ribbon commission established by Congress. Section 1504 of the 2008 farm bill includes revisions to address these concerns. Section 1504 of the 2008 farm bill includes revisions to federal order amendment procedures, with time limits for USDA actions. USDA issued a final rule on August 20, 2008, providing guidelines for amending federal milk marketing agreements. Section 1509 authorizes a blue ribbon commission to assess federal milk marketing orders. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) offers cash bonus payments to U.S. dairy exporters, totaling $1.1 billion since its inception. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) offers cash bonus payments to U.S. dairy exporters, with expenditures capped at $117 million per year under WTO commitments. The program was active in the 1990s, peaking in 1993 with $162 million in bonuses. The authority for DEIP was extended until December 31, 2012 by the 2008 farm bill. Additionally, the Dairy Producer Stabilization Act of 1983 authorized a national dairy producer program funded through a mandatory 15-cent per hundredweight assessment on all milk produced in the 48 contiguous states. Section 1505 of the 2002 farm bill required a 15-cent assessment on imported dairy products, but it was never implemented due to concerns about violating U.S. trade obligations. The 2008 farm bill amended the law to include Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico in the assessment to comply with international trade rules. The 2008 farm bill amended the law to include Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico in a 15-cent assessment on imported dairy products to comply with international trade rules. Most dairy producer groups support the import assessment, while dairy importers and processors oppose it, arguing it is an unfair tax on imported products that could be challenged as trade distorting in the World Trade Organization."
