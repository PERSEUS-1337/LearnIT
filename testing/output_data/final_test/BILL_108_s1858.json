    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Veterinary Medical Service Act\" and establishes a loan repayment program for veterinary medicine. The National Veterinary Medical Service Act establishes a loan repayment program for veterinary medicine, defining qualifying educational loans as those incurred for accredited veterinary medicine programs, including tuition, fees, books, and living expenses. The term 'veterinarian shortage situation' is defined by the Secretary, who may consider urban or rural areas, areas of veterinary practice like public health and food safety, and areas of veterinary need. The Secretary shall carry out a program to enter into agreements with veterinarians to provide veterinary services in shortage situations, with annual loan repayment for each year of service. The Secretary may pay the principal, interest, and expenses of qualifying educational loans for veterinarians who provide service under an agreement. Additionally, veterinarians can enter into a 1-year agreement to provide service to the Federal Government in emergency situations. An annual loan repayment may also be provided under the agreement. The Secretary will pay an amount specified in the agreement towards the qualifying educational loans of veterinarians. The agreement states that a veterinarian will not be required to serve more than 60 working days per year. The veterinarian providing services under the agreement will receive a salary and reimbursement for travel expenses. The Secretary has the authority to administer the program directly or through another agency. Agreements must include breach remedies. The veterinarian agreement includes remedies for breaches, such as repayment of financial assistance with interest. Recovered funds are credited to the program account and can be used without further appropriation. The Secretary may waive repayment obligations in cases of extreme hardship or need. The Secretary may establish a repayment schedule for educational loans and make additional payments to veterinarians to cover tax liabilities. Appropriations are authorized for the program."
