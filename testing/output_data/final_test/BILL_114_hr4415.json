The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Program authorizes the Secretary to award grants to State educational agencies for administrative expenses and make commitments to award Federal Pell Grants to eligible 8th-grade students. The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Program provides commitments for Federal Pell Grants to eligible students who participate in the program and apply for financial aid during their senior year of secondary school. The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Program offers Federal Pell Grants to eligible students who apply during their senior year of secondary school and enroll in a higher education institution within 3 years of receiving a diploma or joining the Armed Forces. The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Program offers Pell Grants to eligible students who apply during their senior year of secondary school and enroll in higher education within 3 years of graduation or joining the military. If a student's family contribution exceeds 2 times the threshold amount for Pell Grant eligibility, they will not receive a Pell Grant during their first 2 academic years in college. The Federal Pell Grant Program offers financial aid to eligible students, with specific requirements and calculations for the grant amount. State educational agencies can apply for participation in the program. State educational agencies must submit an application to the Secretary to participate in the Program, including a targeted information campaign plan, cooperation with program evaluation, and any additional required information. The Secretary reserves funds for grants or contracts for program evaluation. The Program allows for a grant or contract of up to $1,000,000 to be awarded on a competitive basis to an outside organization for an independent evaluation. The evaluation will focus on metrics established by the Secretary related to college access, success, and cost-effectiveness. Findings will be disseminated widely to the public. Each State educational agency receiving a grant must cooperate with the evaluation and implement a targeted information campaign. Each State educational agency receiving a grant under this section must develop a targeted information campaign in cooperation with local educational agencies and the Secretary. The plan should include outreach to students and families at the beginning and end of each academic year, as well as distribution of information. The State educational agency must provide annual information to students and families in the Program about estimated statewide average higher education institution costs, disaggregated by type of institution. The curr_chunk discusses the components of Federal Pell Grants, including the maximum amount, application process, and State-specific college savings. The curr_chunk outlines state-specific college savings programs, state-based financial aid, including merit aid, and federal financial aid available to students.
