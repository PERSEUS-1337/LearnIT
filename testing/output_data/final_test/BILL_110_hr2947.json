The Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to establish revised Federal building energy performance standards requiring new Federal buildings to meet LEED silver level standards or an equivalent approved by the EPA, and achieve a 60 percent energy reduction compared to regional averages. The Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act mandates new Federal buildings to meet LEED silver level standards or equivalent, achieving a 60 percent energy reduction compared to regional averages. Buildings must be designed to reduce fossil fuel energy consumption compared to similar buildings. The Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act requires new Federal buildings to meet LEED silver level standards or equivalent, achieving a 60 percent energy reduction compared to regional averages. Energy consumption data for commercial and residential buildings is adjusted based on specified percentages. The Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act mandates new Federal buildings to meet LEED silver level standards, achieving a 60% energy reduction compared to regional averages. Energy consumption data for commercial and residential buildings is adjusted with reductions of 70% in 2011, 80% in 2015, 90% in 2020, and 100% in 2025. The Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act requires new Federal buildings to meet sustainable design principles, employ renewable energy strategies, and achieve a 50% reduction in energy consumption compared to regional averages for buildings receiving 10% or more of construction funding from the Federal Government. The Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act mandates that new Federal buildings must adhere to sustainable design principles, utilize renewable energy strategies, and achieve a 50% reduction in energy consumption compared to regional averages. This includes referencing Energy Consumption Survey data for commercial and residential buildings to ensure a reduction in fossil fuel energy consumption. The Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act requires new Federal buildings to follow sustainable design principles, use renewable energy strategies, and achieve a 50% reduction in energy consumption compared to regional averages. Major renovation is defined as upgrading or replacing two of the three major building systems. Energy tax provisions are extended and modified. The Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act requires new Federal buildings to adhere to sustainable design principles, use renewable energy strategies, and achieve a 50% reduction in energy consumption compared to regional averages. Major renovation involves upgrading or replacing two of the three major building systems. Energy tax provisions are extended and modified, including an increase in lifetime limitations for nonbusiness energy property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act mandates sustainable design principles for new Federal buildings, with a 50% energy consumption reduction goal. Major renovations involve upgrading two building systems. Energy tax provisions are extended, increasing nonbusiness energy property lifetime limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Amendments to section 25C and 45L of the Code increase applicable amounts and extend deadlines to 2013 for property installations and acquisitions. The Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction under the Energy Efficient Buildings Promotion Act increases the per square footage dollar amount to $2.75 and extends the deadline to 2013 for property placed in service. The Secretary of Energy will conduct a study within 1 year of the Act's enactment to recommend aligning tax incentives with building energy performance goals."
