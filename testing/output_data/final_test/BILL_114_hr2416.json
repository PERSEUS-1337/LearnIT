    "content": "Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended by inserting a new section 505F, which focuses on utilizing evidence from clinical experience. The Secretary will establish a program to evaluate evidence from clinical experience for new drug indications and post-approval studies. Evidence from clinical experience includes data on drug usage and benefits from sources other than clinical trials. Within 18 months of enactment, a draft framework for the program will be established. The draft framework for the program will include information on current data sources, gaps in data collection, standards for data analysis, and priority areas to address. Consultation will also be conducted. The Secretary will consult with various stakeholders in developing the program framework, which may involve public-private partnerships or other arrangements. The Secretary will implement a program to evaluate the use of evidence from clinical experience within 24 months of enactment. This program will inform guidance for industry on when sponsors and the Secretary can rely on such evidence for specific purposes. The Secretary will issue draft and final guidance for industry on the collection and analysis of evidence from clinical experience within 36 and 48 months, respectively, after enactment. The Rule of Construction allows the Secretary to use such evidence for other purposes if deemed appropriate. The Rule of Construction clarifies that this section does not change the standards of evidence or the Secretary's authority for post-approval studies or clinical trials."
