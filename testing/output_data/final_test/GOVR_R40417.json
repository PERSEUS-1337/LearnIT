Systemic risk is defined as risk that cannot be diversified away and can lead to contagion, disrupting financial activity. Financial innovation can increase systemic risk by enhancing capital mobility. Financial innovation enhances capital mobility and provides access to additional sources of capital outside regulated institutions. Market expectations grow in importance, increasing system fragility. Systemic events result from sudden shifts in expectations, causing panic, liquidity disruptions, and asset price declines. The characterization of systemic risk as \"too-big-to-fail\" is misleading as impulsive reactions to financial events can magnify risks. Macroprudential oversight aims to address systemic risk in the financial system. Macroprudential oversight involves monitoring the financial system for systemic risk events, developing early warning systems, conducting stress-testing exercises, and providing advice on financial stability to regulatory agencies. The report discusses the challenges posed by systemic risk in the financial system and the benefits and limitations of macroprudential policy. Financial intermediation involves matching borrowers with lenders, with banks profiting from the spread between loan rates and savings deposit rates. Banks profit from the spread between loan rates and savings deposit rates, as well as from fees and service charges. They face risks such as borrower default on long-term loans and liquidity and interest rate risks on the short-term funding side. Banks must continuously attract short-term savers to fund long-term loans and may face challenges if short-term rates rise higher than long-term rates. Financial institutions seek to reduce risks associated with intermediation transactions, leading to financial innovation. This includes securitization, commercial paper market growth, automated underwriting, derivative markets, and nontraditional mortgage products. These innovations help manage credit risks, increase lending capacity, and allow borrowers and lenders to share the risk of fluctuating long rates. Financial innovation in the mortgage market during the 1990s increased lending capacity by reducing loan origination costs and offering a variety of mortgage products. This innovation allowed intermediation transactions to occur outside traditional banking institutions, with businesses issuing commercial paper instead of obtaining short-term loans. Commercial paper issuances are unsecured, short-term promissory notes or bonds that investors can hold in their portfolios. Hedge funds and pension funds may purchase long-term assets with funds from commercial paper issuances. Financial innovation in the mortgage market during the 1990s allowed intermediation transactions to occur outside traditional banking institutions. Businesses issued commercial paper to purchase long-term, less liquid assets like loans. Securitization also played a role, with entities buying long-term loans and creating short-term securities for investors. Subprime loans were funded through this process in the 2000s, expanding intermediation beyond traditional depository institutions. The shift in financial markets allowed intermediation transactions to move beyond traditional banks. Microprudential regulation focuses on the safety of individual financial institutions by monitoring lending practices and encouraging prudent behavior. However, this approach cannot completely prevent bank failures, as sudden declines in asset values can lead to repayment problems, especially during shifts in local financial conditions. Financial innovation has expanded the financial system, allowing more intermediation transactions outside traditional banks. While small banks tied to the local economy are vulnerable to regional economic conditions, larger banks are exposed to systemic risk. Risks are now spread among various financial market participants, increasing interconnectivity and making the entire financial system susceptible to unexpected disruptions or asset value declines. The use of derivatives instruments by banking institutions can lead to unanticipated disruptions in payments or declines in asset values, increasing interconnectivity among financial market participants. This transfer of risk can have systemic consequences, affecting the ability of other market participants to meet their commitments. Such events can erode confidence in the financial system, even if only one counterparty defaults on a payment. This highlights the importance of microprudential oversight in regulating financial markets. Central banks play a crucial role as lenders of last resort to ensure regulated depository institutions have access to short-term loans, allowing healthy but illiquid banks to continue funding long-term loans. They are considered systemic risk managers for supervised banks and are involved in macroprudential policy oversight. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 proposes to establish a Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC) for macroprudential oversight of the U.S. financial system. This formal approach complements existing microprudential oversight to reduce systemic risks by increasing transparency in intermediation activities. The proposed H.R. 4173 would require the FSOC to facilitate information sharing and coordination among its members for financial services policy development and enforcement actions. A regulatory body for macroprudential oversight aims to prevent bubbles and overleveraging in the financial system. Monitoring stress-testing activities and interconnected risks is also part of the regulator's role. Financial institutions may increase lending if they maintain capital risk ratios. A rise in asset prices could signal a speculative bubble, prompting macroprudential oversight to intervene. However, this policy's countercyclical nature may dampen economic activity during boom times. The impact of procyclical microprudential policy on business cycle activity and the economy may restrain lending during boom times. Macroprudential administrators may call for banks to raise capital or reduce lending in response to rising asset prices, potentially reducing systemic risk but also limiting short-term profits and economic growth. Factors such as declining mortgage interest rates and changing demographics have influenced housing market dynamics. The rise in home prices and use of mortgage credit levels were seen as evidence of a housing market bubble, making it challenging to differentiate between underlying fundamentals and speculative behavior. Speculative trading provides liquidity for assets and increases transactions, posing a challenge for identifying bubbles in the market. Identifying the extent of speculation and reducing it without compromising market activity remains a challenge for macroprudential oversight. Macroprudential regulators face challenges in identifying and managing speculative behavior in global financial markets. Responding to conditions indicating a bubble is crucial due to systemic risks, but it may conflict with other policy goals such as increasing credit access. Financial institutions find it easier to lend to certain groups when asset values are rising. Macroprudential oversight may conflict with other policy goals during times of rising asset values and expanded lending capacity. Regulators may face conflicts between encouraging conservative accounting practices for banks' capitalization and accurate income reporting to investors. Investors prefer accounting practices that reduce reported loan-loss allowances to maintain bank profitability and stock value. Higher loan-loss allowances may lead to overoptimistic information to investors and conflicts with macroprudential regulations. Regulators may prioritize investor needs in disputes over critical information. In H.R. 4173, disputes among federal financial regulatory agencies may be settled by the FSOC, potentially influenced by a combination of regulators' efforts towards conservative accounting practices."
