    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Emergency Response Employees Disease Protection Act of 2000\". The Congress finds that hepatitis C is a blood-borne pathogen causing chronic liver disease, with no known cure. Emergency response workers are at high risk, with only one organization testing all members - Local 22 of the International Association of Fire Fighters in Philadelphia, where 130 out of 2,100 firefighters tested positive. Philadelphia has committed $3,000,000 annually to treat 200 employees with hepatitis C, making it the only major city to allocate such resources. The Federal government should conduct a study on the prevalence of hepatitis C among emergency response workers and provide training, testing, and treatment programs. Study and demonstration projects are being conducted regarding cases of hepatitis C among certain emergency response employees. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, will conduct a study to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis C among designated emergency response employees in the United States. This includes firefighters, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians who are employees or volunteers of local government units. The study will also investigate how these employees likely become infected with the disease while performing their duties. The Secretary will conduct a study to estimate hepatitis C prevalence among emergency response employees. Grants will be provided for demonstration projects on training and treatment by local governments. The study must be completed within a year, with a report submitted to Congress. The section outlines the training, testing, and treatment of designated emergency response employees for hepatitis C. Qualifying local governments must have a prevalence of the disease that is at least 200 percent of the national average. Grants can only be given if the government ensures confidentiality of testing and treatment information. The Secretary will evaluate each demonstration project to assess its effectiveness in carrying out designated activities. A report to Congress will be submitted within 180 days of grant expenditure, summarizing evaluations and providing recommendations for future initiatives. Authorization of Appropriations: $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001 to support the activities described in the previous paragraph."
