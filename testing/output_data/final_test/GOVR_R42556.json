    "content": "The process of nominating and confirming lower federal court judges by the President and Senate has been a topic of interest in recent decades. Senate debates in the 112th Congress have focused on the success rate of a President's nominees compared to nominees of other recent Presidents. Concerns have been raised about delays in considering nominees by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the impact of vacant judgeships on the federal judiciary. This report aims to provide information for the current debate in three ways. This report provides a statistical overview of President Obama's nominees to U.S. circuit court of appeals and U.S. district court judgeships, comparing their success in the confirmation process with nominees of previous Presidents. Various factors influencing judicial appointment statistics across different presidencies are also identified. The statistics in this report focus on nominations made by Presidents Reagan through Obama to U.S. circuit court and U.S. district court judgeships. A Senate agreement in 2012 led to the confirmation of 14 nominees, with additional confirmations following. Paul J. Watford was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in May 2012. The judicial power of the United States is vested in the Supreme Court and lower courts established by Congress under Article III. Justices and judges hold office during good behavior. The focus is on nominations to U.S. circuit courts of appeals and district courts by recent Presidents. Outside the scope are nominations to the Court of International Trade and territorial district courts. The Court of International Trade and territorial district courts handle appeals from federal district court decisions and review administrative agency decisions. Cases in the courts of appeals are heard by three-member panels in 12 geographic circuits and the Federal Circuit. There are currently 179 authorized appellate court judgeships, with the First Circuit having the fewest at 6 judgeships and the Ninth Circuit having the most. In this report, nominations to U.S. courts of appeals judgeships are frequently referred to as \"circuit court nominations.\" There are 91 Article III district courts in total, with each state having at least one U.S. district court. Some states have as many as four district courts. Altogether, there are 673 Article III U.S. district court judgeships currently authorized by law. Congress has authorized between 1 and 28 judgeships for each district court. This section provides a statistical overview of President Obama's appointments to U.S. circuit courts of appeals and U.S. district courts from January 20, 2009, through May 31, 2012. The report analyzes President Obama's appointments to U.S. circuit courts of appeals and district courts from January 20, 2009, to May 31, 2012. It includes a statistical summary of the confirmation status of his nominees, comparing current vacancy statistics to the start of his presidency. President Obama nominated 41 individuals to circuit court judgeships, with 70.7% confirmed by the Senate. President Obama nominated 150 individuals to U.S. district court judgeships. Of these, 117 (78.0%) were confirmed, 6 (4.0%) failed to be confirmed, and 27 (18.0%) have nominations pending. Overall, 146 (76.4%) of President Obama's circuit and district nominees were confirmed between January 20, 2009, and May 31, 2012. President Obama's judicial nominees currently fill 16.2% of circuit court judgeships and 17.2% of district court judgeships. The distribution of his appointees varies across geographic circuits, depending on vacancies. Figures 1 and 2 show the differences in the number of judgeships held by his appointees among the circuits. President Obama has appointed a significant number of U.S. appeals court judges, with the Fourth Circuit having the most confirmed nominees. However, no nominees have been confirmed for the Eighth Circuit or the D.C. Circuit, which currently has three vacancies. President Obama has appointed numerous U.S. appeals court judges, with the Fourth Circuit having the most confirmed nominees. However, no nominees have been confirmed for the Eighth Circuit or the D.C. Circuit, which currently has three vacancies. If no appointment to the D.C. Circuit occurs before January 20, 2013, President Obama will be the first President in over 50 years without a nominee confirmed to this court. Obama has appointed the most district court judges in the Ninth Circuit, followed by the Second and Fourth Circuits. Each circuit has had at least one district court judge appointed under Obama. The First and Sixth Circuits have had the fewest confirmed district court nominees under Obama. President Obama's confirmed U.S. courts of appeals nominees hold the greatest percentage of seats in three circuits where he has the most confirmed nominees. These circuits include the Fourth Circuit, Second Circuit, and Federal Circuit. In 5 out of 13 judicial circuits, Obama's appointees make up a higher percentage of active appellate judges than the national average. President Obama's district court appointees hold a significant percentage of judgeships in various circuits, including the D.C., Eighth, and Seventh Circuits. In six circuits, his appointees occupy a greater percentage of judgeships than the national average. This contrasts with the lack of circuit court nominees confirmed in the D.C. and Eighth Circuits. President Obama's district court appointees hold a significant percentage of judgeships in various circuits, including the D.C., Eighth, and Seventh Circuits. In six circuits, his appointees occupy a greater percentage of judgeships than the national average. The number of U.S. circuit and district court vacancies has increased during President Obama's current term, with a total of 72 current vacancies as of May 31, 2012, compared to 55 on January 20, 2009. During President Obama's current term, there has been an increase in U.S. circuit and district court vacancies, with 72 vacancies as of May 31, 2012, compared to 55 at the beginning of his term. To reduce total vacancies, at least 18 out of 33 pending nominations would need to be confirmed by the end of this Congress. In past presidential election years, the Senate has confirmed more than 18 judicial nominations after May 31, with examples including 32 in 1980, 28 in 1984, and 31 in 1992. During President Obama's term, there has been an increase in U.S. circuit and district court vacancies, with 72 vacancies as of May 31, 2012. Of these vacancies, 41 have not had nominees selected by the President, with an average vacancy of 551.8 days. 17 of these vacancies are classified as \"judicial emergencies.\" There has been a more significant increase in district court vacancies compared to circuit court vacancies since President Obama took office in 2009. The number of court vacancies has increased during President Obama's term, with 72 vacancies as of May 31, 2012. While the number of circuit court vacancies is the same as when he took office, there are 17 more district court vacancies. This difference may be due to the longer time taken by President Obama to name individuals to district court vacancies compared to circuit court vacancies. President Obama took an average of 399 days to make nominations for district court vacancies and 230 days for circuit court vacancies during his first three years in office. The increase in court vacancies during President Obama's term is not solely due to the speed of nominations. Factors like judges departing office and Senate processing also play a role. Statistical measures compare judicial nomination processes from Reagan to Obama, showing differences in confirmation rates. The report compares the number of court vacancies inherited by Presidents Clinton to Obama and analyzes the Senate judicial confirmation process during recent presidencies. It examines the time taken for nomination to confirmation and the percentage of confirmed nominees receiving Senate votes. The report does not take a position on the appropriate number of nominees for confirmation or the average time needed for the process. The report does not analyze the appropriate time for Senate confirmation of judicial nominations. Table 2 shows the total number of nominees and confirmations for Presidents Reagan through Obama. President G.H.W. Bush had the highest total number of nominees. President G.H.W. Bush had the most circuit court nominees confirmed during their first term, with 42 confirmed nominees. President Reagan had the highest percentage of circuit nominees confirmed at 86.8%. President Obama had the second-lowest percentage at 70.7% and the lowest number of circuit nominees confirmed at 29. For district court nominees, President Clinton had the most confirmed with 169, followed closely by President G.W. Bush with 168. President G.W. Bush had the highest percentage of district court nominees confirmed at nearly 95%, while President Obama had the lowest number confirmed at 117 and the second-lowest percentage. Table 3 and Table 4 compare the number of U.S. circuit and district court vacancies inherited by Presidents Obama, Clinton, and G.W. Bush at the beginning of their presidencies, as well as the vacancies in their second, third, and fourth years in office. Presidents Reagan and G.H.W. Bush are excluded due to data limitations. President Clinton started with 17 vacancies, while President Obama had the lowest number of confirmed district court nominees at 117 and the second-lowest confirmation percentage at 78.0%. President Clinton inherited 17 vacancies at the beginning of his first term, decreasing to 12 by his fourth year. He had the highest percentage of circuit court vacancies without nominees in his second, third, and fourth years. President G.W. Bush had 26 circuit court vacancies initially, which decreased to 17 by his fourth year. President G.W. Bush is the only President of the three for whom the percentage of vacancies without nominees was below 50% at the beginning of his second, third, and fourth years in office. This was also the case for district court vacancies during his presidency. President Obama inherited fewer circuit court vacancies than either Presidents Clinton or G.W. Bush, but he began his fourth year in office with more vacancies. President Obama began his fourth year in office with more vacancies than when he took office, similar to district court vacancies under President Obama. President Clinton inherited a greater number of district court vacancies than Presidents G.W. Bush or Obama, some of which were due to the creation of new judgeships in 1990. The number of district court vacancies steadily decreased during President Clinton's first four years in office, dropping from 89 to 41. President G.W. Bush inherited 59 vacancies, which increased to 68 before decreasing to 29 by his fourth year. During President G.W. Bush's fourth year, the percentage of district court vacancies without nominees decreased to 13.8%, attributed to his efficient nomination process. President Obama inherited fewer vacancies but had a higher number of vacancies in his second, third, and fourth years compared to Presidents Clinton and G.W. Bush. Obama was the only President with over 50% of district court vacancies without nominees in his second, third, and fourth years. The high percentage of vacancies without nominees during President Obama's second, third, and fourth years in office may be due to delays in nominating individuals to fill district court vacancies. Obama took an average of 399 days to make nominations during his first three years, compared to 366 days for President Clinton and 272 days for President G.W. Bush. The speed of submitting judicial nominations to the Senate is influenced by factors both within and outside the Administration's control. The section provides comparative statistics of the Senate confirmation process for circuit and district court nominees by presidency (from Reagan to Obama). Figures 4 through 6 track the mean and median number of days from nomination to first committee hearing for nominees from January 20, 1981, through May 31, 2012, regardless of confirmation outcome. During the 1981 to 2012 period, circuit court nominees of President G.W. Bush waited longer for a committee hearing compared to nominees of other Presidents. The mean and median waiting times ranged from 43.1 and 23.0 days during Reagan's presidency to 246.8 and 145.0 days during G.W. Bush's presidency. Bush nominees faced long waiting periods for first hearings, with Priscilla R. Owen waiting 440 days, Deborah L. Cook and Jeffrey S. Sutton waiting 630 days, Richard A. Griffin waiting 721 days, and David W. McKeague waiting 951 days. Clinton's circuit court nominees also had significant wait times, averaging 120.2 days for hearings, compared to G.H.W. Bush's nominees who waited an average of 78.0 days. Obama's nominees had shorter wait times. President Obama's circuit court nominees have had fewer confirmations compared to his predecessors, but they waited less time from nomination to hearing. Reagan's nominees had the shortest wait time, while G.W. Bush's nominees faced the longest wait. District court nominees also had varying wait times across presidencies. During the Obama presidency, the average waiting time for district court nominees from nomination to hearing was 83.2 days, similar to the G.H.W. Bush presidency. The median waiting time was 77.0 days, lower than G.W. Bush but higher than G.H.W. Bush and Clinton presidencies. During the G.H.W. Bush and Clinton presidencies, the average waiting time for district court nominees from nomination to hearing was 65.0 and 68.0 days, respectively. This was more than three times higher than the median waiting time of 22.0 days for President Reagan's district court nominees. The mean and median number of days from first committee report to confirmation for all circuit and district court nominees increased from presidency to presidency, starting with President G.H.W. Bush. During President G.H.W. Bush's presidency, the average waiting time for circuit court nominees from first committee report to confirmation was 7.8 days. This increased significantly to 82.2 days during the Clinton presidency and slightly to 83.1 days during the G.W. Bush presidency. However, under President Obama, the average waiting time surged to 139.7 days. The median waiting time also increased after President G.H.W. Bush but remained relatively short during the Clinton and G.W. Bush presidencies. President Clinton's circuit court nominees were confirmed within 14 days, President G.W. Bush's within 18 days, and President Obama's took an average of 132 days. The average waiting time for circuit court nominees increased from 7.8 days under President G.H.W. Bush to 139.7 days under President Obama. The confirmation process for circuit court nominees varied significantly between different presidencies, with some nominees being confirmed quickly while others experienced lengthy delays. Outliers, such as nominees with multiple nominations, had a greater impact on the average waiting time compared to the median. District court nominees during President G.H.W. Bush's presidency had a shorter average waiting time compared to circuit court nominees. During President Obama's presidency, the average waiting time for district court nominees increased significantly, with 35.9% of nominees waiting at least 100 days for confirmation. The median number of days between first committee report and confirmation also rose, starting from a low of 1.0 days during President G.H.W. Bush's presidency to 8.0 days for Clinton nominees and further increasing during the G.W. Bush presidency. During President Obama's presidency, the average waiting time for district court nominees increased significantly, with 35.9% of nominees waiting at least 100 days for confirmation. The percentage of confirmed U.S. circuit and district court nominees approved by Senate roll call votes increased from Reagan to Obama, with a small percentage of Reagan and G.H.W. Bush's nominees confirmed this way. During President Obama's presidency, a majority of lower court nominees were approved by roll call votes, with a significant increase in waiting time for district court nominees. Confirmation by roll call votes became more common from Reagan to Obama, with a small percentage of Reagan and G.H.W. Bush's nominees confirmed this way. During President Obama's tenure, a majority of lower court nominees were confirmed by roll call votes. Factors influencing the selection and confirmation process include appointment opportunities, nominee vetting processes, and Senate processing of nominations. These factors impact confirmation rates across presidencies. Opportunities for a President to make circuit and district court appointments arise when judgeships are vacant or scheduled to become vacant. The number of such opportunities a President will have is influenced by various factors, including the number of judicial vacancies inherited at the start of a presidency. These vacancies are affected by the frequency of judicial departures, creation of new judgeships, outgoing President's nominations, and the rate of confirmation. During a presidential election year, the Senate's rate of confirming judicial nominations before a new President takes office can impact the number of appointment opportunities. For example, in 2000, 56 district court nominations were pending, with 55.4% confirmed. The promptness of the previous President in making nominations and the Senate's willingness to confirm them also play a role in the number of vacancies inherited by the incoming President. Legislation creating new judgeships, such as the Omnibus Judgeship Act, Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act, and Federal Judgeship Act, has provided Presidents with the opportunity to appoint a greater number of judges. The number of district court vacancies inherited by President Clinton led to a relatively large number of confirmations during his presidency. During his presidency, President Clinton inherited a large number of district court vacancies, partly due to new judgeships created by the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990. Judicial departures and the creation of new judgeships can impact the number of nominations and confirmations throughout a President's tenure. For example, President Obama faced challenges in his first three years due to judges retiring. President Obama faced more judicial vacancies in his first three years compared to his predecessors, with 92 judges taking senior status. If district judges had retired at the same rate as under Clinton or Bush, vacancies would have remained stable. Various factors influence the selection of nominees to fill vacancies, including the number of individuals involved in the process, selection criteria, and resources devoted to filling vacancies, especially in the event of a Supreme Court vacancy. The selection of nominees to fill judicial vacancies can be influenced by various factors, such as the level of consultation between the President and home state Senators. Communication difficulties or disagreements between them can slow down the nomination process, leading to delays in filling vacant judgeships. The nomination of a judge to fill a vacancy may be delayed due to factors like the President's priority level on judicial selection. The Obama Administration did not prioritize judicial selection during the 111th Congress. The speed of nominee selection can also be affected by the Administration's vetting process length. During the first 14 months of the Obama Administration, the time from vacancy to nomination was longer compared to the G.W. Bush Administration, especially for circuit court nominees. The delay was attributed to pre-nomination vetting by the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. The Obama Administration reintroduced the committee's vetting process, adding 30 to 45 days to the nomination stage. Senate processing of judicial nominations is influenced by various institutional and political factors. The Senate confirmation process for lower federal court nominees is influenced by institutional and political factors such as ideological differences between the President and the Senate, interest group opposition, presence of champions on the Senate Judiciary Committee, timing of nominations, and ratings from the American Bar Association. These factors can impact whether a nominee is confirmed and the method of confirmation. The Senate confirmation process for lower federal court nominees is influenced by institutional and political factors such as divided government and procedural strategies used to oppose a President's nominees. Factors like the role of the American Bar Association can impact the speed of judicial nominations at the committee level. The American Bar Association's evaluation of judicial candidates can affect the time a circuit or district court nomination is pending in the Judiciary Committee. The ABA's role in evaluating nominees before or after selection by the President can impact the overall confirmation process. The Senate's processing of judicial nominations can be influenced by political factors, delays can occur even for non-controversial nominees, and the blue slip policy of the Senate Judiciary Committee plays a role in the confirmation process. The Senate Judiciary Committee's blue slip policy allows Senators to assess and potentially block judicial nominations in their states. Positive blue slips from both home state Senators are typically required for nomination consideration, but this doesn't always guarantee a quick confirmation process. In the 112th Congress, circuit and district court nominations require positive blue slips from home state Senators for consideration, but this doesn't always lead to a speedy confirmation. Despite this, the average time for nominations to be confirmed in the current Congress has reached historically high levels."
