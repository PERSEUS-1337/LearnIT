The Congress finds that the National Fire Plan aims to reduce severe wildfires in the wildland/urban interface, with substantial funds allocated for implementation. However, the plan lacks clear leadership and data for informed decision-making and progress measurement. The National Academy of Public Information recommended establishing an interagency council to implement the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and the National Fire Plan to improve implementation of the plan in reducing vegetative fuels in the wildland/urban interface on Federal public lands managed by the Forest Service or an agency of the Department of the Interior. The term \"wildland/urban interface\" refers to areas where homes and structures are adjacent to Federal public lands with flammable vegetation, based on reports from the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior and Congressional directives for wildland fire management. The wildland/urban interface areas have flammable vegetation, conducive conditions for large-scale disturbances, and a significant probability of fire ignition and spread. SEC. 2. INTERAGENCY COUNCIL TO COORDINATE IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL FIRE PLAN. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture will establish an interagency council to coordinate the National Fire Plan. The council will include key members like the Chief of the Forest Service and define criteria for identifying communities at risk from severe wildfires. The interagency council will establish goals, objectives, and performance measures for implementing the National Fire Plan to reduce risks to communities at risk from severe wildfires. A comprehensive long-term strategy will be developed for implementation, incorporating defined criteria, goals, and objectives. The council will also address the use of removed materials. The council will collect data on utilizing fuel materials from Federal public lands for the National Fire Plan. Consultation with State, local, and tribal officials will be done to define criteria and goals. Public comments will be considered. The National Fire Plan implementation prioritizes fuel-reduction efforts in identified communities. No other fuel-reduction projects in a State can proceed until efforts in these communities are completed. A progress report on the Act's implementation must be submitted to Congress within one year of enactment."
