    "content": "Latin American countries have made significant progress in improving their education systems in the last two decades. Governments increased spending on education, cooperated with the United States and other donors, and pledged to achieve educational milestones. The region is close to achieving universal primary enrollment, with 97% of students enrolled. Youth literacy rate is at 96%, exceeding the world average of 87%, and gender parity in literacy and primary school enrollment rates has been achieved. Latin American countries have implemented programs to increase education supply and demand, targeting disadvantaged students. Success depends on accurate targeting mechanisms. Providing free textbooks and classroom libraries is cost-effective for improving equity. In poor districts, in-service teacher training and tutoring programs are effective interventions. Free food distribution programs also show positive effects. Despite recent improvements in education programs for students in Latin America, education indicators still lag behind developed countries and some developing countries in East Asia. Latin American students underperform on international tests, especially those from rural, poor, Afro-descendant, and indigenous households. In Brazil, nonwhite students score significantly lower on national exams. In Latin America, nonwhite students score lower on national tests compared to white students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Indigenous people complete fewer years of schooling and have lower economic returns for each year completed. Access to quality education is limited in countries with high income inequality, leading to high dropout rates, especially among boys in poorer Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, lags behind in primary enrollment and completion rates. Latin America's education system lags behind in enrollment and completion rates, with insufficient budget allocation for education. To improve secondary education enrollment, resource allocation needs to double, posing challenges due to current constraints. The United States supports education programs in Latin America through USAID and State-run scholarship programs. USAID's Bureau of Latin America and the Caribbean implements education assistance programs in Latin America, focusing on basic education resources, teacher training, curriculum improvement, community engagement, and access for disadvantaged youth. U.S. government education assistance to Latin America decreased from $73.4 million in FY2006 to $39.4 million in FY2008. Three major regional education assistance programs are supported by USAID in Latin America. President Bush established the Centers of Excellence for Teacher Training (CETT) initiative in 2001 with USAID support in Latin America. CETT has trained over 15,000 teachers in Grades 1-3 from fifteen countries since 2002. Programs are held in Peru, Jamaica, and Honduras, aiming to train 20,000 teachers by 2009 to improve literacy instruction for 650,000 children. The Partnership for Educational Revitalization in the Americas (PREAL) monitors education quality in the region, publishing reports and promoting best practices. The Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships (CASS) provides scholarships for disadvantaged students and rural professionals from Central America, Haiti, and Mexico to community colleges in the United States. More than 5,000 individuals have graduated from the CASS program, which is similar to the Caribbean and Latin American Scholarship Program (CLASP). USAID provides bilateral education assistance in Latin America to several countries. USAID provides education assistance to various countries in Latin America through programs like Equip123. These programs focus on improving education quality, systems, and serving out-of-school youth. Haiti and Honduras receive the largest bilateral education programs, with Haiti receiving funding for basic and higher education programs. These initiatives have helped lower dropout rates and improve the performance of thousands of students. In Haiti, education programs have reduced dropout rates and improved the performance of over 75,000 youth. In Honduras, USAID has assisted in developing new curriculum standards and evaluation systems for math and reading skills. The State Department administers U.S. education and cultural exchange programs, including a $75 million initiative for English training and study opportunities in Latin America. In 2006, the Study of the United States Institute for Student Leaders brought Latin American undergraduate students to the U.S. for a course on society, culture, history, and values. The Fusion Arts Exchange allowed talented undergraduates to participate in academic exchanges. The Fulbright Foreign Student Program funded by the State Department provides fellowships for foreign graduate students for study and research abroad. In 2007, 389 Latin American students received Fulbright scholarships to study at U.S. universities. U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings mentioned the U.S. regaining ground as a primary destination for education. To regain ground lost to Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom as the primary destination for Latin American students seeking to study abroad, despite additional visa requirements since September 11, 2001. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) supports International Visitor Leadership Programs for young professionals from diverse backgrounds, including Afro-Latinos and indigenous groups. ECA also provides visitor programs for foreign educators teaching English and American studies. The Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program brings mid-career professionals from developing countries to the United States for a year of graduate-level course work. Grants are also given to NGOs for citizen exchange programs, including projects between immigrant youth in San Diego and displaced youth in Bogota, and a cultural exchange project between Harlem and Bolivia. H.R. 176, the Shirley A. Chisholm United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act of 2007, was passed by the House. The Education for All Act of 2007 (H.R. 2092/S. 1259) authorizes assistance to CARICOM countries for educational development and exchange programs. It offers scholarships for various levels of study in the United States, with recipients required to work in a capacity benefiting a CARICOM country for a period equal to their scholarship length. The bill aims to provide assistance to developing countries to enhance their basic education systems and achieve universal basic education as a goal of U.S. foreign aid."
