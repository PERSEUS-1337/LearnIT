The funding agreement for a grant under section 1981 aims to provide access to affordable health benefits coverage for eligible child care providers, their staff, and potentially their spouses, domestic partners, and dependents.

The funding agreement under section 1981 aims to provide affordable health benefits coverage for eligible child care providers and their staff. The State may use the grant to offset costs for enrolling individuals in public health benefits plans or to subsidize health benefits coverage. Criteria may be established to limit providers and staff who may receive assistance, with highest priority given to certain individuals. The State will prioritize providers and staff who meet specific criteria and received assistance in the previous fiscal year. Spouses, domestic partners, and dependents may also receive priority. Accredited providers by certain associations will have the second-highest priority. Children or the National Association for Family Child Care; and at the State's discretion, the spouses, domestic partners, and dependents of such providers and staff. Matching Funds: A funding agreement for a grant under section 1981 requires the State to provide non-Federal contributions of at least 50 percent of the costs, which can be in cash or in kind. Federal Government funding or services that are significantly assisted or subsidized cannot be counted towards contributions. The application for a grant must be submitted with required information and funding agreements, ensuring compliance with section 1981. The amount of allotment is determined in accordance with section 1984. The Secretary reserves a portion of funds for territories, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations from the amount appropriated in each fiscal year. The remaining amount is allotted to states in accordance with section 1986. The Secretary allots funds to each State based on the young child factor and school lunch factor, after reservations for territories, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations. The young child factor is the ratio of children under 5 in the State. The \"school lunch factor\" is the ratio of children in a State receiving free or reduced-price lunches to all States. The \"allotment percentage\" for a State is determined by dividing the per capita income of all individuals in the United States. The allotment percentage for a State is determined by dividing the per capita income of all individuals in the United States. There are limitations in place where the allotment percentage cannot exceed 1.2 percent or be less than 0.8 percent. Per capita income is calculated at 2-year intervals for a 2-year period starting on October 1. The per capita income for determining allotment percentages is calculated over a 3-year period, based on data from the Department of Commerce. Excess funds not allotted to States due to non-submission of applications or intent not to use funds are reallocated. States that do not use their full allotment of funds will have the excess amount redistributed among the remaining states in proportion to their original allotments for the fiscal year. \"SEC. 1985.
