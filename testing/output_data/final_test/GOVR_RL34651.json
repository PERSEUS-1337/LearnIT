This includes cyberstalking, cyberharassment, and cyberbullying, which can cause emotional harm, as seen in cases of teen suicides. Legislators are working to define and prosecute these crimes effectively. Legislators are grappling with the issue of how to address emotional harm inflicted on minors through online harassment. Existing laws governing traditional crimes like stalking and harassment may not fully cover these situations. There is a debate on whether to amend current laws or create new ones to address this type of activity. Legislators are considering how to address online harassment of children, debating whether to prosecute at the federal or state level. This report focuses on constitutional constraints for drafting legislation in this area, noting that states typically have jurisdiction over law enforcement, but Congress can intervene under certain circumstances. Congress has the power to regulate activities related to interstate commerce, including those on the Internet. Laws have been enacted to protect children online, creating new crimes and expanding existing ones. The Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) are federal laws aimed at protecting children online. COPPA focuses on children under 13, requiring websites to disclose data collection practices and restrict access to minors. COPA restricts minors' access to certain materials online. The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) restricts minors' access to harmful materials online, but has never been enforced due to legal challenges. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) applies to public libraries and schools, mandating the use of software filters to block inappropriate content for minors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2425 prohibits the use of interstate commerce facilities for illegal activities. The use of interstate commerce, like the Internet, to transmit information about a minor under 16 for criminal sexual purposes is punishable by a fine and/or up to five years in prison. Laws have been expanded to protect minors from harm online, including child luring through the Internet for sexual purposes. The federal law prohibits electronic luring of minors for illegal sexual conduct, with violators facing fines and imprisonment. Internet harassment, including cyberstalking and cyberbullying, poses challenges for law enforcement and parents. Cyberstalking and cyberharassment statutes cover both adult and minor victims. Cyberstalking is the most dangerous activity, followed by cyberharassment and cyberbullying. Cyberstalking involves a credible threat of harm, while the other two may cause embarrassment or annoyance. Legislators are grappling with the issue of when individuals should be held criminally liable for causing emotional harm. New laws may need to be created to address these actions. Cyberstalking involves using electronic communications to harass or threaten a person. The cyberstalker may send repeated messages or incite others to harass the victim online. Due to the lack of direct contact, law enforcement may struggle to identify and locate the cyberstalker. Cyberstalking presents challenges for law enforcement in identifying and prosecuting offenders due to the anonymity provided by the Internet. Cyberstalkers can easily conceal their true identity by using different ISPs and screen names, making it difficult for authorities to locate them. Jurisdictional limitations also hinder investigations, especially when the cyberstalker is in a different city or state than the victim. This anonymity gives the cyberstalker an advantage, as they could be anyone from a former friend to a stranger met online. Several states have laws that explicitly include electronic forms of communication within stalking or harassment laws. For example, California amended its stalking law to include stalking via the Internet, defining it as willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly following or harassing someone and making credible threats through electronic communication devices. Federal laws, such as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875, address cyberstalking by prohibiting conduct causing emotional distress or fear through communication devices. Some states have enacted cyberstalking statutes, including California, which includes stalking via the Internet in its laws. Federal laws, such as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875, prohibit transmitting threats in interstate or foreign commerce, with penalties of up to five years' imprisonment. This statute has been used against cyberstalkers, expanding to include threats sent via the Internet. The expansion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875 to cover threats transmitted via the Internet requires that a threat be perceived as a serious intention to inflict harm. In a court case, messages expressing violent sexual fantasies were not considered threats but attempts to build a friendship. This highlights a limitation of the statute in certain situations. The limitations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c) include its inapplicability to situations of harassment or annoyance without a threat. It is unclear if this statute applies to online harassment scenarios, where individuals encourage others to harass or annoy someone. Cyberstalking laws may not cover cyberharassment or cyberbullying, but federal law allows prosecution under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223, with penalties of fines and/or imprisonment. The statute 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c) criminalizes using a telephone or telecommunications device to \"annoy, abuse, harass, or threaten\" someone, with penalties of up to two years in prison. It now includes email communications, but the perpetrator must remain anonymous. The law applies to direct communication between the perpetrator and victim, not situations where harassment is encouraged online. The constitutionality of the statute was upheld before it was amended. In United States v. Bowker, the defendant made over 100 threatening and sexual anonymous phone calls to a news reporter. The court upheld the constitutionality of the telephone harassment statute, stating it prohibits abusive and harassing communications intended to instill fear in the victim. Bowker's speech was not protected as it invaded privacy and implied threats of bodily harm. Cyberharassment involves sending threatening or harassing messages online, posting offensive blog entries, or creating humiliating web pages. It differs from cyberstalking as it does not involve a credible threat. Laws on cyberharassment vary by jurisdiction, with some states incorporating it into general harassment statutes. For example, Iowa's harassment statute includes communication via electronic means with intent to intimidate, annoy, or alarm another person. Cyberharassment involves communication via electronic means with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass, often using obscene or indecent language. Some states have specific statutes addressing cyberharassment, with penalties ranging from misdemeanors to more severe consequences. The Internet provides a platform for individuals, including children, to engage in harmful behavior due to the anonymity it offers. Cyberbullying involves harassment among school-aged children through the Internet, with incidents leading to teen suicides. Vermont passed an \"anti-cyberbullying\" law in 2004 in response to a student's suicide after being taunted and insulted online. Vermont's 2004 \"anti-cyberbullying\" law requires schools to create disciplinary policies for on- and off-campus bullying. Other states like Arkansas have also implemented cyberbullying policies, allowing school officials to punish students for off-campus activities directed at students or school personnel. Some policies, like in Washington, have limited application. Some school district harassment prevention policies, like in Washington, only apply to actions on school grounds during the day. This limitation means that bullies from other districts or states may not be covered. Additionally, adults engaging in cyberbullying activities may not be covered in most cases. A Missouri woman was indicted for a MySpace hoax against a teenager, using false identity to torment, harass, and humiliate the juvenile. The Missouri woman was indicted for a MySpace hoax using a false identity to torment a teenager, leading to the teenager's suicide. State prosecutors did not pursue harassment charges, citing laws on stalking and child endangerment. The federal government charged the woman under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The defendant accessed a computer without authorization and obtained information from a protected computer in violation of MySpace's terms of use. H.R. 1966 was introduced to make cyberbullying a federal crime with up to two years of imprisonment and/or a fine. The First and Fourteenth Amendments limit the authority to enact cyberharassment and cyberbullying statutes, despite the guarantee of free speech under the First Amendment. Governments can impose limitations on certain types of speech, such as fighting words and obscene speech. The U.S. Supreme Court has established guidelines for protecting individuals from cyberharassment and cyberbullying, distinguishing between constitutionally protected speech and unprotected categories like threats of violence. The Court has outlined reasons why threats of violence may not be protected by the First Amendment, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding individuals from fear and potential harm. In Watts, the defendant's statement at a political rally about the President was deemed protected speech by the U.S. Supreme Court, as it was considered political hyperbole and not a true threat. Watts claimed his statement was protected political hyperbole, but the Court noted that true threats are not protected by the First Amendment. Lower courts have developed various tests to determine if speech constitutes a true threat, particularly in cases involving threats under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875 and \u00a7 876. The main issue among circuits is whether the focus of a true threat test should be on the speaker or the listener. The focus of a \"true threat\" test is on the speaker or the listener. Some circuits evaluate the threat based on whether the speaker should have foreseen his words as threatening, while others consider if a reasonable recipient would feel threatened. In Planned Parenthood v. American Coalition of Life Activists, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a damage award in favor of physicians and health clinics providing medical services, including abortions, under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) statute. The defendants had published posters with names, photographs, and addresses. The defendants in Planned Parenthood v. American Coalition of Life Activists posted \"WANTED,\" \"unWANTED,\" and \"GUILTY\" posters and operated a \"Nuremberg Files\" website targeting abortion doctors, leading to three murders. The court found that while the language did not explicitly threaten, it conveyed a message of violence, causing doctors to quit out of fear. The court defined a \"true threat\" as a statement that a reasonable person would interpret as threatening. Based on the constitutional framework, cyberstalking, cyberharassment, and cyberbullying statutes may be constitutionally deficient if they do not constitute a \"true threat.\" School officials use these policies for disciplinary actions, but courts rely on Supreme Court precedent when challenged. Students have First Amendment protections, but they may not always align with school policies. In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the Supreme Court ruled that student expression can be regulated if it disrupts school operations or interferes with the rights of others. Students wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam War, leading to suspensions for refusing to remove them. The Court upheld the school's policy as reasonable to maintain discipline. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Tinker v. Des Moines that students have First Amendment rights in the school environment, allowing for symbolic acts like wearing armbands. In Bethel School District v. Fraser, the Court upheld the discipline of a student for delivering a lewd speech at a school assembly. During a school-wide assembly for student government elections, a student gave a nominating speech using sexual innuendos. The reaction was mixed, with some students engaging in inappropriate behavior while others and teachers were offended. The student was suspended and prohibited from speaking at graduation. The Court emphasized the school's duty to teach civility and appropriate behavior, protecting minors from indecent language. The speech was deemed disruptive to the education process, allowing school officials to determine appropriate speech in the classroom or assembly. The First Amendment does not protect \"offensive\" speech on school grounds, but it is unclear when the speech occurs off school premises. In a case where an 8th grader created a website with derogatory remarks about a math teacher, the student argued that his speech was protected. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reviewed the case to determine if the student's speech constituted protected speech. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court addressed whether a student's website constituted a true threat and if the school could discipline the student for off-campus speech. The court found the website to be in poor taste but not a true threat, as it focused on the teacher's appearance in a humorous or parody manner. It also ruled that the school could discipline the student for off-campus speech, rejecting the argument that it was beyond the school's jurisdiction. The court determined that a student's website, accessed at school, could be considered on-campus speech, allowing for disciplinary action under the Tinker or Fraser standard. In a similar case, a student was suspended for sharing a violent message about a teacher with friends. A student created a message icon depicting a pistol firing a bullet at his English teacher with the words \"Kill Mr. Van der Molen.\" The student sent the icon to 15 other students but not to school personnel. The English teacher reported it to school authorities and law enforcement. The student was suspended for five days but allowed to return pending a hearing. The student claimed it was a joke, not a threat. The student's icon depicting a threat towards his English teacher was deemed a joke by the student but was seen as a true threat by a hearing officer. The student was suspended for a semester, leading to a lawsuit by his parents claiming First Amendment protection. The appellate court applied the Tinker standard but did not address whether the icon was a true threat. The court applied the Tinker standard and concluded that the student's icon, deemed a true threat, could disrupt the school's work and discipline. In a separate case, a student was suspended for a website criticizing school officials, leading to a First Amendment claim. The student's website led to his suspension and failing all classes due to school policy. The court found that the suspension was not justified under Tinker as it did not materially interfere with school discipline. A preliminary injunction was granted against the school district. The court ruled that a student's speech rights were violated when a school failed to show a connection between a parody profile of the principal on MySpace and a disruption at school. The profile included objectionable content like references to alcohol and the principal being drunk. Another student also created a parody profile. The school officials discovered multiple parody profiles created by students, leading to the blocking of MySpace access. Layshock admitted to creating one profile and faced disciplinary action for disruptive behavior. The student faced disciplinary action for creating a parody profile with obscene language. Despite a 10-day suspension and other penalties, the court found gaps in linking the student's off-campus conduct to a substantial disruption of school operations. The school district failed to prove the parody profile caused the disruption, and the court noted minimal actual disruption. The court found that the school administrator lacked authority to punish Layshock for creating a parody profile off-campus, as there was minimal disruption and no violence or disciplinary action. The Fourteenth Amendment also limits legislation targeting cyberbullying by protecting citizens' privileges and due process rights. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause includes substantive and procedural due process, ensuring fairness in legal procedures. Procedural due process requires specific legal procedures in state proceedings, such as notice, hearing, and availability of counsel. Criminal statutes must be clear to avoid being declared \"void for vagueness\" and prevent arbitrary enforcement. The U.S. Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of clear laws to prevent arbitrary enforcement and ensure individuals know what is prohibited. Vague laws can lead to unfair treatment and unconstitutional actions. In Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, the Supreme Court struck down a vagrancy ordinance as facially invalid for lacking fair notice and specific intent requirements. The ordinance allowed for arbitrary arrests and convictions, giving police officers too much discretion and criminalizing normal activities. In Karenev v. Texas, a state harassment statute criminalizing repeated electronic communications likely to harass was found unconstitutional by a Texas appellate court. The defendant's conviction was overturned, as the statute was deemed unconstitutionally vague. The defendant sent abusive emails to Elena, calling her derogatory names and threatening her. He claimed to have received messages from fortunetellers about Elena's future. He was convicted of harassment, and challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court found that portions of the harassment statute regarding electronic communications were unconstitutionally vague and lacked clear standards for offense. This ruling also applies in school settings, as seen in Flaherty v. Keystone Oaks School District where broad student handbook policies were deemed overreaching. The court ruled that student handbook policies on discipline and technology violated students' free speech rights and were unconstitutionally vague. A student was disciplined for posting Internet messages on a non-school affiliated message board, leading to a legal challenge. The court found the policies overbroad and not clearly defined, leading to the student's disciplinary action being overturned. The court found that student handbook policies on discipline were unconstitutional due to being vague and overbroad, leading to arbitrary enforcement and lack of warning for students. The challenges of Internet harassment include defining cyberharassment and cyberbullying, jurisdictional limits, and difficulties in identifying offenders. Legislators and law enforcement may need to address these issues through state or federal legislation. Legislators and school administrators are grappling with combating cyberbullying in light of recent high-profile teen suicides, while considering the balance between free speech and preventing emotional harm. Legislation and school policies must navigate constitutional constraints to avoid infringing on protected speech. Legislation and school policies must navigate constitutional constraints to avoid infringing on protected speech, providing adequate notice of what activities constitute Internet harassment. Definitions for relevant terms such as \"annoy,\" \"harass,\" \"repeated communication,\" \"alarm,\" or \"torment\" may be necessary to prevent an inordinate amount of prosecutorial discretion."
