    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Comprehensive Torture Victims Relief Act\". The Congress finds that torture creates fear and insecurity, destroys individuals and society, and is used as a weapon against democracy by repressive governments. Torture victims face long-term physical and psychological threats, with perpetrators often not brought to justice. Torture victims and their caregivers need protection from reprisals. Many refugees in the US have been tortured and deserve prompt asylum consideration. Rehabilitation services are essential for torture survivors to integrate into society. Democratic cultures require more than just legal and political institutions. The development of a treatment movement for torture survivors has created new opportunities for action by the United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored acts of torture. There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect and support torture victims and their treatment providers as part of the overall objective of eliminating torture. By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect their families, the United States can move to defeat the actions of torturers. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as \"asylee,\" \"refugee,\" \"special inquiry officer,\" and \"torture.\" SEC. 4. IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES FOR TORTURE VICTIMS. Any alien who presents a credible claim of torture in their country of nationality or last habitual residence and applies for refugee status, asylum, or withholding of deportation will be processed according to this section. Officials must consider the effects of torture on these applications. For expedited processing of refugee admissions, individuals who present credible claims of torture will be considered refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States. This prioritizes their selection under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The United States gives priority to refugees with compelling humanitarian concerns. Asylum officers can expedite asylum interviews for those at risk of torture to prevent further harm. Additionally, aliens suffering from torture effects may be granted parole instead of detention. Aliens suffering from the effects of torture, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, may be granted parole instead of detention under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Congress recommends allocating resources to maintain information on torture in foreign countries. SEC. 5. SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR CONSULAR, IMMIGRATION, AND ASYLUM PERSONNEL. The Attorney General and the Secretary of State provide training for relevant officials on identifying evidence of torture, its effects on individuals, and how to interview victims without retraumatizing them. Gender-specific training is provided for interacting with male and female victims of torture by rape or sexual violence. The Center for Disease Control will conduct a study on torture victims in the United States since 1987 to identify their numbers, needs for recovery services, and service availability. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress by December 31, 1997. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to authorize grants for programs in the US providing services for torture victims who entered the country since October 1, 1987. Services include rehabilitation, social services, and research/training for healthcare providers. The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes grants for programs in the US to provide services for torture victims, including rehabilitation, social services, and research/training for healthcare providers outside of treatment centers. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1995 for domestic centers for the treatment of torture victims. The amendment made by subsection (a) takes effect on October 1, 1994. SEC. 8. FOREIGN TREATMENT CENTERS. Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorize the President to provide assistance for the rehabilitation of victims of torture through grants to treatment centers in foreign countries. This assistance includes direct services to victims and training for healthcare providers. Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorize $20,000,000 to be appropriated for the President to carry out section 129 for fiscal year 1995.

Congress urges the President to request funds for the Fund through the US Permanent Representative to the UN. The United Nations should support and protect treatment centers for victims of torture, encourage the development of new centers, and establish mechanisms to investigate human rights violations in countries with systematic torture practices.
