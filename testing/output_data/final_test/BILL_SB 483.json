    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1253.7 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"observation services\" as outpatient services provided by a general acute care hospital for patients with unstable or uncertain conditions that require close monitoring. An \"observation unit\" is an area within the hospital where these services are provided outside of the inpatient unit or emergency department. Observation services in an observation unit of a general acute care hospital are limited to 24 hours. Hospitals must apply for approval to provide these services as a supplemental service. The department will establish standards for providing observation services ordered by a licensed practitioner for patients who have received triage services but have not been admitted as inpatients. Observation services in a general acute care hospital are provided to patients who have not been admitted as inpatients. These services must comply with staffing standards and patients must be informed that their care is outpatient-based, which may affect reimbursement. Observation units in outpatient areas must be clearly marked with signage using the term \"outpatient\" to indicate that the services provided are not inpatient. These services are revenue-producing cost centers associated with hospital-based locations emphasizing outpatient care. Any observation unit not named as such requires approval from the department to provide services outside of an inpatient unit. Section 128740 of the Health and Safety Code requires hospitals to report summary financial and utilization data to the office every quarter. The data includes information such as the number of licensed beds, discharges, inpatient days, and outpatient visits. Adjusted reports can be filed within four months of the hospital's fiscal year end. The report includes data on observation service visits, operating expenses, inpatient and outpatient gross revenues by payer, deductions from revenue, capital expenditures, and net fixed assets. Total capital expenditures, total net fixed assets, total number of inpatient days, outpatient visits, observation services, and discharges by payer, total net patient revenues by payer, other operating revenue, and nonoperating revenue net of expenses are reported by hospitals. The office provides hardcopies and computer tapes of hospital reports to the public. They also establish guidelines for charity care services and validate health facility accounting procedures. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, as defined by the Government Code and California Constitution."
