    "content": "Title IV of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 is amended to include a new section on improved risk management education for agricultural producers. The Secretary of Agriculture will implement a program to enhance the risk management skills of agricultural producers, including small farms and limited resource producers. This program aims to help producers understand financial health, marketing alternatives, crop insurance, and legal issues affecting their operations. The Secretary will establish Risk Management Education Coordinating Centers in five regions of the US to provide education to producers and their families. Centers will be located at existing coordinating offices or approved land-grant colleges with the capacity to carry out program priorities. Each Risk Management Education Center will establish a coordinating council to determine funding and program priorities, consisting of representatives from public organizations, private organizations, agricultural producers, and Regional Service Offices. The Centers will also provide intensive risk management instructional programs for professionals working with agricultural producers. Each Risk Management Education Center will coordinate educational programs and materials for agricultural producers, including workshops, courses, and seminars to improve risk management skills. The centers will also develop and disseminate new risk management education materials and coordinate resources. Each Risk Management Education Center will utilize available risk management information and resources, including expertise from various organizations, to evaluate and deliver suitable materials for producers. Special and competitive grants will be provided to land-grant colleges and private entities for conducting activities outlined in the program. The National Agriculture Risk Education Library coordinates and distributes risk management educational materials electronically. $30,000,000 is authorized annually for this program, with funds allocated for competitive grants to public and private entities for risk management activities. Funds for agricultural risk education are distributed equally among Centers, with a portion allocated to the National Agriculture Risk Education Library. The land-grant college overseeing a Center administers the funds for authorized activities. Centers must be located in existing facilities, and funds cannot be used for construction. Evaluation of the program is conducted by the Secretary through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. The State Research, Education, and Extension Service evaluates Centers to assess the improvement of risk management skills in agricultural producers and their families through educational activities funded by appropriations. The term 'land-grant college' refers to specific types of institutions."
