    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court raised the standard for evaluating complaints in federal civil suits in the Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal decisions. This change may make it harder for plaintiffs to survive the pleadings stage, especially if they rely on evidence discovered during litigation. Proposed bills aim to reverse the effects of these rulings. Standards and procedures for complaints in federal civil suits are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The U.S. Supreme Court has the authority to amend the Rules, but Congress has ultimate authority. A complaint must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim\" under Rule 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6) allows a defendant to move to dismiss a claim for failure to meet the 8(a)(2) requirement. If the motion is granted, the case is dismissed. If the complaint survives, discovery and pre-trial motions begin. During the discovery phase, litigants may petition the court for subpoenas to access evidence from other parties. Federal courts historically interpreted the pleading requirement broadly, with complaints needing to satisfy a low bar to survive a motion to dismiss. The Conley \"no set of facts\" approach requires complaints to give fair notice of the claim and grounds. The notice pleading approach, established after the enactment of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938, allows civil complaints to be sufficient as long as they assert a claim that could lead to a legal judgment, without requiring fully developed allegations at the pleading stage. This approach aims to remove barriers to civil litigation in federal courts and promote fair settlements between litigants. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld the notice pleading approach, which aims to facilitate fair settlements between litigants by allowing civil complaints to be sufficient without fully developed allegations. This approach rejects the idea that pleading is a game of skill and emphasizes the purpose of facilitating a proper decision on the merits. Despite some lower court opinions scaling back the \"notice pleading\" approach in recent decades, particularly in complex areas such as bankruptcy, antitrust, and civil rights, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the standard that amendments to the Federal Rules must be obtained through the rulemaking process, not judicial interpretation. The Court emphasized that a claim's likelihood of success should not be considered at the pleading stage, even if recovery seems remote. This shift in approach has been attributed to concerns about the cost and delay of litigation in complex federal civil cases, leading to exceptions for allegations deemed as \"mere conclusions\" or \"bare bones.\" In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, the Supreme Court departed from notice pleading, setting the stage for changes in Twombly and Iqbal. Plaintiffs alleged an antitrust conspiracy by \"Baby Bells\" without sufficient evidence. The plaintiffs alleged an antitrust conspiracy based on parallel conduct by the defendants, but the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of evidence. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, but the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that parallel conduct alone was not enough to prove a conspiracy under antitrust laws. The Supreme Court ruled that mere parallel conduct without sufficient accompanying facts is not enough to prove an antitrust conspiracy under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Court emphasized the need for allegations plausibly suggesting a violation of the Act to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. The Supreme Court rejected a literal reading of the \"no set of facts\" language from Conley, indicating a heightened pleading standard for antitrust claims. The Court clarified that plausible grounds to infer an agreement do not require a probability requirement at the pleading stage. Additionally, the Court cited previous cases reaffirming Conley and rejecting a heightened pleading standard. The Supreme Court reaffirmed Conley and rejected a \"heightened pleading standard\" for antitrust claims, despite some dissent. Justice Stevens argued against abandoning notice pleading, emphasizing its historical importance in enforcing civil rights laws. Lower federal courts had varied interpretations of the Twombly decision. In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, the Supreme Court clarified and extended the \"plausibility\" standard introduced in Twombly. The decision was interpreted as establishing a general heightened pleading standard, particularly in cases requiring factual specificity like antitrust complaints. Legal commentators generally agreed that despite some conflicting language, the ruling did create a heightened pleading standard. Iqbal, designated as \"high interest\" by the FBI in relation to the 9/11 attacks, alleged mistreatment during pre-trial detention. He pled guilty to fraud, served a prison sentence, and filed a civil action focusing on the alleged mistreatment. The action named various defendants, seeking civil damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents. Iqbal alleged mistreatment during pre-trial detention, claiming it was due to unconstitutional discrimination based on his race and religion. The U.S. District Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, citing Conley. The Second Circuit upheld this decision, stating that Iqbal's complaint met the \"plausibility\" standard set by Twombly. The Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit's decision in Iqbal's case, clarifying principles from Twombly that legal conclusions in a complaint are not automatically accepted as true. This distinction between factual and legal elements in a complaint aims to prevent threadbare recitals of a cause of action supported by mere conclusory statements. The Supreme Court's decision in Iqbal requires courts to identify legal conclusions in a claim and adhere to the heightened \"plausibility\" pleading standard introduced in Twombly. Lower courts must evaluate facts asserted to determine if they are likely to result in a judgment in the claimant's favor, giving them greater latitude to make such determinations. The Court emphasizes that determining a plausible claim for relief is a context-specific task that requires judicial experience and common sense. The Supreme Court's decision in Iqbal requires courts to identify legal conclusions in a claim and adhere to the heightened \"plausibility\" pleading standard. Courts must evaluate facts asserted to determine if they support a plausible claim for relief, requiring judicial experience and common sense. The Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss based on this standard, particularly focusing on claims against high-ranking Justice Department officials. The Supreme Court's decision in Iqbal rejected the plaintiff's assertions as \"bare assertions\" that did not satisfy the plausibility test. Justice Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that the specific allegations in Iqbal's complaint should not have been dismissed. He criticized the Court for focusing on vague allegations against high-ranking officials while ignoring more specific claims. The Twombly and Iqbal rulings establish a heightened pleading standard, leading to fewer cases surviving to the discovery phase in federal courts. Lower federal courts are interpreting the decisions in this manner, with many citing them when granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. The impact of these rulings is still being debated by commentators. The Twombly and Iqbal rulings have led to a heightened pleading standard, resulting in fewer cases surviving to the discovery phase in federal courts. Many lower federal courts are citing these decisions when granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, potentially decreasing the quantity of civil complaints that survive such motions. The impact of these rulings on the complexity and quantity of federal civil cases is still a subject of debate among commentators. The Iqbal ruling aims to help federal courts filter out weak cases, potentially reducing delays and costs in civil litigation. Critics argue that the heightened pleading standard may protect government officials during discovery, but others suggest that limiting discovery can minimize expenses and inefficiencies. Justice Stevens' dissent in Twombly challenges the notion that discovery is always costly. The heightened pleading standard in federal courts, as seen in the Iqbal ruling, has sparked debates on the potential consequences of dismissing cases early. Critics argue that limiting discovery may protect public officials, while others believe it can reduce costs and inefficiencies in civil litigation. Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens have differing views on the role of discovery in court cases. The Iqbal ruling's heightened pleading standard may impact civil litigation cases, especially in areas like civil rights and environmental regulation. Critics argue that the standard reintroduces problems addressed by the Rule 8(a)(2) notice pleading approach in 1938. The ruling requires federal courts to distinguish between factual and legal assertions, potentially hindering cases from proceeding. The Iqbal ruling requires federal courts to distinguish between factual and legal assertions, potentially hindering cases from proceeding due to the arbitrary line-drawing between legal and factual allegations. The heightened pleading standard introduced by the Twombly and Iqbal opinions has raised concerns about its impact on decisions like motions for summary judgment. Some argue that the Court's change in procedural rules without formal amendment or congressional approval is troubling, while others see it as a more modest shift in interpretation. Experts have discussed the legal and practical effects of the Iqbal ruling. Experts have testified about the legal and practical effects of Iqbal in hearings. Two bills pending in committees aim to interpret the civil pleading standard as it was before Twombly and Iqbal. The bills, H.R. 4115 and S. 1504, seek to codify the \"no set of facts\" standard from Conley and prohibit dismissal of complaints unless it is clear the plaintiff cannot prove any facts supporting the claim. The Supreme Court's decisions in Twombly and Iqbal criticized the Conley v. Gibson approach but did not expressly overrule it. The interpretation of Conley has been refined over the years, with some decisions refining it to a lesser degree than Twombly."
