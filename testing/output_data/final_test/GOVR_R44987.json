    "content": "Opioid abuse in the United States involves drugs like hydrocodone, fentanyl, and heroin. These drugs bind to opioid receptors in the body, causing harm when abused. SAMHSA collects data on heroin use and misuse of prescription pain relievers, estimating 329,000 Americans age 12 or older were affected in 2016. In 2016, SAMHSA estimated that 329,000 Americans age 12 and older were current users of heroin and approximately 3.8 million Americans were current \"misusers\" of prescription pain relievers. An estimated 11.8 million people aged 12 and older misused opioids in the past year, including 11.5 million misusers of pain relievers and 948,000 heroin users. The Monitoring the Future Survey found that 0.2% of surveyed adolescents were current users of heroin and 5.4% of 12th graders were current users of \"narcotics other than heroin.\" The most severe risk of opioid abuse is overdose and death, with drug overdose deaths tripling from 1999 to 2014. The risk of overdose and death from opioid abuse has significantly increased in recent years. Drug overdose deaths have more than tripled from 1999 to 2014, with over 52,000 deaths in 2015 involving opioids. Prescription opioids were responsible for over 15,000 overdose deaths, nearly half of all opioid-related deaths. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl and heroin are driving the recent increases in overdose deaths, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The number of fentanyl-related deaths is likely underestimated due to lack of testing and reporting. Opioids are the primary drugs involved in overdose deaths, with variations in rates by region. California had the highest number of overdose deaths in 2015, followed by Ohio and Massachusetts, which do not correspond with their population size rankings. Age-adjusted overdose death rates show a different story than unstandardized numbers. The Northeast, Appalachian regions, and certain Southwest states have higher rates of drug overdose deaths. Fentanyl is a significant factor in the sharp increase in overdose deaths. New Hampshire had the most fentanyl overdoses per capita in 2015. Heroin, fentanyl, and controlled prescription drugs are the most significant drug threats in the United States. Availability of heroin and illicit fentanyl in counterfeit pills has increased. The availability of illicit fentanyl in counterfeit prescription opioid pills increased significantly in the 1990s and early 2000s. Various methods were used to obtain prescription drugs, including doctor shopping, pill mills, and pharmaceutical theft. Government efforts were made to reduce the unlawful prescription drug supply and abuse through diversion control programs and crackdowns on pill mills. The crackdown on unlawful prescription drug supply led to a rise in heroin abuse as a cheaper alternative. Accessibility and price are key factors in patients turning to heroin. The trajectory of heroin supply differs from prescription opioids, but their stories are interconnected. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, white powder heroin from South America dominated the market east of the Mississippi River, while black tar and brown powder heroin from Mexico dominated the market west of the Mississippi. Heroin prices fell dramatically in the 1990s, with South American heroin being around 46% pure, Mexican heroin around 27% pure, and Southeast/Southwest Asian heroin around 24-30% pure. Prices continued to decline in the following years, while purity, especially of Mexican heroin, increased. The availability of Mexican heroin has increased, with over 90% of seized heroin in the US coming from Mexico. Mexican traffickers have boosted production of low-cost white powder heroin to meet the rising demand, potentially targeting prescription opioid abusers. Non-pharmaceutical fentanyl, mainly from China, is also contributing to the opioid crisis. Non-pharmaceutical fentanyl, primarily from China, is a potent drug often mixed with heroin. Its increased potency poses a significant danger, with new products like \"gray death\" emerging. Law enforcement anticipates the fentanyl market to grow as more users are attracted to these products. Regional variations exist in opioid supply, with heroin being a significant threat in the Northeast, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic regions. DEA reports indicate a high presence of controlled substances in these areas. The DEA reports high availability of controlled prescription drugs in cities across the United States, with opioids being the main cause of drug overdose deaths. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl and heroin are driving the increase in overdose deaths. The discrepancy between drug overdose deaths and reported drug threats may be due to factors like the lethality of fentanyl. Federal agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services are making efforts to address the opioid crisis. The federal agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, and Office of National Drug Control Policy are working together to combat opioid abuse. The Drug Enforcement Administration focuses on drug enforcement, while the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration supports drug treatment and prevention. Grant programs are also available to address opioid abuse. Several federal agencies, including DOJ, HHS, and ONDCP, have programs to address opioid abuse. These programs range from law enforcement assistance to coordinated responses. Other agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection focus on customs and border security, with drug control as a part of their mission. Agencies within HHS also play roles in monitoring drug control activities. Two HHS agencies, SAMHSA and NIDA, focus on drug abuse prevention and treatment. SAMHSA leads in increasing access to behavioral health services, supporting community-based treatment and prevention services through grants. They also provide technical assistance, data collection, and workforce development for substance abuse programs. Activities related to combatting opioid abuse are primarily administered by two centers within SAMHSA: the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. NIDA is the lead federal agency for advancing scientific research on drug abuse, conducting and funding various types of research to advance prevention, treatment, and public health approaches. Other HHS agencies like CMS, HRSA, and CDC also play a role in combatting opioid abuse. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and CMS finance health care services, including substance abuse treatment. HRSA supports access to care for underserved populations, while CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control aims to prevent injuries and deaths, including drug overdoses. HHS grant programs address opioid abuse, with a focus on programs identified by HHS agencies to combat the opioid crisis. The Substance Abuse Block Grant (SABG) funds services to prevent and treat substance use disorders, including opioid use disorder. States receive SABG funds from SAMHSA and have flexibility in how they use the funds. Grantees must allocate at least 20% of the funds to primary prevention strategies. Additionally, the State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis grant program supports states in addressing the opioid crisis. The State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis grant program supplements opioid-related activities undertaken by states. SAMHSA awarded formula grants to all 50 states and specified territories in FY2017. The Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs supports infrastructure development and prescription drug abuse prevention efforts. Eligibility is limited to states that have completed a Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant. The First Responder Training program aims to reduce deaths and adverse events related to opioids and prescription drugs. In FY2017, SAMHSA awarded grants to train first responders in implementing secondary prevention strategies for opioid overdose, expand access to emergency treatment with naloxone, and support states in providing medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction. In FY2017, SAMHSA awarded state pilot grants to support family-based services for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders, including opioid disorders, and to help state agencies address the continuum of care for women in nonresidential settings. These grants aim to promote a coordinated state system for effective service delivery. SAMHSA awarded grants under various programs in FY2017, including the Building Communities of Recovery grant program for recovery-focused organizations. Grants support services like peer support and linkages to housing or child care. SAMHSA also administers grant programs for drug courts and re-entry services for drug-involved offenders, aiming to improve treatment and support services for individuals re-entering the community from incarceration. CDC supports the Prevention for States program. CDC supports state health departments in advancing overdose prevention efforts through programs like Prevention for States, Enhanced State Surveillance of Opioid-Involved Morbidity and Mortality, and Data-Driven Prevention Initiative. These programs focus on improving surveillance, data analysis, and collaboration to address the opioid crisis. HRSA supports community consortiums to address the opioid epidemic in rural areas through outreach, care coordination, and recovery support services. They also fund telehealth programs for substance use disorder treatment in underserved communities. DOJ agencies also work on addressing opioid abuse. The DOJ, including the DEA, enforces federal drug laws and prosecutes cases related to illicit drug trafficking. The Office of Justice Programs addresses opioid abuse through research and grants. The DEA also regulates controlled substances in the United States. The DEA regulates the flow of controlled substances in the United States by establishing a closed system of distribution for anyone handling these substances. Registrants must keep records, maintain inventories, and ensure secure storage of controlled substances. The DEA uses criminal, civil, and administrative authorities to prevent drug diversion. The DEA regulates controlled substances to prevent drug diversion through various actions like inspections, education, and establishing quotas. Severe administrative actions include immediate suspension orders. Various programs address opioid abuse, with funds used for broad crime reduction strategies or drug-specific threats. Section 201 of CARA authorized these programs. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 authorized the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program for states, local governments, and Indian tribes. The grants aim to provide services related to opioid abuse, including treatment alternatives to incarceration, collaboration between criminal justice and substance abuse agencies, training for first responders on opioid overdose reversal drugs, investigation of illicit activities related to opioid distribution, medication-assisted treatment programs, prescription drug monitoring programs, prevention programs for juvenile opioid abuse, technology to secure prescription drug containers, drug take-back programs, and a comprehensive opioid abuse response program. The Bureau of Justice Assistance administers this grant program. The Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) is part of the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program administered by BJA. It helps law enforcement analyze data on controlled substance prescriptions to investigate illicit activities related to opioid distribution. Grants are available for states and territories to combat opioid abuse. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program provides funds to investigate illicit activities related to heroin and prescription opioids distribution through statewide collaboration. Funding is allocated to state law enforcement agencies in high-admission states for heroin and opioids treatment. The program supports investigative purposes and various criminal justice initiatives. The JAG program funds various purpose areas including law enforcement, prosecution, prevention, corrections, drug treatment, planning, evaluation, technology improvement, crime victim services, and mental health programs. While funds could be used for opioid abuse programs, it is not mandatory. The Drug Court Discretionary Grant program aims to enhance drug court services, coordination, and substance abuse treatment. The JJDPA authorizes grants for drug court programs to help nonviolent offenders with substance abuse issues. These programs aim to reduce recidivism and substance abuse through supervised treatment, drug testing, and rehabilitation services. While not specifically addressing opioid abuse, drug-involved offenders, including opioid abusers, can receive treatment through drug courts. The JJDPA authorizes grants for drug court programs to assist nonviolent offenders with substance abuse problems, aiming to reduce recidivism and substance abuse through supervised treatment and rehabilitation services. Funds provided to the state can be used for various juvenile justice programs, including substance abuse prevention and treatment. None of the program purpose areas specifically address opioid abuse, but they are broad enough to potentially be used for this purpose. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is responsible for creating policies and objectives to reduce illicit drug use, manufacturing, trafficking, and related health consequences. The director develops a National Drug Control Strategy and Budget to guide anti-drug efforts and evaluates their effectiveness. The programs funded by the ONDCP do not specifically target opioid abuse but can be utilized for this purpose. The Trump Administration has requested increases for drug control measures in the FY2018 Budget to combat the opioid epidemic. President Trump created the President's Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, which issued a draft interim report recommending executive actions. The program provides assistance to law enforcement agencies in critical drug trafficking regions to reduce drug production and trafficking through coordination. The HIDTA program aims to reduce drug production and trafficking by promoting coordination and information sharing between law enforcement agencies, bolstering intelligence sharing, providing reliable intelligence, and promoting coordinated law enforcement strategies. It does not focus on a specific drug threat but supports the most pressing problems in a region. There are 28 HIDTAs covering approximately 18% of U.S. counties and over 65% of the U.S. The HIDTA program, administered by ONDCP with a major role played by the DEA, covers 28 regions encompassing 18% of U.S. counties and 65% of the population. ONDCP manages the Drug Free Communities Support program, providing grants for coalitions to prevent substance abuse among youth. Currently, there are 698 DFC-funded coalitions. ONDCP also offers drug court training grants and supports initiatives to combat opioid abuse. HHS provides state-specific grants through SAMHSA, CDC, and HRSA. OJP offers state-specific data on grants. SAMHSA, CDC, and HRSA offer grants. OJP provides state-specific grant data. ONDCP does not have online grant data. SAMHSA funds the NSDUH survey on drug, alcohol, and tobacco use among U.S. civilians. The survey includes adults and adolescents, conducted in English and Spanish for honest reporting. The NSDUH survey funded by SAMHSA focuses on drug, alcohol, and tobacco use among U.S. civilians, excluding certain groups for accurate reporting. NIDA funds the Monitoring the Future survey, which targets students' drug-related beliefs and behavior in secondary schools and colleges. Federal legislation has taken a public health approach towards addressing the nation's opioid crisis with laws like the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) and the 21st Century Cures Act. CARA focused on opioids and broader drug abuse issues, while the Cures Act authorized state opioid grants and included substance abuse provisions. Congress also appropriated funds in FY2017 to specifically address opioid abuse. Below are authorizations of appropriations in CARA. Authorizations of appropriations in CARA are mainly annual, with a few exceptions for a period of years. Examples include $5 million for reducing overdose deaths from 2017-2021, $10 million annually for NASPER reauthorization from 2017-2021, and $5 million for opioid overdose reversal medication access from 2017-2019. Title II, \u00a7202 allocates $12 million annually for FY2017-FY2021 ($60 million total) for First Responder Training for Emergency Treatment of Known or Suspected Opioid Overdose. Title III, \u00a7301 provides $25 million annually for FY2017-FY2021 ($125 million total) for Evidence-Based Prescription Opioid and Heroin Treatment and Interventions Demonstration. Title III, \u00a7302 allocates $1 million annually for FY2017-FY2021 ($5 million total) for Building Communities of Recovery. Title V, \u00a7501 reauthorizes $17 million annually for FY2017-FY2021 ($85 million total) for Residential Treatment Program for Pregnant and Postpartum Women. Title VI, \u00a7601 offers $5 million annually for FY2017-FY2021 ($25 million total) for State Demonstration Grants for Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Response. Title I, \u00a7103. Community-based Coalition Enhancement Grants to Address Local Drug Crises: $5 million annually for FY2017-FY2021. Title II, \u00a7201. Comprehensive Opioid Abuse: $103 million annually for FY2017-FY2021. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) provided $20 million for CARA-authorized HHS-administered programs, including opioid-specific and non-opioid-specific programs. DOJ received $103 million for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance. Congress provided $103 million for comprehensive opioid abuse reduction activities under the DOJ State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account, addressing opioid abuse consistent with program authorities including those authorized by CARA. Additionally, $50 million was allocated for the implementation of the Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act under the Department of Veterans Affairs to enhance opioid and substance abuse prevention and treatment. The second continuing resolution for FY2017 appropriated $500 million for the sole opioid-specific grant program authorized by the Cures Act. The Cures Act authorized $500 million for opioid-related activities. Some programs may use funding for opioid abuse within larger substance abuse efforts. The joint explanatory statement specified $56 million for SAMHSA's MAT-PDOA program. The Cures Act authorized $500 million for opioid-related activities, with specific allocations for various programs under HHS and DOJ to address prescription and illicit opioid use. For example, $112 million is designated for CDC's Center for Injury Prevention and Control, and $14 million for illicit opioid use risk factors. Additionally, $50 million is allocated for HRSA's Primary Health Care services related to opioid abuse treatment, prevention, and awareness. DOJ also received $103 million for comprehensive opioid abuse reduction activities. The DOJ received $103 million for comprehensive opioid abuse reduction activities, with funding coming from various programs including Drug Courts, Veterans Treatment Courts, Residential Substance Abuse Treatment, Prescription Drug Monitoring, and programs addressing mental illness in the criminal justice system. Additionally, $10 million was provided for competitive grants to statewide law enforcement agencies for investigative purposes related to opioid trafficking. States have enacted laws to combat opioid trafficking and increase access to naloxone. Governors have declared the opioid problem a state of emergency, allowing for swift action. Initiatives include broadening access to substance abuse treatment and developing education programs. In Ohio, a law mandates opioid abuse prevention in school health curriculum. Pennsylvania's Governor supports a bill for substance abuse prevention programs in all grades. State officials are involved in national initiatives for opioid overdose treatment and prevention. States have adapted criminal justice responses to the opioid crisis. Many states are increasing law enforcement officer access to naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, and providing immunity to those who possess, dispense, or administer the drug. Over 1,200 police departments in 38 states had officers carrying naloxone as of December 2016. Many states have enacted \"Good Samaritan\" laws to encourage seeking medical attention for overdoses without fear of prosecution. 40 states and DC have some form of overdose immunity law. Drug diversion programs and drug courts are used to address opioid abuse, with some states expanding these options in response to the epidemic. In response to the opioid epidemic, states have expanded drug courts and other court diversion options to provide substance abuse treatment and alternatives to incarceration. Some states have enacted legislation to increase access to medication-assisted treatment for drug-addicted offenders who are incarcerated or recently released. Additionally, the National Governors Association announced a \"learning lab\" involving eight states to develop best practices for opioid abuse treatment in justice-involved populations."
