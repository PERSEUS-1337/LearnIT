    "content": "The \"Silent Skies Act of 2013\" addresses aircraft and airport noise as a common nuisance issue in the United States. It highlights the implementation of the stage 4 aircraft noise certification standard for new aircraft designs since 2006. The \"Silent Skies Act of 2013\" focuses on reducing aircraft noise through a cooperative agreement with the FAA for developing technology to meet noise standards. The \"Silent Skies Act of 2013\" requires recipients of funds to conduct activities on a cost-shared basis and make repayments if aircraft technology developed under the agreement generates revenue. Up to $10,000,000 for each fiscal year 2014-2016 can be used for this program, with the Administrator publishing an annual report starting in 2014. The \"Silent Skies Act of 2013\" requires recipients of funds to conduct activities on a cost-shared basis and make repayments if aircraft technology developed under the agreement generates revenue. Up to $10,000,000 for each fiscal year 2014-2016 can be used for this program, with the Administrator publishing an annual report starting in 2014. The analysis for such subchapter is amended by adding at the end the following section until completion of the program. The \"Silent Skies Act of 2013\" requires cost-shared research on aircraft noise reduction technology. The Act prohibits operating certain aircraft not complying with Stage 4 noise levels. The \"Silent Skies Act of 2013\" mandates regulations for civil turbojets to comply with stage 4 noise levels by December 3, 2015. It requires that a percentage of turbojets operating after December 31, 2020, meet these noise level standards. The \"Silent Skies Act of 2013\" mandates that 50% of turbojets operating after December 31, 2025, comply with stage 4 noise levels, increasing to 75% by December 31, 2030, and 100% by December 31, 2035. The Secretary will request international standards for phasing out non-compliant aircraft. The Secretary will enforce the requirements for foreign-flag aircraft in line with international agreements. Air carriers must submit annual progress reports on compliance, and there is no need for recertification of retrofitted turbojets. The Secretary will enforce noise level compliance for civil turbojets, with means specified for demonstrating compliance without recertification. The nonaddition rule amends Section 47529 to update compliance deadlines. The text chunk involves amending various paragraphs and subsections in Chapter 475 of the title, changing references from \"stage 3\" to \"stage 4\" and updating dates from \"November 5, 1990\" to \"January 1, 2019\". The effective date for these amendments is December 31, 2018. Additionally, there are conforming amendments made to Chapter 475, including changes to the chapter analysis. The text chunk involves amending Chapter 475 by updating references from \"stage 3\" to \"stage 4\" and changing dates from \"November 5, 1990\" to \"January 1, 2019\". It also includes a provision exempting certain aircraft outside the 48 contiguous States from specific requirements. The text chunk updates references in Chapter 475 from \"stage 3\" to \"stage 4\" and changes dates from \"November 5, 1990\" to \"January 1, 2019\".
