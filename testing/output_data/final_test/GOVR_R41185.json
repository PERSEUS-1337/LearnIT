Coordination among various donors and investors is crucial for greater efficiency in meeting global development objectives. Donor coordination is a major theme in international development cooperation agreements, including the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Despite efforts to improve coordination, donors, especially the United States, have had limited success in meeting their goals. Some experts question the achievability of donor coordination, while others argue it is more important than ever due to budgetary pressures. Foreign aid is crucial as donors face budget pressures and the number of development actors increases. The 113th Congress will address aid funding and policy issues. The report summarizes official development assistance, discusses coordination goals, and highlights U.S. efforts in donor coordination. Key issues include the role of non-traditional donors like China in development cooperation. The OECD DAC gathers data on official development assistance (ODA) from 45 countries and 22 multilateral organizations. While the OECD DAC is the main source of ODA information, its data is incomplete as reporting is voluntary and irregular for non-OECD countries. Many non-OECD countries do not report ODA data to the OECD DAC, including important donors like Brazil, China, Russia, India, and South Africa. Private aid resources, such as philanthropic donations and private capital flows, are not included in ODA data but are significant in supporting developing countries. Total private capital flows to developing countries in 2010 were estimated at $329 billion, with ODA accounting for less than 20% of total OECD economic engagement. Many development experts advocate for a comprehensive development coordination strategy that goes beyond official aid to include trade, migration, and foreign investment policies. Aid effectiveness is being compromised by fragmentation as more donors are providing ODA to a growing number of recipients. Efforts are being made to concentrate aid in fewer countries and sectors to reduce fragmentation and enhance impact. Some development professionals argue that the increasing number of donor agencies in developing countries may hinder aid efficiency and effectiveness. However, not all foreign aid experts share this concern, with some believing that multiple donors bring valuable diversity and innovation to development projects. There is a debate on whether donor coordination should be the responsibility of recipient governments or donors themselves. The responsibility of coordination in foreign aid is debated, with some arguing it should be the recipient governments' responsibility, while others see potential benefits in donor coordination. Recent international development forums have shown agreement on the importance of greater donor coordination. The OECD DAC was established in 1960 for formal coordination of official development assistance. The OECD DAC was established in 1960 for bilateral aid donors to discuss aid issues. The UNDP was created in 1965 to avoid duplication in multilateral aid efforts. Coordination efforts have shifted towards improving aid efficiency and effectiveness, with the establishment of the WPAE in 2003. The United States has sponsored international forums on aid effectiveness, focusing on donor coordination and setting goals for development assistance. The OECD-sponsored High Level Forum on Harmonization in 2003 aimed to improve aid efficiency and align donor assistance with host country priorities. The Declaration on Harmonization emphasized streamlining donor procedures and implementing good practices. The Rome forum in 2003 focused on donor coordination without establishing formal goals or standards. A follow-up HLF in Paris in 2005 led to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which included recipient countries as equal partners with shared responsibilities. The Declaration endorsed five partnership principles: country ownership, harmonization, alignment, results, and mutual accountability, with the United States actively involved in crafting it. Administrator Andrew Natsios played a key role in crafting the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which focused on mutual accountability and included specific goals and monitoring. The OECD's WPAE established a Joint Venture to monitor progress towards meeting indicator targets, including donor coordination through Common Arrangements or Procedures and Shared Analysis. The Accra forum in 2008 reviewed the Paris Declaration implementation and produced the Accra Agenda for Action, focusing on donor coordination and aid effectiveness. Some attendees were disappointed with the data provided. The Accra HLF in 2008 saw a shift towards alignment with host country priorities, with less emphasis on donor coordination compared to the Paris forum. A parallel workshop for civil society was held, with 600 representatives from 325 NGOs discussing aid effectiveness. Some organizations were hesitant to commit to the Paris Declaration, fearing loss of autonomy or being labeled as \"donors.\" The final High Level Forum in Busan, Korea in November 2011 followed the Paris Declaration monitoring survey, showing that donors fell short of meeting aid effectiveness targets. Participants reaffirmed commitments to unfinished work from previous agreements. The Busan High Level Forum in 2011 marked a change in the role of development stakeholders, with NGOs participating in negotiations through a coalition representative. The outcome document included emerging donors and non-governmental entities, emphasizing that the principles and commitments are voluntary. To reinvigorate aid efforts, a new Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation was prescribed. The Busan High Level Forum in 2011 marked a shift in development stakeholder roles, with NGOs joining negotiations through a coalition representative. The outcome document included emerging donors and non-governmental entities, emphasizing voluntary principles and commitments. A new Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation is being established to replace the DAC WPAE structure, focusing on country-level accountability. The Global Partnership's governance framework is being set up, with co-chairs representing traditional donors, South-South donors, and recipient countries. The United States is represented on the steering committee by Mr. Donald Steinberg, Deputy Administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, led by Mr. Donald Steinberg, Deputy Administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development, will hold high-level meetings every 18-24 months to make decisions related to Busan commitments. A Steering Committee, with representatives from UNDP and OECD, will meet every 6-12 months to prepare for these meetings. While international mechanisms aim to enhance coordination, each donor also operates within its own foreign assistance statutes and agencies. Multilateral aid organizations like the World Bank and regional development banks coordinate development assistance by pooling resources from donor countries. In 2011, multilateral ODA accounted for 8.1% of total ODA disbursements, with the U.S. contributing 12.0% of its disbursements through multilateral channels. In 2011, multilateral ODA accounted for 8.1% of total ODA disbursements, with the U.S. contributing 12.0% of its disbursements through multilateral channels. The increase in multilateral aid is attributed to strategic assistance in fighting terrorism and global health commitments. However, aid channeled through multilateral entities may not reduce fragmentation or improve coordination due to the proliferation of multilateral organizations. Following the Paris Declaration, host governments and donors in several countries created joint assistance strategies (JAS) to coordinate aid. JAS vary in scope and specificity, with some involving multiple donors and stakeholders. USAID encourages participation in JAS, but U.S. aid officials in the field may face challenges in supporting them. The USAID Cambodia web page mentions that while USAID does not directly participate in the Cambodia Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS), it aims to improve donor coordination by utilizing the preparatory work of other organizations. Progress in implementing specific division of labor processes outlined in JAS has been limited due to challenges in determining which donors have a comparative advantage in certain sectors. Maintaining involvement of donors whose existing cooperative arrangements have been disrupted by the division of labor is also a common difficulty in developing JAS. Involvement of donors disrupted by division of labor decisions, garnering resources for a two- to three-year process, balancing host government leadership with donor control. No new JAS agreements established recently, potential fading. Donors in many countries support sector-wide approaches (SWAps) to coordinate activities under host government leadership, pooling funds for single sector policy. SWAps aim to promote donor coordination. USAID has participated in SWAps, primarily in the health sector, but differences in donor views can hinder effective implementation. Accountability concerns, congressional directives, and legislative restrictions make U.S. agency participation in SWAps challenging. Some donors participate in SWAps on a limited basis to work around these obstacles. In Nepal's current health sector SWAp, Australian and British aid agencies, along with the GAVI alliance and the World Bank, pool funds in a government-managed account. USAID and several U.N. agencies participate as \"non-pooling\" partners. SWAps have become less common as country-wide strategies gain prominence due to development priorities like climate change and food security. \"Transparency\" in aid data sharing is a key issue mentioned in international agreements and is seen as a pragmatic substitute for formal donor coordination mechanisms. Global aid transparency, facilitated by information technology, aims to improve donor coordination and accountability. The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) was launched in 2008 to provide consistent and comparable data on aid allocation and impact, enabling better decision-making for all stakeholders. The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) aims to improve decision-making and accountability for aid effectiveness by establishing common data reporting standards. By 2015, IATI plans to fully implement these standards in line with Busan commitments. As of December 2012, 15 bilateral donors, including the United States, and 18 multilateral and non-governmental donors have signed on to IATI. Coordination within the U.S. aid structure is primarily managed through USAID guidance. USAID's Office of Donor Engagement oversees donor coordination through mechanisms like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and PEPFAR. Field missions were guided to comply with Paris Declaration commitments on coordination by endorsing local agreements and working with other donors. The guidance acknowledges challenges in coordinating with other donors, especially for U.S. field staff due to extensive presence in recipient countries. A July 2012 update to USAID's directives reflects increasing acceptance of joint funding and delegated cooperation for bilateral development partners. In an effort to enhance coordination with other donor countries and organizations, USAID has assigned Senior Development Counselors to key positions in Beijing, Brussels, Geneva, Paris, and Rome. Additionally, USAID missions designate Donor Group Representatives in countries with large donor groups. Responsibilities include familiarizing with the Paris Declaration. The job description for a position in Nepal involves familiarizing with the Paris Declaration principles and addressing USAID's barriers to full implementation. The U.S. Coordinating Director for Development and Economic Affairs oversees foreign assistance in Afghanistan and coordinates with other donors and the Afghan government. The Millennium Challenge Corporation provides aid to countries meeting specific criteria. The Millennium Challenge Corporation provides assistance to developing countries meeting specific criteria through five-year compacts, incorporating donor coordination considerations. MCC compacts often scale-up projects developed with support from other donor agencies, such as a road project in Honduras and Nicaragua. The Millennium Challenge Corporation, supported by various organizations, facilitated project completion in five years instead of ten. Donor coordination was crucial, with examples like New Zealand and AusAid providing additional resources for a transportation project. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator was established to manage PEPFAR, emphasizing coordination among donor governments. The Obama Administration's initiatives, such as the Global Health Initiative and Climate Change and Food Security aid, emphasized donor coordination through strategic plans and collaboration with host countries. Leveraging multilateral partnerships and joint assessments were key to strengthening health systems and addressing financing gaps. The Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative and USAID's Global Climate Change strategy emphasize donor coordination at both country and global levels. Multilateral development banks and funds play a crucial coordinating role. USAID appoints coordinators for food security and climate change programs to oversee whole-of-government strategies. However, progress towards harmonization goals outlined in the Paris Declaration monitoring surveys is slow, indicating persistent obstacles to a unified international approach to Official Development Assistance (ODA). Many aid experts face obstacles to a unified international approach to ODA, including division of labor, concerns about budget support, lack of coordination, and conflicting interests. Analysts suggest establishing a clear division of labor among donor countries to reduce aid fragmentation and ensure effective resource utilization based on comparative advantage. Comparative advantage in aid distribution can be based on various factors like geographical proximity, cultural ties, and sector-specific expertise. Implementing division of labor can involve donors playing a larger role in fewer countries or sectors, or delegating assistance to specific countries or sectors. However, negotiations over division of labor can be contentious as countries may be reluctant to give up their established roles or accept the leadership of other donors. The Accra Agenda for Action emphasizes aid recipients taking the lead in determining donor roles in their countries. Donors may be hesitant to identify effective aid for diplomatic reasons or fear aid reduction. They prefer involvement in regions with short-term success, avoiding \"aid orphan\" countries. Some argue against division of labor for coordination, fearing donor monopolies. USAID lacks guidelines on participation in division of labor negotiations, limiting U.S. aid implementers' negotiation abilities due to provisions in annual appropriations bills. Congressional directives in annual appropriations bills dictate how development assistance is allocated, limiting aid officials' flexibility in negotiating divisions of labor. Some experts suggest channeling aid through recipient governments as direct budget support to harmonize foreign assistance more effectively. Supporters argue that providing aid directly to recipient country governments ensures aid is used in line with host country priorities, prevents inefficiency of parallel donor activities, and enhances financial management capacity. Opponents cite misuse by corrupt governments and lack of oversight, while critics fear diminished NGO roles and donor interference in core government functions. The aid effectiveness debate includes concerns about compromising independence and creating power imbalances among donors pooling funds. The United States has been hesitant to embrace budget support, as noted in the U.S. Action Plan on Harmonization. In 2010, donors reported giving an average of 2.7% of ODA as general budget support, with the U.S. percentage even lower. Most donors prefer project-based aid for more control over project planning and design decisions. Some aid officials are concerned that the U.S. reluctance to use budget support makes it challenging to collaborate with other donors who provide assistance through budget support more frequently. In recent years, USAID has aimed to increase aid flows directed to host country entities to about 30% through the USAID Forward initiative. This includes using host-country systems in Afghanistan through \"host-country contracting\" to give funds directly to vetted ministries for responsible administration. Some argue that channeling funds to pre-designated NGOs for program implementation, as a safeguard against corruption, may undermine the benefits of direct budget support. There are disincentives for donor coordination at every level of foreign assistance policy making and implementation, such as reluctance to coordinate efforts due to fear of diluting influence or brand, legislators not wanting to give up control over assistance programs, and aid agencies fearing less independence and downsizing with increased collaboration. Difficulty in attributing outcomes to specific contributions and demonstrating value on projects are also concerns. Some aid officials suggest that aid workers are too busy for coordination, not evaluated on it in performance reviews. Issues apply to bilateral and multilateral donors. Maintaining unique donor identities and relationships is a priority for countries and agencies. Recipient countries also value long-standing donor relationships. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark report highlights how countries and organizations are hesitant to break away from traditional donor relationships. Host government officials are reluctant to work with new arrangements or cede authority to coordinating committees. Lack of coordination between U.S. departments and agencies is a known issue in aid efforts. The lack of coordination between the numerous U.S. departments and agencies involved in foreign assistance hinders coordination with other donors and creates inefficiencies within the U.S. aid structure. This issue also leads to confusion for other donors trying to coordinate with U.S. efforts. In-country leadership clarity is lacking, as highlighted by a situation in South Africa where U.S. agency representatives had never met each other. The 2010 QDDR aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of U.S. diplomacy and development programs. The 2010 QDDR aimed to improve coordination between U.S. agencies for foreign assistance. Country Development Cooperation Strategies (CDCS) summarize U.S. government policies and synchronize agency activities for a country over five years. CDCS for Guatemala involves coordination with eight U.S. departments and agencies, aligning with host country plans. As of October 2012, 15 CDCSs were approved, with 73 more scheduled by October 2013. Many argue that additional resources are needed to establish coordination mechanisms for foreign assistance, despite the potential for greater efficiency and lower administrative costs. Joint assistance strategies can take years to develop, using significant donor staff time. Increased demands on time and staff resources are seen as significant barriers to further harmonization measures, hindering efforts to improve donor coordination for more efficient and effective development assistance. Improving donor coordination for more efficient development assistance is a key objective, but it conflicts with other U.S. foreign assistance priorities such as supporting commercial interests and geopolitical security concerns. Strategic objectives often hinder delegating authority to other donors, as access and influence are perceived trade-offs for aid. The USAID school reconstruction project in Afghanistan aims to increase local acceptance of the U.S. military presence. Aid experts argue that improving aid effectiveness is challenging due to conflicting objectives. Recent foreign aid reform efforts seek to enhance U.S. policy coherence and differentiate between short- and long-term goals for foreign assistance. This clarity may improve coordination with other donors and facilitate recognition of common goals. Researchers have found that less than half of aid reaching developing countries adheres to Paris Declaration commitments. Aid from private foundations, NGOs, and emerging donors not aligned with DAC goals has changed the development landscape. Non-OECD countries like South Korea, Indonesia, Turkey, and Venezuela are now notable aid donors. \"South-South cooperation\" and \"triangular cooperation\" are emerging trends in aid distribution. \"Triangular cooperation, involving emerging and traditional donors, is becoming more important for aid coordination as ODA decreases in significance. The shift from the OECD DAC to the Global Partnership at the Busan HLF aims to involve a wider range of stakeholders, including private actors and more donor states. Negotiations at Busan focused on the inclusion of emerging donors to maintain aid effectiveness relevance.\" The Busan document established a two-tiered commitment for aid effectiveness, with developing country donors and non-governmental entities accepting provisions as voluntary guidance, while traditional donors accept them as commitments. Emerging donors face skepticism due to their aid being seen as more political and commercial than development-oriented. Emerging donors, like traditional donors before them, may use aid for political and commercial purposes, such as establishing regional leadership or boosting international standing. South-South cooperation, particularly Chinese aid in Africa, is often motivated by access to markets and natural resources. Improved efficiency in development assistance may not be enough to overcome obstacles to coordination, as strategic goals take precedence. Non-OECD donors may not see advantages in participating in OECD DAC reporting, unless they aspire to OECD membership and wish to demonstrate support, facing technical and political challenges in reporting aid data. Many smaller donors face obstacles in reporting detailed and reliable aid data expected by the DAC due to resource constraints. Donors ineligible for OECD membership may be reluctant to cooperate with an organization that denies them this status. Smaller donors may fear their assistance will seem insignificant compared to larger donors or be hesitant to reveal politically or commercially sensitive information. South-South donors do not typically impose governance or human rights conditions on their aid, unlike DAC donors. Non-governmental donors, including foundations and faith-based organizations, encounter obstacles in fully participating in coordination efforts. Development assistance grants from private voluntary organizations totaled $30.8 billion in 2010, with the majority coming from U.S.-based organizations. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation alone provided nearly $2.0 billion in 2010 for global health and development programs. These entities share reporting concerns with emerging official donors, lacking resources for DAC-quality data collection and worrying about the impact on fundraising. Many NGOs involved in international development are wary of being labeled as donors and prefer a broader role. Recent efforts have shifted focus to aid quality and included a wider range of development actors in coordination. Commitments made by donors at global forums have not been met, despite reaffirmations in Busan in 2011. The Busan HLF in 2011 reaffirmed commitments to aid effectiveness, but challenges such as non-traditional donors and coordination issues persist. Efforts to include these actors in a new Global Partnership are voluntary. The United States continues to work on improving aid effectiveness. The United States aims to enhance aid effectiveness by maintaining strong relationships with bilateral donors, improving aid transparency, and utilizing multilateral development entities and partnerships in foreign assistance."
