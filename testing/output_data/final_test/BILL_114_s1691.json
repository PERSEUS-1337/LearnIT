The Secretary shall establish an arbitration program within the Forest Service for projects subject to objections, notifying objectors that further appeals may be subject to arbitration. The Secretary may designate ecosystem restoration projects for arbitration, including collaborative projects, those in community wildfire protection plans, and up to 2 other types per region per year. Arbitrators must meet qualifications set by the Secretary. Arbitrators for ecosystem restoration projects must be currently certified by the American Arbitration Association. The Secretary must notify objectors and the court of jurisdiction within 7 days of receiving a notice of intent to challenge a project. Objectors can file a demand for arbitration following specific procedures outlined in title 5. The demand for arbitration under this section must be filed within 30 days of notification by the Secretary and include an alternative proposal for the ecosystem restoration project modifications sought by the objector. The Secretary and objector must agree on an arbitrator from a published list. The arbitrator will address demands for arbitration and may consolidate multiple demands into one. The arbitrator will decide on the ecosystem restoration project approved by the Secretary. The arbitration process for ecosystem restoration projects must be completed within 90 days of filing a demand.

BONDING REQUIREMENTS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. Bond Requirement for Judicial Review of Ecosystem Restoration Projects: Plaintiffs must post a bond or security equal to anticipated costs before initiating an action. Proceedings are stayed until the required bond is provided. The bond or security required under subparagraph (A) must be posted before proceedings can continue. If the Secretary prevails in an action, they can request payment for costs, expenses, and attorney fees from the posted bond. The total amount recovered cannot exceed the bond amount, and any remaining funds will be returned. If the court rules in favor of the plaintiff, costs, expenses, and attorney fees will be returned. In case of settlement, parties may share incurred costs and fees. Settlement agreements may defer resolving costs, expenses, and attorney fees through further negotiation or court decision. SEC. 108. PERFORMANCE MEASURES; ANNUAL REPORTS. The Secretary evaluates the achievement of ecosystem restoration projects annually based on various performance measures, including the number of acres covered, treated by mechanical methods, stewardship contracts/agreements, timber sales, prescribed fire, and noncommercial activities. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress detailing the results of ecosystem restoration project evaluations, including the number and types of treatments on acres, and the acreage requirements. Additionally, the reports must include information on ecosystem restoration projects subject to arbitration.

In this title, \"catastrophic event\" refers to natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and fires. \"Categorical exclusion\" is an exception to environmental policy requirements for projects on National Forest System land. \"Collaborative process\" involves developing and implementing projects on National Forest System land. The term \"forest management activity\" refers to projects carried out by the Secretary on National Forest System land, in accordance with the forest plan for that area. The term \"forest plan\" is a management plan prepared by the Forest Service for a unit of the National Forest System. A \"salvage operation\" is a forest management activity conducted in response to a specific event. A salvage operation is a forest management activity in response to a catastrophic event, aimed at preventing wildfires, utilizing damaged forest materials, and funding reforestation and restoration activities on National Forest System land.

SEC. 202 provides a categorical exclusion for forest management activities on National Forest System land for purposes such as addressing insect infestations, reducing hazardous fuel loads, and protecting water sources. Acreage limitations apply except for specific cases. Forest management activities on National Forest System land are subject to acreage limitations. Activities covered by a categorical exclusion under subsection (a) cannot exceed 5,000 acres, but can reach up to 15,000 acres if developed collaboratively, proposed by a resource advisory committee, or covered by a community wildfire protection plan. SEC. 203. CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION TO EXPEDITE SALVAGE OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. Categorical exclusion allows the Secretary to conduct salvage operations on National Forest System land after a catastrophic event. Salvage operations cannot exceed 5,000 acres and must not involve permanent road construction. Stream buffers must comply with forest plan standards unless modified for the specific operation. The guidelines for a salvage operation under a categorical exclusion by the Regional Forester include developing a reforestation plan as part of the operation.
