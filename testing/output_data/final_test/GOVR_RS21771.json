The industry operates under government regulations but gained more public attention after the discovery of mad cow disease in North American cows in 2003. U.S. officials are taking new regulatory actions in response to the discovery of mad cow disease in North American cows in 2003. These actions are expected to impact renderers' business practices, costs, and product values, which in turn will affect animal and meat producers. Renderers annually convert raw animal materials into various products sourced from meat slaughtering plants, dead animals from various facilities, and food waste from restaurants and stores. The amount of usable material from each animal varies by species. At slaughter, a 1,200-pound steer can yield 55%-60% human edible product, including meat for retail sale, fat, and variety meats. Independent renderers process half of livestock and poultry that die before slaughter. In 2000, U.S. farm animal mortalities included 4.1 million cattle, 18 million hogs, 833,000 sheep, lambs, and goats, and 82 million chickens. In 2000, U.S. farm animal mortalities included 4.1 million cattle, 18 million hogs, 833,000 sheep, lambs, and goats, and 82 million chickens. Disposing of these mortalities is complicated to minimize adverse environmental consequences. There are 250-260 rendering plants in Canada and the United States, either integrated or independent operations. Rendering facilities in the U.S. and Canada, whether integrated or independent, handle the rendering of edible animal byproducts into fats for human consumption and proteins for animal feeds. These facilities are subject to USDA inspection and safety standards. Inedible byproducts are also rendered into fats and proteins for various uses, with operations segregated based on the animal species processed in meat plants. Rendering facilities in the U.S. and Canada, whether integrated or independent, handle the rendering of edible animal byproducts into fats for human consumption and proteins for animal feeds. Independent operations handle around 30%-35% of rendered material, collecting material from various sources for nonhuman consumption, regulated by the FDA. The rendering process involves grinding raw materials, cooking to separate fat from protein and bone, and processing into fat and protein products. Different rendering systems are used, including those that recover protein from slaughterhouse blood or process restaurant grease. Renderers produce 18 billion pounds of ingredients annually for use in animal feeds. Renderers produce 18 billion pounds of ingredients annually valued at over $3 billion, with $870 million exported. Feed ingredients account for 10 billion pounds worth approximately $1 billion, including 6.6 billion pounds of MBM, 4 billion pounds of poultry byproducts, and 226 million pounds of blood meal. These ingredients are valued for their high protein content, digestible amino acids, and minerals. Poultry and pet food industries dominate the domestic MBM market, while hog and cattle operations also utilize rendered products. The generation of inedible materials is inevitable as long as animals are raised and processed for food. The disposal of slaughter byproducts and rendered products is a concern as market outlets may decrease, leading to questions about safe disposal and cost responsibility. The FDA imposed a feed ban in 1997 to control BSE transmission through infected animal feed. The FDA banned feeding mammalian proteins to cattle and ruminants in 1997 to prevent BSE transmission. Prohibited proteins can still be fed to other animals. Estimates vary on the economic impact, with potential losses of $63 million to $252 million in MBM values. Losses were concentrated among renderers and mixed species handlers. The 2001 Sparks study estimated the cost impacts of feed restrictions, with a total animal protein ban to all farm animals costing $1.5 billion yearly. USDA's ban on \"downer\" cattle from the human food supply also affected the rendering industry. The USDA estimated that 150,000-200,000 downers were entering slaughter plants, raising concerns about the impact of the downer ban on BSE surveillance. The expansion of the BSE surveillance program aims to sample more downers and dead animals, but practical issues such as carcass recovery and costs need to be addressed. Renderers may pay less for dead animals due to changes in the industry, posing disposal challenges. Sparks estimated the cost of disposing dead cattle and calves at $8.25 per head if meat and bone meal (MBM) can be sold for feed, but it could rise to $24.11 per head if MBM is banned. Other disposal methods cost $9.33 for incineration, $10.63 for burial, and $30.34 for composting. The World Health Organization highlighted the importance of rendering in sanitizing animal wastes to prevent disease transmission. An enhanced BSE surveillance program requires a comprehensive system for the proper disposal of dead and non-ambulatory cattle to protect public health, animal health, and the environment. Federal resources may be needed to cover costs for sampling, transport, and safe disposal. Rendering is one option for handling dead stock and animal byproducts, but it must comply with environmental standards enforced by the EPA and local authorities. Rendering is one option for handling dead stock and animal byproducts, but industries should bear the costs, not the public, especially during budget deficits."
