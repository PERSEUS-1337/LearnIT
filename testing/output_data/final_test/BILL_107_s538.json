    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Infant Crib Safety Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. The Infant Crib Safety Act outlines findings by Congress regarding the serious threat of infant injuries and deaths in cribs, emphasizing the importance of safe crib design and construction. Over 12,000 children under 2 are injured in cribs annually, with at least 50 deaths. The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates the societal cost of these deaths. The cost to society from crib-related deaths is estimated to be at least $225 million per year. Secondhand, hand-me-down, and heirloom cribs are a concern as many infants are placed in them, leading to most crib deaths. Current legislation is insufficient to address the hazards posed by these types of cribs. Prohibiting the sale or placement of unsafe secondhand cribs in the market can prevent injuries and deaths. The Act aims to prevent injuries and deaths to infants by prohibiting the sale of unsafe cribs, including secondhand, hand-me-down, and heirloom cribs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"commercial user\" in this Act refers to individuals involved in manufacturing, selling, or dealing with full-size or nonfull-size cribs, whether new or used, including child care facilities and businesses that sell or lease cribs. A crib can be full-size or nonfull-size, with the latter including portable cribs and crib-pens. An infant is defined as a person under 35 inches tall or under 2 years old. SEC. 4 prohibits commercial users from selling unsafe cribs for infants and prohibits lodging facilities from offering unsafe cribs. SEC. 5 establishes crib standards. A crib is considered unsafe if it does not meet specific federal regulations and voluntary standards outlined in the Act. SEC. 6. EXCEPTIONS. This Act does not apply to cribs not intended for infant use, accompanied by a notice declaring their unsuitability for infants. SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT. SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT. Any commercial user, hotel, motel, or similar lodging facility that knowingly violates section 4 may face a civil penalty of up to $1,000. Individuals can also seek injunctions in federal court against violators and recover attorney fees. Penalties and remedies under this Act are additional to those under other laws. The Act will be effective 90 days after enactment."
