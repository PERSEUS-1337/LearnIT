    "content": "EXTERNAL REGULATION OF DEPARTMENT. The Department's regulatory authority over nuclear safety and occupational health responsibilities at nonmilitary energy laboratories will be eliminated. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will assume these responsibilities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission may regulate the Department's contractors for nonmilitary energy laboratories. Contractors are not responsible for decommissioning costs, and no enforcement action can be taken against them for violations due to Department failures in authorizing or funding decommissioning activities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department will establish decommissioning procedures for nonmilitary energy laboratories within a year of this Act. The Commission will have exclusive regulatory authority over accelerators and other sources of radiation at these laboratories two years after the Act's enactment. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will have exclusive regulatory authority over nonmilitary energy laboratories, including accelerators and radioisotopes, as granted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The Commission will establish decommissioning procedures for these laboratories within a year of the Act, and nonmilitary energy laboratories must meet the requirements stipulated in a license for the facility until a rulemaking is completed. The responsibilities under this subsection will be administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, not by States. Any final order or regulation of the Commission establishing standards for nonmilitary energy will be subject to judicial review. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will regulate nonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by the Department of Energy. Contractors must comply with employee protection laws and avoid conflicts of interest. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will regulate nonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by the Department of Energy, with a focus on employee protection laws and conflict of interest regulations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration will assume regulatory and enforcement responsibilities for matters covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration will administer responsibilities for occupational safety and health at nonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by the Department of Energy. Contractors operating such laboratories will be considered employers under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. If a hazard at a laboratory contains both radiological and non-radiological components, both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will regulate it. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will share regulatory responsibilities for hazards at nonmilitary energy laboratories owned by the Department of Energy. A memorandum of understanding will be established within one year of the Act's enactment to govern their authorities. The Department's contractor at these laboratories will not be subject to civil penalties under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The Secretary will not be liable for civil penalties under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 or the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 for actions taken before the transfer of regulatory authority. The Secretary will indemnify nonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by the Department. A plan for terminating the Department's regulatory and enforcement responsibilities for these laboratories must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The report must include a transition plan for terminating self-regulation authority, coordination with regulatory agencies, resolution of remaining issues, and an estimate of annual costs. The General Accounting Office will report to Congress on the progress of implementing self-regulation of nuclear safety and occupational safety at nonmilitary energy laboratories, including the number of employees involved and the expected reduction in Department staff. The report must also include a transition plan for terminating self-regulation authority and an estimate of annual costs. The Comptroller General will provide a report within 20 months on the Department of Energy's transition plan and within 26 months on the implementation of regulations at nonmilitary energy laboratories. Definitions include the Department as the DOE and nonmilitary energy laboratories such as Ames, Argonne, Brookhaven, Fermi, Lawrence Berkeley, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratories. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy at nonmilitary energy laboratories like Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility."
