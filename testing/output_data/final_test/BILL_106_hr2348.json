Definitions are provided in Section 2. The Act defines key terms such as Recovery Implementation Programs, Secretary, Upper Division States, and Colorado River Storage Project. The Colorado River Storage Project Act defines terms related to capital projects, facilities, and interests in land and water for the Recovery Implementation Programs. This includes activities like planning, construction, genetic conservation, habitat restoration, and agreements protecting instream flows. The term \"base funding\" refers to funding for operation, maintenance, recovery actions, monitoring, and program management under the Recovery Implementation Programs. It includes funding from the 1988 and 1992 Cooperative Agreements. \"Recovery actions other than capital projects\" involve leases, reintroduction of endangered fish, and control of nonnative fishes. The term \"depletion charge\" is a one-time charge. The term \"depletion charge\" is a one-time contribution in dollars per acre-foot to be paid to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service based on the average annual new depletion by each project. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION TO FUND RECOVERY PROGRAMS. Authorization of $46,000,000 for capital projects under the Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin, with expiration dates for project implementation authority in fiscal years 2005 and 2007 unless reauthorized by Congress. Total costs of projects to be funded. The Recovery Implementation Programs under this Act have a funding limit of $100,000,000, with specific allocations for the Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin and the San Juan River Recovery Program. The Secretary can adjust these amounts for inflation annually. Additionally, the Secretary can accept contributions for capital projects from Upper Division States or related organizations. The Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of the Interior may use non-Federal contributions and power revenues for capital projects costs, not exceeding $17,000,000 each. These funds will be treated as reimbursable costs and shall be made available in equal amounts over a 2-fiscal-year period. The additional funding provided may be through loans from the Colorado Water Conservation Board Construction Fund to the Western Area Power Administration, authorized for repayment from power revenues starting in fiscal year 2012, subject to an agreement between relevant parties. The Bureau of Reclamation will negotiate agreements with Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects Firm Power Contractors to minimize impacts on power rates. Loan repayment to the Colorado Water Conservation Board must be completed by September 30, 2057. The Western Area Power Administration can adjust power rates to cover necessary costs. Contributions will be additional to replacement power costs and water capital costs, not exceeding $20,000,000. Base funding will begin in the first fiscal year. The Secretary may use power revenues for annual base funding contributions to Recovery Implementation Programs, not exceeding $20,000,000. Contributions for specific programs are capped at $4,000,000 for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin and $2,000,000 for the San Juan River program. The Secretary may adjust contributions up to $2,000,000 per year for inflation. Power revenues can be used for capital projects and monitoring, but base funding will cease after 2011 unless reauthorized by Congress. A report on power revenue usage must be submitted by the end of fiscal year 2008. Existing agreements among participants will not be modified by this Act. The Western Area Power Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation will maintain sufficient revenues in the Colorado River Basin Fund to meet base funding obligations. If funds are insufficient, they will request appropriations. Unexpended funds for capital projects will be retained for future use. Under this Act, unexpended funds will be retained for future fiscal years to implement capital projects for Recovery Implementation Programs. The Secretary has additional authority to enter agreements, acquire interests in land, and accept grants to carry out the Act's purposes. The Congress recognizes the importance of water development in the San Juan River Basin and Duchesne River Basin for Indian tribes and endangered fish species on Indian trust lands. The Act allows for the retention of unexpended funds for future fiscal years to implement capital projects for Recovery Implementation Programs. The Secretary is granted authority to enter agreements, acquire land interests, and accept grants to fulfill the Act's purposes. Additionally, 2 miles of critical habitat on the Duchesne River is located on Indian Trust Land, with no restrictions on funding activities or projects related to the Federal Government's Indian trust responsibility. Authorities provided for Recovery Implementation Programs will terminate upon expiration of the current time period for the respective Cooperative Agreement unless extended to comply with the Act. The SEC. 4 of the text states that actions taken under this title will not affect acreage limitation provisions of Federal reclamation law in terms of repayment obligations, reinstating limitations, or increasing construction repayment obligations.
