    "title": "SB 1175",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4603.2 of the Labor Code is amended to require the employee or physician to notify the employer of the selected physician's name and address. The physician must submit reports to the employer within specified timeframes. If the employer objects to the employee's choice of physician outside their network, but the employee is entitled to select that physician, the employer must cover the treatment costs. Payment starts from the initial examination date or when the physician's report is submitted within five working days. No payment is required for services before the report submission date if it's later than five working days. If the employer objects to the employee's choice of physician outside their network and it is determined that the employee was not entitled to select a physician outside the network, the employer will not be liable for any treatment provided by that physician or any consequences of the treatment obtained outside the network. Providers of services under Section 4600 must submit payment requests with itemized charges, service reports, prescriptions/referrals, and authorization evidence. Employers can establish alternative payment request methods through written agreements. Effective for services provided on or after January 1, 2017, payment requests with itemized charges must be submitted to the employer within 12 months of service or discharge for inpatient facility services. The request for payment is barred if not timely submitted, with exceptions for good cause defined by the administrative director. (C) A copy of the prescription is not required for payment for pharmacy services unless a written agreement mandates it. (D) Employers, insurers, pharmacy benefits managers, or claims administrators can request a prescription copy during a review of dispensed drugs. Payment for medical treatment must be made at reasonable maximum amounts in the official fee schedule within 45 days of receipt of itemized services, with any disputes or denials notified to the physician within 30 days. An itemization must be reviewed and any incomplete information must be addressed within 30 days. Services not paid within 45 days must be paid at the rates then in effect plus 15 percent interest. The employer must pay the provider within 45 days at the current rates. They must also inform the physician of any contested items and remedies available. Delayed payments do not affect the employer's liability to the employee under other provisions. (3) If the employer is a governmental entity, payment for medical treatment must be made within 60 days after receiving itemization and required reports. (4) Duplicate submissions of medical services do not require further notification or objection by the employer and do not incur additional penalties or interest. Interest or increased compensation paid by an insurer under this section is treated similarly to an increase in compensation under Section 4650 for risk classification, premium rates, and merit rating systems approved in the Insurance Code. Whenever an employer or insurer hires someone to review a physician's itemization, they must provide all documentation submitted with the itemization. If additional information is needed, the reviewer must contact the claims administrator or insurer for the necessary documentation. An individual reviewing a physician's itemization cannot change procedure codes or payment amounts without reviewing the documentation provided. If changes are made, a specific explanation must be given to the physician detailing the reasons for the alterations. If a provider disputes the amount paid, they can request a second review within 90 days, providing necessary details and additional information to support the request. If the provider disputes the amount paid, they can request a second review within 90 days. The employer must respond within 14 days with a final determination on the disputed items. Payment of any undisputed balance must be made within 21 days. If the provider still contests the amount paid, they can request an independent bill review. The appeals board has jurisdiction over disputes in this subdivision. Section 4603.4 of the Labor Code is amended to require standardized submission of medical bills, acceptance of electronic claims for payment, confidentiality of medical information, and timely submission of bills. Employers must accept electronic claims for medical services, and standards should align with HIPAA regulations. The Labor Code is amended to require employers to accept electronic claims for payment of medical services within 15 working days. Payment for medical treatment must be made promptly with an explanation of review, and any contested amounts must be resolved within the same timeframe. Section 4625 of the Labor Code is amended to require bills for medical-legal evaluation or expenses to be submitted to the employer within 12 months of service. Exceptions may be made for good cause. Charges not exceeding the official fee schedule must be paid promptly by the employer. If the employer disputes charges paid, they can file a petition with the appeals board to seek reimbursement from the physician for unreasonable charges."
