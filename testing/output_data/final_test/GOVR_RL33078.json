The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a history of providing housing assistance and is involved in addressing the housing needs post-Katrina. This report examines HUD's programs and authority in responding to housing crises, as well as Congress's past expansions of that role. It does not cover HUD's specific response to Hurricane Katrina. Before discussing existing housing resources, it is important to consider the housing needs following a disaster. Research by E.L. Quarantelli identified four stages of housing needs after a disaster: emergency shelter, temporary shelter, temporary housing, and permanent housing. Emergency shelter provides immediate safety, while temporary shelter and housing allow families to establish routines but are not permanent solutions. Temporary housing can last for months or years. Permanent housing, lasting for months or years, includes families returning to former residences, new residences in original communities, or relocation. FEMA aids state and local emergency response efforts, providing resources for shelter and housing needs under the Stafford Act. FEMA assists in designating evacuation areas, coordinating with organizations for temporary shelters. The Red Cross and other charitable organizations, along with FEMA and other federal agencies, provide temporary housing options, rental assistance, loans, and grants to help families repair damaged homes after a disaster. FEMA is the primary disaster response agency, but other federal agencies also contribute housing resources. The restoration and creation of permanent housing is mainly achieved through various programs and incentives. The large majority of permanent housing restoration is funded by private and public insurance. HUD focuses on aiding families in temporary and permanent housing stages after disasters. HUD's assistance falls into direct aid, block grants, and mortgage programs. Rental assistance is provided through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program for low-income families. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program provides portable subsidies for very low-income families, with 75% targeted to extremely low-income families. Administered by Public Housing Authorities, the program is funded by Congress and allows families to move anywhere in the country. Another form of assistance is low-rent public housing, where families pay 30% of their income towards housing costs, with federal subsidies helping cover the rest. In FY2005, Congress provided approximately $2.5 billion each to the capital and operating funds for public housing. The final form of direct assistance provided by HUD is project-based rental assistance, where private landlords manage housing units subsidized by the federal government. Families pay 30% of their incomes towards rent, with the government covering the difference. In FY2004 and FY2005, Congress allocated funds for project-based Section 8, Section 202, and Section 811 rental assistance programs. HUD's direct assistance programs can be used in disaster recovery, with options like emergency capital reserves, insurance for private owners, SBA loans, and HUD loans available for assistance. HUD provides assistance to families displaced by disasters, including vouchers for finding new housing, identifying vacant units for relocation, and offering resources to non-assisted households. Congress has also created emergency vouchers for temporary housing. Flexible block grant programs like the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) provide funds to states and localities, with CDBG funded at $4.9 billion in FY2005. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, funded at $4.9 billion in FY2005, supports various eligible activities such as neighborhood revitalization, economic development, and housing initiatives. Seventy percent of CDBG funds must benefit low- or moderate-income individuals. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program provides block grant funding for affordable housing projects. Eligible activities include acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, and rental assistance. HUD administers grants for affordable housing, rental assistance, and special populations. Grantees must meet match requirements and benefit families at or below 60% of the area median income. Waivers can be issued for disaster recovery needs. Congress has utilized CDBG and HOME for emergency funds after disasters. While HUD does not offer direct mortgage loans, FHA provides single and multifamily mortgage insurance to encourage lending. Procedures for FHA-insured mortgages are triggered by a disaster declaration, including a 90-day foreclosure moratorium. A 90-day foreclosure moratorium is in effect, lenders are encouraged to offer special assistance to affected borrowers, families with destroyed residences are eligible for 100% financing for reconstruction, damaged properties can qualify for financing for purchase and rehabilitation, underwriting guidelines are relaxed for disaster victims, and lenders are directed to expedite hazard claims. The Section 203(h) program offers 100% financing for borrowers who own homes in the affected area, with loans limited to the FHA loan limit. Lenders must expedite hazard claims and cannot retain insurance proceeds without borrower consent. The Section 203(k) program allows borrowers to purchase and rehabilitate abandoned properties in the area. The FHA underwriting guidelines allow borrowers in disaster-impacted areas to have a total debt of up to 45% of their gross monthly income, with exceptions for compensating factors. HUD plays a crucial role in meeting housing needs post-disasters, as seen in past events with major housing losses. Table 1 lists past disasters in which Congress has provided supplemental appropriations to HUD, dating back to 1992. On August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew struck the coast of southern Florida as a category 5 hurricane, causing significant damage in Florida's South Dade County. Hurricane Andrew struck southern Florida as a category 5 hurricane, causing extensive damage in South Dade County. The storm resulted in 26 deaths, 250,000 displaced individuals, and $26.5 billion in damages. Congress passed the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act to provide additional Section 8 vouchers for those affected by Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii, and Typhoon Omar in Guam. Congress allocated funds for housing vouchers, public housing development, and housing counseling assistance for families affected by Hurricanes Andrew, Iniki, and Typhoon Omar. The Secretary of HUD was given the power to waive provisions of statutes or regulations for rebuilding efforts. FHA received funds to insure loans for rebuilding efforts, supporting about 95,000 housing units. Hurricane Andrew devastated over 11,000 manufactured homes in Florida and Louisiana, with 97% of homes in Dade County destroyed. HUD implemented new construction standards for manufactured homes to increase wind resistance up to 110 mph. In 1993, heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding in 10 Midwestern states, including the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers overflowing their banks. In 1993, severe flooding in the Midwest (Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin) caused extensive damage, displacing 54,000 people and resulting in 50 deaths. FEMA declared 534 counties eligible for disaster aid, with 168,340 people applying for federal assistance. Property damage estimates ranged from $12 to $16 billion. Congress passed the Supplemental Appropriations for Relief from the Major, Widespread Flooding of the Midwest Act (P.L. 103-75) in August 1993, allocating funds for recovery efforts. Additional funding was made available in February 1994 for Midwest flood recovery and the 1994 Northridge earthquake in California. In connection with the 1994 Northridge earthquake in California, HUD allocated $500 million for recovery efforts. The Secretary of HUD had the authority to transfer up to $75 million to the HOME program. CDBG funds were used to repair, replace, or restore facilities damaged by the floods, with waived limits on new construction for flood-damaged properties. Nine affected states received CDBG funds in 1993 and 1994, with Illinois receiving $84.1 million, Iowa $96.3 million, Kansas $37.2 million, Minnesota $27.1 million, Missouri $136.8 million, Nebraska $23.1 million, North Dakota $19.6 million, South Dakota $12.8 million, and Wisconsin $13.1 million. After the Midwest floods, CDBG funds were used for mitigation activities in flood-damaged states. Local communities engaged in buyouts, relocation, elevation, and flood proofing to protect properties on flood plains. Some cities used CDBG money to buy out properties located in high-risk areas. After the Midwest flood, CDBG funds were used for mitigation activities in flood-damaged states. St. Charles County, Missouri, and Arnold, Missouri used CDBG funds along with FEMA money to buy out properties on floodplains. A total of 12,385 properties were mitigated, with various actions taken such as buyouts, relocations, elevation, and flood proofing. In a separate event, the Northridge Earthquake in 1994 caused significant damage in the greater Los Angeles area, with losses estimated between $20 and $40 billion, resulting in over 65,000 residential buildings being damaged. After the Northridge Earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994, over 65,000 residential buildings were damaged, including more than 250,000 units of multifamily housing and almost 50,000 units of single-family housing. Congress passed the Northridge Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, providing nearly $900 million in appropriations for HUD programs. This included $200 million for Section 8 rental assistance, $25 million for repairing public housing, and $100 million for repairing privately-owned assisted housing. Additionally, $500 million was allocated to CDBG, with up to $75 million transferable to the HOME block grant program for communities impacted by the earthquake. The Northridge Earthquake led to significant damage to residential buildings, prompting Congress to pass the Northridge Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, providing nearly $900 million for HUD programs. The Secretary was granted authority to waive certain requirements for fund allocation, with exceptions for fair housing, nondiscrimination, environmental, and labor standards. Modifications were made to FHA programs to expand benefits for households affected by the earthquake. Thousands of families were displaced, with 88,000 people still unable to return home as of April 1994. The Northridge Earthquake caused significant damage to residential buildings, leading to the displacement of thousands of families. A housing task force was convened in Los Angeles to address the serious housing problem, providing emergency short-term vouchers to impacted families for shelter and replacement housing. City officials expressed concerns about the situation a year after the earthquake. City officials were concerned about families with temporary vouchers after the Northridge Earthquake. The vouchers were eventually made permanent by Congress and absorbed into the Housing Authority of Los Angeles County's mainstream program. A report by the HUD Inspector General noted an overlap in federal help, as families received vouchers without being screened for FEMA assistance. HUD responded that families may have used FEMA assistance for purposes other than rent. HUD introduced the HUD Earthquake Loan Program (HELP) using $100 million in Flexible Subsidy Funds to assist multifamily properties impacted by the earthquake. The program covered various expenses such as mortgage payments, tenant relocation, building repair, and retrofitting. However, a 1998 HUD Inspector General report found insufficient controls in place to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, with at least $7.1 million in questionable funds awarded. The HUD Earthquake Loan Program (HELP) used $100 million in Flexible Subsidy Funds to assist multifamily properties impacted by the earthquake. A 1998 HUD Inspector General report found $7.1 million in questionable funds awarded to 27 projects, leading to investigations for fund recovery. Funds were used for rental assistance, social services, and redevelopment, including repairs on units not eligible for SBA loans. HUD had updated property standards to include seismic safety before the earthquake, aiming for better-equipped units in the future. The 2004 hurricane season was one of the most active and destructive in recent memory, with four major hurricanes causing havoc in the southern United States. Hurricane Charley, a category 4 storm, hit southwest Florida causing $14 billion in damages and 10 deaths. Hurricane Frances, a category 2 storm, struck central western Florida leaving five dead and $9 billion in damages. Hurricane Ivan, a category 3 storm, made landfall on the gulf coast of Alabama and western Florida panhandle, resulting in 25 deaths and over $13 billion in damages. Hurricane Jeanne, another category 3 storm, also struck the region. In response to the 2004 hurricane season, President Bush requested nearly $14 billion in supplemental funding from Congress. Congress approved two funding measures totaling $13.6 billion, with $150 million designated for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) for disaster relief, long-term recovery, and mitigation in affected communities. The Secretary had discretion to allocate funds to states and entitlement communities, with the ability to waive or specify alternative requirements. The Secretary had the authority to waive certain requirements for the allocation of funds for disaster relief. Funds had to benefit low- and moderate-income families, with restrictions on their use for ongoing projects unless impacted by the disaster. States were required to provide a 10% match, and HUD had to coordinate with FEMA to ensure funds were used appropriately. Reporting to the Appropriations Committees was also mandated. HUD took steps to respond to the 2004 Florida hurricanes by identifying available housing, relocating displaced families, and issuing foreclosure moratoriums. Emergency CDBG funds were made available to impacted states, requiring a detailed plan for fund usage. During the recovery from the 2004 Florida hurricanes, HUD utilized SBA and FEMA data to address unmet housing, business, and public assistance needs. The funding allocation was weighted with 50% for housing, 25% for business, and 25% for public assistance. HUD also provided financial support for repairing public housing units, additional Section 8 voucher funding, repair of Section 202 and Section 811 properties, and relocation of HUD-assisted families. The hurricanes caused damage to over 700,000 homes in Florida. In response to the 2004 hurricanes in Florida, a hurricane housing task force was formed to advise on creating affordable housing. The task force recommended a one-time infusion of $354 million for new affordable housing programs. The state Department of Community Affairs submitted a plan to use emergency CDBG funds for repairs, recovery, and mitigation. The Department of Community Affairs' plan for hurricane recovery in Florida prioritizes infrastructure, public assistance, economic development, and housing projects. Funds will be directed to the 15 hardest hit communities for repairs and long-term recovery. Housing projects have the lowest priority due to expectations of state legislature funding for affordable housing. The Federal Government, through agencies like FEMA and HUD, plays a crucial role in addressing housing needs after disasters. While FEMA focuses on immediate housing assistance, HUD provides longer-term aid such as rental vouchers and new housing construction. The exact roles of each agency post-disaster are not entirely clear. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, HUD's role in responding to housing needs was not significant. Criticism of FEMA's response has led to calls for an expanded role for HUD in disaster recovery. The appropriate role for HUD post-disaster may be debated in Congress."
