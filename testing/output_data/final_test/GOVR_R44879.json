It has been revised multiple times, with the most recent amendment in 2018. The Act established the OJJDP, created grant programs for states, and set core mandates for grant eligibility. Despite amendments, these components remain central to the Act. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, revised multiple times, continues to feature three components. The Act authorizes federal grant programs for juvenile justice, with the OJJDP administering various programs. These programs, including those authorized by the JJDPA, receive appropriations and aim to develop more effective juvenile projects in states. The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385) authorizes OJJDP to make grants for juvenile delinquency programs. Funds are allocated based on each state's proportion of people under 18. States must adhere to core mandates to receive funding. This program has not received appropriations since FY2010. Grants are given to states, which then distribute them to local governments or nonprofits. The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385) authorizes OJJDP to make grants for delinquency prevention programs for juveniles at risk of or in contact with the justice system. Funding is allocated to states based on the number of individuals under 18. States then distribute funds to local governments or nonprofits. The JJDPA also allows grants to eligible Indian tribes for similar programs. Specific program areas are designated for funding, such as the Tribal Youth program or gang violence prevention. The Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-647) authorizes OJJDP to provide technical assistance, training, and administrative reforms. The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 authorizes OJJDP to fund delinquency prevention programs for juveniles. The program allocates funding to states based on the number of individuals under 18, which is then distributed to local governments or nonprofits. The Juvenile Mentoring Program, established under the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs Act, supports mentoring programs to reduce delinquent behavior and improve scholastic performance. The Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program was initially established by Congress. The Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) program was established by Congress and authorized through P.L. 107-273. Administered by OJJDP, it grants funding to states and local governments to strengthen juvenile justice systems. Funding for the program continued through FY2013, with appropriations made through the Juvenile Justice Programs account in the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. Total appropriations for juvenile justice programs fluctuated between FY2002 and FY2019, peaking at $565 million in FY2002 before falling to $348 million in FY2007. Funding increased by almost 22% from FY2007 to FY2010, reaching $424 million, with JJDPA programs receiving $331 million. However, funding began to decline again in FY2011 and continued through FY2017. Total funding for juvenile justice programs decreased by nearly 42% from FY2010 to FY2017, dropping from $424 million to $247 million. Congress eliminated funding for Challenge Grants in FY2011 and for the JABG program in FY2014. However, new funding was appropriated for programs such as missing and exploited children programs, child abuse training programs, and grants for youth violence prevention. Funding increased to nearly $283 million in FY2018, including funds for the Opioid Affected Youth Initiative. In FY2019, Congress appropriated $287 million for juvenile justice programs, the largest amount since FY2010.
