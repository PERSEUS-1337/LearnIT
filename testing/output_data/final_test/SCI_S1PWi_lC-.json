    "content": "In this work, multi-task learning is applied to image classification tasks on MNIST-like datasets, including NotMNIST and FashionMNIST. The datasets are combined to learn joint classification networks, which are then used to pre-train disjoint classification networks. The baseline recognition model is all-convolution neural networks. Without multi-task learning, recognition accuracies for MNIST, NotMNIST, and FashionMNIST are 99.56%, 97.22%, and 94.32% respectively. With multi-task learning, the accuracies improve to 99.70%, 97.46%, and 95.25% respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-task learning framework. The multi-task learning framework significantly improves recognition accuracies for MNIST, NotMNIST, and FashionMNIST to 99.70\\%, 97.46\\%, and 95.25\\% respectively. In multi-task learning, information from multiple datasets is pooled for various tasks like digit recognition, fashion item recognition, and letter recognition using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and NotMNIST datasets. Sharing information can occur at different levels in neural networks, such as input layer, hidden layers, or output layer. The implementation of multi-task learning systems depends on the specific data and tasks involved. The implementation of multi-task learning systems depends on the data and tasks at hand. Multi-task learning has been successfully applied to various machine learning applications, from natural language processing and speech recognition to computer vision and drug discovery. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, often used as a benchmark in machine learning. FashionMNIST, a dataset similar to MNIST, consists of images from Zalando's website and is also commonly used for testing new machine learning methods. FashionMNIST is a dataset with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each 28x28 grayscale with 10 classes. It is more challenging than MNIST. NotMNIST has over 500k images of English letters A-J, with a hand-cleaned subset and an uncleaned subset. Multi-task learning is applied to pre-train parameters for individual image recognition tasks using MNIST-like datasets. The overall framework for the neural network architecture is illustrated in FIG0, where convolution and pooling operations are described. The architecture includes an all-convolution neural network for single-task and multi-task learning classifiers. Each network is trained with 50 epochs using a two-stage learning rate decay scheme. The learning rate decreases during training with a decay rate of 1/(1+d*n), where d is the initial learning rate divided by 25 and n is the current epoch number. Multi-task learning is followed by initializing single-task classifiers with the network parameters and re-training them. Experimental results show the effectiveness of multi-task learning across different image datasets. The effectiveness of multi-task learning is demonstrated across different image datasets, with bi-task and tri-task learning systems outperforming single-task systems. Tri-task learning shows the best results, with significant error rate reductions for MNIST, FashionMNIST, and NotMNIST datasets. Multi-task learning enables the learning of universal and robust representations for various tasks, as shown by the t-SNE visualization of high-dimensional data. In this paper, multi-task learning is used to pre-train an all-convolution neural network model, improving image recognition accuracy on MNIST-like datasets. Using more data reduces the generalization gap, enhancing test set performance. Multi-task learning helps create robust common representations for classification tasks of digits, letters, and fashion items. Visualization of data manifolds with t-SNE demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-task learning. Visualization of data manifolds with t-SNE shows the impact of multi-task learning on creating robust common representations for classification tasks."
