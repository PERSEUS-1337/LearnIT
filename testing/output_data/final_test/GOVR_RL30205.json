    "content": "On October 6, conferees reached agreement on the FY2000 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 2561. The House and Senate approved the conference agreement, and the President signed the bill into law as P.L. 106-79 on October 25. The key issue was funding for the F-22 fighter, with $2.522 billion allocated for the program, slightly below the requested amount. The agreement also includes provisions for testing before low-rate production contracts can be awarded. The annual defense appropriations bill, along with the defense authorization bill, provides funding for national defense programs, including military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) such as pay, benefits, operation, maintenance, weapons procurement, and research and development. Congressional action on both measures is closely related, with major defense policy and funding issues debated mainly in the authorization bill. The defense appropriations bill funds national defense programs, including DOD's military activities like pay, benefits, maintenance, weapons procurement, and research. It also provides funding for other agencies and programs related to national defense. The FY2000 budget includes $280.8 billion for national defense, with $262.9 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. Congressional action on defense-related legislation began early in the year, with bills passed for military pay raises, missile defense policy, and other defense-related activities. The Senate and House approved bills on missile defense policy and a conference agreement on the annual congressional budget resolution. Both houses completed floor action on defense authorization and appropriations bills, which were signed into law by the President. Key legislation included military pay raises and improvements in benefits, as well as missile defense policy updates. On March 17, the Senate approved the \"Cochran-Inouye National Missile Defense Act of 1999\" by a vote of 97-3, calling for deployment of a nationwide missile defense system. On March 18, the House approved a bill declaring the policy to deploy a nationwide missile defense by a vote of 317-105. The Senate later substituted the text of the House bill with their own, which was approved by the House on May 20 by a vote of 345-17. The President signed the bill into law on July 22 as P.L. 106-38. Additionally, supplemental appropriations for FY1999 were approved by the Senate on March 23 and by the House on March 24, including funds for hurricane damage response and aid to Jordan. On May 6, the House approved H.R. 1664 for military operations in Yugoslavia. Senate and House conferees folded Kosovo-related funding into H.R. 1141, which was signed into law on May 21 as P.L. 106-31. H.R. 1141 includes funds for a military pay raise and defense readiness. The FY2000 concurrent budget resolution was approved on March 24. The Senate and House approved their versions of the FY2000 defense authorization bill and appropriations bill. A conference agreement was reached and signed into law on October 5 as P.L. 106-65. The House and Senate passed bill H.R. 2561, with final approval on October 14 as P.L. 106-79. Initial allocations for subcommittees were approved, with adjustments made to allocate more funds to non-defense appropriations bills. The House and Senate passed bill H.R. 2561, with final approval on October 14 as P.L. 106-79. Initial allocations for subcommittees were approved, with adjustments made to allocate more funds to non-defense appropriations bills. The defense subcommittee's budget authority and outlays were initially set at $265.193 billion and $253.104 billion, respectively, but were later reduced to $255.167 billion and $249.727 billion through reallocations and emergency appropriations. The Administration had requested $280.8 billion for national defense in FY2000, with the Department of Defense projecting modest growth in defense spending in the following years. The Administration proposed a significant increase in funding for defense programs, totaling $112 billion over the FY2000-2005 period. Congress approved a conference agreement providing $288.8 billion in budget authority for national defense, slightly lower than the Administration's request. The House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill fell short of the budget resolution level. The Senate-passed appropriations bill used $4.9 billion from the Kosovo supplemental appropriations bill for defense increases, totaling $264.7 billion, $1.4 billion above the request. The House bill provided $268.7 billion in new budget authority, $5.4 billion above the request and $4.0 billion above the Senate level. The appropriations conference agreement reported on October 8 provides $267.8 billion, $1 billion below the House level and $4.5 billion above the request. The appropriations conference agreement reported on October 8 provides $267.8 billion, $1 billion below the House level and $4.5 billion above the request. $7.2 billion is provided as emergency appropriations, with $2.6 billion offset by receipts from auctioning parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Other issues include military pay and benefits, nationwide missile defense deployment, military operations against Yugoslavia, and funding for Kosovo-related operations. The agenda included discussions on military base closures, peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and Haiti, and Theater Missile Defense programs. The House voted to end the U.S. peacekeeping mission in Haiti and the authorization conference agreement includes that provision. The authorization conference agreement rejects an Administration plan to combine future funding for high-altitude theater missile defense programs. Additional funds for major weapons programs are allocated, with most congressional additions for programs identified in unfunded priorities lists from each of the services. The Senate appropriations bill added funds for four F-15 aircraft, while the House Appropriations Committee rejected the Administration's request for F-22 fighter aircraft procurement. Congress addressed military readiness by increasing pay and benefits, adding funds for operation and maintenance accounts, and allocating additional funds for O&M through supplemental appropriations and authorization conference agreements. The FY2000 authorization conference agreement allocates $1.6 billion for O&M, but the appropriations conference agreement only adds $1.1 billion for O&M and then reduces the total by $1.5 billion to offset amounts in the Kosovo supplemental appropriations bill. There are concerns about whether increased pay, benefits, and O&M funds address underlying issues. The restructuring of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program with former Soviet Union states, changes in strategic nuclear force levels, and funding adjustments for chemical weapons demilitarization and nuclear weapons projects are also being considered. The authorization conference agreement includes a compromise that may allow reductions in Trident submarine deployment and establishes a new account to coordinate funding for terrorism and other emerging threats. Social issues like privately funded abortions for DOD personnel at U.S. military health facilities abroad were rejected. China policy and DOE security concerns were raised following a report on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with China. The House Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with China led to the establishment of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NSSA) within the Department of Energy (DOE) to oversee security. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson initially opposed this move but later accepted it when the President signed the bill into law, designating the DOE Secretary as the head of NSSA. Richardson has now promised to nominate a separate director for the organization. The Administration proposed a total of $280.8 billion for national defense in FY2000, with projected growth to $333.0 billion by FY2005. This represents a slow rate of growth, with a 3.6% increase in budget authority adjusted for inflation. The Administration's plan for defense spending includes a slow rate of growth, with a projected increase from $280.8 billion in FY2000 to $333.0 billion by FY2005. This marks an end to the decline in military funding since the mid-1980s, with a significant focus on weapons procurement which will climb from $49 billion in FY1999 to $75 billion in FY2005. Congressional concern over the long-term decline in funding for weapons acquisition has been addressed in the Administration's plan. The Administration's long-term plan for defense spending includes a $112 billion six-year increase, with $35 billion for military personnel pay and benefits, $49 billion for operation and maintenance, and $29 billion for weapons modernization and facilities. This addition covers all requested funding for personnel and readiness, addressing concerns over the decline in weapons procurement funding. The Administration's plan for defense spending includes funding for personnel and readiness, weapons acquisition, and facilities. The budget issue for FY2000 involves balancing defense expenditures within total discretionary spending limits. Increasing the defense budget will impact non-defense discretionary spending, but the Administration aims to increase both while staying within budget limits. The Administration's plan for defense spending includes funding for personnel, readiness, weapons acquisition, and facilities. They propose exceeding budget limits by utilizing savings in mandatory programs and increased revenues as offsets. Questions have been raised about the proposed financing measures, including inflation savings. The Administration's defense spending plan includes funding for personnel, readiness, weapons acquisition, and facilities. Questions have been raised about the proposed financing measures, including inflation savings and split funding for military construction projects in FY2000. The Administration requested $5.4 billion in appropriations for defense projects, with $3.1 billion as advance appropriations for FY2001. Split funding for FY2000 projects was a one-time measure to work around budget caps. $1.65 billion in rescissions of prior year funds was proposed to offset the FY2000 total, a relatively large amount compared to usual practices. The Clinton Administration preferred negotiating rescissions with congressional committees instead of proposing cuts that could upset legislators. Congress debated defense spending levels and criticized the Administration's accounting methods for increasing defense spending within discretionary spending caps. The Clinton Administration negotiated rescissions with congressional committees instead of proposing cuts that could upset legislators. Congress debated defense spending levels and criticized the Administration's accounting methods for increasing spending within discretionary caps. Congress rejected an increase in discretionary caps and dismissed offsets proposed by the Administration. A debate ensued about using emergency supplemental appropriations for Kosovo to boost defense funding. The process involved funds being added, eroded, and then restored in the final appropriations, with steps taken to reduce projected outlays in FY2000 to meet spending targets. The congressional budget projected significantly higher defense spending than the Administration's request for FY2000-2004, with a mismatch between budget authority and outlays. Congressional defense committees did not agree to the proposed split funding. The congressional defense committees did not agree to the proposed split funding for military construction, and most of the rescissions in the final appropriations bill were of amounts earlier provided in the Kosovo supplemental. Approximately $3.1 billion of the $8 billion increase in defense funding was used to restore funds that Congress had rejected. Congress found ways to add money to defense despite the FY2000 discretionary budget. Congress found ways to add money to defense in spite of FY2000 discretionary spending caps. This was achieved through the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for Kosovo, H.R. 1141, and using projected revenues from auctioning parts of the electromagnetic spectrum as an offset for defense increases. The Kosovo funding bill provided $14.9 billion in supplemental appropriations, with $11 billion allocated to the Department of Defense. This included funds for Central America disaster assistance, disaster repairs at U.S. facilities, increased pay and benefits, military readiness-related accounts, and munitions purchases. The added funds in H.R. 1141 helped to ease the apparent mismatch between budget authority and outlays in the budget resolution. The defense appropriations bill included assumed revenues from electromagnetic spectrum sales as a defense offset. Some of the extra $5 billion for defense in the Kosovo bill was used as an offset to defense funding increases in the FY2000 appropriations process. The Senate and House used funds from the Kosovo bill as offsets for defense spending increases in FY2000, allowing for more money to be allocated to non-defense discretionary programs. The House reduced funds allocated to the defense subcommittee, with part of the difference made up by anticipated receipts from radio spectrum sales. The final conference agreement provided $267.8 billion for defense appropriations, $1 billion less than the House and $4.4 billion more than the Administration requested. Congress took steps to limit estimated total defense outlays in FY2000, including reducing estimated outlays by about $10.5 billion and declaring $7.2 billion of budget authority. The final conference agreement for defense appropriations provided $267.8 billion, $1 billion less than the House and $4.4 billion more than the Administration requested. Steps were taken to limit estimated total defense outlays in FY2000, including reducing outlays by about $10.5 billion and declaring $7.2 billion of budget authority as emergency appropriations. Additionally, DOD was required to delay progress payments to contractors, reducing FY2000 outlays by an estimated $1.2 billion. Revenues of $2.6 billion from radio-frequency spectrum sales and $1.838 billion in emergency appropriations for pay and benefits in the Kosovo supplemental were also included. The Administration proposed a pay and benefit improvement package for military personnel costing about $35 billion over six years, including pay raises and \"pay table\" reform. The proposed pay and benefit increases aimed to improve recruitment and retention of military personnel by implementing reforms such as rewarding promotions more than longevity, repealing the \"Redux\" retirement plan, and providing targeted pay and bonus increases for specific skills. The estimated cost of these initiatives over six years was $35 billion, with an additional $10 billion needed for comparable pay raises for DOD civilian personnel. The goal was to address recruiting shortfalls and retention goals in the Army and Navy. Military pay raises have been below the Employment Cost Index since 1982, resulting in a 13% pay gap. The Administration's proposed pay raises are slightly above the ECI. The Senate passed a bill for a 4.8% pay raise in FY2000. The Administration proposes a 4.8% pay raise in FY2000, allows personnel to choose a $30,000 bonus instead of shifting out of the Redux retirement plan, provides a subsistence allowance of $180 per month to eligible personnel, makes uniformed personnel eligible for the Thrift Savings Plan, and increases Montgomery G.I. Bill educational benefits. The Senate passed a bill for these improvements, costing about $9 billion more over the FY2000-2005 period than the Administration plan. The House did not act on a military pay and benefits bill separately, incorporating them into the FY2000 defense authorization bill instead. The House and Senate versions of the defense authorization bill included larger pay and benefits increases than the Administration requested. The Senate approved an amendment to expand GI Bill benefits. The House approved providing Thrift Savings Plan benefits to uniformed personnel. The conference agreement on the authorization bill reflects a compromise between the House and the Senate, providing higher pay raises in the future but not expanding GI Bill benefits or increasing subsistence allowance. Pay and benefits increases are legislative matters considered in the defense authorization bill, not in appropriations measures. The Kosovosupplemental appropriations bill provided $1.838 billion for FY2000 pay and benefits increases, covering the costs of a 4.4% pay raise, pay table reform, and retirement reform. The conference agreement on the FY2000 defense appropriations bill provided funding for congressional pay and benefits packages. The Administration's long-term defense plan included initiatives on missile defense policy, such as funding for a national missile defense system and restructuring the Medium Extended Air Defense System. Defense Secretary Cohen acknowledged the threat of long-range missile attacks on U.S. territory. Defense Secretary Cohen acknowledged the imminent threat of long-range missile attacks on U.S. territory, citing North Korea's multistage missile test as evidence. The Administration's change in threat assessment led to support for deploying a nationwide missile defense system as soon as possible, reflected in the decision not to oppose a bill sponsored by Senators Cochran and Inouye. The Senate and House passed bills supporting the deployment of a nationwide missile defense system. The Administration no longer opposes these measures but maintains its policy to decide on deployment by mid-2000. The Administration is considering deploying a nationwide missile defense system, with deployment likely to begin in 2005 at the earliest. There is debate over the importance of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, with some officials advocating for changes to allow deployment. Some members of Congress support a sea-based defense system, but defense officials cite cost concerns. The Senate-passed authorization bill for FY2000 defense funding focused on Theater Missile Defense programs, rejecting the Administration's plan to combine Navy Theater Wide and THAAD programs. The authorization conference agreement also included funds for Patriot PAC-3 procurement and R&D, as well as Space-Based Infrared System-High (SBIRS-High). The authorization conference agreement adds funds for SBIRS-High but does not end Air Force management. The appropriations conference agreement provides the same amount for SBIRS but moves SBIRS-Low funding from the Demonstration and Validation account to Engineering and Manufacturing Development. The Senate authorization also mandated specific tests of the Airborne Laser system. The key issue in the appropriations conference concerned funding for the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), a cooperative program with European allies. The House-passed appropriations bill eliminated MEADS funding, but the appropriations conference agreement restores funds. Both the House and the Senate approved a bill providing supplemental appropriations for military operations against Yugoslavia. DOD officials estimate that costs of U.S. participation in the peacekeeping mission will total $2.042 billion. The estimated cost of U.S. participation in the peacekeeping mission in FY2000 is $2.042 billion. Some costs can be covered by leftover funding from other operations, leaving $1.78 billion to be financed by supplemental appropriations. Authorization and appropriations action for operations against Yugoslavia was a major issue in House action on the FY2000 defense authorization bill. The HASC version of the bill included a provision to prohibit funds for operations in Yugoslavia, leading to extensive debate and potential floor amendments. The White House threatened to veto a bill provision related to Kosovo funding, leading to its removal by the House Rules Committee. Despite opposition, the provision was later reinstated in a revised rule. An amendment to remove the provision was approved by the House after the White House agreed to seek additional funding for peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. In May 1999, the Senate had key votes on amendments related to funding for operations in Yugoslavia, including one to direct the President to seek approval from Congress before introducing ground troops in Kosovo. Another vote was to cut off funding for operations unless authorized by Congress. Ultimately, Congress did not impose restrictions on the Administration. The authorization bill allows continued spending without restrictions on Administration policy in Kosovo. The House approved an amendment prohibiting U.S. forces' continuous deployment in Haiti after December 31, 1999. The Defense Department urged Congress to approve two more rounds of military base closures in 2001 and 2005. The defense infrastructure funding for major weapons programs depends on improving efficiency. Congress has rejected additional base closure rounds due to concerns about politicization in the past. The authorization bill did not approve additional base closures. The House Appropriations Committee version of the defense appropriations bill eliminated $1.9 billion for six F-22 fighter aircraft procurement, citing technical problems, affordability concerns, and alternative options like upgrading current generation F-15s. Instead, they proposed increased funding for Air Force personnel recruitment, retention, and aircraft spare parts. Increased funding for Air Force personnel recruitment, aircraft spare parts, upgrades of aircraft programs, and procurement of F-15E, F-16s, and KC-130-J cargo aircraft for the Marine Corps. Subcommittee leaders hope the F-22 decision will spark a discussion on Air Force priorities. The Air Force defended the F-22, stating that delaying procurement would increase costs by $6 billion. Rep. Kingston withdrew an amendment to restore F-22 procurement funds in the House Appropriations Committee markup. The House debated F-22 procurement funds, with Rep. Barr offering and withdrawing an amendment. The military service chiefs prepared a list of unfunded priority programs totaling $8.7 billion for FY2000 and $45 billion over FY2000-2005. Congress has used similar lists to guide additional allocations to the defense budget. The defense appropriations bill for FY2000 includes $3.9 billion for weapons procurement and R&D, with allocations for the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The F-22 program receives $2.522 billion, with $1 billion for aircraft acquisition. The total amount provided for the F-22 is below the request, and an initial low-rate production contract is prohibited. The conference agreement prohibits awarding an initial low-rate production contract unless certain testing is completed. Defense bills added funds for weapons procurement and R&D, including for C-130J aircraft and LHD amphibious ship procurement. Congressional additions are for items on service priority lists or future acquisition plans. Marine Corps and Senate added funds for KC-130Js, while House added funds for 4 KC-130Js. The House authorization and appropriations bills added funds for KC-130Js and EC-130Js, with the conference agreement providing funds for 4 KC-130Js. The Senate and House differed on funding for a new LHD class amphibious ship, with the conference agreement settling on $375 million. This ship, LHD-8, is part of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan for purchase in FY2005. The curr_chunk discusses additional funds for various aircraft procurement, including UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, V-22 tilt rotor aircraft, and E-8 JSTARS radar aircraft. There is a debate over funding for F-15 aircraft procurement, with the Senate approving funds for 4 F-15Es and the House providing funds for 8 F-15s. Boeing's production line in St. Louis is at risk of shutting down without additional funding. Boeing may shut down production in St. Louis without more orders for aircraft. Senator Feingold's amendments on the F/A-18 E/F program were debated, with one approved and one rejected. Additional funds were allocated for precision-guided munitions like Tomahawk missiles and JDAMs. The authorization conference approved funding for JDAM procurement and rejected resuming Tomahawk production. They also added $50 million for JDAMs but none for JSOW. Funding for rebuilding munitions stocks was provided in the Kosovo supplemental appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee refused to approve new multi-year procurement contracts for major weapons programs. The House Appropriations Committee rejected new multi-year procurement contracts for major weapons programs due to unsettled funding plans. Despite Defense Department protests, most requested programs were approved with restrictions on the M-1A2 tank upgrade program. Concerns over military readiness have driven support for increased defense spending, with acknowledged issues in recruiting, retaining personnel, spare parts, and equipment shortages. The Kosovo supplemental bill (H.R. 1141) included unrequested funding for pay, benefits, and military readiness to support troops and bolster readiness accounts. Both the HASC and SASC added funds for operation and maintenance accounts, with the conference agreement adding about $1.6 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee also took action on readiness-related budget accounts. The conference agreement adds $1.6 billion in funding for operation and maintenance accounts, with $1.1 billion more allocated than requested. There is ongoing debate about whether increased pay and benefits will address recruitment and retention issues, as well as concerns about readiness and operational tempo. Neither the House nor the Senate has systematically addressed the factors contributing to high operational tempo. The Administration requested $475.5 million for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, which assists states of the former Soviet Union in safeguarding nuclear materials and dismantling weapons. There have been disputes about the program's size, funding pace, and specific projects. The House has been more critical of the program than the Senate. SASC approved the Administration's CTR request without change but reduced funds for two related programs in the Department of Energy. HASC also decreased CTR funding for chemical weapons demilitarization assistance significantly, citing a GAO evaluation recommending support for Russian stockpile security instead of destroying weapons stocks. HASC proposed making various restrictions on the program permanent. The House Appropriations Committee (HAC) proposed adding $12 million for biological weapons proliferation prevention to the use of funds for peacekeeping, housing, environmental restoration, defense conversion, or job retraining. The appropriations conference agreement provides $460.5 million for Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR), $15 million below the request and the authorization, with restrictions on the program being made permanent. Congress has included a prohibition on reducing strategic nuclear delivery systems below START I treaty levels until Russia ratifies the START II agreement in defense authorization bills since FY1996. The Navy has requested permission to reduce Trident ballistic missile submarines from 18 to 14 to avoid costly refueling overhauls. The Senate rejected a proposal to repeal restrictions on strategic force reductions, while the House bill allows for flexibility in reducing total force levels pending START II approval. The President is allowed flexibility to reduce total force levels, with a requirement to maintain at least 98% of the 6,000 warheads allowed by START I. The authorization agreement includes an amendment to allow for the reduction of Trident submarine levels with certain certifications. The Senate Armed Services Committee has established a new budget account for \"combating terrorism\" to consolidate funding for counter-terrorism programs. The Senate Armed Services Committee established a budget account to consolidate funding for counter-terrorism programs, providing $1.954 billion for the account. The House Appropriations Committee added $50 million for counter-terrorism programs. Social issues like abortion and gender integrated training have been debated in defense funding bills. HASC approved a measure allowing abortions at military hospitals. HASC approved a measure to permit abortions at military hospitals for women who are victims of rape or incest, with a requirement for women to have previously filed sexual abuse charges. The Senate and House rejected amendments to repeal the current law prohibiting U.S. military healthcare facilities overseas from providing abortions for U.S. military personnel at private expense. The existing prohibition on abortions remains intact in the authorization conference agreement. The House Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns, chaired by Rep. Cox, recommended measures to tighten restrictions on technology exports to China. The HASC bill included limits on military-to-military contacts with China and established a Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs at the National Defense University. The SASC bill included measures to tighten security at Department of Energy labs. Several significant amendments were proposed to the authorization bills in both the House and the Senate. Amendments were proposed in both the House and Senate following the Cox committee report. The Senate approved a Lott amendment for increased monitoring of satellite technology exports and annual reports on Chinese military capabilities. The House added amendments codifying recent security initiatives and limiting U.S.-China military contacts. Rep. Spence did not propose transferring responsibility for nuclear weapons programs from the Department of Energy. The Senate approved an amendment to establish an independent organization within the Department of Energy to oversee security. The House rejected a motion to remove this provision, and Secretary of Energy Richardson withdrew his objections, allowing the President to sign the bill into law. The President signed the bill into law and designated the Secretary of Energy to head the new agency. Secretary Richardson promised to nominate a separate director for the NSSA. The authorization conference agreement includes measures limiting military contacts with China and imposing restrictions on technology transfers. H.Con.Res. 68 and S.Con.Res. 20 establish the congressional budget for fiscal years 2000-2009. The House approved S.Con.Res. 20, a resolution setting the congressional budget for fiscal years 2000-2009. H.R. 4, a bill on national missile defense, was approved by the House and Senate, signed into law as P.L. 106-38. S. 257, the Cochran-Inouye National Missile Defense Act of 1999, was also passed. The Cochran-Inouye National Missile Defense Act of 1999 was approved by the Senate with amendments on March 17, 1999. H.R. 1141, a bill for emergency supplemental appropriations, was approved by the House and Senate. The Senate agreed to the conference report on May 18, 1999. The bill S. 544 (Stevens) making emergency supplemental appropriations for recovery from natural disasters and foreign assistance was signed into law as P.L. 106-31 on May 21, 1999. Reported by the Committee on Appropriations, it was considered and approved by the Senate on March 23, 1999. Additionally, H.R. 1664 (Young, C.W. Bill) made emergency supplemental appropriations for military operations and humanitarian assistance, was also passed for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999. H.R. 1401 (Spence) and S. 1059 (Warner) authorize appropriations for military activities, construction, and defense activities for fiscal year 2000. H.R. 1401 was reported by the House Armed Services Committee, while S. 1059 was reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate approved the bill S. 1122 (Stevens) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, with amendments on June 8, 1999. The bill was signed into law by the President on October 5, 1999. The House and Senate passed a joint resolution (H.J.Res. 68) for continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 2000. The resolution was signed into law by the President on October 25, 1999, after being considered and approved by both chambers. The House and Senate passed a joint resolution (H.J.Res. 68) for continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 2000, signed into law by the President on October 25, 1999.
