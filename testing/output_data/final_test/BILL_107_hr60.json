    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Secure Democracy for All Americans Act\". Congress acknowledges the need for uniformity in voting procedures for Federal elections, as there is still significant variation among states. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 aimed to standardize voter registration to prevent fraud and maintain accurate voter lists. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act allows absentee voting for military and overseas voters in Federal elections, even if a state does not provide an official ballot. In some states, individuals can vote without registering, while others allow same-day voter registration. The residency requirement for voter registration varies from 1 to 30 days across states. Disability or illness may not be sufficient grounds for absentee voting in certain states. Some states permit any citizen outside the US or the state to register as an absentee voter. Multiple types of voting equipment are used in at least 7 states. At least 7 types of voting equipment are used in Presidential elections across the US, determined at the county level. Polling places open between 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and close from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. The Commission on the Comprehensive Study of Voting Procedures is established to examine voting procedures. The Commission will conduct a study on voting procedures in Federal, State, and local elections, including best practices, legislation, standardized procedures, and vote count timeliness. The Commission will develop recommendations on the accuracy and security of vote counts in Federal, State, and local elections. Within 180 days after the study, a report with findings, conclusions, and legislative recommendations will be submitted to the President and Congress. The Commission may submit interim reports to the President and Congress if approved by a majority of members. They can also include dissenting or minority opinions in any reports submitted. SEC. 5.
