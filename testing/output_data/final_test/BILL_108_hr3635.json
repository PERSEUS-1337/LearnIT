Congress finds that in 2003, over 300,000 Americans had end-stage renal disease, which is expected to exceed 600,000 by 2010. Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are likely to need treatment within 6-18 months. Medical treatment and counseling during this period can significantly reduce morbidity. Treatment for end-stage renal disease has been found to decrease morbidity and mortality rates significantly and slow down the progression from advanced kidney disease. SEC. 3. DELAYING ONSET OF AND DECREASING MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RATES FOR END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE. Medicare coverage for chronic kidney disease patients is expanded under Section 226A of the Social Security Act. Qualified patients are entitled to benefits under part A and eligible for part B enrollment, but not part C. Qualified chronic kidney disease patients are individuals diagnosed with advanced chronic kidney disease who may benefit from pre-ESRD services and are likely to need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 18 months. The text discusses the definition of advanced chronic kidney disease and the coverage of pre-ESRD services for qualified chronic kidney disease patients. Amendments to the Social Security Act are outlined, with an effective date set for six months after enactment.
