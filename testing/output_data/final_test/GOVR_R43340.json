    "content": "Under current law, renewable electricity projects starting before January 1, 2014, can receive PTCs for the first 10 years. Projects after this date are not eligible for PTCs. There are proposals to eliminate or make the PTC permanent, with options to phase it out over time. Congress is considering various alternatives for phasing out PTC incentives as the deadline approaches. The report discusses the phase-out option for renewable electricity generation tax credits (PTC), focusing on wind power projects due to the sector's significant use of PTCs. Congressional action would be needed to extend the incentive during the phase-out period. The report provides an overview of different policy options for phasing out PTC incentives for the wind power industry, including four phase-out concepts and an alternative approach based on market variables. The phase-out approaches examined are: (1) phase-out under current law, (2) straight line phase-out over five years, (3) AWEA phase-out concept, and (4) a market-linked phase-out policy option. The analysis in the Appendix considers multiple energy and financial market variables that can impact the economic competitiveness of wind power projects. The curr_chunk discusses the examination of a market-linked phase-out policy option for reducing and eliminating PTC incentives gradually over time. It also covers policy design options, preliminary analysis, and limitations of this approach. The quantitative comparison and analysis results of different policy options are detailed, showing how the PTC might phase out under each approach. Various PTC phase-out alternatives for renewable electricity are available, each with unique complexities and certainties. The report compares different phase-out alternatives for renewable electricity generation incentives in the U.S. tax code. It highlights the complexity of incentivizing various energy sources and discusses the history of energy tax incentives. The focus is on production tax credits and potential options for eliminating, extending, or phasing them out. The discussion focuses on wind power generation and the production tax credits (PTC) incentives provided for wind projects. By the end of 2012, the U.S. had installed approximately 60,007 Megawatts (MW) of wind power capacity, making it the second-largest wind market globally. The PTC incentive offers a tax credit for each kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by a wind project during its first 10 years of operation. The PTC incentive for wind projects, established in 1992, is currently valued at 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. It has played a critical role in the growth of the U.S. wind industry, with project installations increasing as the expiration date approaches and declining afterward. Wind project development typically ramps back up following an extension of the PTC incentive availability, leading to record years like 2012 with over 13,000 MW of new capacity added. In 2012, over 13,000 MW of new wind power capacity was added, driven by developers accelerating projects before the PTC expiration. The PTC was extended in 2013, but factors like project timelines and low demand are expected to reduce installations. The impact of permanently eliminating the PTC on wind power deployment remains uncertain. The future of wind power development post-PTC expiration is uncertain, with varying forecasts on capacity installations. Phasing out the PTC gradually has been proposed in Congress to allow the industry to adapt to reduced incentives. The report discusses policy options for the future of the PTC incentive for wind projects, including elimination, permanent extension, and phase-out approaches to gradually reduce the incentive over time. Congress may debate the future of wind PTC incentives as the 2013 expiration date approaches. The report discusses different policy options for the future of the PTC incentive for wind projects, including four phase-out concepts. New large wind power projects starting construction after January 1, 2014, will not be eligible for PTC incentives, leading to a forecasted decline in new project development without the incentive. The future of wind power projects post-PTC incentive is uncertain, with factors like natural gas prices, project location, and technology performance playing a role. Proponents argue that the industry should compete without federal incentives, as large amounts of wind power distort competitive markets. Calls to end the PTC incentive have been made by Members of the House of Representatives and various organizations in November 2013. In November 2013, various organizations and groups expressed differing views on the wind production tax credit (PTC). Some called for the PTC to be ended, while others advocated for a multi-year extension or making it permanent. The President's FY2014 budget proposed making the PTC permanent and refundable, with an estimated cost of $17.4 billion over 10 years. Proponents of extending the PTC argue that its temporary nature creates investment uncertainty in the energy sector. Proponents argue for federal financial incentives to support renewable electricity generation due to emission reductions and environmental benefits. One potential policy alternative is to phase out the wind production tax credit (PTC) gradually to incentivize the industry to compete without federal support. Various phase-out concepts are examined for the PTC. The wind production tax credit (PTC) may be phased out gradually based on the reference price for wind power exceeding a threshold value. If the reference price exceeds the threshold by more than 3 cents, the PTC incentive for that year would be zero. If it exceeds by less than 3 cents, the PTC is reduced proportionally. In 2012, the wind PTC value was not adjusted as the reference price was below the threshold value. Wind electricity contract prices have been decreasing due to lower equipment costs and improved turbine performance. The PTC value is reduced proportionally if the reference price exceeds the threshold by less than 3 cents. The PTC value may not be adjusted downward due to inflation, and a proposed phase-out approach suggests reducing the PTC level by 20% each year for five years. This approach provides predictability for the wind industry stakeholders to plan their activities accordingly. The straight line phase-out approach for the PTC does not consider energy and financial market dynamics, potentially impacting wind power's economic competitiveness. AWEA proposed a PTC phase-out concept in a letter to Congress, suggesting a gradual reduction in PTC value over time. This concept has been proposed in the 113th Congress through H.R. 2081 and H.R. 2987. The AWEA proposed a PTC phase-out concept in a letter to Congress, suggesting a gradual reduction in PTC value over time. The analysis indicated that a phased reduction starting at 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for projects in 2013, followed by decreasing percentages for projects in subsequent years, would sustain a minimally viable industry. Table 3 outlines the phased elimination of the PTC under this concept. The AWEA proposed a gradual reduction in PTC value over time to sustain the wind power industry. Congress is considering market-linked phase-out alternatives for PTC incentives. This approach could provide certainty but may lead to a \"hard landing\" in 2019 if wind power struggles to compete economically. The report discusses phasing out PTC incentives by linking PTC values to market variables. An Appendix provides a hypothetical market-linked approach for wind electricity competitiveness, considering energy and financial market parameters. This approach sets an annual PTC value to make wind projects economically competitive with natural gas power generation. The report examines a market-linked policy option to set the Production Tax Credit (PTC) at a level that makes wind power projects financially competitive with natural gas generation. It uses Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) to compare wind and natural gas generation and assumes annual cost reductions of 5% or 10% for wind projects to incentivize cost reduction and improve performance. The market-linked approach to phasing out the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind power projects aims for 10% annual cost reductions. Uncertainty exists regarding whether wind capital costs can achieve this reduction. The policy includes a provision to end the PTC incentive once Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) price parity is reached. Preliminary analysis suggests the PTC could phase out between 2017 and 2019, but actual timelines depend on market conditions. The market-linked approach is dynamic and faces challenges and limitations. The market-linked policy option for phasing out the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind power projects faces challenges such as complex implementation, issues with comparing wind and NGCC power generation economics, regional variations, and industry cost reductions. Despite limitations, it is a potential policy option worth exploring. Other countries use different incentive types like feed-in tariffs to encourage renewable power development, offering perspective for a market-linked PTC phase-out approach. Germany and Japan offer examples of market-linked approaches to phase out incentives for renewable power projects. Germany uses an active degression approach to adjust feed-in tariff incentives periodically based on market activity and new installations. Japan reviews and adjusts FIT rates for renewable power based on market conditions. Japan periodically reviews and adjusts FIT rates for renewable energy projects based on market conditions, including capital and operation costs. Congress may consider a phased-out extension of the PTC to account for changing market dynamics impacting renewable electricity competitiveness, such as wind resource variations and market structures. The complex calculations required to estimate the value of the PTC incentive for wind power generation are influenced by power prices, resource mix variations, and financial market conditions. CRS has analyzed a hypothetical market-linked phase-out policy option to illustrate one possible alternative for phasing out the PTC incentive, but this approach has limitations and challenges. The hypothetical market-linked phase-out approach aims to reduce and eventually eliminate PTC incentives for wind power projects over time. Policymakers could use policy pressure to encourage cost reduction in wind project electricity generation. Once the PTC is eliminated, wind projects would compete based on the levelized cost of electricity compared to natural gas power plants. The design elements of a market-linked PTC phase-out policy could include using the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for natural gas power plants as a benchmark for calculating the PTC value for wind projects. This approach aims to reduce PTC incentives for wind projects over time, encouraging cost reduction in wind electricity generation to compete with natural gas power plants. The market-linked phase-out approach for PTC values involves annual calculations based on changes in energy and financial markets. This includes factors like debt costs, equity costs, leverage ratios, loan terms, and natural gas prices. The PTC values are calculated annually to ensure wind projects remain economically competitive with NGCC power plants. The PTC value is calculated annually based on changes in financial and energy markets to compare wind and NGCC LCOEs. Policy pressure for wind cost reduction could involve declining capital cost assumptions. Annual calculations may assume wind project capital costs decrease each year. The analysis includes two cases: a 10% annual capital cost reduction and a 5% reduction. This may incentivize the wind industry to improve cost and performance. The PTC value could be capped at 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour and phased out once price parity with NGCC generation is reached. The goal is to eventually eliminate federal PTC incentives. The market-linked phase-out policy option aims to reduce and eliminate federal PTC incentives for wind power projects by capping the PTC value at 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Once wind and NGCC LCOEs reach parity, the PTC incentive may cease to exist. Methodology and assumptions play a crucial role in calculating annual PTC values for any phase-out policy approach. The analysis for a market-linked PTC phase-out approach involves calculating NGCC and wind power LCOE estimates, as well as determining the value of the PTC over a 10-year period. Different methodologies, models, and assumptions can lead to varying outcomes in implementing a phase-out policy design. The LCOE estimates for a new-build NGCC power plant were provided by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), using a methodology that calculates the electricity price needed to provide investors a 10% rate of return. BNEF's model considers key input variables to estimate NGCC LCOEs for plants expected to come online between 2013 and 2019. Key assumptions used by BNEF are listed in Table A-1. The LCOE for an NGCC power plant is determined by key assumptions and the price of natural gas used for electricity generation. BNEF relies on EIA's natural gas price forecasts to calculate LCOE. Wind power LCOE estimates are calculated by CRS to determine the electricity price needed for a 10% rate of return, excluding any tax credits or incentives. The wind LCOE estimates are calculated without subsidies and compared directly with NGCC LCOEs to assess economic competitiveness. Assumptions for key input variables are used, including annual declines in total installed costs. These assumptions show sensitivity in the analysis, but are based on illustrative purposes only. The U.S. Department of Energy reports a 20-35% decline in wind turbine costs since 2008, with an average annual decline of 4-8%. Total installed costs for wind projects decreased by 10% from 2011 to 2012. The industry aims for 5-10% annual capital cost reductions to compete with NGCC power generation. The feasibility of achieving these reductions is uncertain. Estimating the value of the PTC incentive for wind projects involves calculating the present value of PTCs over 10 years, with a key assumption being partnership with tax equity investors. The discount rate used for this analysis is 8.5%, but some investors may require yields between 13% and 16%. The value of the PTC incentive for wind projects is dependent on tax equity yield assumptions, with some investors requiring yields between 13% and 16%. Preliminary quantitative analysis was performed by CRS for illustrative purposes, showing how a phase-out policy option could be implemented. The analysis results are highly dependent on methodology and assumptions used. The PTC value necessary for wind power projects to be economically competitive with NGCC power plants was estimated using a specific framework and approach. The PTC value was calculated to make wind power economically competitive with NGCC plants. Analysis shows NGCC LCOEs increasing and wind power LCOEs decreasing from 2013 to 2019. Assumptions and methodology influence LCOE estimates. Based on a preliminary analysis, wind power projects may not need PTC incentives to be economically competitive in 2017 and 2019 with a 10% and 5% annual capital cost reduction, respectively. The PTC phase-out could happen faster with a 10% cost reduction scenario, potentially eliminating the incentive by 2017. The PTC phase-out might occur more gradually, potentially ending in 2019 instead of 2017 as in the 10% cost reduction scenario. Actual values and market dynamics would influence the PTC level for new wind projects annually. Despite considering various market variables, there are limitations and challenges associated with this approach. The market-linked PTC phase-out policy requires complex financial and market analysis for implementation. Establishing a framework for calculating PTC values annually is a major challenge. The federal government would need to publish PTC values for industry planning. The Department of Treasury and Department of Energy could play a role in this process. The market-linked PTC phase-out policy requires complex financial and market analysis for implementation. Ensuring objectivity, fairness, and unbiasedness is crucial. The illustrative policy design does not consider other state or federal incentives available to wind power projects, which could complicate implementation. LCOE comparison metric may not capture the relative value of electricity produced during certain seasons and times of day. The LCOE comparison metric may not reflect the value of electricity produced at different times of day, impacting investment decisions. Wind generation is highest at night when electricity value is low, while NGCC power plants can capture high-priced peak power values. Comparing LCOEs for new wind and natural gas projects may not consider all relevant factors. The regional variations in renewable resources and electricity markets in the U.S. may not be adequately reflected in comparing LCOEs for new wind and natural gas projects. Wind resource quality varies across the country, with the best resources in the middle portion. Different electricity markets have varying structures, rules, and energy mixes, which may not be stimulated by a fixed PTC level. The current PTC incentive does not account for these regional differences in the wind industry. The current PTC incentive does not consider regional variations in the wind industry. It assumes annual cost reductions to incentivize the wind industry, but the feasibility of these reductions is uncertain. The phase-out policy design only considers one business model for wind power projects, while in reality, there are multiple financial structures and models available. Several phase-out design options are available for reducing and eventually eliminating PTC incentives for renewable electricity. These options include indexing the credit value to fuel prices, wholesale electricity prices, or other comparative metrics. The goal is to find a business model that maximizes financial returns and is workable for all parties involved in the project."
