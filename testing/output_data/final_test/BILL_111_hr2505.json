    "content": "The Act titled \"Reaching Rural Veterans through Telehealth Act\" emphasizes the importance of using telehealth platforms to treat veterans in rural areas with PTSD or traumatic brain injury. The Act emphasizes the need for better access to treatment for veterans in rural areas with PTSD or traumatic brain injury through a tele-health pilot project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish three pilot projects using tele-health platforms to provide treatment, education, and evaluation for veterans in rural areas with PTSD or traumatic brain injury. The projects will collaborate with State behavioral health systems and other entities to support veterans and their families. Tele-health platform is defined as using electronic information and telecommunications technologies for long-distance clinical health care. The pilot projects aim to educate primary care providers on diagnosing and managing clients with PTSD or traumatic brain injury using standardized tools. Treatment efforts will be comprehensive and accessible to veterans 24/7. Provider participation will be multi-disciplinary. Grant requirements will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will select grant recipients based on geographical diversity, reaching veterans not currently receiving treatment for PTSD or traumatic brain injury, and creating programs in designated Veteran Integrated Service Networks. Grant funds can be used for training practitioners to treat veterans with PTSD or traumatic brain injury, including teaching primary care providers to diagnose and manage patients with PTSD. Grant funds can be used for testing clinical modalities for specific populations like veterans, purchasing tele-health equipment, and partnering with local community groups for project organization. Grant funds can be used for providing various social services in rural areas and for stipends to clinicians involved in a pilot project. Reporting requirements for grant recipients include results of the pilot project, number of veterans treated, client progress, service coordination, client demographics, and outcomes shared with government agencies."
