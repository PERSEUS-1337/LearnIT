    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Quality Health Care Coalition Act of 2005\". Congress finds that there is a high percentage of Americans enrolled in managed health care plans through their employers, with concerns about the quality of care. The concentration of health care plans due to mergers has given them significant leverage over providers and patients, infringing on health care professionals' rights. Repealing Federal laws prohibiting medical professionals from collective negotiation with health care plans will balance power, promote cooperation, and improve patient care without affecting professionals' ethical duty to provide necessary care. The Federal antitrust laws will now apply to health care professionals negotiating with health plans. Health care professionals negotiating with health plans are exempt from Federal antitrust laws, but this exemption does not grant the right to collectively stop providing services to patients or change the National Labor Relations Act for professionals excluded from it. The National Labor Relations Act does not apply to negotiations between health care professionals and health plans regarding benefits provided under specific federal programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, and others related to medical and dental care for uniformed services and veterans. Chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code pertains to the Federal employees' health benefits program, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act is also referenced. Definitions for Federal antitrust laws and health plan terms are provided in this section. The terms \"health insurance coverage\" and \"health insurance issuer\" are defined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The term \"group health plan\" is also defined under the same Act. A \"health care professional\" is an individual who provides health care services to patients. A \"health care professional\" provides health care services, treatment, assistance, or medications to patients with specialized training."
