    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Computer and Communications Trade Freedom Act\". The Congress finds that increased communications and exchange of information through computer and telecommunications networks promote democratic institutions and economic modernization. The computer, telecommunications, and semiconductor industries account for a significant portion of US exports and jobs. The rapid pace of technological development has made export controls on advanced computer, telecommunications, and semiconductor products meaningless. The availability of these products from sources outside the US disadvantages American exporters and hinders innovation and employment in related industries. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF EXPORT CONTROLS ON COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT.\" is about the removal of export controls on computers and electronic equipment. Section 4 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include a new subsection regarding License Authority for Computers, Telecommunications Equipment, and Semiconductors. This subsection states that no validated license or reexport authorization is required for the export or reexport of certain products to countries other than targeted countries. The products include computers, related equipment, and telecommunications equipment. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include License Authority for Computers, Telecommunications Equipment, and Semiconductors. Certain products, including telecommunications equipment and semiconductors, are exempt from requiring a validated license for export to countries other than targeted countries. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include License Authority for Computers, Telecommunications Equipment, and Semiconductors. The United States is prohibited from proposing the transfer of certain items from the Industrial List to the International Munitions List of the Coordinating Committee. No export controls can be imposed on goods or technology that do not require a license under specific acts. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include License Authority for Computers, Telecommunications Equipment, and Semiconductors. The Secretary may require a validated license for exports to countries under embargo or parties denied export privileges. The term 'targeted country' refers to countries supporting international terrorism or under embargo. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include License Authority for Computers, Telecommunications Equipment, and Semiconductors. The provisions of this subsection apply to countries under embargo imposed by the United Nations and in which the United States is participating. The amendment made by section 3 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 will take effect 6 months after the enactment of the Act. The President will negotiate with COCOM and other export control regimes to align their controls with the amendment, regardless of whether an agreement is reached."
