    "content": "The report focuses on the transformation of U.S. naval forces, specifically the Navy and the Marine Corps within the Department of the Navy. The Navy shifted its planning focus in the 1990s towards operating in littoral waters to counter potential regional aggressors, leading to changes in concepts of operation, training, and equipment over the last 12 years. The Navy's transformation in the last 12 years has shifted its focus to operating in joint and combined environments, emphasizing amphibious warfare, mine warfare, and defense against submarines. Initiatives like the Littoral Combat Ship and DDG-1000 aim to improve operations in littoral waters and support the global war on terrorism. The Navy's transformation in the last 12 years has focused on joint and combined operations, emphasizing areas like amphibious warfare, mine warfare, and defense against submarines. Initiatives such as the establishment of a Navy Expeditionary Combat Command, riverine force, reserve civil affairs battalion, and intelligence data-mining capability at the National Maritime Intelligence Center are part of this transformation. The concept of network-centric operations, known as network-centric warfare, is a key feature involving computer networking technology to rapidly transmit critical information. Many in the Navy believe this will lead to changes in naval operations and increase U.S. naval capabilities. The Navy's transformation in recent years has focused on joint and combined operations, with a key emphasis on network-centric warfare. This approach, known as network-centric operations, utilizes technology to enhance information sharing and communication. Key efforts include the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) network, Naval Fires Network (NFN), IT-21 investment strategy, and ForceNet. Additionally, the Navy is incorporating unmanned vehicles (UVs) across air, surface, underwater, and ground domains, which could lead to changes in crewed ships and piloted aircraft procurement. The Navy is incorporating unmanned vehicles (UVs) across various domains, which could lead to changes in crewed ships and piloted aircraft procurement. Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) could change naval aviation, while unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) could expand Navy submarine capabilities. The term sea basing refers to a new operational concept where forces are staged at sea for expeditionary operations ashore with minimal reliance on a nearby land base. Functions like command and control, fire support, and logistics support would be relocated to the sea base under this concept. The sea basing concept involves relocating functions like command and control, fire support, and logistics support to a sea base formed by amphibious and sealift-type ships. This concept addresses concerns about the vulnerability of fixed overseas land bases to enemy weapons. The Navy plans to field a 14-ship squadron, the Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future), consisting of new-construction amphibious and sealift-type ships, along with connector ships for equipment movement. The Navy is transitioning to new naval formations like ESGs and SSGs to increase independently deployable, strike-capable naval formations for forward presence, crisis response, and warfighting operations. This shift raises questions about the affordability and effectiveness of the sea basing concept, which aims to move equipment to operational areas ashore using MPF(F) ships. The Navy is transitioning to new naval formations like ESGs and SSGs to increase independently deployable, strike-capable naval formations. ESGs are considered formations of this kind, while ARGs generally were not. The Navy also proposed establishing global fleet stations (GFSs) as persistent sea bases of operations for coordinating and employing adaptive force packages within a regional area of interest. GFS focuses on Phase 0 operations, Theater Security Cooperation, Global Maritime Awareness, and tasks related to the War on Terror to enhance regional maritime security through cooperative efforts. Each GFS serves as a self-contained headquarters for regional operations. The GFS concept provides a leveraged, high-yield sea based option that achieves a persistent presence in support of national objectives. It serves as a self-contained headquarters for regional operations with the capacity to repair and service all ships, small craft, and aircraft assigned. The Navy is implementing new ship-deployment approaches to improve emergency response and increase time ships spend on station in forward deployment areas. Key efforts include the Fleet Response Plan (FRP) for emergency surge deployments and the Sea Swap concept for long-duration forward deployments with crew rotation. The Navy is implementing steps to reduce the number of personnel needed for operations at sea and ashore, moving away from an outdated \"conscript mentality.\" This includes the Fleet Response Plan (FRP) for quick deployments and the Sea Swap concept for long-duration deployments with crew rotation. The FRP allows for deploying up to 6 of 11 planned CSGs within 30 days, with an additional CSG within 60 days (referred to as \"6+1\"). Sea Swap aims to reduce the number of ships needed for continuous stationing overseas by 20% or more. The Navy is reducing personnel requirements through organizational streamlining and new ship designs to operate with smaller crews. This includes initiatives like the LCS, DDG-1000, and Ford class aircraft carrier. The goal is to generate savings and improve business practices. Sea Enterprise is a set of initiatives aimed at improving Navy processes and business practices to generate savings for Navy transformation. The Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) and Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) oversee transformation activities and major exercises to explore new naval concepts. Congress may have oversight questions regarding these efforts. Potential oversight questions for Congress regarding Navy transformation efforts include whether they are adequately coordinated with the Army and Air Force, striking the proper balance between global war on terrorism and preparing for Chinese maritime military forces, maintaining near-term readiness, and how naval transformation may affect force-structure requirements and funding availability."
