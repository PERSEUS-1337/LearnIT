    "content": "As parties to the GATT 1994, WTO Members must provide MFN treatment to each other's products. Free trade agreements are exceptions to this rule, allowing for favorable treatment between parties. Article XXIV of the GATT requires notification and review of these agreements by the WTO. The WTO reviews regional trade agreements, including FTAs, to ensure they comply with GATT requirements. The 1994 Understanding aims to enhance surveillance over these agreements by clarifying assessment criteria and procedures. The CRTA was established in 1996 to conduct reviews and assess the overall impact of FTAs. The WTO reviews regional trade agreements, including FTAs, to ensure compliance with GATT requirements. FTAs must meet four fundamental requirements to comply with Article XXIV, including the elimination of duties and restrictive regulations, coverage of substantially all trade, and a plan to achieve these goals within a reasonable period of time. FTAs under the GATT allow for tariffs and restrictions in certain circumstances. WTO Members must notify the WTO when entering into an FTA. Working parties review FTA agreements and make recommendations to the WTO Council on Trade in Goods. Noncompliant proposals can be approved by a two-thirds vote if they lead to the formation of an FTA as outlined in Article XXIV. Parties to a noncomplying agreement may seek a waiver of obligations under Article IX of the WTO Agreement, with waivers possible in \"exceptional circumstances\" if agreed to by three-fourths of WTO Members. The GATS allows for regional service agreements that eliminate barriers and restrictions on trade in services immediately or within a reasonable time frame, with substantial sectoral coverage. Nonparties should not face higher trade barriers as a result of the agreement. Parties must notify the Council for Trade in Services and report periodically if implementing on a time frame. The GATS allows for regional service agreements that eliminate barriers and restrictions on trade in services immediately or within a reasonable time frame, with substantial sectoral coverage. The term \"substantially all trade\" in Article XXIV of the GATT has not been clearly defined, leading to uncertainty in compliance with regional trade agreements. The working parties assess FTAs for compliance with obligations, considering quantitative and qualitative factors. Concerns were raised about agricultural trade exclusions in U.S. FTAs with Israel and Canada, but no disapproval was recommended. GATT Article XIX allows temporary import restrictions during import surges. Safeguards Agreement Article 2.1 permits safeguard measures if increased imports threaten domestic industries. Article XIX allows temporary import restrictions during import surges, while the Safeguards Agreement permits safeguard measures if increased imports threaten domestic industries. WTO Members have differing views on the relationship of safeguards to FTAs, with arguments regarding the imposition of safeguards against FTA partners and the requirement of \"parallelism\" in the Safeguards Agreement. The Safeguards Agreement requires \"parallelism\" in applying safeguards to imports, including those from FTAs. A WTO challenge faulted the US for not including FTA partners in a safeguard on steel imports, lacking a reasoned explanation. FTAs with various countries were affected, including NAFTA, Israel, Canada, Jordan, Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, and the Dominican Republic. Several FTAs, including those with Canada, Jordan, Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, and the Dominican Republic-Central American-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), have safeguards provisions for originating goods. Recently signed FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and the Republic of Korea also include safeguards provisions. The 1994 Understanding on Article XXIV allows for WTO dispute settlement procedures to be invoked for matters related to free-trade areas and interim agreements. This provision clarifies that WTO dispute settlement can be used to examine the compatibility of FTAs with GATT rules. Additionally, WTO dispute settlement is available for all obligations under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). FTA were presented to the GATT Contracting Parties as interim agreements for the formation of a free-trade area. NAFTA, FTAs with Jordan, Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain, and DR-CAFTA were submitted as free trade and services agreements. The United States has FTAs with Oman, Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, with implementing legislation for Oman and Peru enacted but not yet in force. Legislation for Colombia was introduced but suspended, while bills for Panama and South Korea have not been introduced yet. The Administration is negotiating FTAs with Thailand, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU)."
