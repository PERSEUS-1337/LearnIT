    "content": "The drug industry is characterized by heavy investments in R&D and advertising, a focus on specific therapeutic categories, reliance on patents for profits, and a network of foreign subsidiaries. This industry has significant implications for federal tax burdens due to its research-intensive nature and high R&D spending relative to receipts. Drug firms invest heavily in R&D, spending 12.7% of domestic net sales on it in 2005. This is significantly higher than the average for all industries and manufacturing. While federal funding for drug R&D is low at $41 million, firms continue to invest in R&D as it drives sales and profits. Industry leaders sustain their position by developing popular products, despite the time-consuming and costly nature of drug discovery and development. Drug firms face pressure to develop new drugs due to the finite life of drug patents. Some firms struggle against generic competition after their patents expire, leading to mergers or development of blockbuster drugs. Advances in technology have increased the discovery of drug compounds with therapeutic potential. The entry of new breakthrough drugs into the market has slowed in the past 10 to 20 years. A study found that a significant number of new drug applications approved by the FDA were new molecular entities with therapeutic advantages. The number of new molecular entities approved by the FDA has decreased since 1996. Major drug firms invest heavily in promoting their branded products through advertising. Major drug firms invest heavily in advertising to promote new innovative medicines, with a focus on capturing market share early on and later defending against competition. In 2007, promotional spending totaled $10.4 billion, with $3.7 billion on direct consumer advertising and $6.7 billion on healthcare providers. The emphasis on informing and building brand loyalty among physicians is unique to the prescription drug market. The drug industry is characterized by consumers relying on third parties like doctors and insurance companies for drug choices. The market for brand-name drugs is fragmented, with no dominant seller due to the multitude of therapeutic categories. In 2002, the top 20 producers accounted for 70% of domestic shipments of medicines. Some drug formularies cover multiple therapeutic categories and sub-categories, creating a collection of differentiated oligopolies in the drug industry. Despite the high cost of establishing dominance, some firms can temporarily lead in specific market segments by introducing innovative drugs. For example, Wyeth dominates the female hormone replacement therapy market, while Pfizer leads in cholesterol-reducing medications. The drug industry is divided into pharmaceutical firms, biotechnology firms, and generic drug firms. Pharmaceutical firms focus on small-molecule drugs, biotechnology firms focus on biologics, and generic drug firms make low-cost copies of branded drugs. Pfizer and Merck have led in specific market segments with innovative drugs like Viagra and Proscar. Generic drug firms focus on making low-cost copies of branded drugs that have lost patent protection. Pharmaceutical firms, on the other hand, are larger in assets, sales, and employment, and more profitable. The competition between pharmaceutical and biotech firms has narrowed as pharmaceutical companies have invested in acquiring biotech firms. Technological innovation and reliance on patents for drugs play a central role in the industry's growth and transformation. Patents grant temporary legal monopoly over commercial uses of inventions, allowing firms to generate high returns on investment and maintain dominance in the market. Drug companies use patents for drug compounds, formulations, uses, and manufacturing methods. The life of a patent is typically 20 years from the date of application, with potential extensions granted under certain laws. Drug companies can extend their patents by up to five years to make up for time lost during clinical testing. Patents are crucial for drug firms to stay competitive and profitable. The FDA regulates the introduction of new drugs through three phases of clinical testing to ensure safety and efficacy. The FDA confers approval for drugs after testing for safety, efficacy, and optimal dosages in ill patients. Patents protect the molecular design of drugs, blocking substitutes and allowing innovators to appropriate returns on R&D investment. Drug industry executives value patents as effective mechanisms for profit. In the mid-1970s, R&D managers in the pharmaceutical industry highly valued product patents for protecting competitive advantages from innovation. A 1994 survey showed that the drug industry had the highest percentage of product innovations where patents were effective for capturing returns. This aggressive use of patents for approved products may explain why drug firms are consistently profitable. The pharmaceutical industry has consistently shown high returns on stockholders' equity, with patented medicines commanding higher prices than generic counterparts. The industry's profitability is attributed to its extensive use of patents for product innovations. The pharmaceutical industry's extensive operations in U.S. possessions and foreign countries have impacted revenue streams, competitive postures, and federal tax burdens for U.S.-based drug firms. Many firms have foreign subsidiaries in Europe and Japan for manufacturing, sales, and R&D, recognizing the need for a presence in foreign markets since the 1960s. Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce shows significant foreign direct investment abroad by U.S. firms in 2005. In 2005, U.S.-based drug firms had 421 majority-owned foreign affiliates with assets totaling $181 billion, generating $126 billion in sales and employing 207,900 workers. PhRMA member companies had domestic sales of $190 billion in 2007, with foreign sales totaling $82 billion. In 2005, U.S.-based drug firms had 421 majority-owned foreign affiliates with assets totaling $181 billion, generating $126 billion in sales and employing 207,900 workers. PhRMA member companies had domestic sales of $190 billion in 2007, with foreign sales totaling $82 billion. Foreign-based PhRMA member companies contributed $82 billion, or 43% of domestic sales, while spending $35 billion on domestic R&D. U.S.-based PhRMA member companies and U.S. affiliates of foreign-based companies spent $9 billion on foreign R&D, accounting for 26% of domestic R&D spending. The U.S. drug industry may derive up to 40% of its revenue from foreign sales, with foreign operations potentially contributing a higher portion of overall profits. In 2003, six major U.S.-based pharmaceutical firms received over 65% of their profits from foreign operations. The taxable income of drug firms is shown in Table 1, based on tax returns filed by corporations with and without net income. The industry includes firms manufacturing medicinal products, processing botanical drugs, and manufacturing pharmaceutical products. The taxable income combines domestic income earned by U.S.-based corporations and U.S. affiliates. The taxable income of drug firms, as shown in Table 1, includes domestic income earned by U.S.-based corporations and U.S. affiliates of foreign-based firms. The U.S. tax system taxes business income based on residence, not territorial source, leading to worldwide income taxation for U.S.-based corporations. To avoid double taxation, U.S.-based firms can claim a credit for foreign income tax payments. Additionally, U.S. affiliates of foreign corporations are required to pay federal income taxes on income earned in the United States. The U.S. tax system requires foreign firms to pay federal income taxes on income earned in the United States. U.S.-based firms can defer tax payments on profits from foreign subsidiaries. The industry benefited from business tax credits, with a decline in credits from 1990 to 2000 due to the phase-out of the possessions tax credit. The drug industry saw high levels of taxable income in 2005 and 2006 due to repatriated foreign earnings under a tax holiday. The main tax credits claimed are discussed, with the foreign tax credit not providing a direct benefit to the claiming firm. This provision aims to prevent double taxation of income earned by foreign branches. The foreign tax credit provision aims to prevent double taxation of income earned by foreign branches or subsidiaries of U.S.-based corporations. The credit may not exceed federal income tax owed on repatriated foreign-source income and cannot offset tax owed on domestic-source income. Excess foreign tax credits can be carried back one year and carried forward up to 10 years. The drug industry benefited from the possessions tax credit under IRC Section 936 until 1996, which was later revised as the Puerto Rican tax credit. The Puerto Rican Economic Activity Credit (PREAC) was available from 1997 to 2005, allowing corporations to exclude up to 40% of their income from business operations in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories from federal taxation. Drug firms accounted for 53% of the total amount claimed. The credit expired on December 31, 2005, and was subject to caps enacted in 1993. The possessions tax credit, subject to caps enacted in 1993, was modified by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 to phase out by the end of 2005. The drug industry responded by establishing a significant manufacturing presence in Puerto Rico. According to a 1992 report, 26 drug firms had manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico in 1990, resulting in an estimated tax savings of $10.1 billion. These operations produced 17 of the 21 most commonly prescribed drugs in the US in the early 1990s. Corporations are subject to both regular income tax and alternative minimum tax (AMT), with different rules for income measurement and deductions. The corporate AMT is based on a broader income definition and fewer deductions, with most business tax credits not applicable to reduce AMT liability. The corporate AMT is calculated based on a broader income definition and fewer deductions compared to regular income tax. Most business tax credits, including the research tax credit, cannot be used to reduce AMT liability. The AMT rate is 20%, lower than the top corporate tax rate of 35%, requiring taxable income to be at least 75% greater under the AMT before it must be paid. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is paid by corporations mainly due to timing differences in deductions, such as depreciation. Corporations can switch between paying the AMT and regular tax, with a credit allowed to offset future tax liability. Unused AMT credits can be carried forward indefinitely but cannot lower regular tax liability below the tentative minimum tax. This ensures that total tax liability over a period remains similar whether paying the AMT or regular tax. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) accelerates payment of regular tax, with an opportunity cost of forgone earnings. AMT credits claimed by drug firms varied widely but accounted for a small share overall. Corporations likely to pay AMT invest heavily in assets subject to accelerated depreciation. Differences in depreciation treatment between corporate AMT and regular tax systems drive most adjustments and preferences in AMT calculations. Drug firms invest less in assets compared to the manufacturing sector, which contributes significantly to total corporate AMT liability. Pharmaceutical firms spent 5.0% of value added on plant and equipment in 2002, while manufacturing firms spent 6.6%. The General Business Credit (GBC) consists of 31 tax credits, with limits based on net regular income tax and tentative minimum tax liability. The General Business Credit (GBC) consists of 31 tax credits, with limits based on net regular income tax and tentative minimum tax liability. If the GBC exceeds the limitation, the excess can be carried back or forward. The drug industry's GBC claims have mainly come from the research credit under IRC Section 41. The industry consistently claimed more research credits than allowable GBC from 1991 to 2006, except for a few years. The pharmaceutical industry has accumulated $1.1 billion in unused research tax credits, allowing them to reduce future tax liabilities. Business taxpayers can claim a tax credit for qualified research spending above a base amount, incentivizing increased research investment. The research credit includes five non-refundable credits, such as the regular research credit and alternative incremental research credit. The research tax credit includes five non-refundable credits due to expire at the end of 2009. A business taxpayer can claim the basic and energy research credits and one of the remaining three in a single tax year. The credit is equal to 20% of qualified spending on eligible research conducted in the United States. The research tax credit benefits firms by reducing their effective rate below the statutory rate. Qualified research expenses under IRC Section 174 are key, with the base amount needing to be at least 50% of current-year research expenses. The credit applies to wages, supplies, leased computer time, and contract research payments. The drug industry is a major beneficiary, claiming $902 million in research tax credits in 2006. The research tax credit benefits firms by reducing their effective rate below the statutory rate, with the base amount needing to be at least 50% of current-year research expenses. The drug industry claimed $902 million in research tax credits in 2006, representing 12% of total claims by all industries. However, the credit may not have had a significant impact on investment in new drug development in recent years, as even firms spending hundreds of millions on R&D may not qualify for the credit due to specific rules. For example, Merck was unable to claim the credit in 1998 despite spending $1.8 billion on R&D that year. In 2005, only one in five pharmaceutical firms claimed the research tax credit. The orphan drug tax credit targets the drug industry, with firms in the industry contributing 52% of total claims in 2006. The credit subsidizes half the cost of human clinical trials for orphan drugs, which are intended to treat rare diseases. This helps with the costly and time-consuming process of drug development. The orphan drug tax credit defines a rare disease as one likely to afflict fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US or more than 200,000 individuals with no realistic prospect of recovering R&D costs from US sales alone. The credit applies to expenditures for supplies, wages, and salaries of researchers in clinical trials for orphan drugs. It is a permanent provision of the tax code aimed at stimulating investment in new drugs for rare diseases. At least 325 drugs have gained regulatory approval in the US, some becoming major revenue sources despite the credit's intended purpose. The federal tax burden on an industry refers to how the tax code affects its return on past investment, including provisions like taxable income, deductions, tax rates, and incentives for certain activities. Some drugs, like Retrovir AZT, Epogen, and Protropin, have become major revenue sources despite the tax burden. The federal tax burden on an industry is determined by how much of its profits it must pay in taxes. One way to measure this burden is through the average effective tax rate, which is the ratio of federal income tax liability to taxable income. This approach helps account for the differences between economic income and taxable income due to provisions in the tax code. The average effective tax rate is a percentage that shows the impact of the federal tax code on an industry's pre-tax returns. It indicates whether the tax code penalizes or rewards economic activities. However, it has limitations as it reflects the impact on previous investments and may not accurately represent the current or future tax burden. The average effective tax rate reflects the impact of the federal tax code on an industry's pre-tax returns, showing whether it penalizes or rewards economic activities. It has limitations as it may not accurately represent the current or future tax burden. Computing the marginal effective tax rate for an industry is challenging due to the difficulty in estimating the value of certain tax benefits. However, applying average effective tax rates consistently can reveal differences in federal tax burdens across industries. Table 3 displays the average effective federal tax rates for the drug industry and major U.S. industries from 2001 to 2006. The average effective tax rate for the drug industry from 2001 to 2006 compares federal income tax liability with worldwide taxable income, excluding the foreign tax credit. This hybrid measure reflects the federal tax burden on domestic and foreign income recognized for tax purposes. Excluding the foreign tax credit is crucial to avoid understating the federal tax burden on the industry. The drug industry's federal tax burden from 2001 to 2006 was similar to the average for all industries, despite perceptions of unfair benefits. The industry's tax burden increased in the late 1990s due to the phase-out of the possessions tax credit. The drug industry likely has lower marginal effective federal tax rates due to certain tax preferences not fully reflected in average rates, such as deferral of federal income taxes and accelerated depreciation. The drug industry benefits from tax preferences like deferral of federal income taxes on foreign subsidiaries' net income, expensing of research spending, and advertising costs. Foreign branch profits of U.S.-based corporations are taxed in the year earned, regardless of repatriation. The tax benefits for U.S.-based corporations include deferral of federal income taxes on foreign subsidiaries' profits, which are only taxed when repatriated. This deferral can result in significant tax savings, especially when subsidiaries are located in countries with lower tax rates. U.S.-based firms can reduce their federal tax burden by deferring tax payments on foreign-source income, especially when subsidiaries are in countries with lower tax rates. This incentive encourages investment in countries with lower income tax rates than the United States. U.S.-based drug firms have taken advantage of this opportunity, with an effective foreign income tax rate of 17.6% in 2003. The foreign profits of six major U.S. pharmaceutical firms were 17.6% in 2003, with unrepatriated foreign earnings increasing tenfold from $10.1 billion in 1993 to $101.0 billion in 2004. These firms were among the top 20 U.S.-based multinational companies with accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings. The drug industry benefited from deferring federal taxes on profits earned by foreign corporate subsidiaries, taking advantage of tax reduction opportunities in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Under IRC Section 965 of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, U.S. corporations could claim a deduction equal to 85% of cash dividends received from their controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) and invested in the United States. This deduction lowered the tax rate on dividends received to 5.25% for corporations paying a 35% marginal tax rate. The deduction could be claimed in either the last tax year before October 22, 2004, or the first tax year during the 12 months starting on that date. The base-period amount for a corporation was defined as the average cash dividends received from CFCs in three of the five most recent tax years. The deduction under IRC Section 965 allowed U.S. corporations to claim 85% of cash dividends from their controlled foreign corporations. A study by the IRS found that 843 U.S.-based corporations claimed the deduction by repatriating $362 billion in cash dividends from 2004 through 2006. Drug firms accounted for 3% of the firms but contributed 32% of the repatriated cash dividends, with the average drug firm repatriating $3.6 billion in qualifying dividends. The deduction under IRC Section 965 allowed U.S. corporations to claim 85% of cash dividends from their controlled foreign corporations. Drug firms accounted for 3% of the firms but contributed 32% of the repatriated cash dividends, with the average drug firm repatriating $3.6 billion in qualifying dividends. Major U.S.-based pharmaceutical firms reduce their tax burdens by transferring assets to offshore subsidiaries with lower tax rates. A U.S.-based drug company reduces its tax burden by transferring a patent to a subsidiary in a country with lower tax rates. The subsidiary funds further research in the U.S., claims ownership of the patent, and produces the drug at a low cost. The parent company attributes most of the profit from U.S. sales to the foreign subsidiary, allowing it to be taxed at a lower rate. Most of the profit from a U.S.-based drug company is transferred to a subsidiary in a country with lower tax rates, where it is taxed at a lower rate. The remaining profit is taxed at a higher rate in the United States. This practice allows for the sheltering of profits in foreign tax havens, raising questions about the legality of the practice due to higher drug prices in the U.S. compared to other countries. Sullivan estimated that foreign earnings for drug firms should have accounted for 43% of their worldwide profits in 2005, leading to an additional 27% of profits subject to U.S. taxation. Drug firms also benefit from tax treatment of research expenditures under IRC Section 174. In practice, only wages, supplies, and overhead costs related to qualified research can be deducted under IRC Section 174. The cost of structures and equipment used in research must be recovered over 15 years and three years, respectively. Business spending on R&D creates intangible assets like patents that generate revenue over time, indicating a longer economic life. It is fair for firms to treat R&D spending in computing taxable income. The tax code allows firms to treat R&D expenditures as a current expense rather than a capital expense, creating a subsidy for business R&D investment. This lowers the user cost of capital for R&D investment significantly compared to other investments like new plant and equipment. Supporters of expensing R&D expenditures argue that it addresses a market failure in research investment, where firms tend to underinvest due to inability to capture all returns. Drug firms benefit more from this tax subsidy, with the industry spending significantly more on R&D compared to other sectors. In 2006, drug firms allocated 13.5% of domestic net sales to R&D, totaling $38.8 billion. In 2006, the pharmaceutical industry was able to lower its tax liability by $12 billion by deducting R&D expenditures. Drug firms also benefit from tax deductions on advertising expenses, similar to R&D expenses. Expensing advertising and R&D costs as current expenses provides a tax subsidy with a marginal effective tax rate of zero on profits from assets. While justified for advertising if benefits are limited to the year incurred, evidence suggests advertising can create long-term intangible assets like brand recognition and consumer loyalty, boosting profits. Ernst R. Berndt and colleagues studied the U.S. market for anti-ulcer drugs, finding that marketing efforts by leading manufacturers significantly impacted domestic demand and market shares from 1977 to 1993. They differentiated between efforts to expand overall demand and those focused on increasing market shares. The value of marketing to expand overall demand remained constant, while marketing to boost market shares depreciated annually by nearly 40%. Others estimate the depreciation rate for intangible assets created by commercial advertising falls between 20% to 30%. The economic value of advertising created intangible assets falls between 20% to 30%. Current tax laws allow for expensing of advertising costs, lowering the cost of capital for advertising investment. However, uncertainty remains about the depreciation rate of advertising and its economic life varies by mode of advertising. This makes it challenging to assess the extent of tax code subsidies for advertising investment. In 2005, the drug industry benefited significantly from tax deductions for advertising expenses, claiming 4.6% of business receipts compared to the overall industry average of 1.2%. This resulted in a tax savings of $4.3 billion at the industry's average effective federal tax rate of 32.5%. Tax policy plays a role in influencing the climate for new drug development through business taxation's impact on the cost of capital for R&D investment and internal funds. The user cost of capital is the cost incurred by a firm for owning an asset, including opportunity cost, direct costs like depreciation and taxes. It indicates the rate of return needed for an investment project to break even. Business investment responds to changes in the user cost of capital, influenced by factors like tax burden on investment returns. The marginal effective tax rate is a key measure of the tax burden on investment returns. Federal tax subsidies for R&D investments, such as the research tax credit and deduction for research expenses, help lower the cost of capital for these investments compared to other types of investments like plant or equipment purchases. According to economist Bill Cox, tax subsidies for R&D investments can result in after-tax rates of return exceeding pre-tax rates, boosting cash flow and internal funds for firms. Some firms base their R&D budgets on available funds after expenses, with internal funds often cheaper than external funds for small biotechnology start-ups. In the short run, firms can invest more in new R&D projects by using retained earnings to finance them, leading to a decrease in tax liabilities. Additionally, U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies can reduce their global tax burden by transferring profits to low-tax subsidiaries through patent transfers and transfer pricing strategies. The drug industry's federal tax burden is measured by average effective tax rates, which were similar to all industries from 2000 to 2006. However, drug firms allocated a higher percentage of revenue to R&D during this period. This suggests that new drug development is influenced by factors beyond federal tax subsidies, such as advances in basic research, regulatory requirements, competitive strategies, and potential earnings. The tax burden for drug firms varies based on their profitability and type of firm. Pharmaceutical firms can benefit from tax credits and deferrals, while biotech firms with net operating losses cannot take advantage of these incentives. Generic drug firms have a tax profile similar to pharmaceutical firms but spend less on drug development and advertising."
