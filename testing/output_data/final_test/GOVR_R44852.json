    "content": "The analysis below compares tax incentives for fossil and renewable energy production, highlighting limitations in quantifying subsidies per unit of production. The tax incentives for energy resources aim to encourage investment rather than production. For example, expensing intangible drilling costs for oil and gas incentivizes capital equipment and exploration. Federal financial support levels may not reflect underlying policy rationales, which could be economic, social, or other objectives. Analyzing federal financial support per unit of energy production may inform policy debates but does not address why different energy sources receive varying levels of support. Tax expenditures are estimates of federal revenue losses associated with specific provisions, not specific to energy sources. The Joint Committee on Taxation advises against summing tax expenditures across provisions due to interaction effects. Many tax incentives are available to various energy resources without distinguishing between them. Accelerated depreciation does not specify benefit distribution to different technologies like wind and solar. Various tax provisions supporting energy are not energy-specific. The U.S. energy sector benefits from tax provisions not specifically targeted at energy, such as the production activities deduction. Certain energy-related activities may also benefit from tax incentives available to non-energy industries. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides annual data on U.S. primary energy production, defining it as energy in its natural form before conversion. In 2017, fossil fuels dominated primary energy production, with natural gas at 32.0%, crude oil at 22.1%, and coal at 17.7%. Fossil sources accounted for 77.7%, while nuclear electric and renewables made up the rest, with nuclear electric energy contributing 9.5% in 2017. In 2017, renewables accounted for 12.8% of U.S. primary energy production. Biomass was the largest source among renewables, making up 5.9% of overall production. Hydroelectric power followed at 3.1%, wind energy at 2.7%, solar energy at 0.9%, and geothermal energy at 0.2%. Biomass was used for biofuels and biopower, with 2.3 quadrillion Btu used for biofuels out of 5.2 quadrillion Btu total biomass energy production. The tax code provides targeted incentives for the energy sector, along with broader provisions available to all taxpayers. Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates forecast revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions, which are projected rather than based on actual economic conditions. The Joint Committee on Taxation advises that individual tax expenditures cannot be simply summed to estimate aggregate revenue losses due to interaction effects. Total tax expenditure figures for energy provisions are projected estimates and may not reflect actual federal revenue changes. In FY2017 and FY2018, energy-related tax provisions resulted in estimated revenue losses of $17.8 billion and $6.4 billion was attributed to renewable energy credits. Fossil fuel support decreased from $4.6 billion in 2017 to $3.2 billion in 2018, despite no direct changes in tax provisions. In 2017, changes in tax laws (P.L. 115-97) did not directly impact fossil fuel tax provisions, but the reduced corporate tax rate decreased tax savings for fossil fuel incentives. Federal tax support for energy in 2017 mainly favored fossil fuels and renewables, with some support for energy efficiency, alternative vehicles, and nuclear energy. 77.7% of U.S. energy production in 2017 came from fossil fuels, with 25.8% of federal tax support directed towards them. Renewable sources accounted for 12.8% of energy production in 2017. In 2017, 12.8% of U.S. primary energy came from renewables, with 65.2% of federal tax support going towards them. The table includes subcategories of renewables, excluding hydro and biofuels. It may not be appropriate to compare current tax incentives to energy production due to past investment decisions. Hydroelectric power technologies installed before the 1990s do not receive current federal tax benefits. In 2017, nonhydro renewables accounted for 9.7% of primary energy production, with potential for growth in smaller hydro projects. Tax incentives benefit taxpayers developing and operating hydroelectric power facilities, including efficiency improvements and capacity additions. In 2017, excluding biofuels, 53.4% of energy-related tax incentives went towards supporting renewables, reducing their share of primary energy production. In 2017, excluding biofuels, renewables' share of primary energy production decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 10.1%. Nuclear resources accounted for 9.5% of primary energy produced, with a tax benefit for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds totaling $0.2 billion. This tax expenditure reduces the cost of investing in nuclear energy by taxing income from reserve funds at a preferred rate of 20%. The value of energy-related tax incentives has shifted over time, with a focus on fossil fuels until the mid-2000s when support for renewables increased. Most federal financial support for renewable energy was for renewable fuels like ethanol, but tax credits for these fuels expired in 2011. Excise tax credits have been incurred by the federal government since 2008. Starting in 2008, the federal government incurred outlays for excise tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel, which expired at the end of 2017. The cost of energy tax incentives for renewables began to increase in the mid-2000s, with Section 1603 grants contributing to higher costs. The Section 1603 grant option was not available for projects starting after December 31, 2011. Tax expenditures for the ITC and PTC have increased in recent years, with the 1603 grant option not available for projects starting after December 31, 2011. The PTC will not be available for projects starting after December 31, 2019, but tax expenditures will continue after the provision expires. The ITC for solar is currently 30% and is scheduled to decline to 26%. Tax expenditures for tax incentives supporting energy efficiency increased in the late 2000s but subsequently declined, with most of the increase in revenue losses associated with tax incentives for homeowners investing in energy-efficient property. The primary tax incentive for energy efficiency improvements to existing homes expired at the end of 2017, and extending expired tax incentives for energy efficiency would increase the cost of energy efficiency-related tax incentives. Tax expenditures for energy-related tax incentives, particularly for renewables, are expected to decline as incentives phase out over time. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) allows for credit claims over 10 years, with expenditures expected to continue for at least the next decade. U.S. Department of the Treasury estimates show how expiring provisions impact energy-related tax expenditures over time. Treasury and Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates differ in budget window length and methodologies. Tax expenditures for energy-related tax incentives, particularly for renewables, are expected to decline as incentives phase out over time. The U.S. Department of the Treasury estimates show a decrease in tax expenditures supporting renewables from $8.4 billion in 2018 to $3.5 billion by 2028, mainly due to reduced tax expenditures for the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC). In contrast, tax expenditures supporting fossil fuels are expected to increase from $2.2 billion in 2018 to $3.8 billion over time. The Treasury projects a rise in revenue losses from permanent oil-and-gas tax incentives, reaching $3.8 billion by 2028. Tax support for the energy sector varies across sectors and may decrease under current law, but could change with extensions or modifications to tax provisions. There is a possibility of a decline in tax-related support for the energy sector in the long term if provisions expire as scheduled."
