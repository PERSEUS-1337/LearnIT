Taiwan is now a multiparty democracy with a separate political system and economy from China. The US withdrew diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in 1979 but has not taken a formal position on Taiwan's ultimate status. The US has not taken a formal position on Taiwan's ultimate status but emphasizes that it must be decided peacefully with the consent of the Taiwanese people. The Taiwan Relations Act highlights the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait area for the US and internationally. The Taiwan Relations Act emphasizes that Taiwan's future must be determined peacefully with the consent of its people. The Act states that any attempt to decide Taiwan's future through non-peaceful means is a threat to regional peace and security, and the US will resist any coercion that jeopardizes Taiwan's security or economic system. Additionally, the Act aims to preserve and enhance the human rights of all people in Taiwan. The United States maintains a strong defense and security relationship with Taiwan since signing the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1954, contributing to freedom, peace, and stability in the region. Taiwan's ability to defend itself is crucial for maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait area. Since 1979, the United States has sold defensive weapons to Taiwan to help maintain its autonomy and freedom against China's hostility. However, pressures to delay, deny, and reduce arms sales to Taiwan have been prevalent since 1982, which could hinder Taiwan's self-defense capability. The Taiwan Relations Act takes precedence over any communique with China, which has threatened force against Taiwan and demonstrated willingness to use missiles near Taiwan. The People's Republic of China is increasing its military capabilities, including developing advanced missiles and satellites with precision guidance. This military buildup is highlighted in a Department of Defense report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. The People's Republic of China is expanding its military capabilities, including advanced offensive missiles, anti-satellite lasers, and radio frequency weapons that pose a significant threat to Taiwan. Additionally, they are acquiring advanced naval systems like Russian Kilo submarines, which are hard to detect. The military buildup of the People's Republic of China includes new naval capabilities like nuclear-powered attack submarines, destroyers armed with anti-ship missiles, and long-range naval attack aircraft. They are also improving air combat capabilities by acquiring Russian fighters and advanced air-to-air missiles. These capabilities pose a grave threat to Taiwan. Taiwan needs to acquire diesel-powered submarines to counter a blockade and for antisubmarine warfare training due to China's advanced naval capabilities. Taiwan's democratic government and nonaggressive foreign policy make offensive submarine use unlikely. The current defense relationship between the United States and Taiwan is insufficient to counter potential aggression from China. The sense of Congress is that additional positions should be reserved for Taiwan officers at key military institutions, and Taiwan should have full access to defense data. The President is required to assign additional technical staff to the American Institute in Taiwan using funds from the Department of Defense. Annual reports detailing Taiwan's defense requests and any decisions made regarding those requests must be submitted to Congress. The President must assign technical staff to the American Institute in Taiwan using funds from the Department of Defense. Annual reports on Taiwan's defense requests and decisions made must be submitted to Congress, including the level and justification of the final decision. SEC. 5. STRENGTHENING THE DEFENSE OF TAIWAN. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is required to develop a plan to enhance training and exchanges between the US and Taiwan's armed forces in various areas such as threat analysis and force planning, to maintain Taiwan's self-defense capabilities. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is required to develop a plan for exchanges of officers up to the grade of O-10 between the US and Taiwan military commands. A report must be submitted to Congress within 180 days, and the plan must be implemented within 30 days of the report submission. Additionally, secure direct communications between the United States and Taiwan military commands must be established within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Defense will establish secure direct communications between the US Pacific military command and Taiwan military command. The President is authorized to sell missile defense equipment, satellite early warning data, and air defense equipment to Taiwan at reasonable cost. The President is authorized to sell modern air-defense equipment to Taiwan, including AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles, advanced fighters, AWACS, equipment for airfield defense, and communications infrastructure for joint-force air defense. Additionally, defensive systems such as diesel-powered submarines and anti-submarine systems can be sold to Taiwan to counter China's naval capabilities. The President is authorized to sell modern air-defense equipment to Taiwan, including AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles, advanced fighters, AWACS, equipment for airfield defense, and communications infrastructure for joint-force air defense. This includes defensive systems such as diesel-powered submarines, naval anti-missile systems, and communications systems for joint-force naval defense operations. Nothing in this section supersedes the Arms Export Control Act."
