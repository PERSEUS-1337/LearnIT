    "content": "Grants are available for the purchase of ultrasound equipment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide grants for ultrasound equipment to nonprofit organizations that operate as community-based pregnancy help clinics and offer free ultrasound examinations to pregnant women under medical supervision. The entity must be under the supervision of a licensed physician and comply with all legal requirements to provide medical services to pregnant women. Pregnant women must be shown ultrasound images of the fetus and given a description of its characteristics. Each pregnant woman will receive an approximate age of the embryo or fetus based on medical judgment. They will also be provided with information on abortion alternatives such as childbirth and adoption, as well as resources for assistance. The entity receiving the grant must maintain medical malpractice insurance of at least $1,000,000 to cover activities related to the ultrasound machine. The grant amount cannot exceed 50% of the ultrasound machine's purchase price or $20,000, whichever is less. Applications for the grant must be submitted to the Secretary in the specified form and manner. The applicant must submit an application to the Secretary containing necessary agreements and information. A grant recipient must report annually on compliance with eligibility conditions. A \"community based pregnancy help medical clinic\" offers free medical services to pregnant women under a licensed physician's supervision. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2003, with additional funding for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 for the implementation of the program."
