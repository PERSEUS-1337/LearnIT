    "content": "The Act is titled the \"50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds it appropriate to honor the 50 States of the United States and promote knowledge about their history and geography. The circulating coinage has not been updated in 25 years. A commemorative 25-cent coin program could generate significant earnings for the Treasury. The Congress plans to issue redesigned quarter dollars over a 10-year period to commemorate each of the 50 states. This program aims to honor the states, promote knowledge about their history and geography, and generate earnings for the Treasury. The Congress plans to issue redesigned quarter dollars over a 10-year period to commemorate each of the 50 states. The designs on the reverse side of the coins will be emblematic of the states, with single state designs issued each year. Additionally, coins commemorating 5 states will be issued annually during the 10-year program. The quarter dollar coins issued over a 10-year period will feature designs emblematic of 5 states each year, selected in the order of ratification or admission into the Union. The Secretary of the Treasury will determine the number of coins for each design annually. Each of the 50 state designs for the quarter dollars will be selected by the Secretary after consultation. The curr_chunk states that the Governor of the State being commemorated, or other designated State officials, along with the Commission of Fine Arts, are involved in the design selection process for quarter dollar coins. The Secretary may include participation by State officials, artists, engravers, and the public in the design selection process for quarter dollars. Designs must meet standards of dignity and appropriateness, with certain representations prohibited. No head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead, and no portrait of a living person may be included in the design of any quarter dollar under this subsection. All coins minted under this subsection shall be considered numismatic items. The Secretary may mint and issue quarter dollars of each design selected in uncirculated and proof qualities as deemed appropriate.

The \"United States $1 Coin Act of 1997\" amends the weight, color, content, and design specifications for the dollar coin, ensuring it is distinctive, easily recognizable, and has anti-counterfeiting properties. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with Congress, will choose designs for the obverse and reverse sides of the dollar coin. Upon depletion of the Susan B. Anthony $1 coin supply, new $1 coins meeting specified requirements will be circulated. The Secretary of the Treasury may mint $1 coins with Susan B. Anthony's likeness until production begins. These coins can be included in numismatic sets. A marketing program will be adopted to promote the use of the new $1 coins. The Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on the marketing program for the new $1 coins and submit a report to Congress by March 31, 2001. SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

They will be legal tender and the design shall be emblematic of the first flight of Orville. The Secretary will obtain gold and silver for minting coins under this section from various sources. The coins minted under this section will have a design emblematic of the first flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1903.

Surcharges received from coin sales will be paid to the First Flight Foundation for maintaining the Wright Brothers Monument and National Memorial Park in North Carolina. The Comptroller General can audit the First Flight Foundation's financial records related to expenditures. The Secretary must ensure minting coins will not cost the US Government.
