    "content": "The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, amending federal K-12 educational accountability requirements. States receiving Title I-A funds must submit accountability plans addressing low high school graduation rates. Schools failing to graduate one-third or more of their students must be identified for support and improvement. LEAs serving these schools must develop plans to improve graduation rates. The national graduation rate for the Class of 2016 was 84.1%, showing improvements across all student groups. However, graduation rate gaps persist among different subgroups, with many individual high schools performing poorly. As many as 16% of high schools may need more rigorous state-determined actions if they do not improve within a set number of years. The implementation of accountability rules in high schools under ESSA reveals that up to 16% of schools may fail to graduate one-third of their students. This could lead to interventions in thousands of schools nationwide. ESSA defines the Four-Year Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate (ACGR) for the first time in federal education law, aiming for national uniformity in measurement. The Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate (ACGR) is calculated by dividing the number of students who receive a regular high school diploma by the adjusted cohort for the graduating class. The rate of high school completion in the United States has increased significantly since World War II, reaching 92.5% in 2017. The high school completion rate in the United States plateaued at 85% in 1980 and reached 92.5% in 2017. Inequities persist among racial and ethnic groups, with Hispanics showing a rapid increase in recent years. Gaps in attainment exist between white, non-Hispanics and Hispanics, as well as between Blacks and Asians/non-Hispanic whites. The CPS educational attainment rate is useful for tracking long-term trends and differs from the ACGR. The CPS educational attainment rate is a cross-sectional measure that includes diploma equivalencies, leading to a higher rate than the ACGR. The CPS rate is for people ages 25 to 29, allowing more time for completion. The ACGR tracks a cohort from high school entry to graduation, while the CPS captures a wider population beyond the school system. The overall graduation rate has increased by five percentage points between 2011 and 2016, similar to the three percentage point increase in the overall CPS educational attainment rate estimate. Different trends are observed among racial/ethnic groups, with varying increases in graduation rates. The ESSA accountability requirements apply to both the total student body within schools and specified subgroups, necessitating the reporting of ACGR data. The ACGR data from 2011-2016 show progress in graduation rates among low-income students, English language learners, and students with disabilities. Graduation rates vary across states, with New Mexico having the lowest ACGR at 71% and Iowa the highest at 91.3%. Figure 2 displays the ACGR for the Class of 2016 by state, with four states graduating fewer than 76.1% of students. Graduation rates have increased or remained the same in every state between the graduating classes of 2011 and 2016. Alabama saw the largest increase, from 72% to 87.1%. Four states had increases of more than ten percentage points, while three states saw increases of less than one percentage point. ESSA provisions require states to use the ACGR as an indicator in their accountability systems starting in the 2017-2018 school year. Analysis of school-level data for the Class of 2015 shows that 16% of schools nationwide had an ACGR. The analysis of school-level data for the Class of 2015 reveals that 16% of high schools nationwide had an ACGR of less than 70%. Due to privacy protections, a cutoff of 70% was used instead of 66.7% for identifying schools for intervention. This may overestimate the number of schools needing intervention, especially since graduation rates have been improving. Despite these limitations, thousands of high schools may still be identified for intervention. The analysis suggests that thousands of high schools may need improvement due to low graduation rates. It is unclear if these schools would be singled out solely based on graduation rates or for other reasons as well. The Department of Education collects graduation rate data through the EDFacts Initiative, which is publicly available on their website while ensuring privacy protection. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act requires techniques to protect privacy in reporting graduation rates. Schools with fewer than 6 students have suppressed rates, while those with 6-200 students have reported ranges, and over 200 students have exact rates. The width of the ranges depends on cohort size, with the actual rate falling within the range. ACGR ranges are shown in Table A-1."
