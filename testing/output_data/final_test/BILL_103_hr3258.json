    "content": "TITLE I--BOOT CAMP GRANTS\n\nSEC. 101. GRANT AUTHORIZATION.\n\nThe Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance may make grants to States for establishing boot camp prisons, with priority given to using surplus Federal property.\n\nSEC. 102. ELIGIBILITY. To receive Federal funding, a State-operated boot camp prison must offer manual labor, vocational training, drug/alcohol addiction treatment, and a therapeutic environment to reduce recidivism and promote responsible citizenship among inmates. The boot camp prison program includes procedures for inmate compliance, with noncompliant inmates being resentenced to traditional prisons. After completing the program, inmates enter a community adjustment phase with probation, substance abuse treatment, and other conditions as needed. SEC. 103. APPLICATIONS.\n\nTo request a grant under this title, the State chief executive must submit an application to the Director with required information. The application must ensure that Federal funds supplement non-Federal funds for funded activities. The State office designated under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 will prepare and administer grant funds, including financial oversight and disbursement. SEC. 104. REVIEW OF STATE APPLICATIONS.\n\nThe Bureau approves grants based on application consistency with requirements and affirmative findings. Applications are approved within 45 days unless specific disapproval reasons are provided.\n\nSEC. 105. ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. The Director may allocate up to 5% of funds for national demonstration projects. Remaining funds are distributed to participating States based on the ratio of eligible offenders. Federal grants cover up to 75% of boot camp costs. Unused funds are subject to Director's determination. Federal assistance may be reallocated to other states for prison boot camp projects if the Director determines that a portion of allocated funds will not be used. Title II of the document introduces a special sentencing rule for nonviolent drug offenders under the Controlled Substances Act. It authorizes $500,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1994 to 1996 for the implementation of this title. States receiving grants must submit yearly evaluations on boot camp effectiveness and recidivism rates. The special sentencing rule allows nonviolent offenders to be sent to boot camp prisons instead of mandatory minimum imprisonment, with the possibility of resentencing if noncompliance occurs."
