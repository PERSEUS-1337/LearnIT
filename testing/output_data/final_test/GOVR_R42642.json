    "content": "The term \"STEM education\" encompasses teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics across all grade levels and settings. Federal policy makers have a strong interest in STEM education, with the topic frequently discussed in various policy debates. This report aims to provide context for Congress on legislative and executive branch STEM education-related policy proposals. The launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite in the 1950s is often cited as a pivotal moment for STEM education policy in the United States, but federal interest in scientific and technological literacy dates back to the 1st Congress. The long-standing interest in promoting scientific knowledge dates back to the 1st Congress, with President George Washington emphasizing the importance of science and literature for public happiness. Recent concerns focus on the relationship between STEM education and national prosperity, highlighting the benefits of a skilled STEM workforce for economic and military advances in the United States. The economic and social benefits of STEM education are considered crucial for workers in both STEM and non-STEM fields. Policy makers emphasize the importance of STEM literacy and expertise for the 21st century economy. The education system is a major source of the STEM workforce in the United States, with federal legislators focusing on improving STEM-related outputs through policy and investments. Over 225 bills related to science education were introduced between 1991 and 2012. Between the 102nd and 112th Congresses, the term \"science education\" gained prominence. Federal agencies invest between $2.8 billion and $3.4 billion annually in STEM education programs. Congressional interest in STEM education increased in 2007 with the publication of the influential report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm.\" This report highlighted weaknesses in the U.S. STEM education system and contributed to the passage of the America Creating Opportunities Act. The America COMPETES Act authorized STEM education programs at various federal agencies. Congress reauthorized major provisions in 2010, but they expired in FY2013. The conversation about STEM education continues in Congress through reauthorization bills and annual budget processes. The report examines federal agencies, programs, and funding for STEM education, the performance of the U.S. STEM education system, and various policy issues and options. Appendices provide links to STEM education data, publications, and major legislation in federal STEM education policy history. Four inventories of federal STEM education programs have been published since 2005 by various organizations. The reports identified a total of 207, 105, 252, and 209 programs funded at approximately $2.8 billion, $3.1 billion, and $3.4 billion in different fiscal years. The discrepancies in federal STEM education inventories (referred to as \"GAO-2012\") highlight the complexity and methodological challenges in establishing the federal effort in STEM education. Differences arise due to the lack of a common definition of STEM programs, difficulty in capturing STEM activities within science mission agencies, and the intricacies of funding calculations for broad-purpose education programs with a STEM focus. Additionally, reliance on agency self-reporting for estimates of federal STEM education activities is considered a less-reliable auditing method. The four inventories of federal STEM education efforts reveal general patterns in investments, with NSF, ED, and HHS accounting for the majority of funding. Approximately one-third of STEM education funding goes to the NSF, while the other two agencies receive varying portions. The GAO-2005 and ACC-2007 inventories found a larger share of STEM funding at HHS compared to the GAO-2012 and NSTC-2011 studies. The GAO-2005 inventory found a smaller share of funds at ED due to a large increase in FY2006 ED appropriation for the SMART Grant program. Each inventory reported results differently due to overlap between populations served or program objectives in STEM education programs. STEM education programs often serve multiple populations and have various objectives, making it challenging to compare results across different inventories. The reporting of populations served and program objectives varied, with some focusing on education levels and others on funding levels. This diversity in reporting methods hinders the ability to analyze and compare program elements effectively. The GAO-2005 study found that 40% of programs served elementary and secondary schools, while over 60% served postsecondary institutions. In comparison, the ACC-2007 study reported 25% and 75%, the NSTC-2011 inventory showed 44% and 56%, and the GAO-2012 study indicated 31% and 69%. The NSTC-2011 inventory did not include programs for postdoctoral fellows, affecting the distribution of programs at the postsecondary level. Both the NSTC-2011 and GAO-2005 inventories reported that a majority of programs had multiple objectives, with 74% and 80% respectively having more than one goal. In FY2012, federal STEM education programs primarily support degree attainment, research experience, and career development for postsecondary students. The largest programs include the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards, Graduate Research Fellowships program, and Mathematics and Science Partnership program. These programs represent the major types of federal STEM education initiatives. The Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards (NRSA) and Graduate Research Fellowships program are the largest federal STEM education programs. NRSA funds support Institutional Research Training Grants and individual fellowships, while the GRF program is the oldest and most prestigious national award offered by NSF. The Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) program at NSF, established in 1952, is a prestigious national award for STEM graduate students. Fellows receive three-year portable stipends for graduate study leading to research-based degrees. In FY2012, NSF issued 7,800 fellowships worth up to $42,000 each, including a $12,000 cost-of-education allowance and a $30,000 stipend. In December 2012, NSF announced the GROW program to expand international research opportunities for GRF fellows in collaboration with international partners and USAID. The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship program offers opportunities for professional development through research collaborations at top science and engineering research sites overseas. GROW/GRF fellows receive a living allowance from host countries, $5,000 for travel and research costs from NSF, and may continue to receive their stipends through their home institution. GROW awards are distributed through a competitive process to GRF fellows, with the first cohort announced in July 2013. Participating countries include Denmark, Finland, France, Japan, South Korea, Norway, and Sweden. The Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP) program, established under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, provides grants to states to improve academic achievement in math and science. Grantees, including high-need school districts and higher education institutions, offer professional development for teachers to enhance their content knowledge. A companion program by the National Science Foundation (NSF-MSP) also supports research and development projects with a budget of $55 million in FY2012. The NSF-MSP program supports projects for K-12 STEM education through grants to institutions. The condition of STEM education in the US has generally held constant or improved over the last four decades. Persistent concerns in STEM education include achievement gaps, US student performance on international tests, foreign student enrollments, global STEM education attainment, STEM teacher quality, and the STEM labor supply. The percentage of US bachelor's degree holders in science and engineering was 36.4% in 2009, consistent with annual production. NSF estimates show that S&E bachelor's degrees have remained constant at 30-35% of all bachelor's degrees for the past four decades. The number of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded annually nearly tripled between 1966 and 2010, reaching 525,374. Doctorate degree production in S&E fields has ranged between 56% and 69% since 1966, with a total of 33,141 doctorates awarded in 2010. Graduate enrollments in S&E fields also increased, with 556,532 graduate students enrolled in 2010. In K-12, U.S. student performance on standardized national mathematics tests has improved over the past four decades. Average NAEP math scores for 4th and 8th graders increased between 1990 and 2011. Despite overall improvements, significant achievement gaps still exist. 12th grade math scores were higher in 2009 compared to 2005. Concerns about STEM education are raised despite positive trends in student performance. Analysts express concerns about STEM education, highlighting achievement gaps among demographic groups, U.S. student performance on international assessments, foreign student enrollments, global STEM education attainment, U.S. STEM teacher quality, and labor supply. The conversation focuses on racial, ethnic, and gender disparities in STEM outcomes, with significant gaps in test scores, degree attainment, and employment. For instance, a 20-point gap exists between white students and black/Hispanic counterparts on NAEP math assessments. In 2011, there were disparities in STEM achievement among demographic groups, with only 18.4% of engineering bachelor's degrees going to women. Despite persistent achievement gaps, there have been improvements in S&E graduate enrollments, especially among Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and black/African American students. Women accounted for a higher percentage of psychology and biological/agricultural sciences degrees in 2010. In 2011, disparities in STEM achievement persisted, with only 18.4% of engineering bachelor's degrees awarded to women. Despite ongoing achievement gaps, there have been improvements in S&E graduate enrollments for Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and black/African American students. Women received a higher percentage of psychology and biological/agricultural sciences degrees in 2010. Research shows that teacher quality, particularly having a major in mathematics or science, positively impacts student achievement, but many U.S. math and science teachers lack this credential. In the 2007-2008 school year, 28% of mathematics teachers did not major in mathematics, and they are less likely to be subject-certified. U.S. students typically score below the average of industrialized nations in mathematics and science tests, ranking below the OECD average in mathematics. Some observers caution against using student assessments to compare nations due to various influencing factors like translation issues, test administration differences, and student effort. Critics of international assessments point out the selection and diversity of test takers as a concern when evaluating U.S. student performance. Poverty is closely linked to low performance in the United States, but this correlation applies to other countries as well. Analysis of the 2009 PISA results shows that the richest U.S. areas outperform most other nations, especially those with less than 10% poverty. Many analysts are concerned about the percentage of STEM degrees going to foreign students, with foreign students earning a significant portion of U.S. doctoral degrees in fields like engineering, physics, computer sciences, and economics. The presence of foreign students in U.S. graduate S&E programs raises concerns about their eligibility for certain jobs requiring security clearance. Some analysts are worried about the high number of STEM degrees obtained by foreign students, especially in fields like engineering, physics, computer sciences, and economics. Concerns also arise about foreign students' eligibility for jobs requiring security clearance. There are suggestions for federal policy makers to encourage foreign STEM students to study and remain in the United States to maintain competitiveness. Additionally, the United States is seen as falling behind other nations in the production of total STEM degrees. In 2007, China surpassed the United States in awarding doctoral degrees in natural sciences and engineering. Some argue that the U.S. produces higher quality graduates, but concerns about STEM education weaknesses leading to workforce shortages persist. The population difference between the U.S. and China amplifies these concerns. Some analysts argue that perceived limitations in the U.S. S&E workforce are overstated and that U.S. competitiveness is not threatened by across-the-board S&E labor shortages. The U.S. Census Bureau reported 7.2 million STEM workers in the United States in 2011, with 70% having at least a bachelor's degree. Many workers trained in science and engineering are not in STEM jobs. Engineering and computers/mathematics/statistics majors have the highest STEM employment rates. Education majors have the lowest STEM employment rates. Recommendations for improving STEM education include addressing governance concerns, improving teacher quality, and strengthening school accountability measures. Some recommendations focus on enhancing STEM education at the post-secondary level, including retaining undergraduate STEM majors and promoting advanced STEM education. There are concerns about governance and coordination in federal STEM education efforts, leading to proposals for program consolidation. Stakeholders advocate for an overarching federal STEM education strategy to address these issues. Program consolidation is a contentious policy option under debate. Program consolidation is a debated policy option for federal STEM education programs, aiming to reduce duplication and fragmentation. Some see it as a way to transfer control to states. Proposals have been made by Members of Congress and the Obama Administration. Analysts note the high number of federal STEM programs and suggest merging for cost savings and coherence. However, GAO found consolidation could be more expensive in the short term and may not lead to long-term savings. Consolidation of federal STEM education programs is a debated policy option, with some advocating for it to increase flexibility and responsiveness. However, the impact would depend on the programs consolidated, funding streams affected, and potential duplication. Some policymakers are concerned about the shift in program control from legislative to executive branches. Block grants have been proposed as a way to transfer control to states. Shifting control to states through block grants is proposed to increase flexibility in responding to local needs in STEM education. However, concerns exist about the potential impact on national STEM agendas and federal agency assets. Opponents of consolidation worry about specified funding streams for programs like STEM education to prevent them from being overlooked. Increased coordination among federal STEM programs is suggested to address duplication and fragmentation issues. Stakeholders highlight a lack of coordination within agencies rather than duplication in the federal portfolio. Some analysts suggest an overarching STEM education strategy to address the lack of coordination among federal agencies. Congress and the President have taken steps to develop a federal STEM education strategy, as directed by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The NSTC was directed to develop a five-year STEM education strategy by the Act of 2010. The strategic plan published in May 2013 received mixed Congressional response, leading to discussions about the FY2014 Administration budget and proposals to reorganize federal STEM education programs. Policy makers debated whether the NSTC strategy was altered to align with the Administration's proposed reorganization, with some suggesting it lost key elements. Other options included creating an Office of STEM Education for better coordination. Proposals include creating an Office of STEM Education and designating an Assistant Secretary for STEM Education at the Department of Education to improve STEM education administration. Focus is on improving K-12 teaching quality and addressing low student achievement through accountability adjustments. Mathematics and science teachers' lack of subject-specific credentials is a concern. The shortage of STEM teachers, particularly in mathematics and science, is a concern in the K-12 education system. Various solutions have been proposed, including providing support and training for current teachers and establishing a STEM Master Teacher Corps to reward experienced and effective teachers. Some advocate for maintaining and expanding federal funding for professional development specifically for STEM teachers. Some stakeholders propose a Master Teacher Corps to reward experienced STEM teachers for mentoring and providing professional development. Others suggest increasing online education in rural schools and easing the removal of ineffective teachers. Improved recruitment and retention of high-quality new teachers is also seen as a solution, with support for alternative certification policies and incentives for mid-career STEM professionals. Incentives for mid-career transition of STEM professionals include subsidizing education costs, developing concurrent STEM and teaching degree programs, and offering financial incentives like differential pay and signing bonuses. Some critics question the focus on teacher quality based on credentials and advocate for improving teacher effectiveness instead. The accountability movement in education policy advocates for reforming teacher evaluation systems to reward top performers and remove low performers. It also suggests restructuring teacher preparation programs based on graduates' classroom effectiveness rather than certification exam results. This movement gained prominence with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which aimed to hold schools accountable for measurable results through achievement benchmarks. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 required states to establish achievement benchmarks and set annual goals for students to reach proficiency in reading and math by 2014. Some stakeholders advocate for including science proficiency in the law. States are developing common academic standards for K-12 education to ensure students are prepared for high school graduation and college or workforce success. Some analysts argue for including science proficiency in common academic standards for K-12 education, pointing out the need to focus on high-achieving students in STEM fields. Proponents of the \"STEM for All\" approach emphasize the demand for STEM competencies in the economy, while others suggest expanding programs like Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate to increase STEM education achievement among all demographic groups. The majority of federal STEM education funding supports undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate education and research. Some proposals aim to improve post-secondary STEM education by addressing remediation, increasing retention rates in STEM majors, and providing support for graduate study and post-doctoral research. Analysts suggest lowering barriers for foreign STEM students entering U.S. institutions. Analysts recommend reducing barriers for foreign STEM students entering U.S. higher education. Challenges in undergraduate STEM education include poor pre-college preparation and high attrition rates among STEM majors. Suggestions for improvement include increased federal investment in remedial education, partnerships between businesses and community colleges, and utilizing non-degree-granting institutions for STEM training. Non-degree-granting institutions are recommended for STEM remediation and training. Policy makers are concerned about low retention rates in undergraduate STEM programs, with various reasons for students switching from STEM to non-STEM degrees. Some advocate for research programs like NSF's WIDER and TUES to improve undergraduate STEM education, while others support efforts to retain underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The demographic profile of the U.S. student-age population is changing, with more diversity and females. Over half of U.S. college students are female, and a majority of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees go to women. Some believe this shift poses challenges for the STEM field historically dominated by white males, but others see it as an opportunity to tap into underrepresented groups for meeting technology needs. Increasing diversity in STEM is seen as a solution by many stakeholders. Increasing diversity in STEM education and employment is seen as a solution to the challenges posed by racial, ethnic, and gender disparities. Researchers have identified various factors that contribute to underrepresentation, with different causes and solutions for different population subsets. For instance, a 2011 review highlighted factors that positively influence the success of minority students in STEM. Factors influencing success of minority students in STEM include parental support, bilingual education, early exposure to STEM, interest in STEM careers, self-efficacy, and educational opportunities. School-based factors contributing to under-preparedness include lack of resources, less qualified teachers, limited access to AP courses, tracking into remedial education, low teacher expectations, stereotype threat, and racial oppression. The 2011 review identified factors associated with minority student STEM success in college, including colorblind meritocracy, financial aid, campus culture, self-efficacy, and STEM support programs. Non-school factors contributing to achievement gaps include poverty, single-parent households, early childhood development, and health. Policy solutions for broadening STEM participation are numerous. In 2010, Congress tasked the National Academies with examining diversity in the STEM workforce and recommending ways to broaden participation. The resulting report highlighted key policy priorities, including increased financial support for minority STEM students, improved teacher preparation, advanced courses for K-12 students, better transition to graduate school, research assistantships for minority graduate students, and investments in minority serving institutions. Other proposed solutions include charter schools, school choice, faith-based schooling, transfer pathways from community colleges, reducing undergraduate debt, and participation in undergraduate research. Analysts suggest investing in minority serving institutions like HBCUs and TCUs to increase diversity in STEM fields. Gender disparities in STEM jobs are debated, with some attributing it to self-efficacy, discrimination, and bias, while others point to family responsibilities and personal choices as contributing factors. Women's career choices outside of science are influenced by various complex factors. Women with high math and verbal skills have more career options outside of science. Scholars propose different solutions for gender disparities in STEM, with some focusing on increasing girls' interest in STEM and creating supportive college environments. Others recommend family-friendly policies in academic institutions and federal funding for research on women's career paths. Some researchers study the lifecourses of women's and men's careers to address gender disparities in STEM fields. They argue that income inequality plays a significant role in achievement gaps, especially for low-income students who experience summer learning loss in mathematics. Urbanization levels also impact mathematics achievement gaps among youth. Researchers have found that urban and rural youth have lower math achievement levels compared to suburban peers, with the gap widening from kindergarten to 8th grade. This disparity is not solely due to socioeconomic differences. Federal STEM education analysts rely on various sources for data on STEM education efforts. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a key assessment tool for K-12 students in the US. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) administers assessments in 12 subject areas for U.S. K-12 students, including mathematics, science, and a pilot assessment in technology and engineering literacy. More information about these assessments is available online. Additionally, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is an international test that assesses the achievements of U.S. 4th and 8th grade students in mathematics and science. The TIMSS and PISA assessments compare U.S. student achievements in math and science with other countries. The GAO report provides an inventory of federal STEM education programs and policy recommendations. More information is available online. The Science and Technology Council reports provide an inventory of federal STEM education investments from FY2008 to FY2013. The U.S. Department of Education's Academic Competitiveness Council report offers funding data from FY2005 to FY2007. Links to the reports are available online. The 2007 ACC report provides policy recommendations and an assessment of STEM education program evaluations. The 2005 GAO report includes an inventory of federal STEM education programs and assesses program goals and constituencies served. The National Science Board's Science and Engineering Indicators 2012 publication offers comprehensive collections of key STEM indicators. The National Science Board's Science and Engineering Indicators 2012 publication provides key STEM indicators and is published every two years. The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) compiles and analyzes STEM data, with detailed publications available on their website. Federal interest in STEM education can be traced back to the 1st Congress, with various institutions playing a central role in the effort. Before the United States celebrated its first centennial, key institutions like the National Academy of Sciences and the Department of Education were already in place. Federal STEM education policymaking intensified after World War II, leading to the creation of the National Science Foundation in 1950. The launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union in 1957 prompted the National Defense Education Act of 1958, considered the first federal foray into modern STEM education policy. Selected historical federal STEM education measures are included in this appendix. The Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance of 1787 were measures passed by the Continental Congress after the Revolutionary War. The Land Ordinance directed surveyors to establish townships in the Northwest Territories, with one lot reserved for a public school. The Northwest Ordinance established governments and civil liberties in the territories, emphasizing the importance of education for good government and happiness. The Marine Hospital Service Act of 1798 established the Marine Hospital Service to provide medical care for merchant seamen. This led to the creation of federal health agencies like the National Institute of Health (NIH). The Ransdell Act of 1930 re-designated the Hygienic Laboratory as the NIH and authorized fellowships. NIH funding in the 1930s-1950s focused on post-doctoral researchers and clinical traineeships, but in 1948 funds were awarded to improve undergraduate education. Congress established the National Research Service Award in 1974. The National Research Service Award (NRSA) was established by Congress in 1974 at NIH to improve undergraduate education. The Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 authorized the establishment of colleges in various fields, including agriculture and engineering. The Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 authorized colleges in agriculture, mechanic arts, English language, and various sciences. Repealed in 1981, replaced with focus on \"food and agricultural sciences.\" Colleges funded include MIT, Clemson University, and Historically Black Colleges. National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1950 established NSF to promote basic research and education in sciences. NSF began supporting STEM education in 1952 with fellowships and teacher institutes. The National Defense Education Act of 1958 aimed to improve STEM education by addressing imbalances in educational programs. It authorized the first federal student loan program, provided funds for science and math instruction, and grants for gifted student programs. This act paved the way for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 established federal education aid to states, with STEM provisions added in subsequent reauthorizations. The Higher Education Act of 1965 provides federal aid and support to institutions of higher education. The Higher Education Act (HEA) provides federal aid and support to institutions of higher education and student aid programs. The HEA was last amended in 2008 by the Higher Education Opportunity Act. The Department of Education Organization Act of 1979 established the Department of Education as an independent entity. The Department of Education Organization Act of 1979 (P.L. 96-88) established the Department of Education as an independent federal agency. It transferred science education programs from NSF to ED, excluding certain programs related to scientific career development, continuing education of scientific personnel, and research and development in science learning. Specific NSF programs transferred to ED included Elementary and Pre-school Science Teacher Training and Minority Institutions Science Improvement. The act only allowed for the transfer of existing programs at the time of enactment. The Education for Economic Security Act of 1984 (EESA) authorized teacher institutes, mathematics, and science education programs at the National Science Foundation. It also directed grants for STEM teacher training and development and authorized presidential awards for teaching in mathematics and science. This act was a response to concerns about international competitiveness following critical reports on the U.S. education system. The America COMPETES Act and its 2010 reauthorization authorized STEM education programs at federal science agencies and the Department of Education. It established a federal government-wide STEM education coordinating committee under the National Science and Technology Council."
