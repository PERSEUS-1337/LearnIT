    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Training for Realtime Writers Act of 2002\". Congress finds that the Federal Communications Commission has mandated closed captioning for television programs, with new programming required to be fully captioned by 2006. Over 28 million Americans are deaf or hard of hearing, with many needing captioning for participation in mainstream activities. Additionally, around 24,000 children are born in the US each year with some form of hearing loss. According to a study by the National Council on Aging, a significant percentage of Americans over the age of 65, 70, and 75 are hearing impaired. The study also suggests a link between hearing loss and depression in older adults. Additionally, enrollment in programs training court reporters as realtime writers has declined in the past 5 years, leading to closures of such programs on many campuses. Authorization of grant program to promote training and job placement of realtime writers. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration will provide grants to court reporting programs to train individuals as realtime writers for closed captioning of video programming. Eligible entities must be approved by the National Court Reporters Association, accredited by a recognized agency, and participate in student aid programs. Grants will be for a specified duration. A grant under this section is for a two-year period and may not exceed $1,000,000 for eligible entities. SEC. 4. APPLICATION. To apply for a grant under section 3, an eligible entity must submit an application to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration with specific information, including details on the training and assistance to be funded and performance measures for evaluating progress. The eligible entity must describe how they will ensure scholarship recipients are employed as realtime writers, continue training after the grant period, collaborate with local workforce boards to meet local goals, and create educational opportunities for disadvantaged or displaced workers. The eligible entity must provide information as required by the Administration, including details on how scholarship recipients will be employed as realtime writers, receive ongoing training, collaborate with local workforce boards, and create educational opportunities for disadvantaged or displaced workers. SEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS. An eligible entity receiving a grant under section 3 must use the funds for recruitment, training, job placement, and assistance for individuals, including those who have completed court reporting training. This includes scholarships based on financial need, distance learning, education, job placement, encouraging individuals with disabilities to pursue realtime writing careers, and employing personnel for these purposes. The scholarship under the Higher Education Act requires recipients to provide realtime writing services for a specified period. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration sets coursework and employment requirements, including repayment of scholarship amounts for non-compliance. The grant recipient must use no more than 5 percent of the grant amount for administrative costs. The grants should supplement, not replace, other funds for training and placing individuals as realtime writers. SEC. 6. REPORTS. Each eligible entity receiving a grant under section 3 must submit an annual report to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration detailing the use of grant funds and assessing the effectiveness of activities in increasing the number of realtime writers. The final report should also include a description of the best practices. The annual report for entities receiving grants must detail the best practices for increasing the number of trained, employed, and retained realtime writers. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005, and necessary sums for fiscal years 2006 and 2007."
