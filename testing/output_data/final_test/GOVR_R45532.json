    "content": "Some commentators and policymakers argue that MNCs in the digital economy are undertaxed or not paying a fair share of taxes due to their ability to provide services without physical presence and shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. The challenge lies in establishing the right to tax MNC profits in the digital economy, as transfer pricing rules can reduce taxable profits even if a country has the authority to tax them. The international tax law requires a substantial connection between a country and a corporation's activities to establish \"nexus\" for taxation. Permanent establishment criteria are outlined in tax treaties, often requiring a physical presence. Digital activities may not trigger permanent establishment rules due to the global nature of the internet. The internet allows global transactions without physical presence. Countries are considering \"digital presence\" criteria for taxation. Transfer pricing rules divide profits among countries in MNCs. Transfer pricing rules aim to prevent income shifting between related foreign companies and the U.S. Arm's-length standard can be challenging to apply in intra-company transactions within multinational corporations. Sophisticated transfer pricing strategies can lead to low effective tax rates for MNCs globally, especially in the digital economy where intangible assets play a significant role in income generation. Intangible assets, such as unique technologies and services, pose challenges for arm's-length pricing due to their uniqueness. Multinational corporations (MNCs) use tax planning methods to transfer ownership rights to low-tax jurisdictions, creating shell corporations for holding these assets. This strategy allows MNCs to reduce tax liabilities by selling income-earning ownership rights to subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions. A shell corporation is used to hold ownership of intangible assets, often through cost-sharing agreements where a foreign affiliate pays for technology rights and shares in development costs. This allows for income shifting and tax planning by multinational corporations. The use of shell corporations and cost-sharing agreements allows multinational corporations to shift income and engage in tax planning. This involves maximizing costs in higher-tax jurisdictions and increasing taxable income in lower-tax jurisdictions. For example, a U.S. corporation can establish a subsidiary in a jurisdiction with a 0% tax rate, allowing it to buy technology rights and shift earnings to that subsidiary. The Jersey subsidiary benefits from a tax agreement allowing it to use technology developed in the US for sales in Europe tax-free. Concerns over multinational corporations avoiding taxes have led to discussions and unilateral tax proposals in Europe. Efforts to tax the digital economy, particularly in Europe, have been driven by politicians and commentators, including the United Kingdom. The OECD and G-20 initiated the BEPS Project in 2013, leading to the 2015 BEPS Action Plan which addresses the implications of the digital economy on tax systems. Article 1 discusses new tax principles for taxing profits in the digital economy, including user interaction as a value-creating activity. It also considers the concept of \"significant economic presence\" for taxation purposes. Article 1 discusses new tax principles for taxing profits in the digital economy, including the concept of \"significant economic presence\" as a basis for taxation. The OECD BEPS report and various DST proposals in Europe also address digital taxation options, with a focus on user-value creation and the alignment of profits with value creation in the digital economy. The user-created value argument for DSTs has been a key point of discussion. Different perspectives on tax policy challenges in the digital economy exist, with some advocating for existing international tax frameworks, while others are satisfied with current BEPS recommendations. The task force aims to establish an international consensus on taxing the digital economy, with a final report expected in 2020. The European Commission has proposed expanding the definition of permanent establishment to include significant economic activity. The European Commission proposed expanding the definition of permanent establishment to include cases where a company has significant economic activity through a \"digital presence.\" This would allow EU members to tax profits generated in their jurisdiction even without a physical presence. The proposal includes criteria for a digital platform to establish a \"virtual permanent establishment\" in an EU member state. Additionally, an interim tax on certain revenue from digital activities is suggested until more systemic changes in permanent establishment rules are adopted. The European Commission proposed a digital services tax (DST) on companies with significant digital presence in the EU to address the challenges of taxing digital economy profits. The tax would apply to companies with annual revenues over \u20ac750 million and EU revenues over \u20ac50 million, with a 3% tax rate estimated to raise \u20ac5 billion annually. However, EU-wide proposals have stalled due to disagreements among member states and legal concerns. The Commission argues that current tax rules do not account for the value created by users in the digital economy. The European Commission proposed a digital services tax to address challenges in taxing digital economy profits. Current tax rules do not recognize the value created by users in the digital world, leading to a mismatch between value creation and tax payments. In the digital economy, value is generated through algorithms, user data, sales functions, and knowledge. User contributions, such as sharing preferences on social media, are monetized for targeted advertising, with profits often taxed in the country where advertising algorithms are developed. The European Commission proposed a digital services tax to address challenges in taxing digital economy profits. Despite disagreements among EU member states, the Ecofin Council met to consider the EU's DST proposal, which faced opposition. The issues are still under consideration by the council. The Ecofin Council discussed the EU's digital services tax proposal, which faced opposition. Despite this, individual EU member states can still impose their own national-level DSTs. Spain announced a 3% tax on certain digital services starting in 2019. The Conservative Party introduced a Digital Services Tax (DST) in the UK, levied at 2% on revenues from digital businesses with UK users. The tax applies to companies with revenues exceeding \u00a325 million per year from search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces. The UK Treasury introduced a Digital Services Tax (DST) at 2% on global revenues from search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces exceeding \u00a3500 million annually. The DST includes a safe harbor provision for \"loss-makers\" and a review clause for future international tax reform discussions. Legislation for the DST is expected in April 2020, aiming to raise \u00a3400m by 2022-2023 and \u00a3440m by 2023-2024. This tax is seen as interim action until a comprehensive method is determined for taxing income from multinational digital businesses. The French government announced a Digital Services Tax (DST) starting in 2019 to raise \u20ac500 million annually. The decision was made after EU finance ministers failed to agree on a EU-wide DST. The tax is motivated by perceived unfairness in taxes paid by foreign corporations compared to domestic ones. Details on activities covered and tax rate were not provided initially. The report discusses the fundamentals of a corporate profits tax and justifications for Digital Services Taxes (DSTs). DSTs are seen as a selective tax on revenue, not corporate profits, which tax the return on investment in the corporate sector. Investment can be in tangible or intangible assets, with eventual earnings taxed. The earnings generated by assets owned by corporations are taxed under the corporate profits tax, with the first right to tax income at its physical source. The location of a corporation's customers does not determine the country's right to tax its income. Countries may impose a residual tax on foreign-source income earned from overseas. The United States taxes income from foreign branches currently, while most countries do not tax foreign-source income unless it can be easily shifted to low-tax countries. European Commission sees their DST proposal as an extension of corporate income taxes, while the UK's DST is considered a gross receipts tax, not an income tax. The curr_chunk discusses the distinction between a digital services tax (DST) and an income tax, highlighting that DSTs are not structured as taxes on corporate profits but as turnover taxes based on revenue generated from taxable activities. International tax rules justify a country's right to tax a multinational corporation's profits based on ownership of assets, not just because residents purchase goods or services. The first section of the Appendix illustrates how a DST may impact a firm's after-tax profits differently than an income tax. DSTs are compared to excise taxes on intermediate services in supply chains, with the economic burden likely falling on purchasers of taxable services and consumers downstream. Under specific market conditions, DSTs could reduce corporate profits. Proponents of Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) argue that multinational corporations (MNCs) in the digital economy are not paying enough taxes globally due to tax planning strategies. DSTs could potentially reduce corporate profits, even though they are not structured as a tax on profits. It may be challenging to prove that digital economy firms earn supernormal profits or have monopolistic power in their markets. Tax planning strategies for multinational corporations (MNCs) in the digital economy involve avoiding permanent establishments in high-tax jurisdictions, using transfer pricing to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions, debt and earnings stripping, avoiding withholding taxes, and contract manufacturing. Critics argue that Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) may not recoup lost revenues from profit shifting practices, as the country imposing the tax may not have the right to tax the corporation's income. Tax strategies used by multinational corporations to pay little to no tax have been criticized for enabling profit shifting. Recent investigations into tax benefits for firms like McDonald's and Starbucks show that profit shifting is not limited to the digital economy. Changes in tax policies in various countries aim to reduce incentives for aggressive profit shifting. The tax policies in the United States, under P.L. 115-97, have reduced incentives for profit shifting by multinational corporations. Changes include lowering the corporate tax rate, implementing \"Thin capitalization\" rules, and imposing a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) imposes a minimum tax rate on the intangible income of Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs). It serves as a \"floor\" for tax owed by firms that previously sought out low-tax jurisdictions for their intangible assets. Additionally, a deemed repatriation tax applies to accumulated post-1986 earnings held abroad by U.S. multinational corporations. Inverting companies face penalties such as higher tax rates on stock compensation for executives. Some European countries are changing tax policies to prevent tax avoidance by digital economy multinational corporations. For example, Ireland is phasing out the \"double Irish sandwich\" tax provision by 2020, which allowed firms to reduce their tax rates on cross-border income and shift profits to tax havens. The Netherlands is also considering imposing a withholding tax on royalty payments to low-tax jurisdictions. The Netherlands is considering imposing a withholding tax on royalty payments to low-tax jurisdictions by 2021, reducing benefits of past tax-minimizing strategies used by multinational corporations. Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) are unlikely to affect profit-shifting behavior as they tax gross revenue, not net profits, allowing MNCs to continue shifting profits. The European Commission and United Kingdom argue that tax regimes do not adequately tax the \"value\" created by user contributions and behavioral data in the digital economy. User-based value creation is seen in platforms benefiting from \"network effects,\" where one user's contributions benefit others, drawing more users to the platform. For example, a UK user creating a video on YouTube generates more advertising revenue for the platform as it is shared among other users. Yelp generates revenue from targeted advertising on its platform, with user contributions increasing advertising revenue. Critics argue that digital economy business models do not pose unique challenges to tax frameworks. Companies in the digital economy often operate in two-sided markets, using revenue from one side to subsidize services on the other side. The digital economy operates on a two-sided market model where revenue from one side subsidizes services on the other side. This business model is not new, as seen in the historical example of radio and television broadcasting. Taxing advertising revenues from foreign companies targeting local users is a contentious issue. The digital economy operates on a two-sided market model where revenue from one side subsidizes services on the other side. France does not have the right to tax a U.S. social media firm's advertising revenue as the value is created by the companies themselves through innovations and assets, not by individual users. User contributions are viewed as inputs to the digital economy platforms. User contributions in the digital economy can be seen as inputs to business models, with little market value on their own. Any income earned from selling data would be taxed, similar to how Airbnb hosts and YouTube influencers pay taxes on their earnings. User contributions can also be seen as a form of payment for digital services. The provision of digital services, known as \"direct provision,\" involves exchanging user data for free use of platforms like Google and Facebook. This transaction benefits both consumers and producers by maximizing economic welfare. Consumers value digital goods and services, while producers generate revenue from aggregated user data. Amazon's business model is similar to a catalog retail merchant that earns income by featuring manufacturers' products in its catalog. Customers place orders, and goods are shipped from outside their location. Customers do not create value in this transaction through their purchases. The location of the final consumer does not give countries the right to tax Amazon's revenues. Consumers in the digital economy create value through various activities like reviews and referrals, but this does not give countries the right to tax service providers' profits. Free marketing by consumers does not trigger tax liability based on their location. The digital economy has changed how consumer actions are relayed to others. Excise taxes are justified by economic principles and come in four common types: sumptuary taxes, regulatory taxes, benefit-based taxes, and luxury taxes. These taxes aim to correct market failures and fund government programs. Based on classifications of excise taxes, a DST primarily serves as a revenue raising measure and does not create negative spillovers to society. It is not a benefit-based tax or a more progressive method of financing government activities compared to income or consumption taxes. The economic efficiency of DSTs in Europe is analyzed in this report, focusing on their impact on consumer demand, producer supply, fairness, and tax compliance costs. DSTs may be regressive in financing government spending. Understanding the economic burden or incidence of the tax is crucial for estimating distortions in resource allocation. The economic burden or incidence of a tax, such as the Digital Services Tax (DST), can differ from the statutory incidence depending on market conditions. The DST is borne by firms providing covered services, with the economic impact varying based on market structure and characteristics. In a perfectly competitive market, firms subject to the Digital Services Tax (DST) can either exit the industry or pass the tax to consumers through higher prices. Spain levies its DST on firms providing digital advertisements based on revenue earned from showing ads to users with Spanish IP addresses. In a competitive market, firms subject to the Digital Services Tax (DST) can pass the tax to consumers through higher prices, leading to a decline in quantity demanded. The impact of the tax depends on the elasticity of companies purchasing internet advertising. Higher prices may result in lower consumer demand for the advertised product. A DST imposed on intermediary services can have ripple effects downstream within markets. Under perfect competition, the economic incidence of an upstream DST is ultimately borne by the final consumers of advertised products. Sellers of digital services with market power may bear part of the tax in the form of reduced profits. Market power can be derived from factors like lack of competition or the presence of complements. Some firms with market power can earn supernormal profits in the digital economy due to low production costs and operating in oligopolies or near-monopolies, like Google and Facebook. In the digital economy, firms like Google and Facebook can earn supernormal profits due to low production costs and operating in oligopolies or near-monopolies. However, arguments about supernormal profits may not provide clear indication, as competing firms can drive prices down close to marginal costs. Additionally, the structure of \"two-sided markets\" in the digital economy can impact competition, as seen with Google providing search engine results to users for free and selling advertising space to businesses. In the digital economy, firms like Google and Facebook compete for digital advertising against other firms. Digital economy firms also compete with traditional advertising methods, which can limit their ability to set prices significantly above production costs. When faced with a Digital Services Tax (DST), monopolists or firms with market power may bear some of the tax as lower profits. The extent to which the tax is passed on to companies buying advertising placement depends on market supply and demand elasticities. DSTs introduce distortions by reducing financial returns in digital economy industries. Investment in affected markets would decrease due to distortions caused by a Digital Services Tax (DST), which can shift investment away from digital economy firms and reduce demand for final goods. The exact magnitude of these changes varies based on supply and demand responsiveness in different markets. Distortions can also arise depending on how a country's DST is applied to different firms. The principle of vertical equity suggests that taxpayers with higher income should pay a greater share of taxes. Corporate income tax is mainly borne by shareholders, who are often in higher-income households. This has implications for the vertical equity analysis of Digital Services Taxes (DSTs). Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) tend to impact higher-income households more, while excise taxes are usually passed on to consumers through higher prices. The equity effects of DSTs can vary based on the ability of firms to pass on the tax to consumers and the nature of the goods and services sold. For example, if companies can pass on higher advertising costs to customers, the effects of DSTs can be more progressive for luxury car sellers and more regressive for sellers of consumer household goods. Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) can have regressive effects, especially when compared to corporate profit taxes. They create economic inequalities between firms in and outside the digital economy, allowing for profit shifting and aggressive transfer pricing to reduce taxes owed. DSTs also lead to unequal treatment and create disparities. Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) create inequalities for firms based on exemptions and thresholds, leading to concerns of inequitable treatment between different sectors. The thresholds are drawn arbitrarily, potentially excluding domestic MNCs or targeting a narrow set of foreign MNCs. Digital firms facing DST may raise prices or exit industry if tax is fully passed to consumers. MNCs bearing economic incidence of DST have lower return on investment compared to non-DST firms. UK DST's exemption for \"low profit\" firms may raise equity concerns, especially for foreign MNCs not subject to UK corporate income tax. The exemption for foreign MNCs under UK DST may lead to different tax rates for MNCs with similar global revenue. An alternative exemption based on global consolidated profits could pose administrative challenges. DSTs create issues for both public and private sectors in clarifying taxable activities and compliance costs. The decisions made by lawmakers and agencies could impact compliance costs with DST regimes. Technology poses challenges to implementing DST proposals, such as users opting out of data tracking and rerouting internet traffic to avoid taxes. VPN technology allows users to access websites from different locations, masking their true IP addresses. This can help users bypass restrictions and censorship. However, VPNs may not fully protect user IP addresses, as other methods can be used to uncover them. Despite this, using VPNs from servers outside of a taxing jurisdiction can reduce revenue collected from local users, leading to mismeasurement of revenue. Lawmakers writing Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) need to specify enforcement levels for companies to source revenues accurately to local users. More due diligence by companies to determine user sources may increase costs. DSTs may trade off between user privacy and tax revenue. The UK's proposed DST has administrative challenges and an exemption based on low UK profits could reduce revenue. The DST may result in reduced revenue for digital economy MNCs with subsidiaries in Europe. Low-profit UK subsidiaries may justify an exemption for the entire MNC group, allowing them to generate revenue from UK customers without paying income tax. This exemption does not apply to MNCs without UK subsidiaries. The low-profit exemption for UK subsidiaries of MNCs could lead to little to no revenue from the UK DST. Alternatively, the UK could consider basing the exemption on worldwide profits of the MNC. Book-tax differences exist in tax data reported by corporations, with varying rules for depreciation between accounting and actual tax policy. U.S. corporations can claim a tax credit against U.S. corporate income tax for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions to prevent double taxation. However, digital services taxes (DSTs) are not eligible for this credit as they are not considered income taxes under common bilateral tax treaty language. Countries like the UK do not intend for DST payments to be creditable against taxes owed in the MNC's home country. The IRS could clarify that U.S. bilateral income tax treaties do not allow for a foreign tax credit against U.S. tax for U.S. corporations making DST payments to foreign jurisdictions. Congress may need to pass legislation to deny a foreign tax credit for such payments, potentially increasing taxes for U.S. MNCs globally. Allowing DST payments to be creditable would mean U.S. taxpayers subsidizing tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, which some policymakers may disagree with. The GILTI tax serves as an alternative policy tool to impose higher effective tax rates on U.S. firms in the digital economy. Legislation proposed in Congress aimed to increase the GILTI tax rate and eliminate deductions for certain activities. DSTs are compared to excise taxes, but some proponents have not explicitly labeled them as such, creating uncertainty in international agreements. Some argue that Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) may violate World Trade Organization rules by discriminating against U.S. firms. Proponents see DSTs as interim measures until broader international tax reforms are adopted, aligning with the EU's goal of a consolidated tax base and formulary apportionment of corporate tax revenue. The formulary apportionment of corporate tax revenue based on factors like sales, assets, and employment could lead to a shift away from tax allocation based on assets. Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) align with the EU's goal of formulary apportionment tax and could be imposed by individual member states if consensus at the European Commission level is not reached. Congress could incentivize or penalize DST proponents, and there are debates among tax policy scholars on potential compromises that do not require major changes to international tax rules. Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) are not structured as taxes on profits like corporate taxes. Corporate profit is defined as total revenue minus total cost before taxes, while DST is levied as a percentage of total revenue. DSTs could be imposed by individual member states in the EU if consensus at the European Commission level is not reached. Congress could direct the executive branch to impose incentives or disincentives affecting key sectors of the EU economy. The after-tax profit for a corporation subject to a 3% income tax rate is greater than for a corporation subject to a 3% DST. DSTs are imposed as a percentage of total revenue, not on profits like corporate taxes. To analyze the economic effects of a DST, the different markets in which digital economy firms operate must be considered. In digital economies, firms operate in two-sided markets serving individual users and businesses. The economic effects of a DST are analyzed starting with business-to-business transactions, where the statutory incidence is typically imposed. For example, in markets like internet advertisements, marketplace sales, and user data sales, different parties act as consumers and sellers. In the market for user data sales, a data transfer firm could be the consumer and Facebook, Google, or Fitbit could the supplier. There are two extremes of market structure: perfect competition and monopoly. Monopolies are regulated and rarely exist in markets where DSTs apply. Firms may have market power due to barriers to entry. Analysis of a DST in a Competitive Market shows firms facing a downward-sloping demand curve with a perfectly elastic supply curve. In a perfectly competitive market, firms earn no economic profit and are price takers. When the government imposes an excise tax, firms pass on the cost to consumers or exit the market. The digital economy firms provide similar services, such as internet advertising and data transfer. The market can be narrowly focused on digital activities or broadly encompass consumer-related services. In a perfectly competitive market, firms earn no economic profit and are price takers. When the government imposes an excise tax, firms pass on the cost to consumers or exit the market. The digital economy firms provide internet advertising and data transfer services, competing in the market alongside television, print, and radio advertisers. Companies can choose to advertise on platforms like Facebook and Google, or collect data from various sources for consumer preferences. Figure A-1 and Figure A-2 illustrate the long-run effects of a DST in perfect competition. In a perfectly competitive market, firms pass on the cost of an excise tax to consumers or exit the market. Figure A-1 and Figure A-2 show the long-run effects of a DST in perfect competition with different demand curve slopes. Consumers demand less of the taxed service as price increases, with elastic and inelastic scenarios represented. The supply curves are flat, allowing suppliers to adjust capacity to meet consumer demand. The initial equilibrium before the tax is denoted by an asterisk, and the change after the tax is shown with a subscript. The tax is passed forward to consumers in the form of higher prices. In a perfectly competitive market, firms pass on the cost of an excise tax to consumers or exit the market. Imposition of a DST causes prices to rise and quantity demanded to fall in the market. The change in quantity can exceed the change in price in markets with relatively elastic demand due to the availability of near-substitutes. Imposition of a DST causes prices to rise and quantity demanded to fall in the market, especially in markets with relatively inelastic demand. The change in price may exceed the change in quantity due to factors like a lack of substitutes or strong preferences for certain services. Services subject to a DST are often intermediate inputs in the supply chain, requiring analysis of effects at each stage. Imposition of a DST causes prices to rise and quantity demanded to fall in the market, especially in markets with relatively inelastic demand. The effects of DSTs on price and quantity in downstream markets can lead to changes in consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss. Imposition of a DST causes prices to rise and quantity demanded to fall in the market, especially in markets with relatively inelastic demand. Producer surplus is the benefit to producers from selling a good or service at a price higher than their marginal cost of producing one additional unit. Deadweight loss is an inefficiency in the market typically introduced by government intervention, resulting in a loss in economic activity and potential losses to consumer or producer surpluses. Welfare analyses of the DSTs indicate they reduce consumer surplus, have no effect on producer surplus, and create deadweight loss inefficiencies. After the imposition of a DST, consumer welfare is reduced to area a, as producers increase costs leading to decreased consumer welfare. The revenue collected by the government is represented by area b, while area c signifies deadweight loss. Producer surplus is not affected in a perfectly competitive market. In a competitive market, producers are price takers and earn no economic profit. The differences in demand curve slopes in Figure A-1 and Figure A-2 result in varying impacts on consumer welfare, tax revenue, and deadweight losses. A relatively inelastic demand curve, as seen in Figure A-2, leads to higher consumer prices and increased government revenue. In a monopoly market, some argue that major firms in the digital economy have monopoly power due to network effects and dominant market positions. Digital economy platforms like Facebook and Amazon are seen as having monopoly power due to network effects and dominant market positions. However, some argue that this view is misguided as these platforms operate in two-sided markets and compete in areas like selling digital advertising space. Digital economy firms compete in various markets, including consumer product advertising against traditional mediums like television and print. Determining if firms have economic profits is challenging, as high accounting profits do not necessarily indicate economic profits. Economic profits consider opportunity costs and the risk involved in investments. In the digital economy, high accounting profits may not always indicate economic profits due to the risk involved in investments. A hypothetical monopoly market example illustrates the effects of a DST, where a single firm sells internet advertising, marketplace sales, or data transfers. In a monopoly market, the monopolist sets price and output at the intersection of marginal revenue and marginal cost to maximize profits. The monopolist faces increasing marginal costs and earns economic profits by charging a price higher than the average total cost. The effects of a DST on a monopoly market are illustrated in Figure A-4. A DST shifts the demand curve, leading to a decrease in quantity and an increase in price for consumers. The monopolist's economic profit decreases as a result of the tax. The presence of a monopoly market creates deadweight loss relative to a competitive market because the monopolist sets a higher price. Introducing a tax on top of the monopolist's distortions further increases the size of the deadweight loss in the market."
