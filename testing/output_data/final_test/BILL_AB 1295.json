    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 23363.1 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow distilled spirits manufacturers or craft distillers to conduct tastings of their products on or off their premises. Tastings off-site can only be done for events sponsored by nonprofit organizations, which must obtain a permit from the department. Nonprofit organizations exclude community colleges, higher learning institutions, and certain clubs or organizations. Tastings on licensee's premises are limited to 1.5 ounces per person per day, must only include authorized products, and cannot be served by individuals under 21. Licensees can provide free tastings but may charge for on-site tastings. Holders of a distilled spirits manufacturer's license are still liable for any violations. Craft Distiller's Licenses are added to the Business and Professions Code. The Craft Distillers Act of 2015 establishes Craft Distiller's Licenses in California under the three-tier system to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages. This system aims to prevent undue marketing influences, promote temperance, and create economic development in the distilled spirits industry. The Craft Distillers Act of 2015 in California aims to encourage the development of the craft distilling industry by providing limited exemptions to the three-tier system while supporting its regulation of distilled spirits sales. Craft distillers have increased employment and economic development in the state, and the act allows the department to issue craft distiller's licenses for commercial manufacture of distilled spirits. A licensed craft distiller in California can manufacture up to 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per fiscal year. They can package, rectify, mix, flavor, color, label, and export the spirits they manufacture. The distilled spirits can only be sold to specific license holders within the state or for out-of-state delivery or use. Craft distillers are also allowed to deal in warehouse receipts. A craft distiller's license in California is restricted from being issued to individuals or entities affiliated with those who manufacture more than 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per year. The fees for the license are consistent with a distilled spirits manufacturer's license and are subject to adjustments as per Section 23320. All fees collected for craft distiller's licenses are deposited into the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. Licensed craft distillers must report their distilled spirits production annually to the department for license renewal. If they no longer qualify for a craft distiller's license, it will be renewed as a distilled spirits manufacturer's license. Licensed craft distillers can sell up to 2.25 liters of distilled spirits per day per consumer in prepackaged containers during instructional tastings on their premises. Licensed craft distillers or their subsidiaries with a 51% interest can hold ownership or financial relationships in on-sale licenses, as long as all alcoholic beverages are purchased from California wholesale licensees. Licensed craft distillers or their subsidiaries with a 51% interest can hold ownership or financial relationships in on-sale licenses, as long as the number of distilled spirits items by brand offered for sale does not exceed 15% of the total, and the spirits are purchased from a California licensed craft distiller. Licensed craft distillers or their subsidiaries with a 51% interest can hold ownership or financial relationships in on-sale licenses, as long as the number of distilled spirits items by brand offered for sale does not exceed 15% of the total, and the spirits are purchased from a California licensed craft distiller. Additionally, they cannot have more than two on-sale licenses where they or any person with an interest in the craft distiller holds any interest, directly or indirectly. Licensed craft distillers or their subsidiaries with a 51% interest can hold ownership or financial relationships in on-sale licenses, as long as the number of distilled spirits items by brand offered for sale does not exceed 15% of the total, and the spirits are purchased from a California licensed craft distiller. They cannot have more than two on-sale licenses where they or any person with an interest in the craft distiller holds any interest, directly or indirectly. Additionally, a licensed craft distiller can maintain ownership in on-sale retail licenses even if they no longer qualify as a craft distiller, as long as the interest was acquired when they held a craft distiller's license. A craft distiller licensee can sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises in a bona fide eating place, as long as any products not made by the licensee are purchased from a licensed wholesaler. Beer, wine, and brandy can be used in food and beverages prepared for consumption on the premises. A licensed craft distiller can sell beers, wines, and distilled spirits on its premises during private events. Products not made by the distiller must be purchased from a licensed wholesaler. If the distiller no longer qualifies as a craft distiller, they can still hold the privileges granted by the section. Section 23771 of the Business and Professions Code is amended. Section 23771 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to restrict the issuance of certain distilled spirits licenses. Additionally, Section 23772 prohibits individuals holding certain licenses from having ownership interests in other types of licenses. The provisions of Section 23771 of the Business and Professions Code do not apply to certain license holders, including those with on-sale general licenses for clubs, club licenses, veterans' club licenses, and on-sale licenses for specific venues where alcoholic beverages are not directly provided by the manufacturer or wholesaler."
