Over $100 billion in federal grants, loans, and work-study funds are provided annually to millions of students. In the academic year 2015-2016, approximately 19.3 million undergraduates were enrolled in postsecondary education in the US. The report focuses on the income of undergraduate students, exploring the relationship between student income and demographics such as race and dependency status. It compares the income distribution of undergraduates with that of the national population without a postsecondary degree, using data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study and the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement. The data used in this report were primarily derived from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), a nationally representative study of students enrolled in postsecondary education focusing on how students finance their education. NPSAS is conducted by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) every four years, with the most recent study covering AY2015-2016. Data from the last six administrations of NPSAS (AY1995-1996 to AY2015-2016) are used to explore changes in postsecondary student characteristics over 20 years. The NPSAS data is used to analyze income characteristics of postsecondary students, including the relationship between income, demographics, and type of institution attended. Income is measured as a percentage of poverty guidelines, which account for family size and total income without needing adjustments for inflation over time. The income of postsecondary students is analyzed using NPSAS data, with a focus on the relationship between income, demographics, and the type of institution attended. Income is measured as a percentage of poverty guidelines, considering family size and total income. Studies show that low-income students are enrolling in postsecondary education at a higher rate than middle-income students in recent years. The NPSAS data provides a representative sample of all types of students across Title IV schools, but data for non-FAFSA filers may be less precise. In AY2015-2016, 70% of student respondents completed the FAFSA. The CPS ASEC, sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, provides annual estimates of poverty in the U.S. It is a monthly labor force survey used to calculate labor statistics like the unemployment rate. The ASEC asks about 18 types of income annually through professional interviewers, ensuring higher accuracy compared to self-filled surveys. The CPS ASEC survey, sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, collects data on household income. Despite limitations like sampling error, it is widely used for income analysis. This report uses CPS ASEC data from 2007, 2011, and 2015 to compare national and postsecondary population incomes. Assumptions and calculations were made to align income variables with NPSAS data, despite differences in household definitions. The report compares national and postsecondary population incomes using CPS ASEC data from 2007, 2011, and 2015. Assumptions and calculations were made to align income variables with NPSAS data. Federal student aid is determined by income, and FAFSA is used to assess financial aid eligibility. This section explores changes in the income distribution of postsecondary students. The report examines changes in income distribution among postsecondary students over time using NPSAS data on income as a percentage of poverty guidelines issued by HHS. Poverty guidelines are used in various social programs and student loan repayment plans. Five poverty bands were created for analysis based on these guidelines. The report analyzes income distribution among postsecondary students over time using poverty guidelines. Low-income students fall within the first two poverty bands, below 200% of the poverty guidelines. Poverty guidelines are indexed for inflation and used in social programs and student loan repayment plans. Postsecondary student enrollment has generally increased over the past two decades, reaching a peak of 23.0 million in AY2011-2012. Enrollment dropped to 19.3 million undergraduates in AY2015-2016. The report analyzes income distribution among postsecondary students over time using poverty guidelines, which are indexed for inflation and used in social programs and student loan repayment plans. The number of undergraduates dropped to 19.3 million in AY2015-2016. The proportion of students with income below 100% of the poverty guidelines increased significantly, reaching 31% of the undergraduate population. Over 50% of students had incomes below 200% of the poverty guideline in AY2011-2012 and AY2015-2016. The trend in enrollment of low-income students differed from that of students in upper and middle income categories. Enrollment trends show a decrease in upper-income and middle-income students from AY2007-2008 to AY2015-2016, while low-income student enrollment has increased. This suggests that institutions may be more effective at enrolling low-income students, and that economic benefits from higher education are becoming more apparent to low-income individuals. The income composition of undergraduate students has shifted, with a decline in middle and upper-income students and an increase in low-income students. This trend may reflect changes in the national population's income. The enrollment trends do not closely align with broader income trends in the general population, but show some alignment with income trends for traditional college-aged students. Differences in enrollment trends among income groups are evident, indicating a shift in the student population demographics. The racial composition of undergraduate students in AY2015-2016 shows that minority students accounted for nearly 50% of the population, with white students making up 53%. White students were overrepresented in higher income bands, while black and Hispanic students were overrepresented in lower income bands. In AY2015-2016, black and Hispanic students were overrepresented in lower income bands, with 70% of black students and 64% of Hispanic students having income below 200% of the poverty guidelines. Asian and other students had a relatively stable proportion across different poverty bands. The majority of undergraduate students had income below 200% of the poverty guidelines. Non-traditional students, specifically independent students, are defined by various criteria such as age, orphan status, military service, or emancipated minor status. Under the Higher Education Act (HEA), independent students are those who are on active duty in the Armed Forces, graduate or professional students, married, have legal dependents, or are verified as homeless or at risk of homelessness. Independent students make up a significant portion of the undergraduate population, especially those in the lowest poverty band. Dependent students, on the other hand, are treated as dependent students under the HEA. Nearly 70% of students in the lowest poverty band are independent students, while dependent students are overrepresented in the upper income bands. Dependent students constitute 76% of students with income of 500% and above of the poverty guidelines. Figures 3, 4, and 5 explore the concentration of low-income students within each dependency group and the types of institutions attended by students in different income categories, showing variation based on income levels. Figure 4 shows the distribution of students across different types of institutions based on income levels. Low-income students are more likely to attend public two-year institutions, while the likelihood of attending private for-profit institutions decreases as income increases. Figure 5 illustrates the selectivity of four-year institutions. Figure 5 shows the selectivity of four-year institutions attended by undergraduate students across different poverty bands. The percentage of students attending very selective institutions decreases as income levels increase, with a higher percentage of low-income students attending highly selective institutions compared to the second lowest poverty band. Overall, there is a trend of fewer low-income students attending open admission or minimally selective institutions as income increases. The NPSAS data shows that low-income students have higher enrollment levels in postsecondary education in recent years. The discussion focuses on students with income below 200% of the poverty guideline, comparing the income distribution of the national population with that of the undergraduate population. Figure 6 compares the income distribution of the national population aged 15 to 65 with postsecondary education. The data shows a growth in low-income national population and undergraduate students from 2007 to 2011. The number of low-income persons increased by 22%, while low-income undergraduates increased by 44%. Between 2011 and 2015, there was a slight increase in low-income persons but a drop in low-income students, possibly due to a decrease in postsecondary enrollment. The proportion of low-income individuals in the national population increased from 29% in 2007 to 34% in 2011 and 2015. Among enrolled undergraduates, low-income individuals accounted for 40% in 2007 and over 50% in 2011 and 2015. Data on potential enrollees aged 15-23 showed a growth in low-income students from 2007 to 2011. From 2007 to 2011, the number of low-income students aged 15-23 grew faster than the national population in that age range. The number of low-income potential enrollees increased by 13%, while enrolled students increased by 37%. In 2015, low-income undergraduates decreased by 6%, related to a drop in total student enrollment. Low-income individuals constituted a smaller portion of the undergraduate population in 2007 but similar shares in 2011 and 2015. Since the last reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, the number and proportion of low-income undergraduate students has increased, with low-income students now making up over 50% of the postsecondary undergraduate population. Certain student characteristics like race, age, and dependency status are associated with income, with independent undergraduate students labeled as \"non-traditional\" often having lower incomes. Nonwhite students account for nearly 50% of the undergraduate population. The student population in postsecondary education has seen an increase in low-income students, with nearly 50% being nonwhite. These students often attend community colleges or private for-profit institutions and are more likely to enroll in minimally selective institutions. The influx of low-income students may impact policies aimed at promoting access to higher education. Federal student aid programs have historically aimed to support students with financial need, and the data suggests that these policies have been effective in increasing access for low-income individuals. The data suggests federal policies have been effective in promoting access for low-income individuals in postsecondary education. However, challenges exist for middle- and upper-income students, with declining enrollment. Completion rates are higher in private nonprofit and public four-year institutions compared to public two-year and for-profit institutions, where low-income students are overrepresented. Policymakers must consider addressing these disparities in federal policies. Data shows that non-traditional and minority students make up 50% of the undergraduate population, facing unique challenges in postsecondary education. Policymakers need to consider how federal policies can support their success, especially in terms of enrollment and completion. Additionally, analyzing the distribution of students across poverty bands can help in targeting assistance programs for lower-income individuals. Family units in NPSAS align with HEA dependency definitions and are used to calculate expected family contributions (EFC). To analyze poverty bands, CPS ASEC data was adjusted to create family units resembling those on the FAFSA for EFC calculations. This methodology divides larger family households into smaller units to match income reported on the FAFSA. When calculating a student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC), the relevant family members included depend on the student's personal characteristics. The CPS allows for the separation of household members into distinct families for EFC calculation purposes. For example, a married individual without children would be considered. The EFC formula considers various criteria for identifying a person as \"independent,\" including age, marital status, and having dependents. Unmarried individuals aged 24 and older without children were treated as a separate family unit in the analysis. The EFC formula considers age, marital status, and dependents to identify independent individuals. Family income is calculated by summing each person's income in the family unit, assuming negligible impact from additional persons not captured in the analysis. The definition of income for EFC differs from CPS ASEC. The EFC formula considers adjusted gross income and various untaxed income sources, excluding some taxable income, while the CPS ASEC measure includes money income before taxes but excludes capital gains or noncash benefits. It was assumed that the two income measures are comparable for analysis."
