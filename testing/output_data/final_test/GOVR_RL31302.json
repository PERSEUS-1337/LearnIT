    "content": "The President requested additional funding for actions in the Middle East in a FY2003 supplemental request to Congress. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (P.L. 108-7) funded accounts through the end of FY2003 with an across-the-board rescission rate of 0.65%. H.R. 5120 and S. 2740 were legislative vehicles for regular appropriations in the 107th Congress. The House passed H.R. 5120 and the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 2740 in the 107th Congress. The President submitted the FY2003 budget to Congress in February 2002. The proposed budget would fund Treasury and General Government accounts at $18.7 billion. The House passed H.R. 5120 funding discretionary accounts at $18.5 billion, totaling $35.1 billion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 2740 funding discretionary accounts at $18.5 billion, totaling $34.8 billion. No further action was taken on either measure. The House passed H.R. 5120 funding discretionary accounts at $18.5 billion, totaling $35.1 billion, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 2740 funding discretionary accounts at $18.5 billion, totaling $34.8 billion. No further action was taken on either measure before the adjournment of the 107th Congress on November 22, 2002. Funding for the accounts was maintained at FY2002 levels through a series of continuing resolutions until the enactment of P.L. 108-7. The President sent a FY2003 supplemental request to Congress on March 25, 2003, seeking additional funding for actions in the Middle East affecting accounts within the Executive Office of the President and the Department of Homeland Security. Typically, Congress establishes a concurrent resolution for the government's budget and allocates discretionary funding levels to subcommittees. The discretionary funding allocations for FY2003 are still pending agreement between the House and Senate. Appropriations for the Department of the Treasury fund various law enforcement organizations, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, Secret Service, and others. The U.S. Postal Service mostly operates without federal funding support. The Postal Service receives federal funding for recovery costs after terrorist attacks in FY2002. Appropriations for the Executive Office of the President cover salaries and expenses for various agencies. Funding for drug control initiatives is distributed by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Office of Homeland Security is newly funded in FY2003. In FY2003, the Office of Homeland Security is a new entity funded through the Treasury and General Government appropriation. Independent agencies like the Federal Election Commission, General Services Administration, and others are also financed through this appropriation, which includes general titles with governmentwide restrictions and defined actions. The FY2003 omnibus funding bill includes provisions for drug-free workplaces, travel expenses for federal employees serving overseas, and reorganization of appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. The bill consolidates funding for Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and independent agencies into a subcommittee named Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies. The FY2003 omnibus funding bill requires a rescission to be applied to accounts, with instructions provided by the Office of Management and Budget. Agencies had one week to submit proposed rescissions, which had to be reflected in FY2003 funding reapportionments by March 7. The rescission had to be applied proportionally to all discretionary accounts in divisions A through K of P.L. 108-7. From October 1, 2002, until the enactment of P.L. 108-7, Treasury and General Government accounts were funded at FY2002 levels through continuing resolutions. Agencies faced spending restraints on activities like training and hiring, hindering their ability to enhance existing programs. For example, the IRS couldn't strengthen efforts to combat tax fraud and corporate tax shelters. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) mandated the transfer of various agencies from the Department of the Treasury and General Services Administration to the Department of Homeland Security. This included the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Customs Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and Federal Protective Service. Other functional responsibilities were also moved to the Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 mandated the transfer of agencies to the Department of Homeland Security. Funds appropriated for these entities were to be transferred to the new department for their intended purposes. A continuing resolution allowed the transfer of unobligated funds for establishing the department. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget proposed transferring $125 million from various accounts for this purpose. The funding decisions for agencies are increasingly referencing performance plans, goals, and measures set by the agencies. Specific goals and measures can be found in the Budget Appendix for some agency accounts. Bills are introduced in the House and Senate after the Committees on Appropriations have completed markup on the provisions. Subcommittees usually draft legislation. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have completed markup on provisions for funding decisions. Subcommittees draft legislation and accompanying reports, which are used by full committees for discussion and markup.

The conferees from the House and Senate agreed to the conference on February 13, 2003, and reported on House Report 108-10. The Department of the Treasury has various functions, including formulating economic policies and producing currency. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 impacted its operations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in late 2002, leading to a major revision in its operational profile. The department consists of departmental offices responsible for policy formulation and implementation, and operating bureaus that carry out specific duties. The bureaus, except for one, can be categorized into those with financial duties and those involved in law enforcement. Financial duties have been handled by various agencies under the Treasury Department. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in 2002, leading to a reorganization of its operations. The department includes offices for policy and bureaus for specific tasks. Most bureaus are either involved in financial duties or law enforcement. The IRS is an exception, handling both financial functions and law enforcement through tax administration. With the creation of DHS, law enforcement functions are expected to decrease. Agencies like the Secret Service, Customs Service, and Federal Law Enforcement Training Center are being transferred to DHS, while others like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms are moving to the Justice Department. Funding for Treasury is also affected by these changes. In FY2002, funding for Treasury operations totaled $15.042 billion under P.L. 107-67, with the IRS receiving the largest share at 63%. Other major accounts included Customs Service, Secret Service, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

The President's FY2003 budget requested funds for operation, maintenance, protection of buildings, and construction and design services. The President's FY2003 budget requested approximately $260 million for courthouse projects and $986 million for repairs and alterations of federal buildings. This includes funding for security improvements, a glass fragmentation program, a chlorofluorocarbons program, and antiterrorism efforts. The Electronic Government Fund remains a contentious issue between the President and Congress. The Blueprint proposed establishing an electronic government account with $10 million in 2002, growing to $100 million over three years to support interagency e-gov initiatives. Managed by OMB, the fund aimed to facilitate digital signatures, implement the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, and support projects operating across agency boundaries. The Bush Administration later doubled the allocated amount. The Bush Administration doubled the e-gov fund allocation to $20 million, established within the General Services Administration to support interagency projects for electronic activities. Congress appropriated $5 million for FY2002, with transfers to federal agencies delayed until a spending plan is approved. The Bush Administration increased the e-gov fund allocation to $20 million, with transfers to federal agencies delayed until a spending plan is approved. Congress recommended clarifying the fund's authorization status and highlighted the importance of interagency approaches for citizens to access federal services easily. The administration sought $45 million for the e-gov fund to develop 23 high priority Internet services. The fund aims to implement the Government Paperwork Elimination Act by October 2003. However, the House Appropriations Committee recommended only $5 million for the fund. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $5 million for the e-gov fund, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the full $45 million requested by the President.

Table 2 provides a comparison of key sections under discussion regarding governmentwide general provisions. Prior to the terrorist attacks, certain agencies were funded for functions related to countering terrorism. The Department of the Treasury does not have a specific counterterrorism fund, but funds have been allocated for counterterrorism efforts through the Emergency Response Fund established after the attacks. Different agencies have been allocated funds for various counterterrorism functions, with the Customs Service leading in preventing terrorists from entering the US and the Secret Service responsible for protecting officials and facilities. The Department of the Treasury is responsible for the security of officials and facilities, with the Secret Service leading in providing security plans for National Special Security Events. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is in charge of firearms and explosives. The General Services Administration manages federal buildings and real property, while also assisting agencies in maintaining procedures for detecting and responding to security incidents. The GSA operates the Federal Computer Incident Response Center to handle computer security incidents. The government has established an Office of Homeland Security within the Executive Office of the President, with funding recommended by both House and Senate committees. The purpose is to have a central focal point for handling computer security incidents and to enhance information-sharing programs. The Committee accommodated the executive branch by conducting an informal briefing instead of a regular hearing with the Director of the Office of Homeland Security. They expect information on the office's operations and funding to be more accessible through a new account. Witnesses testifying for this account should be prepared to answer questions. The account remained undefined at the adjournment of the 107th Congress. The funding for the Office of Homeland Security in Washington, DC was set at $19,398,000 by P.L. 108-7, lower than the Senate's proposed $24,844,000. The conference report also allocated $738,000 for a pilot program to centralize procurement services, but excluded $4,663,000 for costs related to the Nebraska Avenue complex operations. The conferees deferred consideration of $4,663,000 proposed for Nebraska Avenue operations due to availability of other funding sources. They support transferring $9,000,000 of FY2003 funds from the Office of Homeland Security to the Department of Homeland Security to address mail processing problems in the Executive Office of the President. The conferees support transferring $9,000,000 from the Office of Homeland Security to the Department of Homeland Security to address mail processing issues in the Executive Office of the President. The Department of Homeland Security will be established under P.L. 107-296, with units like the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Secret Service being transferred to the department. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms will also be renamed. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms will be renamed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and transferred to the Department of Justice. Additional funding requests for actions in the Middle East were sent to Congress, with $4.25 billion requested for homeland security requirements. The Department of Homeland Security would receive $3.5 billion, the Department of Justice $500 million, and the Executive Office of the President $250 million. The Office of Management and Budget is required to provide Congress with 15 days notice before any transfer is made. Under the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990, federal white collar employees are to receive annual adjustments based on changes in private sector salaries. The base pay adjustment for January 2003 will be 3.1%, with locality comparability payments made at the same rate as January 2002. The federal General Schedule net increase was 3.1% payable throughout the system. The General Schedule net increase for federal white collar employees in January 2003 was 3.1%, with an additional 1% increase applied to locality-based comparability payments through Executive Order 13291. The President's budget proposed a 2.6% federal civilian pay increase, but both House and Senate Committees supported a 4.1% adjustment to align with projected rates. The House-passed version includes a 4.1% federal civilian pay adjustment, to be absorbed by agencies, while the Senate committee version would increase salaries and expenses accounts to fund pay parity. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. Congress has limited wage rate adjustments in recent years. The Monroney Amendment extends out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel and federal officials' pay adjustments are based on ECI calculations, with a maximum rate of adjustment set at 3.1%. The General Schedule base pay is adjusted at a rate of 3.1% for federal officials in January 2003. The 1% increase in pay was only applied to locality pay, leaving officials' salaries unaffected. Judges require specific authorization for annual pay increases, with the authorization for the January 2002 increase found in the Commerce, State, Justice, and Judiciary appropriation. The authorization for the January 2003 increase was not enacted before Congress adjourned, but P.L. 108-6 (77) was later enacted to allow judges to receive the adjustment. The 108th Congress enacted P.L. 108-6 (77) to allow judges to receive retroactive pay increases. Presidents' salaries were increased to $400,000 per annum in 2001. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay. The House Committee addressed funding strategies for retirement benefits and health benefits for civilian employees, proposing individual agencies cover accrued costs starting in fiscal year 2003. The President's Budget requested additional funds in affected accounts to cover these costs, with the Committee reducing the requested amounts. The Committee reduced the President's request amounts to exclude the accrual funding proposal, pending legislative approval. The Senate Appropriations Committee also adjusted the funding data in response to the pending legislation. The Federal Retirement Program funds pensions for federal employees through contributions from employees and the government. Pensions under FERS are fully pre-funded, while those under CSRS are not fully pre-funded, leading to a substantial unfunded liability. Annual transfers from the general revenues of the U.S. help cover part of this unfunded liability. The unfunded liability of the CSRS is partially covered by annual transfers from the U.S. Treasury to the CSRDF. Additional contributions from federal agencies, as proposed in the Managerial Flexibility Act, would prevent further unfunded liability but not pay off the existing accrued liability. Increasing agency contributions to the CSRDF requires legislation and cannot be done under the existing regulatory authority of the Office of Personnel Management. The pre-funding proposal in the FY2003 Budget documents also affects federal retiree health plans. H.R. 5120 (107th Congress) dropped requirements related to costs. The House bill dropped requirements related to cost accounting standards for contracts under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. There was debate on the potential impact on federal employees. The Federal Employees Compensation Act provides workers compensation benefits for injured federal employees, with costs reimbursed by federal agencies to the Labor Department. The proposed legislation aims to charge administrative costs for the Federal Employees Compensation Act to each employing agency, rather than the Labor Department. This would increase agencies' incentive to improve workplace safety, with an estimated 4.5% surcharge on benefit costs. The U.S. Postal Service and Defense Department would bear the majority of these costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee will continue to fund administrative costs for child care through the Department of Labor. The Bush administration has proposed eliminating provisions for child care services for civilian employees in federally owned facilities. Payment to child care providers can be made in advance of services. The House and Senate bills do not propose repealing provisions for payment to child care providers in advance of services rendered. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about redundancies in cyber-security initiatives and directed OMB to submit a report detailing the initiatives and costs. The House Committee on Appropriations raised concerns about cyber-security initiatives and urged the adoption of uniform standards for government websites. They also criticized an OMB proposal for disregarding statutory requirements for government printing. The OMB Director issued a new policy allowing executive branch agencies to use private sector options for printing services if more efficient and cost-effective. This change in policy emphasized selecting services based on quality, cost, and delivery time. The OMB Director issued a new policy allowing executive branch agencies to use private sector options for printing services to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The House and Senate committees requested reports on how the new policy would impact federal printing costs and public access to government information. The Senate Committee on Appropriations strongly opposes the Office of Management and Budget's plans to ignore the statutory requirement for Government publications to be procured through the Government Printing Office. The committee directed the administration to abide by the law and expressed concerns about the government's role in providing digital services. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the government's role in providing digital services, urging the Administration to improve efficiency and quality. They emphasized the need for careful evaluation of E-government plans to avoid competition with private providers. The committee directed OMB to provide a blueprint for guiding e-government initiatives within 90 days. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a report detailing the process used by the e-government task force in reviewing and adopting initiatives from the President's budget. This includes evaluations of existing and proposed initiatives, determining which activities are governmental or non-governmental, and utilizing private sector support. The committee also highlighted concerns about potential competition with private providers in digital services. The Senate Committee on Appropriations is considering a new provision in bill S. 2740 to increase the private endowment requirement for future Presidential libraries from 20% to 40% of the facility's assessed value. This requirement offsets the public cost of maintaining the libraries, which are privately funded and later deeded to the federal government for operation by the National Archives. The Bush Administration has continued the policy of isolating Cuba with a trade embargo and restrictions on U.S. financial transactions. The 106th Congress passed a law allowing one-year export licenses for agricultural exports to Cuba, but private commercial financing is not permitted. Efforts have been made to ease sanctions on Cuba, including relaxing travel restrictions and the prohibition on private commercial financing for agricultural products. The 106th Congress passed a law allowing one-year export licenses for agricultural exports to Cuba, but private commercial financing is not permitted. Efforts have been made to ease sanctions on Cuba, including relaxing travel restrictions and the prohibition on private commercial financing for agricultural products. In the second session, the Senate approved its version of the 2002 \"Farm Bill,\" H.R. 2646, which included a provision that would have eliminated the prohibition on U.S. private commercial financing for agricultural sales to Cuba. The House version did not include this provision, and it was not included in the final congressional action on the bill. The issue of easing Cuba sanctions was debated during consideration of the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill. Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill stated they would recommend a veto if the legislation included loosening restrictions on travel to Cuba or private financing for U.S. agricultural exports. The House approved three Cuba sanctions amendments and rejected two, including a Flake amendment preventing funds from being used to enforce Treasury Department regulations on travel to Cuba. The House approved three Cuba sanctions amendments, including a Flake amendment allowing travel to Cuba and prohibiting restrictions on remittances. Another amendment by Moran (Kansas) prevents sanctions on private commercial sales of agricultural commodities and medicines. Some concerns were raised about the impact of these amendments on the embargo. The House rejected two Cuba amendments during consideration of H.R. 5120, one preventing funds from being used to enforce the economic embargo of Cuba and another limiting funds for travel restrictions to Cuba. Enforcement action against embargo violations could potentially occur in future years without funding limitations. The President certified to Congress conditions regarding biological weapons and terrorism. The Senate version of the Treasury Department appropriations measure includes a provision that no funds may be used to enforce travel regulations to Cuba. Additionally, no Treasury Department funds may be used by OFAC until certain conditions are met. The FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill included provisions to expedite processing of license applications for travel by OFAC. The Senate version did not ease travel restrictions but aimed to expedite action within 90 days. The final conference report did not include the provision. The conference report to the omnibus bill did not retain the provision expediting action on travel license applications. The FY2003 funding cycle was unusual as there was no formal agreement on a congressional budget resolution, leading to the House Committee on Appropriations issuing allocations for subcommittees. The FY2003 funding cycle was unusual as funding measures were not adopted before the fiscal year began, leading to funding being enacted almost two months into the next Congress. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 funded Treasury and General Government accounts at $34,653,476,000. The House Committee on Appropriations reported funding discretionary accounts at $18.5 billion, totaling $35.1 billion. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $18.5 billion for fiscal year 2003 operations, above the President's request by $538 million. The Subcommittee also allocated $200 million for election administration reform, with the total recommendation being $338 million above the President's request. They rejected the proposal to fund $250 million in base operations of the Customs Service through an increase in passenger processing fees. The Subcommittee funds base operations through a direct appropriation, providing support for homeland security efforts, drug trafficking programs, Customs Service modernization, GSA construction, and IRS technology upgrades. The Senate Committee on Appropriations filed S.Rept. 107-212 to accompany S. 2740, showing accounts funded at $34,766,450,000, exceeding the request by almost $500 million. The Subcommittee funds base operations through a direct appropriation, providing support for homeland security efforts, drug trafficking programs, Customs Service modernization, GSA construction, and IRS technology upgrades. The Senate Committee on Appropriations filed S.Rept. 107-212 to accompany S. 2740, showing accounts funded at $34,766,450,000, exceeding the request by almost $500 million. The increase reflects the committee's recommendation for pay parity provision funding. The curr_chunk provides detailed information on Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and General Government Appropriations for FY2003, sourced from the Conference Report on H.J.Res. 2. Figures for S. 2740 are also included, with a note that they do not reflect a 0.65% across-the-board rescission required by P.L. 108-7. The curr_chunk provides definitions of key budgetary terms such as account, appropriation, authorization, budget authority, and budget resolution. These terms are essential for understanding the federal budget process. The curr_chunk explains key budgetary terms like borrowing authority, budget resolution, continuing resolution, and direct spending. These terms are crucial for understanding the federal budget process. Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is budget authority provided in laws other than annual appropriations acts. It is distinguished from discretionary spending and is subject to PAGO rules. Outlays are payments made to fulfill obligations, while obligations are binding agreements that require payment. Federal funds encompass all government monies except trust funds. The PAGO process, established by the Budget Enforcement Act, ensures that revenue and direct spending legislation does not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus. It requires any deficit increase or surplus reduction to be offset by other legislation or sequestration. The reconciliation process allows Congress to adjust existing laws to match budget resolution levels. A revolving fund is an account where all income is kept. A reconciliation bill is used to adjust existing laws to match budget resolution levels. A revolving fund is an account where all income is available to finance operations without fiscal year limitation. Scorekeeping tracks congressional budgetary actions. Supplemental appropriations provide budget authority in addition to regular appropriations. Trust funds are designated for specific purposes, and user fees are charged for government services. Congress determines whether revenue from fees should go to the U.S. Treasury or the agency providing goods/services."
