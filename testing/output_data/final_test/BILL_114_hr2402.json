    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting Critical Infrastructure Act\" introduces a new section, SEC. 215A, under Part II of the Federal Power Act, aimed at the protection of information related to critical infrastructure. The Act \"Protecting Critical Infrastructure Act\" introduces SEC. 215A under the Federal Power Act, which prohibits public disclosure of protected electric security information and authorizes the Commission to designate and protect such information. The regulations and orders under SEC. 215A authorize sharing of protected electric security information among various authorities and entities in the United States. The Commission considers State commissions' role in reviewing investments, setting electric service rates, and ensuring system safety. They may also consider the Controlled Unclassified Information framework. Consultation with Canadian and Mexican authorities is required for sharing protected electric security information. The section allows voluntary sharing of protected electric security information with Canadian and Mexican authorities and bulk-power system stakeholders outside the US. It does not mandate sharing with federal, state, local, or tribal authorities. Information cannot be withheld from Congress, its committees, or the Comptroller General. The Commission must protect non-protected information when implementing this section. The Commission must protect only the minimum necessary information to safeguard the bulk-power system and distribution facilities. Information designated as protected electric security information cannot be withheld for more than 5 years unless re-designated. The Commission is required to remove the designation of protected electric security information from documents or electronic communications when necessary. The Commission can disclose information if it no longer poses a threat to the power system's security. Judicial review of designations is allowed under specific conditions. The determination under review involves examining electronic communications to assess if they were improperly designated as protected electric security information. Definitions for terms like bulk-power system and electromagnetic pulse are provided in this section. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a grid security threat, which includes the potential for malicious acts using electronic communication or electromagnetic pulses to disrupt essential electronic devices and communication networks in the bulk-power system. This threat could result in significant adverse effects on the system's security and reliability. The curr_chunk defines a grid security vulnerability as a weakness in the bulk-power system that could pose a substantial risk of disruption to essential electronic devices and communication networks in the event of a malicious act using electronic communication or an electromagnetic pulse. The curr_chunk defines protected electric security information as data designated by the Commission that specifically discusses grid security threats, vulnerabilities, or security plans. The curr_chunk provides a definition of protected electric security information as data related to grid security threats, vulnerabilities, or security plans that could be used maliciously to impair the bulk-power system. The curr_chunk amends sections of the Federal Power Act by inserting \"215A,\" after \"215,\" in certain provisions."
