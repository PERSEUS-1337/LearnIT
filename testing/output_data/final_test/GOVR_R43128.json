    "content": "Imports of Canadian oil sands-derived crude oil have significantly increased in the past decade, leading to interest from policymakers and stakeholders due to oil spills involving this material. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 addresses oil spill liability, cleanup, and compensation issues, with the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund providing federal funding for timely responses. The fund, managed by the National Pollution Funds Center, is financed through a per-barrel tax on domestic and imported crude oil and petroleum products. In 2017, the per-barrel tax on domestic and imported crude oil and petroleum products increased from 8 cents to 9 cents per barrel. The IRS concluded in 2011 that oil-sands-derived crude oils are not subject to this tax. The issue of taxing oil sands has been debated in recent Congresses and by the prior Administration. The 113th Congress introduced proposals to address this issue, but they did not progress. The 114th Congress showed considerable interest in this issue during the debate over the Keystone XL pipeline. Secretary of State John Kerry denied TransCanada a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, sparking mixed reactions from Congress and stakeholders. The report covers oil sands resources, the OSLTF, legislative activity, and concludes with observations on the oil sands/tar sands terminology. The terms \"oil sands\" and \"tar sands\" are used interchangeably to describe nonconventional oil deposits found worldwide. The Department of State refers to the material as oil sands in evaluating the Keystone XL pipeline, while the EPA also uses this term in discussing environmental impacts. This report adopts the term \"oil sands\" for deposits in the ground and \"oil-sands-derived crude oil\" for material imported into the United States. The term \"oil sands\" refers to a mixture of sand, clay, water, and bitumen, a form of crude oil. Bitumen is dense and viscous, resembling molasses, and is used to make asphalt. Oil sands deposits, particularly in Alberta, Canada, are one of the largest oil accumulations globally, mined for crude oil production. Canada's oil sands deposits are among the largest in the world, contributing to the country's high ranking in proven oil reserves. Production of oil-sands-derived crude oil has significantly increased. The Keystone XL pipeline, if approved, would transport oil-sands-derived crude oils from Alberta to the United States. Companies process or dilute the natural bitumen for pipeline transport, resulting in upgraded bitumen (SCO) and diluted bitumen (Dilbit). Dilbit is a blend of 25-30% condensate and 70-75% bitumen, making it lighter and easier to transport. Synbit is a mix of synthetic crude and bitumen, with a typical ratio of 50% each. Canada's crude oil imports to the US increased from 217 million barrels in 2005 to 587 million barrels in 2015, accounting for 22% of all imports. The figure shows that blended bitumen exports from Canada to the US have more than tripled since 2005 and are expected to drive most of the growth in oil sands production. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 addressed concerns about inadequate funding for oil spill response and damages recovery, leading to the establishment of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 led to the establishment of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, managed by the National Pollution Funds Center. The fund can be used for various purposes including payment of removal costs, assessment of natural resource injuries, and providing assistance to impacted parties. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 established the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, managed by the National Pollution Funds Center, to provide assistance to fishermen and aquaculture claimants impacted by oil spills. The NPFC has immediate access to $50 million annually for removal activities and natural resource damage assessment, with a per-incident cap of $1 billion for payments. Congress authorized the OSLTF after the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident, with OPA providing the necessary statutory authorization. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 established the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) after the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident. Congress imposed a 5-cent-per-barrel tax on oil to support the fund, which expired in 1994 but resumed in 2006. The tax rate increased to 8 cents in 2008 and to 9 cents in 2017. The tax is scheduled to terminate at the end of 2017, with the per-barrel oil tax being a primary source of revenue for the trust fund. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) receives revenue from various sources, including a per-barrel oil tax and other receipts like fines, penalties, and interest. Additional revenues are expected from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with BP paying $5.5 billion in Clean Water Act penalties, 20% of which will go to the OSLTF. BP will pay $5.5 billion in CWA penalties, with 20% going to the OSLTF. Annual payments of approximately $75 million will be made from 2017 to 2031. The OSLTF had a mechanism to suspend the per-barrel oil tax if the fund balance reached certain thresholds, but it was never put into practice. The fund was dormant until OPA in 1990 and tax legislation in 1989. In 1989, tax legislation amended the \"ceiling\" provisions for the per-barrel tax, suspending it if the fund balance reached $1 billion. The threshold was raised to $2.7 billion in 2005 and eliminated in 2008. The requirement to suspend the tax if the fund balance exceeded $2.7 billion was repealed in 2008 for simplification. Different legal contexts define \"oil\" differently. In different legal contexts, \"oil\" has varying meanings. For instance, in the context of OPA and OSLTF response authority, it differs from its meaning in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which established a per-barrel tax to finance the OSLTF. The IRC imposes a per-barrel tax on crude oil received at U.S. refineries and petroleum products entering the U.S. for consumption, use, or warehousing. Definitions for crude oil, petroleum products, and domestic crude oil are provided in Section 4612 of the IRC. The term 'petroleum product' includes crude oil. Sections 4611 and 4612 were enacted with the passage of CERCLA in 1980, establishing a per-barrel tax on oil to support the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund. Tar sands imported into the US are not subject to this tax, based on a 2011 IRS interpretation. The IRS memorandum supports the conclusion that \"tar sands\" are not subject to the per-barrel tax. In 1986, Congress established the OSLTF and amended IRC Section 4611 to fund the OSLTF, with the tax taking effect in 1990. Congressional committees included similar statements in reports leading up to the passage of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. Several CRS reports from the early 1980s indicate that tax code provisions were established to subsidize synthetic fuels development, with liquid from tar sands generally included in the synthetic fuel category. OPA liability and compensation provisions apply to a broader definition of oil compared to the IRC definition. The OPA definition of \"oil\" includes hazardous substances listed under CERCLA and subject to its provisions. Oil-sands-derived crude oil likely meets this definition but may not qualify for the OSLTF excise tax. This raises equity concerns regarding tax exemptions for certain crude oils. Some argue that the equity concern over the OSLTF excise tax on oil-sands-derived crude oil is exaggerated, citing the small tax amount compared to crude oil prices. It is uncertain if importers are paying the tax, but ExxonMobil admitted to paying it for oil involved in a spill. The IRS memo indicates that only the non-bitumen component of dilbit is taxed, not the bitumen component. The OSLTF serves as a backup for response funding during oil spills, with the trust fund available to support cleanup efforts. The responsible party typically provides the primary funding for cleanup, but the federal government can direct response activities. The OPA Section 1015 allows the Attorney General to intervene at the request of the Secretary. The OPA Section 1015 allows the Attorney General to recover costs from the OSLTF, minimizing the financial impact if payments are reimbursed by responsible parties. Liability limits vary by oil spill source, with onshore facilities having a limit of $634 million. Enbridge's estimated response costs for the Michigan pipeline spill exceed this limit. The company's response costs for an onshore facility could reach $1.2 billion, exceeding the liability limit. OPA allows reimbursement from the trust fund for costs and damages above the limit, with conditions such as gross negligence or violation of federal requirements. The OSLTF could pay up to $1 billion for costs and damages above the liability limit. The OSLTF excise tax has generated an average of $493 million per year since FY2010. Amending the IRC to include oil-sands-derived crude oils could increase tax revenue. The amount of increase would depend on whether importers of oil sands crude oil are currently exempt from the tax. An estimate suggests additional revenue could be obtained by subjecting oil-sands-derived crude oil to the excise tax. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting S. 953 (113th Congress) would generate $475 million in additional revenue between 2013 and 2018 by extending the per-barrel financing rate and amending the definition of crude oil. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget proposed including other sources of crudes in the OSLTF tax base, which could provide $127 million in additional revenue in FY2017. Issues may arise regarding the scope of oil covered by the OSLTF excise tax. Issues may arise regarding the scope of oil covered by the OSLTF excise tax, including potential tax implications for domestic crude oil used in or exported from the United States. The definition of \"domestic crude oil\" as any crude oil produced from a well located in the United States may be subject to interpretation. Proposed projects in Utah involve mining processes for oil sands extraction, with potential tax implications if Congress amends the definition of \"crude oil\" to include tar/oil sands. This could subject material from Canada to the tax in IRC Section 4611(a), while domestic crude oil extracted through mining techniques and not sent to a U.S. refinery may not meet the tax applicability in IRC Section 4611(b). S. 953 aims to amend Section 4611 by removing the phrase \"from a well located\" to address trade complications with Canada. The 1980 House committee report excludes synthetic petroleum, shale oil, liquids from coal, tar sands, biomass, or refined oil from the definition of crude oil for OSLTF excise tax provisions. Shale oil, also known as \"tight oil,\" is crude oil trapped in specific geologic formations, while oil shale contains kerogen, a solid organic matter. Oil shale contains kerogen, a solid organic matter that results in deposits of organic matter like crude oil. While significant quantities of shale/tight oil are being produced in the United States, oil shale deposits are not currently produced at a commercial scale. The term \"tight oil\" is preferred over shale oil as it can be found in non-shale rock formations and is extracted using similar processes like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Rapid growth in tight oil production has been enabled by advances in technology, with U.S. tight oil production surpassing 4.8 million barrels per day by the end of 2015. U.S. tight oil production exceeded 4.8 million barrels per day by the end of 2015, comprising over 50% of domestic crude oil production. The IRS determined that Bakken tight oil is subject to the per-barrel tax as it is not synthetic petroleum and does not require upgrading before refining. Legislation addressing this issue has not been proposed in the 115th Congress. Several Members proposed legislation in prior Congresses to include oil-sands-derived crude oils in the per-barrel tax. Bills like H.R. 214, S. 187, H.R. 1930, S. 1041, H.R. 2768, and S. 2400 were introduced in chronological order. Additionally, OSLTF amendments were offered to the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. Several Members in the 113th Congress proposed legislation to include oil-sands-derived crude oils in the per-barrel tax. Bills like S. 268, H.R. 786, and S. 953 were introduced in chronological order. The different definitions of \"oil\" in two related contexts may lead to OSLTF expenditures being used in certain situations. The OSLTF may use funds to address oil discharges not subject to the tax, potentially raising equity concerns. The IRS defines \"crude oil\" based on a 1980 committee report, with Canadian oil sands production increasing over time. Canadian oil sands production has steadily increased since 1980, with operations involving mining and upgrading bitumen to synthetic crude oil. In recent years, in situ operations blend bitumen with diluents for transport, raising questions about its classification as synthetic petroleum or liquids from tar sands. Some mining operations now blend bitumen for transport instead of upgrading. Policymakers may need to reexamine these classifications. The definition of \"crude oil\" in the tax code may need to be reevaluated if U.S. oil sands resources become viable for energy purposes."
