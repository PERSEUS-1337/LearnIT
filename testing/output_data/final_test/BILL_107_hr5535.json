    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge Complex Expansion and Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act\". The Congress recognizes the importance of the western basin of Lake Erie as part of the Great Lakes ecosystem and the efforts made by the US and Canada to restore water quality and fisheries. There is a shift towards an ecosystem approach that includes shoreline areas in the restoration efforts. The western basin of Lake Erie is a vital part of the Great Lakes ecosystem, receiving most of its flow from the Detroit River. It supports diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, with coastal wetlands hosting the largest variety of species in the Great Lakes region. The moderate climate and southern latitude of Lake Erie allow for unique species not found in the northern Great Lakes. The western basin of Lake Erie is home to over 300 plant species, including 37 significant species, in aquatic and wetland habitats. It contains the largest concentration of marshes in Lake Erie, providing important waterfowl habitat. Various bird species utilize the wetlands, making it a crucial ecosystem in the Great Lakes region. The western basin wetlands of Lake Erie are crucial for migration, nesting, and feeding of raptors, perching birds, and diving ducks. The area is a major stopover for migrating bufflehead, common goldeneye, common mergansers, and ruddy duck. Lake Erie is internationally recognized for its Ottawa and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges, as well as its reputation for walleye, perch, and bass fishing, recreational boating, birding, photography, and duck hunting. The tourism industry around Lake Erie generates over $1.5 billion in retail sales and supports more than 50,000 jobs. Coastal wetlands in the western basin of Lake Erie have been under intense pressure for 150 years, with only approximately 5,000 hectares remaining today out of the original 122,000 hectares. This has significantly impacted the ecosystem and wildlife in the area. Coastal wetlands in the western basin of Lake Erie have been greatly reduced over the years, with only about 5,000 hectares remaining today. The city of Monroe, Michigan, has had a significant impact on the wetlands at the mouth of the Raisin River, leaving only approximately 100 hectares unaltered. The remaining wetlands have been degraded by various stressors such as sediments, nutrients, contaminants, and exotic species. Coastal wetlands in the western basin of Lake Erie, like Bay Point and Woodtick, near the Ohio-Michigan border, have eroded over time, worsening shoreline erosion and affecting breeding grounds. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Refuge Complex\" as Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge Complex, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"International Refuge\" as Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. The boundaries of the Refuge Complex in Ohio are expanded to include lands and waters from Maumee Bay State Park to the Darby Unit, including the Bass Island archipelago. The Secretary has the authority to make boundary revisions as needed. The southern boundary of the International Refuge is extended to include additional lands. The International Refuge boundaries are extended south in Michigan to include more lands and waters east of Interstate Highway 75. The map referenced in subsection (a)(1) will be available for inspection at appropriate offices of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. SEC. 5 allows the Secretary to acquire lands within the Refuge Complex through donation, purchase, or exchange with owner consent. Federal properties within the Complex can be transferred to the Secretary for administration purposes. The Secretary administers federally owned lands within the Refuge Complex in accordance with relevant laws. Additional statutory authority may be used for conservation and recreational opportunities. The Refuge Complex is managed to strengthen existing resource programs and activities. The Refuge Complex is managed to provide habitats for migratory birds and wildlife, enhance conservation efforts in the western basin of Lake Erie, restore native aquatic and terrestrial communities, and foster partnerships with governmental and private organizations in the United States and Canada. The curr_chunk discusses collaboration between various entities to promote public awareness of Lake Erie's resources and advance goals outlined in the Great Lakes Strategy 2002. The curr_chunk focuses on the priority uses and cooperative agreements for the management of the Great Lakes basin ecosystem, including hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and environmental education. The Secretary encourages cooperation for the management of lands within the Refuge Complex to promote public awareness and participation in conservation efforts. Additionally, Ohio is urged to utilize existing authorities for funding trails development within the Complex. The Secretary will conduct a study of fish and wildlife habitat at dredge spoil disposal sites near the Maumee River. A report will be submitted to Congress within 18 months. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Department of the Interior for the acquisition, development, operation, maintenance of lands and waters within the Refuge Complex, as well as for conducting a study under section 7."
