    "content": "The United States Congress has a long history of engagement on U.S. policy toward Sudan, with a sustained bipartisan focus driven by advocacy groups and public awareness campaigns on issues ranging from famine to human rights violations. Peace and stability in Sudan and South Sudan are top U.S. foreign policy priorities, but remain elusive despite positive momentum and peace accords signed in 2005. The SPLM/A signed a peace agreement to end Africa's longest civil war, leading to South Sudan's secession in 2011. Despite ongoing violence and insecurity, efforts are being made to resolve conflicts and promote post-war recovery and reconciliation in the region. Progress in talks between the governments of Khartoum and Juba has been slow since their separation, with agreements on security and economic cooperation reached in 2012. Disputes over shared resources like oil and contested border areas remain unresolved, leading to skepticism about the latest accord. Security forces from both countries have clashed along the border, despite efforts to establish a demilitarized zone and joint monitoring mission. The agreement failed to resolve the status of contested border areas, including Abyei. Peacekeepers deployed in mid-2011 defused a stand-off between Sudanese and South Sudanese forces, but conflict persists in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. Local grievances against Khartoum have led to fighting, displacing over half a million people. Sudanese military may be responsible for war crimes in these states. The conflicts in Sudan's Darfur region complicate U.S. relations with both countries. Critics suggest a piecemeal approach to resolving conflicts has prolonged violence. Calls for a comprehensive agreement promoting democratic reform and lasting peace throughout Sudan have been made. Khartoum prefers separate negotiations with different opponents, leading to partially implemented agreements that do not fully address regional grievances. In Darfur, a 2011 peace agreement supported by the international community has failed to incorporate the region's largest armed groups, leading to deteriorating security conditions. Despite a relative reduction in violence, the conflict is far from a sustainable resolution. U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan and South Sudan Princeton Lyman highlighted the challenge in August 2012, stating that Sudan cannot address ongoing troubles in various regions without meeting demands for greater political space, wealth sharing, and democracy. The conflicts in Sudan have led to accusations of human rights violations, hindering the country's progress towards democracy. Opposition groups in Khartoum lack a unified vision for the future, but armed groups are cooperating to achieve regime change. Economic struggles between Sudan and South Sudan in 2012 caused hardship and budget shortfalls. The preliminary agreement in August 2012 between Sudan and South Sudan on financial arrangements, including oil exports, may allow production to resume by mid-2013. Both governments have faced revenue losses, leading to austerity budgets and prioritizing security over social services and development. Population displacement and food insecurity are significant issues in both countries, prompting them to seek assistance from donors and lenders to make up for lost oil revenue. U.S. policy towards Sudan has been influenced by Congressional actions, as the two countries have historically held opposing positions on regional issues. U.S. foreign aid to Sudan increased in the late 1970s due to Cold War alliances, but was cut off after the 1989 coup. Sudan was designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993. Efforts to tighten sanctions and provide aid to areas outside of Khartoum's control were initiated by Congress in 1999. In 2002, non-lethal assistance was appropriated for opposition forces. The Democratic Alliance, including the SPLM, aimed to protect civilians from attacks. Congress supported efforts for a negotiated settlement to Sudan's civil war. Later, Congress accused Khartoum of genocide in Darfur, leading to tighter sanctions and aid provisions. Additional sanctions were imposed in 2006 to resolve the Darfur conflict. The United States has been actively involved in pressing the Sudanese government to end abuses and facilitate a peaceful future for both Sudans. Congress has supported divestment efforts and imposed sanctions to address the Darfur conflict. The U.S. remains the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to both Sudan and South Sudan. Statutory restrictions limit U.S. development assistance to Sudan to humanitarian, health, demining, and democracy aid. South Sudan is a major recipient of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. has invested heavily in making South Sudan viable due to its significant humanitarian and development needs. U.S. spending on both Sudans has reached around $2 billion annually, mostly for humanitarian aid and peacekeeping operations. The levels and types of foreign aid to both Sudans may become a topic of debate as fiscal constraints and domestic priorities come into play. Sudan and South Sudan were unified for over fifty years but were internally divided, making them the largest country in Africa. After gaining independence from Anglo-Egyptian rule in 1956, Sudan experienced development disparities between the north and south due to colonial administration. Northern-led regimes promoting Islamist ideals dominated Sudan's political history, often imposing policies to centralize power in Khartoum. This led to ongoing conflict and unrest between the now-separate countries, reflecting deep political and cultural divisions that have plagued Sudan for decades. Government policies exacerbated Sudan's racial, cultural, and religious differences, leading to resistance from various ethnic and regional groups. Insurgencies in the south against Khartoum occurred in 1955-1972 and 1983-2005. Oil revenues primarily benefitted the north, financing government responses to domestic uprisings in the south, west, and east. Sudan's counter-insurgency campaigns in the south, west, and east were brutal, targeting both fighters and civilians. The SPLA rebel group was successful in gaining ground against the Sudanese military, despite internal divisions fueled by Khartoum. The civil war in Sudan resulted in over two million deaths, massive displacement, and suspended development in the south. The conflict in Darfur, which followed the civil war in Sudan, led to the training of local Arab militia by Khartoum to conduct brutal campaigns against rebels and civilians. This scorched earth policy was condemned as genocide by Secretary Powell and President Bush, resulting in a humanitarian crisis with millions displaced and hundreds of thousands becoming refugees. Casualty estimates vary widely, with studies suggesting between 100,000 and 500,000 deaths in the early stages of the conflict. The conflict in Darfur resulted in between 100,000 and 500,000 deaths in the early years, with many dying from malnutrition and disease. South Sudan declared independence in 2011, following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed after over two decades of civil war between north and south. The CPA aimed to address southern grievances within a unified Sudan. The CPA aimed to address southern grievances within a unified Sudan but failed to do so, leading to South Sudan's independence in 2011. Relations between the two countries deteriorated after independence, with tensions mounting in the borderlands. Talks have continued with some promising concessions made, but underlying security issues persist. Relations between Sudan and South Sudan have deteriorated due to underlying security issues. South Sudan accuses Khartoum of supporting militias in its territory, while Sudan accuses the SPLM of backing insurgent groups in the north. The Sudanese Armed Forces have conducted air strikes across the border, prompting conflicts like the seizure of Heglig. Despite their formal separation, tensions persist between the two countries. The CPA did not define the relationship between north and south in the event of separation, leading to unresolved issues such as border disputes, citizenship, and financial arrangements. Negotiations on these issues began in 2010 under the AUHIP, but many key aspects remain unimplemented. In 2010, the AU High-Level Implementation Panel on Sudan, led by Thabo Mbeki, worked to encourage Khartoum to recognize the south's referendum result. Sudan's military operations and human rights violations hindered support delivery. South Sudan's secession caused Sudan to lose 75% of its oil reserves, leading to financial strain. Oil revenues were to be split evenly between north and south per the CPA from 2005 to 2011. Once oil revenues began to accrue to Juba under the CPA, they comprised 98% of the south's total revenues. South Sudan remained reliant on northern infrastructure to export its oil through pipelines to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. Negotiations on the future management of South Sudan's petroleum sector, including pipeline rental and transit fees, were crucial as Sudan sought to offset the loss of its share of the south's oil revenues. South Sudan's counter-offers of under $1 per barrel for transit fees were significantly lower than Sudan's demands of $32-36 per barrel. The two countries are economically co-dependent due to South Sudan's reliance on Sudan's infrastructure for oil exports. However, the relationship soured after South Sudan shut down oil production in 2012, accusing Khartoum of diverting over $800 million worth of oil. South Sudan accused Khartoum of diverting over $800 million worth of oil and detaining outbound tankers. Sudan claimed South Sudan owed $1 billion in unpaid transit fees. South Sudan halted production and signed an agreement with Kenya to build a new pipeline to Lamu port. Experts believe finding capital for these projects will be challenging, leading to a massive loss of revenue for both governments. The parties have reached a tentative agreement in August 2012, finalized in late September, with Juba offering over $3 billion as a direct cash transfer to compensate Khartoum for lost revenues. Sudan expects international support to cover the remaining financial gap, anticipating increased income from lifted economic sanctions. South Sudan's concession to offer Sudan $3 billion, roughly 15% of its revenues over 3.5 years, is unprecedented. Some analysts believe it could be seen as a \"multi-billion dollar lifeline\" to President Bashir. Oil fields in South Sudan remain inactive after the August deal, tied to talks on security issues. Oil flows are expected to resume soon, but production and exports will take months to restart. Recovery of oil production and exports in South Sudan and Sudan will take months; repairs to damaged facilities may take up to a year. Both countries may need external assistance. Sudan's $40 billion debt, mostly to bilateral and commercial creditors, is a burden as it struggles with decreased oil revenues. Juba refuses to share the debt, citing no benefits received during the war. Sudan, burdened by a $40 billion debt, is facing challenges in making debt payments due to decreased oil revenues. Some donors, like the UK and US, have offered debt forgiveness if certain conditions are met. The US State Department requested $250 million in its FY2013 budget for potential debt relief commitments, but Congress has prohibited the obligation of funds until Sudan meets requirements related to human rights, terrorism, and outstanding CPA issues. Khartoum is unlikely to meet these conditions under current circumstances. Sudan is struggling to meet debt payments due to decreased oil revenues, with the US and UK offering debt forgiveness under certain conditions. Negotiations with Gulf States and China are ongoing. The border between Sudan and South Sudan, established by the British in 1956, remains disputed, complicating efforts to define it due to historical grievances and oil reserves. The African Union suggests a \"soft border\" to promote peaceful coexistence. Military presence is heavy in Abyei, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile. Heavy military deployments and unresolved political issues in regions like Abyei, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile have reignited conflicts, leading to the closure of the north-south border in 2011. Harsh penalties were imposed, including capital punishment. The parties agreed in a 2012 accord to re-open the border, but the referendum for Abyei's special status is yet to occur. The Abyei region is home to the Ngok Dinka and Misseriya groups, with tensions arising from accusations of settlement and arming by Khartoum. Territorial disputes over Abyei were fueled by its oil reserves, but production has since declined. The Abyei region's significance is now more political and cultural than oil-related. Disputes over the border and voter eligibility delayed the Abyei referendum, leading to clashes in 2011 and the displacement of 100,000 people. The UN Security Council authorized a peacekeeping operation, UNISFA, in response to the violence and tensions. The UN authorized the peacekeeping operation UNISFA in response to violence and tensions in the Abyei region. UNISFA, composed of Ethiopian troops, was tasked with broader border monitoring responsibilities. Despite the presence of UNISFA, the security situation in Abyei remains tense but stable, with only a fraction of the displaced returning. Sudanese and South Sudanese security forces maintained a presence in the area until mid-2012, when they withdrew. South Sudan alleges that some Sudanese soldiers remain in Abyei disguised as \"oil police.\" Some Sudanese soldiers remain in Abyei disguised as \"oil police,\" despite Khartoum's refusal to withdraw. Negotiations for Abyei's final status include options like ceding it to South Sudan, partitioning it, or placing it under international administration. Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, resource-rich areas along the border, face similar conflicts emblematic of Sudan's history. Unlike Abyei, they were not granted special administrative status under the CPA. The CPA proposed a \"popular consultation\" process for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, offering greater autonomy within Sudan. The Nuba Mountains region in Southern Kordofan faced severe human rights violations in the 1990s, with Khartoum denying aid access for 15 years. Residents relied on unauthorized relief flights due to bombings, leading Congress to push for aid delivery in the restricted areas. The CPA proposed a \"popular consultation\" process for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, offering greater autonomy within Sudan. Congress pushed for aid delivery in the restricted areas from the mid-1990s through the 2002 ceasefire. Local SPLM leaders formed the SPLM-N, mistrust of Khartoum remained high among supporters. State elections in Blue Nile proceeded under Governor Malik Agar, while in Southern Kordofan, elections were repeatedly postponed causing tensions. In May 2011, tensions were high during the election in Southern Kordofan where Khartoum's candidate, Ahmed Haroun, defeated the SPLM-N candidate. The Sudanese military demanded the withdrawal of local SPLA forces, leading to fighting in June 2011. The SPLM-N argued that the fighters were residents of the two states, not of South Sudanese origin, and that CPA-mandated processes were unfulfilled. The SPLA-N gained a military advantage in the conflict. The SPLA-N quickly gained a military advantage against the SAF in Southern Kordofan despite heavy aerial bombardment. Reports suggest the SAF and allied militia may be responsible for grave human rights violations, targeting civilians through violence and forced displacements. The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that actions by the Sudanese military in Southern Kordofan may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Concerns were raised about the government's indiscriminate aerial bombardments and scorched earth policies. In Blue Nile, violence erupted due to SPLA disarmament, leading to a state of emergency declaration by President Bashir and the formation of the Sudan Revolutionary Front aiming to overthrow the National Congress Party. The SPLM-N aims to overthrow the National Congress Party in Sudan and establish a democratic state. AU's attempts to mediate between Khartoum and SPLM-N have failed. President Bashir rejected a framework agreement on political and security arrangements in June 2011. The UN Security Council urged for a negotiated settlement based on the agreement. UNSCR 1997 (2011) established a peacekeeping operation in the two states, but Sudan did not consent. Access to populations in both states by relief agencies has been limited, leading to deteriorating humanitarian conditions. The government restrictions in Sudan have hindered residents from harvesting crops and accessing food and medicines. Refugees arriving in South Sudan and Ethiopia camps are malnourished, indicating dire conditions in the two states. Efforts by AU, U.N., and Arab League to secure access to areas held by SPLM-N have been unsuccessful. The deteriorating relationship between the NCP and SPLM has hindered a full-scale relief effort in conflict zones. Inflammatory rhetoric and cross-border incursions have fueled mistrust, complicating their relationship further. Khartoum insisted on security arrangements before implementing deals on outstanding issues, including southern oil exports. South Sudan's relationship with Sudanese rebel groups, particularly the SPLM-N, remains ambiguous despite formally separating in 2011. Senior SPLM-N officials have ties to the SPLM leadership, but the government denies any formal link to the insurgency. The relationship between the SPLA and SPLA-N is complicated, with experts suggesting Juba no longer maintains control over the armed units in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. The Small Arms Survey reports that the SPLA-N receives military support from the SPLA but mainly relies on capturing SAF weapons. Allegations of South Sudanese military support for other SRF groups are unverified, but reports suggest these groups find safe haven in South Sudan. The U.N. Security Council focuses on Sudan-South Sudan issues and envisions two economically prosperous states living peacefully. UNSCR 2046 (2012) set expectations for agreements between the parties by August 2, 2012, which were not met. The Republic of South Sudan, established in 2011 after years of war, faces significant challenges with low human development indicators, sparse infrastructure, and high food insecurity. Despite abundant natural resources and agricultural potential, limited infrastructure hinders access to markets. The government's decision to halt oil production has further impacted the country's development. The government's decision to halt oil production in South Sudan is expected to significantly delay post-war recovery despite international goodwill and donor resources. The population supports the government despite rising pessimism about the economy and service delivery. Development challenges include low literacy rates, dependence on subsistence farming, and limited resources due to conflict, displacement, and environmental shocks. The halt in oil production in South Sudan will strain limited resources and hinder post-war recovery efforts. Austerity measures will delay infrastructure development and foreign investment, while the government's ability to fund security and rule of law sectors is uncertain without new loans or grants. Donors urge South Sudan to improve fiscal discipline and transparency before providing additional support. The United States is the largest donor to South Sudan and has invested resources in the country's development. In December 2011, a conference was held to showcase South Sudan's priorities to foreign investors. South Sudan joined the World Bank and IMF in April 2012, receiving technical assistance. Despite eligibility for financing, short-term relief is not expected in 2012. East African countries are also contributing to South Sudan's development efforts. South Sudan faces challenges with high-level corruption, with President Salva Kiir suspecting senior officials of embezzling billions of dollars in government revenues. The Auditor-General confirmed at least $1 billion in missing funds, including from a scandal involving undelivered grain imports. Despite offering amnesty, no officials have been prosecuted, prompting concerns about the government's credibility. The South Sudan government, dominated by the SPLM, faces challenges with high-level corruption. President Salva Kiir suspects senior officials of embezzling billions of dollars, with at least $1 billion in missing funds confirmed by the Auditor-General. Amnesty has been offered to those who return missing funds, but the government's credibility is at stake. The government's capacity is limited, and it must adopt a permanent constitution and transition to fully elected national and local governments by 2014. South Sudan is urged to develop democratic governance, deliver services, and uphold the rule of law. Pressure from human rights groups and donors to hold security forces accountable for abuses. Legal frameworks for protecting rights, addressing property ownership and labor rights are crucial benchmarks. Persistent security threats include armed cattle raids and ethnic conflicts. Localized insecurity is a significant concern due to the abundance of small arms. The SPLM in South Sudan faced internal ethnic conflicts in the 1990s, leading to ongoing tensions. Boundary disputes with Sudan pose a threat, with both sides having troops near the border. Militias complicate stabilization efforts, with the SPLA vulnerable to air strikes. Thousands of fighters from militias have been integrated into South Sudan's military as part of reconciliation efforts. Several militias emerged in South Sudan after the 2010 elections, with some accusing Khartoum of supporting them. David Yau Yau's militia in Jonglei state is a growing concern, while militias in Unity and Upper Nile states also pose a threat. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), previously supported by Khartoum, continues to threaten South Sudanese communities near the borders of the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Accusations of Khartoum resuming support for the LRA in 2012 have been made by South Sudan and Uganda. In South Sudan, interethnic violence has increased, with retaliatory attacks displacing populations. The UN Mission in South Sudan faces logistical challenges in deploying peacekeepers. The SPLA's civilian disarmament campaign in Jonglei state has received mixed reviews. The civilian disarmament campaign in South Sudan has raised concerns about equitable enforcement. Militia activity in Jonglei has led to tensions among Nuer and Murle communities, questioning the government and UNMISS's ability to protect civilians. The SPLA's role in internal security is significant due to the police service's lack of capacity. Some SPLA activities have caused tensions with communities, resulting in displacement and deaths, with documented human rights violations by SPLA troops. Military justice has been applied to some accused of serious abuses. Some SPLA officers accused of serious abuses have faced military justice, but the presence of senior officers in the government raises concerns about democratic civilian control. Governance skills and democratic concepts are being promoted through donor programs in South Sudan. The country's poor road infrastructure limits access during the rainy season, making humanitarian operations costly. Recent flooding has affected communities, and the lack of all-weather roads to refugee camps has forced aid agencies to airlift relief at high expense. The rainy season in South Sudan has led to flooding, causing water-borne diseases in refugee camps. Mortality and malnutrition rates are high, prompting aid agencies to improve conditions. Yida camp, the largest refugee settlement, faces security concerns near the Sudan border. Inaccessibility by road forces aid agencies to airlift relief at great cost. Insecurity in the country hinders access to internally displaced populations. Refugees resist relocation despite safety risks. Isolated incidents of harassment of relief workers in Sudan have increased, leading to complaints from donors in Juba. The country faces social, political, and economic challenges similar to those of its southern neighbor. President Bashir's party has managed to prevent large-scale protests, but economic pressure is rising. Student-led uprisings in 2012 were met with a swift response from security forces. Despite warnings against excessive force, police killed protesters in Darfur. The government's use of torture and lengthy detention without trial has drawn criticism from the U.S. The Sudanese government's use of torture and lengthy detention without trial has drawn criticism from the U.S. and others. Rifts within the NCP and armed services are becoming more apparent, with decision-making consolidated among hardliners in the military. The government is struggling with armed insurgencies in Darfur, as well as rebellions in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, leading to economic challenges and international condemnation. Sudan's economic growth has slowed, and its willingness to use force against restive regions has hindered normalizing relations with Western countries. Sudan relies on other countries for financing and arms acquisitions, leading to economic strain and political pressure on President Bashir. The government's military operations burden the tight budget, hindering foreign investment. Opposition parties call for political reforms, including a new constitution. The National Consensus Forces (NCF) in Sudan are advocating for political reforms, such as a new constitution to protect rights and pluralism. The NCF includes opposition parties like the Umma Party, DUP, and Communist party, as well as former members of the National Islamic Front. They criticize the 2010 elections won by Bashir, calling for a national dialogue involving all parties. Sudan's opposition groups aim to change the government in Khartoum, but have differing visions for post-NCP governance. Urban Sudanese youth have been leading anti-government protests. The young urban Sudanese leading the anti-government protests are not formally affiliated with any opposition party. Traditional parties are seen as ineffective, with calls for internal reform within the ruling NCP due to corruption allegations. Efforts to draft a new constitution are viewed skeptically as unlikely to bring significant change. The government is becoming more sensitive to criticism, especially regarding austerity measures. The government in Sudan is increasingly sensitive to criticism, especially regarding austerity measures and subsidy cuts. There have been incidents of harassment of newspapers in 2012. The potential threats to President Bashir's rule come from rival party members, segments of the security forces, and his former ally turned political rival, Hassan al Turabi. Sudan has been designated as a Country of Particular Concern for religious freedom violations, with strict laws against blasphemy, defamation of Islam, and apostasy. Laws against indecent dress and other moral offenses are also enforced. Reports suggest that religious freedom violations are increasing in Sudan, with state-sanctioned \"hate speech\" by Islamic clerics on the rise. Salafism's influence is growing, leading to attacks on churches and Sufi Muslim sites. Salafist groups are targeting opposition groups, issuing fatwas against political figures. The government's response to protests against Western embassies in 2012 drew criticism, with protesters setting fire to the Germany Embassy. Protesters set fire to the Germany Embassy and two were killed in demonstrations outside the U.S. Embassy. Around 4,000 people were involved in the protests after Friday prayers. Vice President Biden called Sudanese government to protect diplomatic facilities. Additional police were deployed near embassies but rejected U.S. plan to deploy Marines. Non-emergency U.S. diplomatic personnel were evacuated from Khartoum. Darfur conflict remains unresolved despite peace agreements and large peacekeeping operation. The Darfur conflict, described as the worst humanitarian crisis, involved tensions over land and resources among Darfuri groups. Arms flows from internal and external actors fueled violence, leading to widespread atrocities and displacement. Despite a massive humanitarian response in the mid-2000s, insecurity in the region continues, with almost two million displaced persons. Continuing insecurity in Darfur has prevented nearly two million displaced persons from returning home, leading to a large semi-urban population reliant on food aid. Efforts to mediate peace have been hindered by rebel group fragmentation. The Doha Document for Peace in Darfur was signed in 2011, resulting in the creation of two new states in the region. The creation of the Darfur Regional Authority (DRA) has not led to promised investments in the region, with provisions of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) remaining unimplemented. Khartoum is accused of using territorial divisions to weaken opposition groups, shifting support to new non-Arab militias to stoke ethnic tensions. Darfuri insurgent groups like JEM and SLA have rejected the DDPD. The Congress Party and main factions of the Sudan Liberation Army rejected the DDPD and aligned with the SPLM-N under the Sudan Revolutionary Front. Despite a UN arms embargo on Darfur since 2004, there is still a significant presence of weaponry in the region, much of it from China, Russia, and Belarus. Reports indicate that arms supplies to Sudanese government forces and militias in Darfur have been largely unimpeded by international efforts, including the UN arms embargo. In 2005, the embargo was expanded to ban offensive military flights in the region, which Sudan violated. President Bashir's reconciliation with President Idriss D\u00e9by in Chad seems to be holding, with both sides stopping support for rebels in each other's territory. Weapons flows from Chad and Libya have decreased. The government has restricted the movements of UNAMID, hindering its resupply and mandate implementation. UNAMID is the largest peacekeeping operation globally, but the U.N. Security Council voted to downsize it in 2012. The United States has had conflicting aims in Sudan, with a focus on ending human suffering and rights violations. U.S. policy has been criticized for prioritizing one conflict over another, despite playing a key role in the north-south peace process. Critics suggest a shift in focus from monitoring progress on the CPA implementation. The actors shifted focus from monitoring CPA implementation to the Darfur crisis, neglecting pressure on Juba and Khartoum. Attention returned to the south for the 2011 referendum, sidelining Darfur mediation. In late September 2012, the SAF conducted air strikes in Southern Kordofan and North Darfur. Negotiating humanitarian access required compromise, moderating calls for confrontation with Bashir's regime. U.S. pursued counterterrorism objectives, seeking dialogue with Khartoum. U.S. policy towards Sudan shifted from isolation in the 1990s to increased diplomatic engagement under President George W. Bush. Relations deteriorated after Sudan expelled Osama bin Laden in 1996 and the U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa in 1998. By 1999, the policy approach began to shift towards dialogue and cooperation with Khartoum. President Clinton appointed Harry Johnston as a special envoy for a new peace process in Sudan. Under President Bush, talks on terrorism began, leading to the formation of a Sudan Task Force. Special envoy John Danforth proposed confidence-building measures for the north-south war, which both parties accepted, advancing the peace process. The U.S. government remained neutral on unity or separation during the CPA talks. In 2002, the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum reopened after suspending operations in 1996. By 2004, attention on Darfur increased, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. In September 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell testified before Congress that the government of Sudan and Janjaweed militias had committed genocide in Darfur, citing a pattern of atrocities against non-Arab villagers. Powell implicated the military in the attacks and declared evidence of intent to destroy a group under the 1948 Convention. The International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur recommended individuals be investigated for crimes against humanity, leading to the ICC's first referral. US media attention on Darfur from 2004 led to calls for military intervention, but concerns about undermining peace processes and Sudan's compliance with peacekeeping operations hindered action. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick was sent to address the situation. In 2006, Bush envoy Andrew Natsios threatened a \"Plan B\" if attacks on civilians persisted in Darfur. The ICC issued arrest warrants related to Darfur in 2007, and in 2008, the Prosecutor applied for an arrest warrant for Bashir. The Bush Administration rejected calls to suspend the ICC referral, leading to Sudan denying a visa to Special Envoy Rich Williamson. Sudan's policy in Darfur continues to be a concern. The Obama Administration initially showed a strong stance against Khartoum's tactics in Darfur, with key figures like Samantha Power advocating for intervention to stop the violence and genocide. Sudan's government has created a chaotic environment in Darfur by manipulating tribal divisions and creating militias, leading to a lawless situation that they can no longer control. In 2007, Susan Rice, appointed as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations by President Obama, called for tougher sanctions on Khartoum, unity among rebel groups in Darfur, a negotiated agreement to end the conflict, and the enforcement of a no-fly zone with NATO. She urged Congress to authorize the use of force to stop the genocide. Biden, Obama, and Clinton previously cosponsored a resolution urging immediate action to stop violence in Darfur, including a no-fly zone. Obama emphasized a \"moral imperative\" to address the situation. President Obama appointed a new special envoy, Major General Scott Gration, in 2009 to address the violence in Darfur. A new policy towards Sudan was announced in October 2009, focusing on the CPA, Darfur, and counterterrorism cooperation as primary priorities. Incentives were proposed, including investigating Sudan's removal from the state sponsor of terrorism list in exchange for allowing the south's referendum to proceed unimpeded. The strategy emphasized engaging with allies and adversaries to advance peace and security. The Obama administration emphasized the need to engage with allies and those with differing views to promote peace and security in Sudan. Decisions on incentives and disincentives would be based on verifiable changes on the ground, not just process-related achievements. Cooperation on counterterrorism would not be used as a bargaining chip against U.S. priorities in Darfur and the CPA. President Obama urged both parties to work towards the emergence of two viable states at peace with each other and their neighbors after South Sudan's independence. President Obama admonished both parties in Sudan, emphasizing the importance of a shared future and peaceful coexistence. The Administration has been critical of attacks by both Sudan and South Sudan, demanding an end to support for the SPLM-N and urging urgent action on humanitarian agreements. Obama welcomed accords between Juba and Khartoum in 2012, hoping for progress in resolving Sudan's conflicts. The United States maintains sanctions against Khartoum through Executive Orders and legal restrictions dating back to the late 1980s. These sanctions were imposed due to various reasons such as debt payment arrears, government restrictions on aid access, military coup, state sponsorship of terrorism, and abuses during the civil war. Some sanctions specifically target the Darfur conflict. South Sudan, as a sovereign state, is no longer subject to these restrictions. U.S. sanctions against Sudan include restrictions on transactions in the petroleum and petrochemicals sectors. Legislation may expand sanctions to target those assisting Khartoum in human rights violations. OFAC issued licenses in 2011 to facilitate trade with South Sudan. In late 2011, OFAC issued two general licenses to facilitate activities in South Sudan's petroleum sector and the transshipment of goods through Sudan. South Sudan is now eligible for benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences program and the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Prior to the split, Sudan received significant U.S. foreign aid, including bilateral aid, humanitarian assistance, and support for peacekeeping operations totaling over $1 billion annually. The State Department and USAID have requested assistance separately for South Sudan in FY2013. The United States provided over $274 million in humanitarian aid to South Sudan and $296 million to vulnerable populations in Sudan, with a focus on Darfur. U.S. assistance aims to strengthen governance in South Sudan and increase internal stability through building government capacity, civil society, economic infrastructure, and mitigating local conflicts. In FY2013, U.S. assistance to South Sudan aims to accelerate progress in governance, rule of law, conflict mitigation, economic development, basic service delivery, and security sector reform. Efforts to reduce dependency on food aid and build agricultural capacity are key for economic growth objectives. Some health and education programs have been revised to preserve basic services until oil revenues increase. Proposed funding also supports transforming the SPLA into a professional military force subordinate to civilian authority. In FY2013, U.S. assistance aims to transform the SPLA into a professional military force subordinate to civilian leadership and build the capacity of the police force in South Sudan. Military aid for both Sudans is subject to restrictions related to child soldiers, with a waiver issued for South Sudan in 2012. Development assistance in Sudan focuses on peace building and conflict mitigation in various regions. Additionally, global Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities cover a significant portion of the State Department's FY2013 request. International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) funds U.S. share of expenses for U.N. operations in the Sudans. Policy options for engagement with the two Sudans are debated by Congress. President Obama uses a special envoy to coordinate policy towards both countries. The President appointed a U.S. Ambassador to South Sudan in 2011, but the United States has not had an ambassador to Sudan since 1997. The appointment of an ambassador to Sudan could improve relations, but critics argue it would signal acceptance of the regime's abuses. The Senate nomination hearing may prompt Congress to reexamine U.S. engagement with Sudan. Security concerns may also impact enhancing the U.S. diplomatic presence in Khartoum. The U.S. diplomatic presence in Khartoum is a key factor in decisions by the executive branch and Congress. Trust between Khartoum and the United States is low, with Sudan seeking to improve relations to enhance its international standing. However, the U.S. officials cite Sudan's violations of human rights and peace accords as reasons for maintaining sanctions. If the Administration considers easing sanctions, concessions from Khartoum would be required. The U.S. requires changes in leadership and policy in Khartoum for the removal of Sudan's state sponsor of terrorism designation. Congress mandates certain restrictions until Khartoum meets specific conditions outlined in legislation. Ongoing human rights violations in Sudan complicate the U.S.-Sudan relationship. The U.S. and Sudan relationship is complicated by ongoing human rights violations, including air strikes in South Sudanese territory. Khartoum restricts access to conflict areas, leading to condemnation from the United States and the United Nations. The Obama Administration deems the humanitarian crisis unacceptable and advocates for increased diplomatic pressure to improve humanitarian access. Some proponents urge collective measures like sanctions, safe zones, and protection forces to improve humanitarian access in Sudan. International actors may deliver aid without Sudan's permission, but the U.N. Security Council is divided on how to respond to human rights violations. Deploying a U.N.-mandated force without Khartoum's consent is unlikely without a ceasefire. The Security Council may impose economic sanctions on Sudan and South Sudan if negotiations fail to progress. Some members of Congress have proposed additional punitive measures, such as the Sudan Peace, Security, and Accountability Act of 2012. Russia and China oppose foreign military intervention, including no-fly zones, in conflict situations like Syria. H.R. 4169, referred to committee in 2012, aims to end human rights abuses in Sudan and promote peace. Sanctions would be imposed on those contributing to Sudan's capacity for abuses. The US-South Sudan relationship is warmer but still concerns about rights abuses and corruption exist. US has invested in South Sudan's development, but tensions with Khartoum threaten progress. Juba allocates over half its budget to security. South Sudan allocates over half its budget to security, mainly for soldiers' salaries and readiness. Some view this as favoring the military over development, funded partly by the U.S. Concerns arise over the country's internal security, with the need to maintain army morale for stability and state viability. Alleged support for insurgent groups in Sudan complicates U.S.-South Sudan relations. The Obama Administration advocates for peaceful resolutions in conflicts in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur. Some Sudan watchers argue that South Sudan's armed struggle against Khartoum was necessary for achieving southerners' aspirations. The SPLM-N leadership is open to negotiations with Khartoum but has been forced to fight for peace, democracy, and justice. Congress faces questions about protecting civilians in South Sudan due to ongoing insecurity. Security forces in South Sudan have limited capacity, and Congress may assess how support can enhance their capabilities and behavior. Human rights groups report abuses by some units. Human rights groups report abuses by some units in South Sudan. UNMISS faces challenges in protecting civilians from various armed actors, including the SPLA. Concerns arise over UNMISS's capacity to protect civilians from harm by the SPLA. The lack of infrastructure and helicopters further complicates civilian protection efforts. The deteriorating relationship between South Sudan and Sudan has led to South Sudan ceasing oil production, cutting off its primary revenue source. Suggestions have been made for the US to provide anti-aircraft weapons to South Sudan to defend against air strikes, which could worsen relations with Khartoum. Despite some positive agreements reached in 2012, distrust between the two governments remains high, with the border remaining a potential flashpoint. The relationship between Sudan and South Sudan has deteriorated since their separation in 2011, leading to renewed conflict due to partially implemented agreements. Economic and political pressures raise concerns about state collapse in either country. Despite existing as separate nations, they are still interconnected in U.S. policy decisions, impacting each other. The political landscape in Sudan includes various parties and groups such as the Democratic Unionist Party, JEM, LJM, NCF, NCP, PCP, PDF, SAF, SDBZ, SLM/A, SPLM/A, SPLM/A-N, SRF, UNAMID, and UNISFA. These entities play significant roles in the country's governance and conflicts. The text chunk mentions various United Nations peacekeeping missions in Sudan and South Sudan, including UNAMID, UNISFA, UNMIS, and UNMISS."
