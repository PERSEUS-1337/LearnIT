Congress finds that United States households are facing financial vulnerability due to low personal savings rates, which contributed to the recession of 2007-2009. Many households lack the savings or structures to meet short-term and long-term needs, as shown by low participation in retirement plans and banking services. According to the Corporation 2013 Survey, 7.7% of US households are unbanked, and 31.2% do not have a savings account. The Pew Charitable Trusts report that 55% of American households have limited savings, unable to replace one month of income. Financial shocks are common, and savings help households be more resilient and upwardly mobile. In a 2-year period, nearly half of households experience income fluctuations of over 25%. Small savings of $2,000 or less can reduce negative financial outcomes. Children of low-income, high-saving parents have a 71% chance of moving up the economic ladder. Emergency savings are crucial to protect retirement funds and ensure long-term security. Successful pilot programs in various cities have shown that low-income tax filers can save when given the right incentive and access to an account. Increasing savings at tax time for low- and moderate-income households has been validated by large-scale pilot programs. It is in the economic interest of the United States to promote savings for all members of society, regardless of income. SEC. 3. FINANCIAL SECURITY CREDIT. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for the Financial Security Credit. The Financial Security Credit allows a tax credit for deposits or contributions to designated savings products, limited to $500 or 50% of the total amount deposited. Taxpayers must designate the credit for deposit into these savings products on their tax return.

The credit amount is reduced based on income, with thresholds of $55,500 for joint filers and $41,625 for individuals. Marital status is determined under section 7703. Designated savings products include qualified retirement plans, qualified tuition programs, Coverdell education savings accounts, US savings bonds, and certificates of deposit.

Deposits or contributions are reduced by any distributions from the savings products during the testing period. The testing period for the Financial Security Credit includes the taxable year, the 2 preceding years, and the period after the taxable year before the tax return filing due date. Other rules similar to section 25B(d)(2) apply. Inflation adjustments for the credit limit in subsection (a)(1) will increase after 2016 based on the cost-of-living adjustment. No double benefit is allowed under section 25B, and the credit must be coordinated with other refundable credits. The cost-of-living adjustment for taxable years after 2016 will increase the dollar amounts in subsection (b)(2)(B). The Secretary will issue regulations within 12 months of enactment to ensure appropriate reporting requirements for designated savings products. Rounding rules apply for increases in credit limits and AGI thresholds. The curr_chunk discusses reporting requirements for contributions, account balances, and earnings from designated savings products. It also mentions provisions for maintenance of deposits and prevention of avoidance. Conforming amendments are made to title 31 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The curr_chunk introduces a financial security credit effective for taxable years after December 31, 2015. Additionally, it mentions the opening of accounts on federal income tax returns to facilitate savings. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue notifies individuals eligible for a credit under section 36C of the Internal Revenue Code about the option of electronic direct deposit. This notification is part of a public awareness program to promote depositing refunds in designated savings products to qualify for the financial security credit. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program to electronically deposit federal income tax refunds into designated accounts held by depository institutions, in consultation with the Federal Management System. This program aims to minimize non-electronic refund deliveries and includes provisions for account parameters. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program for electronic deposit of federal income tax refunds into designated accounts with specific parameters, effective for tax returns after December 31, 2015."
