The foreign tax credit allows U.S. taxpayers to offset foreign taxes paid against U.S. taxes owed, preventing double taxation. The foreign tax credit alleviates double taxation of foreign-source income by allowing U.S. taxpayers to offset foreign taxes paid against U.S. taxes owed. This helps define U.S. tax jurisdiction and is not a tax expenditure favoring selected groups. Deferral and the foreign tax credit limitation are key structural pieces in the U.S. taxation of foreign-source income. U.S.-owned firms can operate through foreign chartered subsidiaries to benefit from deferral. Foreign chartered subsidiaries allow U.S. parent firms to invest abroad and defer U.S. taxes on foreign income until repatriated as dividends. Foreign tax credits can be claimed to offset U.S. taxes on repatriated income, including indirect credits for foreign taxes paid during deferral. The U.S. imposes limitations on foreign tax credits to protect its domestic tax base. Excess credits can be carried back one year and carried forward up to 10 years. The foreign tax credit allows U.S. investors to pay total taxes on foreign income at an average rate equal to the higher of the U.S. pre-credit tax rate or the foreign tax rate. The foreign tax credit allows U.S. investors to pay taxes on foreign income at a rate equal to the higher of the U.S. pre-credit tax rate or the foreign tax rate. If foreign taxes exceed U.S. tax on foreign-source income, the sourcing of income and deductions becomes important. The tax code contains rules for allocating deductions between foreign and U.S. sources. For example, interest expense is generally allocated based on the approach that money is fungible and attributable to all business activities, regardless of specific purposes. The tax code allocates deductions between foreign and U.S. sources based on the fungibility of money. Corporations can manipulate boundaries for financial gain, supporting both domestic and foreign investments through borrowing. Interest rate differentials exist across jurisdictions. The tax code allocates deductions based on fungibility of money, allowing corporations to manipulate boundaries for financial gain. Cross-jurisdictional interest rate differentials suggest fungibility may not hold between all jurisdictions. The \"waters edge\" allocation system excludes foreign subsidiaries, counting only a domestic parent's equity stake. An alternative is a \"worldwide\" allocation regime. An alternative to the \"waters edge\" allocation is a \"worldwide\" allocation regime, like the Jobs Act. This change would increase the foreign tax credit limit of multinationals, reducing after-credit U.S. taxes. It involves including interest of foreign subsidiaries, reducing foreign source deductions, increasing foreign source income, and decreasing U.S. tax liability. Additionally, debt financed assets of foreign subsidiaries would be counted in the parent company's worldwide asset base, ultimately reducing tax liability under worldwide allocation. The worldwide allocation regime, as an alternative to the \"waters edge\" allocation, reduces tax liability for multinationals by increasing the foreign tax credit limit. It ensures a more accurate foreign tax credit limitation by not allowing the location of borrowing to affect the maximum creditable foreign taxes. The worldwide allocation regime aims to achieve a more accurate foreign tax credit limitation but comes with complications such as administrative and tax planning issues, as well as potential increases in investment distortions. This approach may require foreign subsidiaries to classify their assets and borrowing for U.S. tax purposes, leading to complexities in IRS tax administration and firm compliance. Under worldwide allocation, firms could artificially increase their gross foreign assets to avoid interest allocation. If a subsidiary borrows and redeposits funds, they could raise their debt to asset ratios, potentially eliminating any allocation. For example, if a parent company and its subsidiary each have $100 million in assets, with only $50 million in debt for the parent, under current and pending law, half of the debt would be allocated to the subsidiary. However, if the subsidiary borrows $100 million and redeposits it, no allocation would occur, resulting in $200 million in gross assets for the subsidiary. The subsidiary could potentially avoid interest allocation by increasing its gross foreign assets through borrowing and redepositing funds. This could result in no allocation occurring, with $200 million in gross assets, $150 million in gross debt, and $50 million allocated to domestic uses. While this tax planning technique could reduce U.S. tax liability, transaction costs and administrative complications may limit its value. Other methods may be needed to prevent such abuses and maintain economic efficiency in worldwide allocation. The foreign tax credit limit is not aimed at ensuring economic efficiency but rather at protecting the U.S. tax base. Worldwide allocation may lead to distortions in the allocation of debt and equity capital, increasing borrowing abroad and reducing it in the U.S. This can result in cost savings by multiplying the foreign tax rate. The foreign tax credit limit is calculated by multiplying the foreign tax rate by the interest shifted abroad. Shifting debt abroad can result in a smaller foreign tax credit limit due to allocation rules, leading to a difference in tax rates. The current system falls between no allocation and full allocation scenarios. The efficiency effects of shifting debt and equity abroad depend on various factors. Current allocation rules can cause distortions or reduce them, but having no allocation rules minimizes distortions in borrowing and equity investment allocation. The efficiency effects of shifting debt and equity abroad depend on various factors. Having no allocation rules could lead to a significant loss of U.S. revenue compared to the current system and the worldwide approach. Partial allocation rules are less distortionary than full allocation rules, especially when considering investment shifts across multiple countries. Firms can use excess foreign tax credits from high-tax countries to shelter income from low-tax countries, creating an incentive to invest in low-tax jurisdictions. Inefficient tax systems can lead to distortions in economic efficiency, especially with deferral and interest allocation rules. Changes in allocation rules that lower taxes for multinational corporations can amplify distortions. Interest rate differentials may occur due to preferences of domestic savers or risk variations across locations, affecting the foreign tax credit limit. The presence of interest rate differentials may question the presumption of fungibility and equal debt-to-equity ratios in worldwide allocation. The Jobs Act expands the subgroup election for banks to include finance companies and insurance firms, potentially reducing the amount of interest allocated to foreign sources for multinational corporations. The Jobs Act expands the subgroup election for banks to include finance companies and insurance firms, potentially reducing interest allocated to foreign sources for multinational corporations. Firms may use related subsidiaries to minimize foreign allocations of interest, despite anti-abuse provisions in the act. The Jobs Act expands the subgroup election for banks to include finance companies and insurance firms, potentially reducing interest allocated to foreign sources for multinational corporations. This rule limits the increase in earnings paid to the parent as dividends, aiming to restrict borrowing and debt transmission. The subgroup election provision offers opportunities for firms to avoid interest allocation based on the fungibility principle. This feature of the bill moves the system away from the theoretically pure foreign tax credit limitation. The analysis suggests benefits and disadvantages of worldwide allocation of interest under the Jobs Act. Worldwide allocation ensures the U.S. foreign tax credit offsets U.S. pre-credit tax on foreign source income accurately. However, without additional rules, tax planning opportunities may limit this objective and contribute to distortions discouraging equity investment abroad. Adopting worldwide allocation rules could increase these distortions relative to current law. The subgroup election provision in the Jobs Act may allow firms to reduce domestic interest allocation costs and gain foreign interest allocation benefits, which could impact overall tax liability. The appendix discusses allocation rules that support the foreign tax credit limitation and how borrowing location can affect tax liability. The appendix discusses how borrowing location can impact tax liability by analyzing allocation rules and the assumption of debt fungibility. It concludes that a shift in borrowing location should not affect the location of investment or income earned, in order for the foreign tax credit limit to be accurate. The foreign tax credit limit should not be affected by shifting borrowing location. The U.S. tax liability equation includes U.S. source income, foreign dividends, foreign tax rate, interest rate, and domestic borrowing. The foreign tax credit is limited to U.S. tax on grossed up dividends and actual foreign taxes paid. Changing the base of the foreign tax credit only matters in cases of \"excess credit.\" The foreign tax credit base affects companies in an \"excess credit\" position, where foreign tax rate exceeds U.S. rate. Foreign subsidiary dividends are defined in terms of foreign earnings, retained earnings, and borrowing. Foreign earnings include dividends, retained earnings, interest payments, and foreign taxes. The U.S. tax liability equation includes U.S. source income, foreign dividends, foreign tax rate, interest rate, and domestic borrowing. The foreign tax credit is limited to U.S. tax on grossed up dividends and actual foreign taxes paid. The limitation for a firm in an excess credit position is affected by shifting borrowing to subsidiaries to reduce taxes. To ensure borrowing location does not impact the limitation, geographic-specific borrowing cannot be a parameter in the equation. This can be achieved by replacing the term iBf with iBT in the equation. The limitation for a firm in an excess credit position is influenced by shifting borrowing to subsidiaries to lower taxes. To prevent the borrowing location from affecting the limitation, geographic-specific borrowing should not be a factor in the equation. This can be accomplished by replacing iBf with iBT in the equation. The ideal limitation formula is defined as L* = t(Yf - R/(1 - tf) - i((Kf/KT)BT)). Comparing the current law's allocation and the Jobs Act's rules to this ideal formula. The current law requires part of domestic borrowing to be allocated to foreign sources, but subsidiary borrowing costs are automatically allocated to foreign sources. The allocation rule includes only the parent's equity stake in the subsidiary. The limitation formula is dependent on the location. The current law violates the principle of fungibility by allowing taxpayers to manipulate the limitation on interest deductions by shifting borrowing locations. The JOBS Act's rules include all subsidiary assets in the allocation formula, with interest expenses subject to allocation between domestic and foreign sources. The limitation equation for interest deductions involves allocating domestic and foreign interest to respective sources, independent of borrowing location. Foreign taxes can impact borrowing locale, assuming a single tax rate for dividends and retained earnings. The total tax paid by a company can be calculated using different allocation rules, such as the current law, no allocation rule, and the worldwide allocation rule. Shifting debt from domestic to foreign use can affect the tax amount under these rules. Effects of shifting debt from domestic to foreign use on tax amount can vary based on different allocation rules. Without allocation rules, the change in tax is determined by the difference between tax savings from foreign and domestic deductions. With worldwide allocation, the largest incentive to borrow abroad is seen, while the smallest incentive is with no allocation rules. The effects on equity include the dilution of the foreign tax credit limit due to the allocation of worldwide interest and the use of net foreign assets in the formula. The text discusses the effect of allocation rules on equity investment, comparing different tax calculations with and without allocation rules. It highlights the impact of using net foreign assets in the formula and the differences in total tax calculations under various scenarios. The text discusses the impact of allocation rules on tax liabilities for equity investments. It compares tax calculations with and without allocation rules, highlighting the effects of different scenarios on total tax calculations. The formulas show how tax systems can discourage investment based on the allocation of capital. The tax systems discourage investment abroad due to high tax countries and allocation rules magnify this effect. Worldwide allocation rule further discourages investment abroad, making it less efficient than domestic interest allocation. Effects on investment financed by debt and equity are considered, assuming fixed debt to asset ratio and total assets. The effects on equity investment are analyzed by adjusting notation to reflect the return on capital multiplied by the capital stock. Tax effects of changes in foreign debt are incorporated, assuming a constant relationship between foreign debt and foreign assets. The change in tax can be expressed as a function of various factors including foreign capital. The tax effects on equity investment are analyzed by adjusting notation to reflect the return on capital multiplied by the capital stock. The change in tax due to changes in foreign debt is expressed as a function of various factors including foreign capital. The tax systems discourage investment abroad, but the effect is moderated by the deduction for debt-financed investment. The worldwide allocation rule would discourage investment to a lesser extent than equity investment when debt to asset ratios are lower abroad than in the United States. The current allocation rule may either encourage or discourage investment abroad. The first term remains unchanged and reflects allocating more domestic interest abroad as the capital stock increases. The second term indicates that some interest has shifted abroad and would not be allocated. If domestic debt is small compared to foreign debt, the current rule would raise U.S. revenue and deter foreign investment in high tax jurisdictions."
