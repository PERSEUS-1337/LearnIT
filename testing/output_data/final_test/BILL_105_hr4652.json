    "content": "The \"Bangladeshi Adjustment Act\" allows for the adjustment of status for certain nationals of Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi Adjustment Act allows for the adjustment of status to permanent residence for eligible aliens who apply before July 1, 2000, and meet certain admissibility criteria. The Bangladeshi Adjustment Act allows eligible aliens, including those who have been excluded, deported, or ordered to depart, to apply for adjustment of status under certain conditions. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains enforceable. This provision applies to nationals of Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi Adjustment Act applies to Bangladeshi nationals who have been physically present in the US since January 1, 1987, with exceptions for absences totaling less than 180 days. Proof of continuous presence before 1987 is required for adjustment of status. The Bangladeshi Adjustment Act allows Bangladeshi nationals to adjust their status if they have been physically present in the US since January 1, 1987. They must demonstrate continuous presence before 1987, with exceptions for short absences. The Act also outlines requirements for physical presence and documentation for eligibility. The regulation allows aliens subject to deportation or removal orders to seek a stay based on filing an application. The Attorney General cannot order removal if the alien has applied for adjustment of status, except if the application is denied. Work authorization may be granted during the application process. During the application process, the Attorney General may authorize employment for aliens, and if the application is pending for over 180 days without denial, employment authorization must be granted. Spouses and children of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence may have their status adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident if they meet certain criteria. The alien must establish continuous physical presence in the US from January 1, 1987, until the application for adjustment is filed. The alien must apply for adjustment while physically present in the US and be admissible for permanent residence, with certain exclusions. In order to qualify for adjustment of status, an alien must demonstrate continuous physical presence in the US from January 1, 1987, with absences not exceeding 180 days in total. The alien must also apply for adjustment before July 1, 2000, and meet admissibility requirements. The Attorney General provides administrative review for this process. The Attorney General provides applicants for adjustment of status with the right to administrative review, similar to applicants under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or aliens in removal proceedings under section 240. Any determination by the Attorney General regarding status adjustment is final and not subject to judicial review. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply unless specified otherwise. The Attorney General's powers in immigration enforcement are not affected by the eligibility for permanent residence status under this section. Eligibility for status under this section does not prevent an alien from seeking status under other applicable laws."
