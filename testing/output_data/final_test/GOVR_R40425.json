    "content": "Medicare is a federal program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, as well as permanently disabled individuals under 65. It is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and consists of four parts, with Part A covering inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. The program is funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers. Medicare consists of four parts: Part A covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. Part B covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services, with beneficiaries paying an additional 0.9% on income over certain amounts. Part C is a private plan option that covers Parts A and B services, except hospice, and is funded through trust funds. Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits and is financed through various sources. Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans and will cover an estimated 61 million persons in 2019. In 2019, Medicare is estimated to cover 61 million persons aged 65 and older, with total spending projected to be $772 billion. Approximately $749 billion will be spent on benefits, with 28% allocated to hospital services. Federal Medicare spending is expected to be $637 billion, accounting for 14% of total federal spending and 3% of GDP. Medicare is mandatory spending and not subject to appropriations, and is a high-priority issue in Congress. Medicare is a high-priority issue in Congress due to its significant impact on beneficiaries, the economy, and future financial demands. Congress may consider various reform options, including changes within the current structure or a complete program restructuring. Medicare was enacted in 1965 to address the lack of health insurance for seniors. It includes Part A for hospital services and Part B for medical services, funded by payroll taxes. Committees oversee the program's spending, with Part A requiring 40 quarters of contributions for premium-free benefits. Medicare, enacted in 1965, requires 40 quarters of contributions for premium-free benefits. Part B is voluntary with a monthly premium. Payments to providers are based on \"reasonable costs\" or \"usual, customary and reasonable charges.\" Medicaid was also established in 1965 for the poor, with some individuals qualifying for both Medicare and Medicaid. Changes have occurred over the years, including the expansion of coverage to certain disabled individuals in 1972. In 1972, the Medicare program was expanded to cover individuals under 65 with disabilities and end-stage renal disease. Private insurance entities were allowed to provide Medicare benefits in exchange for a monthly capitated payment. Laws in the 1980s and 1990s aimed to control program spending by modifying payment rules to providers and delaying the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund. The Medicare program underwent significant changes in payment systems and provider reimbursement with the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This law established predetermined payment amounts for services and introduced the sustainable growth rate methodology for Medicare physician payments. Additionally, it expanded private plan options through the Medicare+Choice program. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made changes to Medicare payments and established the Medicare+Choice program. Congress later enacted legislation in 1999 and 2000 to mitigate the impact of the BBA 97 cuts on providers. In 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act expanded benefits and emphasized the private sector for managing benefits. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) introduced new outpatient prescription drug benefits, replaced Medicare+Choice with Medicare Advantage, implemented income testing for higher-income individuals, adjusted provider payment rules, expanded preventive services, and established a review process for program spending. Additional modifications were made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. In the 110th and 111th Congress, changes were made to Medicare through various acts such as MMSEA, MIPPA, ACA, and HCERA. These acts included provisions that affected Medicare payments, covered benefits, and care delivery. The ACA constrained Medicare's payment increases for certain providers and changed payment rates. The ACA made several changes to Medicare, including constraining payment increases for certain providers, adjusting payment rates in the MA program, reducing payments to hospitals serving low-income patients, creating an Independent Payment Advisory Board, phasing out the Part D \"doughnut hole,\" enhancing fraud prevention efforts, and providing incentives for quality and efficiency improvements in care delivery. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Continuing Appropriations Resolution of 2014, and Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 made short-term modifications to physician payment updates and established new payment systems for certain providers. The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 required post-acute care providers to report standardized patient assessment data and quality data. In the 114th Congress, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10) repealed the SGR formula for Medicare payment rates to physicians and established new payment methods like MIPS and APMs. MACRA also reduced updates to hospital and post-acute care providers. The 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) made adjustments to LTCH reimbursement, modified length of stay criteria, delayed payment reductions, and required changes to DMEPOS payments. It also allowed ESRD beneficiaries to enroll in MA starting January 1, 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 18; P.L. 115-123) made changes to federal health care programs, including Medicare, such as expanding care for beneficiaries with chronic health conditions, promoting team-based care, increasing telehealth services, and extending certain Medicare provisions for five years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 18; P.L. 115-123) made changes to federal health care programs, including Medicare, such as expanding care for beneficiaries with chronic health conditions, promoting team-based care, increasing telehealth services, and extending certain Medicare provisions for five years. The act also required modifications to the home health prospective payment system starting in 2020, provided indefinite authority for MA special needs plans, repealed limits on outpatient therapy services, and eliminated the IPAB. Additionally, it mandated pharmaceutical manufacturers in Medicare Part D to offer larger discounts on brand-name drugs purchased by enrollees in the coverage gap and created a new high-income premium category under Parts B and D. Individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are exempt from the 24-month waiting period for Medicare Part A. Those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who receive regular dialysis or a kidney transplant are generally eligible for Medicare, with coverage starting on the fourth month of dialysis. Individuals with specified lung diseases or certain types of cancer who lived in areas subject to a public health emergency declaration are also entitled to Medicare benefits. Enrollment in Medicare Part B is voluntary for individuals over 65 not entitled to premium-free Part A. Monthly premiums are $135.50 in 2019, with some paying less due to a \"hold-harmless\" provision. Higher-income enrollees have higher premiums since 2007. Disabled individuals losing cash benefits can continue Medicare coverage by paying a premium. Enrollment in Medicare Part B is voluntary for most individuals, but those who enroll in Part A by paying a premium must also enroll in Part B. ESRD beneficiaries and Medicare Advantage enrollees are also required to enroll in Part B. Original Medicare (Parts A and B) covers benefits on a fee-for-service basis, while Medicare Advantage offers coverage through private plans. Beneficiaries can choose between original Medicare and private MA plans, with an annual open enrollment period for plan changes. In 2019, the annual open enrollment period for Medicare runs from October 15 to December 7. Medicare beneficiaries can enroll in MA plans with a 5-star quality rating at any time. Enrollees in Part A or Part B can also get prescription drug coverage through a Part D plan. Higher-income enrollees may pay higher premiums for Part D. Beneficiaries in MA plans with prescription drug coverage must use that plan for their prescriptions. Individuals who do not enroll in Medicare Part B or Part D during their initial enrollment period may face permanent penalties in the form of increased monthly premiums. However, the Part B late enrollment penalty is waived for current workers with primary coverage through an employer-sponsored plan. Those who miss the initial enrollment period for Part D can enroll during the annual open enrollment period. Individuals may enroll in Medicare Part C during the annual open enrollment period from October 15 to December 7. Maintaining \"creditable\" drug coverage through another source can prevent the Part D penalty. Part C offers a private plan alternative for Medicare services covered under Parts A and B, except hospice. Low-income subsidy recipients are exempt from the delayed-enrollment penalty for Part D. Medicare Part A provides coverage for inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, hospice care, and some home health services. Approximately 20% of fee-for-service enrollees use Part A services annually. Coverage includes bed and board, nursing services, hospital facilities, drugs, supplies, and diagnostic services. Services are linked to an individual's benefit period. Medicare Part A coverage includes inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, hospice care, and some home health services. Each benefit period starts when a patient enters a hospital and ends after 60 days of not being in a hospital or SNF. Coverage details include deductible, daily co-payment charges, lifetime reserve days, and limitations on inpatient mental health care. Medicare Part A coverage includes inpatient hospital services with limited mental health care in a psychiatric facility to 190 days per lifetime. Cost sharing is similar to stays in a general hospital. Medicare payments to hospitals are determined by a discharge payment amount adjusted by a wage index and the weight of the Medicare severity-diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) assigned to the patient. Additional payments are made for cases with extraordinary costs and indirect costs for teaching hospitals. Medicare makes payments to hospitals for various costs, including graduate medical education, disproportionate share hospitals, and new technologies. Payments are also made for beneficiaries' unpaid deductible and co-payment amounts. Quality-related programs can reduce IPPS payments based on a hospital's performance. The Medicare payment system includes various programs such as the Condition Reduction Program and Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program. Hospitals may face payment reductions for not demonstrating meaningful use of certified EHR technology. Certain hospitals may receive additional payment adjustments under the IPPS, while others are exempt and paid on an alternative basis. Medicare covers up to 100 days of posthospital care for skilled nursing or rehabilitation services. Medicare covers up to 100 days of posthospital care for skilled nursing or rehabilitation services. SNF stay must follow a 3-day hospital stay and occur within 30 days of discharge. SNFs must provide services for conditions treated in the hospital. Beneficiaries have no cost sharing for the first 20 days, then face daily co-payment charges. SNF services are paid under a prospective payment system based on per diem rates adjusted for case mix and area wages. The Medicare hospice benefit covers palliative care and management of terminal illness for beneficiaries with a life expectancy of six months or less. Services include drugs, medical, and support services provided for two 90-day periods followed by unlimited 60-day periods. The per diem rate covers all services, including room and board, based on the resource utilization groups (RUGs) classification system. Extra payments are not made for costly cases, and patient assessments determine the beneficiary's designated RUG category. The Medicare hospice benefit covers palliative care for terminal illness with a life expectancy of six months or less. Hospice care is provided in lieu of most other Medicare services related to curative treatment. A hospice physician or nurse practitioner must have a face-to-face encounter with the individual before the 180th day recertification and for subsequent recertifications. Payment for hospice care is based on four prospectively determined rates for each level of care. The Medicare hospice benefit covers palliative care for terminal illness with a life expectancy of six months or less. Payment for hospice care is based on four prospectively determined rates for each level of care, including routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care, and general inpatient care. Payments are adjusted for area wage levels using the hospital wage index, with limits on inpatient care days and annual payment per beneficiary. Home health services for individuals with end-stage renal disease are covered under both Parts A and B of Medicare. Home health services under Medicare cover part-time nursing care, therapy services, social services, and medical supplies. Services must be provided under a physician's plan of care, with no cost sharing for beneficiaries. Eligibility requirements and benefit limits apply for services under both Parts A and B. The Medicare home health benefit covers part-time nursing care, therapy services, social services, and medical supplies. Part A pays for postinstitutional home health services for up to 100 visits during a spell of illness for beneficiaries enrolled in both Parts A and B. Part B covers any medically necessary home health services exceeding the visit limit and those not considered \"postinstitutional.\" There is no visit limit for beneficiaries enrolled in only Part A or Part B, with all medically necessary episodes of home health care covered. Medicare payments to Home Health Agencies (HHAs) are the same regardless of enrollment in Part A, Part B, or both, with no cost-sharing for beneficiaries. Home health services under Medicare are paid through a home health PPS based on 60-day episodes of care. Physician certification for home health services requires a face-to-face encounter with the patient. Payments are adjusted based on the hospital wage index and the Home Health Resource Group (HHRG) assigned to the beneficiary. The HHRG is determined by assessing the patient's condition using the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). Since January 1, 2016, home health agencies in nine states are reimbursed under a home health value-based purchasing (HHVBP) model, which adjusts reimbursements based on performance on quality measures. Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are eligible for all services covered under Parts A and B, including kidney transplantation services reimbursed by both Parts A and B. Since January 1, 2011, Medicare's ESRD prospective payment system (PPS) provides a bundled payment for renal dialysis services, covering dialysis treatments, drugs, laboratory tests, and other services for individuals with ESRD. This payment system eliminates distinctions based on where dialysis services are provided and includes erythropoiesis stimulating agents for anemia treatment. The ESRD prospective payment system (PPS) implemented on December 31, 2010, covers dialysis treatments, drugs, laboratory tests, and other services for individuals with ESRD. The system is case-mix adjusted and includes erythropoiesis stimulating agents for anemia treatment. Medicare Part B covers physicians' services, outpatient hospital services, durable medical equipment, and other medical services, with a decreasing percentage of enrollees in recent years. Medicare Part B covers 80% of approved amounts for covered services, with beneficiaries responsible for the remaining 20%. Providers may accept assignment, agreeing to bill only the coinsurance and deductible. Being a participating physician offers advantages. Being a participating provider in Medicare offers advantages such as higher payment, lower beneficiary co-payment, and automatic forwarding of Medigap claims. Nonparticipating physicians may charge more than the fee schedule amount on nonassigned claims, subject to limits. Physicians can also opt out of Medicare and enter private contracts with patients for unrestricted payment options. Medicare Part B covers medically necessary physician services and services provided by nonphysician practitioners like nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Assignment is mandatory for some providers, while optional for others like durable medical equipment services. Beneficiary cost sharing is typically 20% of the approved amount, with exceptions for preventive services. Medicare Part B covers physician services and services by nonphysician practitioners. Services are paid under the Medicare physician fee schedule, with over 7,000 service codes. Relative values are assigned based on physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice expenses, adjusted for geographic variations. MACRA made changes to how Medicare pays for these services. MACRA changed how Medicare pays for physician and practitioner services by establishing a merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS) and alternative payment models (APMs). It repealed the SGR system and implemented new methods for determining fee schedule updates. Payments under the MPFS were 0% from January 2015 to June 2015 and increased by 0.5% for the remainder of the year. The BBA 18 reduced the 2019 payment update to 0.25% and set the payment update to 0% from 2020 through 2025. MACRA established the Quality Payment Program (QPP) with two pathways for payment reform: MIPS and APM. MIPS combines performance measures into a single adjustment to the base MPFS payment. In 2019, MIPS adjustments will impact payments for the first time, while advanced APMs offer alternatives to fee-for-service models, focusing on quality and efficiency. An ad hoc committee evaluates proposed advanced APMs, with 13 options available under the QPP for 2019, tailored to specific specialties or geographic locations. MACRA incentivizes the development of APMs. MACRA incentivizes the development of APMs by offering prepaid bonuses and update factors for participants. Medicare covers necessary outpatient therapy services, with intermittent therapy caps in place. The BBA 18 repealed outpatient therapy caps and established a $3,000 threshold triggering manual medical review for therapy services. Medicare prohibits payments for services not deemed necessary for diagnosis or treatment, excluding preventive and screening services. Congress has expanded Medicare coverage. Under current law, Medicare covers preventive and screening services recommended by the USPSTF, with waived cost sharing. The Secretary can add coverage for additional recommended services. This includes a \"welcome to Medicare\" physical exam, flu vaccine, screening tests for various cancers, and screening for other conditions like depression and heart disease. Medicare covers preventive and screening services recommended by the USPSTF with waived cost sharing. This includes screening for conditions like depression, alcohol misuse, heart disease, glaucoma, and osteoporosis, as well as intensive behavioral therapy for heart disease and obesity. Payments for these services are provided under the physician fee schedule and/or the clinical laboratory fee schedule, covering outpatient clinical laboratory tests without co-payments or deductibles for beneficiaries. Since 2014, laboratory tests in hospital outpatient departments are no longer separately paid under the CLFS but included in OPPS payments. PAMA changed how clinical lab payments are determined, requiring Medicare to base CLFS reimbursement on private insurance rates. Weighted median private insurer rates have been used by Medicare for CLFS payment rates since January 1. Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests under the CLFS have been based on national rates since January 1, 2018. Part B also covers nonlaboratory diagnostic tests and therapy services, with beneficiaries responsible for a 20% coinsurance payment. Durable medical equipment (DME) is covered if medically necessary and prescribed by a physician, meeting specific criteria for use in the home. Durable Medical Equipment (DME) includes items like hospital beds, wheelchairs, blood glucose monitors, and prosthetics that replace body organs or functions. Medicare pays for most DME based on fee schedules, with beneficiaries responsible for 20% of the cost. Fee schedule amounts are updated annually. Since 2016, fee schedule rates for certain DMEPOS outside of competitive bidding areas have been reduced based on price information. The reductions were phased in during 2016 and fully phased in starting in January 2017. Concerns about low rates led to the Secretary applying the phase-in rate for rural and noncontiguous areas not subject to competitive bidding starting in June 2018. Currently, two different fee schedules apply outside of CBAs: a 50/50 blend of the fee schedule with and without reductions based on competitive bidding information in rural or noncontiguous areas, and a separate fee schedule in nonrural areas. The Medicare fee schedule for DMEPOS is adjusted based on competitive bidding information. Overpayments were attributed to the fee schedule mechanism, leading to the establishment of a Competitive Acquisition Program. The program, which started in 2011, expanded to 130 areas by 2018 but is currently suspended for a new bidding methodology. The Medicare fee schedule for DMEPOS is adjusted based on competitive bidding information. Payments for competitively bid items in bidding areas will be based on 2018 amounts, adjusted yearly for inflation. Medicare Part B covers certain outpatient prescription drugs and biologics, including drugs furnished incident to physician services, immunosuppressive drugs post-organ transplant, erythropoietin for ESRD, oral anticancer drugs, certain vaccines, and drugs administered through DME. Medicare reimburses providers for covered Part B drugs at 106% of the average sales price, with some drugs reimbursed at 95% of the wholesale price. Providers are also paid separately for administering these drugs, with Medicare covering 80% of the cost and beneficiaries responsible for the remaining 20%. Hospital outpatients are individuals not admitted as inpatients but registered for outpatient services. Payments under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) cover costs directly related to procedures. Under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS), payments cover capital-related costs directly related to performing procedures or services on an outpatient basis. This includes operating suite use, treatment, anesthesia, drugs, supplies, and other necessary services. Payments for physician services and therapy are separate, with payments based on ambulatory payment classifications (APCs). New technologies are assigned to \"new technology APCs\" until clinical and cost data are available. Medicare's hospital outpatient payment under the OPPS is calculated by multiplying the relative weight of an APC by a conversion factor, with adjustments based on geographic location. New technologies are initially assigned to \"new technology APCs\" until clinical and cost data are available for reassignment. The OPPS also includes pass-through payments for new technologies and payments for outliers. MedPAC has recommended site-neutral payment policies, while the BBA 15 gave CMS authority to impose new restrictions on Medicare payments. In 2015, the BBA 15 granted CMS the power to impose new restrictions on Medicare payments for services in off-campus hospital outpatient departments to align payments under the MPFS and the OPPS. The 2019 OPPS Final Rule extends the site-neutral policy to clinic visits. Ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) provide outpatient surgical procedures without overnight stays, mostly as freestanding facilities. Medicare covers surgical and medical services in ASCs that can be safely performed there. Medicare covers surgical and medical services in Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) that can be safely performed there. Procedures in ASCs must meet specific criteria and are classified into APC groups for payment. ASC payment rates are generally lower than those under the OPPS. ASC payment rates are lower than those under the OPPS. Medicare Part B covers various services in ASCs, including office-based procedures, radiology services, drugs, and device-intensive procedures. Separate payments are made for ancillary items integral to surgical procedures. Medicare also covers ambulance services for ESRD beneficiaries. Medicare covers 80% of ambulance services for beneficiaries, who are responsible for the remaining 20%. Ambulance services are covered if transportation is necessary, the beneficiary is taken to an appropriate facility, and other modes of transportation are not suitable. Medicare also covers nonemergency transports for bed-confined beneficiaries and may cover emergency air transportation if ground transportation is not feasible. Medicare pays for ambulance services based on a national fee schedule, with different levels of services provided depending on the patient's medical needs. Basic life support is provided by EMTs, while advanced life support is provided by paramedics. Rural ambulance services and those owned by CAHs may qualify for increased payments. Medicare covers Part B services in rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers, with payments based on reasonable-cost or fee schedule criteria. RHCs receive an all-inclusive cost-based rate per beneficiary visit, while FQHCs are paid a base payment rate per visit under a PPS methodology. Under the PPS methodology, FQHCs receive a base payment rate per visit adjusted by geographic factors. New patients and certain Medicare visits receive a 34% increase in the rate. Medicare pays 80% of the adjusted rate or actual charges, with beneficiaries responsible for a 20% coinsurance. Medicare Advantage is an alternative option for beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage (MA) is an alternative way for Medicare beneficiaries to receive covered benefits. Private health plans are paid a per-person amount to provide all Medicare covered benefits (except hospice) to beneficiaries who enroll in their plan. Eligible beneficiaries can enroll in an MA plan if available in their area. Nearly all Medicare beneficiaries have access to an MA plan, with approximately a third enrolled in one. Private plans may use different techniques to influence medical care, such as requiring care from a restricted network of providers. Medicare Advantage plans may require enrollees to use a restricted network of providers, including seeing a primary care physician for coordination of care. These plans offer additional benefits and reduced cost sharing compared to original Medicare, with some beneficiaries finding them to be a more affordable alternative to supplemental insurance policies. Medicare Advantage plans in the private market provide required services for a capitated monthly payment adjusted for enrollees' demographics and health history. Plans are at-risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain savings if costs are less. Payments are based on a bid compared to a benchmark, with a rebate given if the bid is lower. The rebate amount depends on plan quality, ranging from 50% to 70% of the difference between the bid and benchmark. The rebate in Medicare Advantage plans ranges from 50% to 70% of the bid-benchmark difference, returned to enrollees as extra benefits or reduced premiums. Benchmarks are determined by formulas to encourage plan participation, but ACA changes tie them closer to FFS Medicare spending and adjust based on quality. In recent years, Medicare Advantage plan bids and payments have decreased compared to FFS Medicare spending, leading to increased enrollment. Regional MA plans were introduced in 2006, with benchmarks determined by a statutorily set amount and a weighted average of plan bids. Plans with bids below the benchmark receive a rebate. Medicare Advantage plans with bids below the benchmark receive a rebate, while those above require an additional enrollee premium. Some MA plans have enrollment restrictions, such as employer-sponsored plans for company retirees. Special Needs Plans exclusively enroll individuals with special needs, like those institutionalized, eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, or with severe chronic conditions. Medicare Part D covers outpatient prescription drugs. Medicare Part D provides coverage of outpatient prescription drugs to Medicare beneficiaries through private prescription drug plans (PDPs) or Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA-PDs). About 77% of eligible Medicare beneficiaries are estimated to be enrolled in a Part D plan in 2019, with significant variations in benefit design among plans. Plans must meet minimum requirements, but differences exist in premiums, formularies, and cost sharing for drugs. Medicare Part D prescription drug plans offer standard or alternative coverage with varying deductibles and coinsurance. The coverage includes a coverage gap known as the \"doughnut hole\" until out-of-pocket costs reach $5,100. Once the catastrophic limit is reached, the program covers all costs except for a small coinsurance amount for generic and brand-name drugs. Rebate checks were sent to enrollees in 2010, and the coverage gap is gradually being reduced each year under the ACA. Under the ACA, the coverage gap for brand-name and generic drugs is being reduced each year. In 2019, a 70% discount is provided by drug manufacturers for brand-name drugs, with Medicare paying an additional 5%. Medicare also pays 63% of the cost for generic drugs, with enrollees paying 37%. By 2020, Part D enrollees will be responsible for 25% of the costs for both types of drugs in the coverage gap. Plans may offer alternative benefits such as reduced deductibles or tiered cost sharing. Medicare's Part D program uses tiered cost sharing for drugs, with lower costs for generics. Payments to plans are based on competitive bidding, and enrollee premiums are tied to plan bids. Part D sponsors negotiate drug prices, and the government cannot interfere in these negotiations. The program also offers enhanced coverage for low-income individuals, including dual eligibles and those below 150% of the poverty level. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) provides a federal subsidy of 28% to employers or unions offering drug coverage to retirees. The maximum subsidy per covered retiree in 2019 is $2,264 for \"creditable\" coverage. Employers or unions have options like paying a portion of Part D premiums or providing enhanced coverage, with financial implications. They can also contract with a PDP or MA-PD for coverage or become a Part D plan sponsor for retirees. Various entities handle Medicare administrative and oversight functions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) manages program finances, sets payment rates, and contracts with private entities like Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) to administer Medicare. Social Security Administration enrolls beneficiaries and issues Medicare cards. Medicare's quality assurance activities are primarily handled by State Survey Agencies and Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) to ensure compliance with federal safety and quality standards. QIOs monitor the quality of care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. Some providers receive certification through private accrediting agencies like the Joint Commission. The Center for Program Integrity within CMS, along with other government and private entities, conducts Medicare program integrity activities to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. Unified Program Integrity Contractors (UPICs) and the National Benefit Integrity Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (MEDIC) analyze data to identify potentially fraudulent claims for Medicare services. The National Benefit Integrity Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (MEDIC) investigates fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare Advantage and Part D, working with law enforcement. Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) identify improper Medicare payments and recoup overpayments. The Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program quantifies improper payment rates, and the Supplemental Medical Review Contractor targets areas for medical reviews to lower improper payment rates. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) was established as required by the ACA. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) was established in 2011 to test innovative payment models under Medicare, including ACOs and bundled payments. CMMI also helps develop physician payment models required by MACRA. Medicare beneficiary education is shared between CMS and the Social Security Administration, with CMS mailing out a \"Medicare and You\" handbook annually. Each year, CMS provides Medicare beneficiaries with a \"Medicare and You\" handbook and offers additional resources on the Medicare.gov website. Beneficiaries can call a CMS-operated 1-800 number for assistance with plan selection. A Medicare beneficiary ombudsman is available for complaints and grievances. The Social Security Administration notifies low-income beneficiaries about assistance programs and provides eligibility information. CMS partners with community-based organizations for further support. Medicare's financial operations are managed through two trust funds, the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund for Part A and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund for Parts B and D. Payments for Medicare Advantage (Part C) are made from these trust funds. HI is funded by payroll taxes, while SMI is funded through general revenue transfers and premiums. The trust funds are overseen by a Board of Trustees that provides annual reports to Congress. The trust funds for Medicare are accounting mechanisms funded by payroll taxes and general revenue transfers. Income is credited to the funds in the form of government securities, and expenditures are recorded against the fund. Medicare expenditures are primarily paid for through mandatory spending, with current workers funding most expenses through income and Medicare payroll taxes. Trust funds allow the Department of the Treasury to make payments for Medicare services. Medicare Part A is funded primarily by payroll taxes paid by employees and employers, with no upper limit on earnings subject to the tax. Other sources of income include interest on federal securities, federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, and premiums from voluntary enrollees. Part A expenditures for CY2019 are estimated at around $330 billion, with revenue expected to be $285 billion from payroll taxes and $38 billion from other sources. The HI trust fund, funded by payroll taxes and other income, is projected to have a deficit of $7 billion in CY2019. Despite never becoming insolvent, expenditures have exceeded income in recent years, leading to a projected insolvency in 2026. The HI trust fund is projected to become insolvent in 2026, with Part A expenditures no longer fully covered. Medicare Part B is financed by federal general revenues and beneficiary premiums, with total spending estimated at $368 billion in CY2019. Most Part B beneficiaries pay a monthly premium, deducted from Social Security checks. The Social Security Act includes a \"hold-harmless\" provision to prevent Social Security checks from decreasing due to annual Part B premium increases, except for higher-income individuals. The 2019 monthly Part B premium is $135.50, with about 3.5% of Medicare enrollees paying lower premiums due to the hold-harmless provision. Higher-income individuals with modified AGI exceeding $85,000 for individuals or $170,000 for couples filing jointly pay higher premiums ranging from 35% to 85% of the value of Part B, affecting about 5% of Medicare enrollees. Medicare Part D is financed through beneficiary premiums, federal general revenues, and transfers from states known as \"clawback payments.\" Total spending for Part D in CY2019 is estimated at around $98 billion, with $71 billion from general revenues and $16 billion from beneficiary premiums. In 2019, Medicare Part D is financed by $71 billion from general revenues, $16 billion from beneficiary premiums, and $12 billion from state transfers. Beneficiary premiums vary based on the plan chosen and income level, with an average set at 25.5% of total Part D costs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the federal budget deficit through measures like sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the federal budget deficit through measures like sequestration. Legislation delayed automatic spending reductions through FY2027, including sequestration of mandatory spending and reductions in discretionary spending. Special rules for the Medicare program in the event of sequestration are outlined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 contains rules for Medicare during sequestration. Medicare sequestration began in April 2013 and will continue until March 31, 2028. Payments to health care providers, MA, and Part D plans are reduced by 2% under sequestration, with some exemptions. Non-benefit related Medicare expenses face higher reductions, such as 6.2% in 2019. Medicare does not cover all services used by aged and disabled beneficiaries, such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, and long-term care. Unlike private insurance, Medicare lacks an annual cap on out-of-pocket spending. Most beneficiaries have additional coverage through Medicare Advantage plans, which offer extra services and reduced costs. Medicare beneficiaries can also receive coverage through reduced cost sharing, employer plans, Medigap policies, and Medicaid for low-income individuals. Employer coverage may be reduced or dropped entirely, while Medigap policies supplement Medicare with coverage for deductibles, coinsurance, and additional services. Medicaid provides coverage for low-income beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries may also be eligible for Medicaid benefits, with some receiving full or partial coverage. Dual eligibles, who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, have their healthcare expenses mostly covered by these programs. Other public sources like the Department of Veterans Affairs and TRICARE also provide additional coverage for some Medicare beneficiaries. In 2015, 87% of Medicare beneficiaries had additional coverage. Some may have had more than one type of coverage."
