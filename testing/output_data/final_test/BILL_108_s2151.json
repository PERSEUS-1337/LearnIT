    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Remote Sensing Applications Act of 2004\". The Federal Government can play a role in innovative land use planning and growth management. The US invests in remote sensing data for various purposes, including societal goals. Landsat data and earth observation data are valuable for assistance. The use of remote sensing and earth observation data can greatly assist various agencies in urban land use planning, coastal zone management, resource management, and disaster monitoring. This technology, combined with geographic information systems and satellite-based positioning, allows for the development of new applications to address societal needs. However, there is still untapped potential in utilizing remote sensing and geospatial information to meet public sector requirements, supported by relevant policies and directives. The Space Act of 1998 supports and promotes the development of US commercial remote sensing capabilities. Many agencies are unaware of the utility of remote sensing and geospatial information, hindering effective wildland fire management. The United States Geological Survey, in coordination with other agencies, can demonstrate how scientific data combined with other sources can assist agencies and the private sector in decision-making in areas like agriculture, weather forecasting, and forest management. The United States Geological Survey, along with other agencies, can stimulate the development of remote sensing and geospatial information by integrating governmental and commercial data to provide useful applications products. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the United States Geological Survey. Geospatial information is knowledge of physical and cultural features on the landscape derived from data analysis. An \"institution of higher education\" is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. SEC. 4. PILOT PROJECTS TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC SECTOR APPLICATIONS. The Director will establish a grant program for pilot projects using remote sensing and geospatial information to address agency needs. Preference will be given to projects using existing data sets, integrating multiple geospatial sources, involving non-Federal contributions, and collaborating with commercial entities. The Director will establish a grant program for pilot projects using remote sensing and geospatial information to address agency needs, with a focus on creating data products with added value, diverse public sector applications, and assisting in commercial applications, growth management, and wildland fire detection. Assistance for pilot projects will be provided for a maximum of 3 years. Each grant recipient must report results of the pilot project to the Director within 180 days of completion. Recipients must also conduct a workshop within 180 days after the project to share lessons learned. The Director will establish regulations for application, selection, and implementation procedures, as well as guidelines for reports and workshops. SEC. 5. PROGRAM EVALUATION. The Director shall establish an advisory committee with expertise in various fields to monitor the program under section 4. The committee will consult with relevant industry representatives and organizations. An evaluation of the program's effectiveness in utilizing remote sensing sources must be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2008. The Director will establish an advisory committee to monitor the program's effectiveness in utilizing remote sensing sources and other geospatial information for State, local, regional, and tribal agency needs. The evaluation must be conducted by an independent entity. SEC. 6. DATA AVAILABILITY.\n\nResults of pilot projects under section 4 will be accessible through an electronic database.\n\nSEC. 7. EDUCATION.\n\nAn educational outreach program will be established to raise awareness of remote sensing applications.\n\nSEC. 8. COST SENSITIVITY STUDY.\n\nA study on the impact of remote sensing imagery costs on agency applications will be conducted.\n\nSEC. 9. REPORT. The Director must submit a report to Congress within 6 months on agencies' implementation of recommendations from a 2003 General Accounting Office report on geospatial information for wildland fire management. Additionally, $15,000,000 is authorized for the United States Geological Survey annually from 2005 to 2009 for this Act."
