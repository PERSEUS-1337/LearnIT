    "content": "The \"Assault Weapons Prohibition Act of 1993\" prohibits the possession or transfer of assault weapons. Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to prohibit the transfer or possession of assault weapons, with exceptions for government entities and individuals who lawfully possessed the weapon before the effective date of the subsection. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring the name, address, date of birth, driver's license number, and weapon serial number to be reported within 90 days of enactment. The definition of assault weapon is outlined in Section 3. The definition of assault weapon in Section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, includes specific firearm models such as Norinco, Mitchell, and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs, Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil, Beretta AR-70, Colt AR-15, Fabrique Nationale FN/FAL, MAC 10, Steyr AUG, INTRATEC TEC-9, Street Sweeper, Auto Ordnance Thompson, Springfield BM59, Ruger Mini-14 with folding stocks, and Armscorp FAL. It also encompasses any firearm that is functionally equivalent to those specified models. The definition of assault weapon includes firearms with specific characteristics designed for attachments like silencers, bayonets, grenade launchers, flash suppressors, folding stocks, detachable magazines with a capacity of 10 or more rounds, and parts intended for assembling specified firearms. The definition of assault weapon includes firearms or devices that could be assembled from specified parts if possessed or controlled by one person. The Secretary of the Treasury, with the Attorney General's consultation, can suggest changes to the definition of assault weapons in the United States Code. This includes adding firearms not currently covered and excluding those that should not be covered. Enhanced penalties for possessing assault weapons are proposed, with 15 years imprisonment for the first offense and 30 years for subsequent offenses. Additionally, a study by the Attorney General is mandated. The Attorney General is required to investigate the impact of the Act on crime and assess noncriminal uses of assault weapons. A report must be submitted to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees within 30 months. The Act and its amendments will take effect 90 days after enactment."
