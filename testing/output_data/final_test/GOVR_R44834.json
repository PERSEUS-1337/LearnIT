    "content": "Congress has shown interest in federal programs addressing tsunami detection, warning, research, education, and outreach due to the tsunami hazard in the United States, especially in the Pacific Northwest, Northern California, Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean, and Atlantic coastline. The 2011 Japanese tsunami highlighted the potential damage and loss of life from a tsunami in the Pacific. The Cascadia Subduction Zone off the northwestern United States poses a similar threat, with Oregon, Washington, Northern California, Hawaii, and Alaska at risk. The Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2017 was passed by Congress as Title V of P.L. 115-25 on April 4, 2017, and signed into law by President Trump on April 18, 2017. The Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2017, signed into law as P.L. 115-25 on April 18, 2017, amends existing legislation related to federal tsunami activities. It broadens the purposes of these activities to focus on research, community resilience, and education. The law authorizes appropriations of $25.8 million per year for FY2016 through FY2021. The question remains whether Congress will allocate funds matching the authorized amounts to support the existing program and new activities. The Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-25) authorizes funding for existing and new program activities. Challenges include evaluating program effectiveness, maintaining DART buoys, and incorporating research results into resilience efforts. Assessing the impact of tsunami program activities is difficult due to the rarity of damaging events in the United States. The bill P.L. 115-25 authorizes funding for tsunami program activities and repeals P.L. 109-424. A section-by-section comparison of the two laws is provided in Table 1 by the Congressional Research Service. The effectiveness of the program in reducing damage and injuries is a challenge for Congress. The CRS comments on sections or parts of sections in the same row of the table."
