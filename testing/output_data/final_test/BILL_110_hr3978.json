    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student Breakfast and Education Improvement Act of 2007\". Congress finds that approximately 60 percent of US students are eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches. In fiscal year 2006, 7.7 million students consumed free or reduced-price school breakfasts. Currently, 83 percent of public schools provide 9.5 million school breakfasts annually to at least 130,000 students. Less than half of low-income students benefit from these programs. As of January 1, 2005, over 13,000,000 children in the United States were living in poverty, with 11 percent of households being food insecure. Missing breakfast can hinder academic performance and learning ability in children. Provision 2 under title 7 reduces burdens for schools providing free meals; schools face hurdles in implementing breakfast programs; districts using Provision 2 can offer free breakfast with 60-75% eligible students due to cost savings. Studies have shown that eating breakfast closer to class time improves student performance on standardized tests. Children experiencing hunger are more likely to have behavioral or attention problems. Eating a complete breakfast leads to fewer mistakes and faster work in math exercises. School breakfast programs improve math grades, attendance, and punctuality. Providing breakfast in the classroom enhances attentiveness and academic performance. Providing universal free breakfast, especially in the classroom, has been shown to significantly increase school breakfast participation rates, decrease absences and tardiness, and improve nutrition intake. Local produce, harvested closer to full ripeness, can have higher nutritional quality compared to transported produce. Some students in nutrition programs have a lower body mass index and risk of being overweight. The purpose of this Act is to improve student nutrition by promoting the use of local produce, which can have higher nutritional quality, improved taste, and be more efficient to store and distribute. Using local produce also reduces dependence on foreign oil and supports education on nutrition, farming, and sustainability. The Act aims to enhance student learning and classroom environment by expanding and enhancing school breakfast programs, especially universal programs during the school day. SEC. 5621 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 introduces grants for expanding school breakfast programs to improve the health and education of children. The term \"qualifying school\" refers to a school where at least 65% of students are eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches. The Secretary will establish a grant program for local education agencies or State departments of education to improve nutrition and school meal programs, coordinating with the Secretary of Agriculture as needed. The Secretary will provide grants to local education agencies or State departments of education for improving nutrition and school meal programs. The grants shall not exceed $2,000,000 or the product of the number of qualifying schools receiving subgrants and the maximum subgrant amount. The funds must be used to award subgrants to qualifying schools. The grant funds will be used to award subgrants to qualifying schools for activities outlined in the section. Local education agencies or State departments may allocate a portion of the subgrant for centralized support. The amount and term of the subgrant will be determined by the agency or department. The maximum amount of a subgrant provided to a qualifying school shall not exceed $50,000 for a single fiscal year or $100,000 for all fiscal years. The grant term for subgrants to a qualifying school shall not exceed 5 fiscal years. In providing grants and subgrants, preference will be given by the Secretary, local education agencies, and State departments. Priority for grants and subgrants will be given to qualifying schools with 75% or more students eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches. Qualifying schools must show intent to connect with local agricultural producers, offer universal free breakfast, or establish service methods to improve food access. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a local education agency or State department of education must submit an application to the Secretary. The Secretary will develop an application process and advertise the availability of funds to qualified schools. Qualifying schools can use the grant to improve food access. The grant under this section can be used to establish or expand school breakfast programs, increase local food availability, provide nutritional education materials, extend breakfast availability, offer breakfast during the school day, and boost participation in the program. The grant can be used to establish or expand school breakfast programs, increase local food availability, provide nutritional education materials, extend breakfast availability, offer breakfast during the school day, boost participation in the program, compensate for reduced and paid breakfasts with a universal free breakfast program, provide first-hand knowledge of food systems through activities and curriculum integration, and collaborate with local colleges. The qualifying school can collaborate with local colleges or research entities to compile and submit data on the school breakfast program to the Secretary. Activities must adhere to nutritional guidelines. Grants will not affect state and local funding for the program. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress on the impact of school breakfast programs on classroom performance. Data collection guidance will be provided to ensure qualitative and quantitative evaluation of grant impacts. Evaluation must be done 180 days before the program ends. The local education agency or State department of education receiving a grant must evaluate the cost-effectiveness of providing universal free breakfasts under the school breakfast program and submit the results to the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2008 through 2012."
