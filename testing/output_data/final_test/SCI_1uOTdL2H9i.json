To deepen our understanding of how pets perceive the world, wearables can offer animal perspective-taking opportunities. A sensory-augmenting wearable was developed to give wearers cat-like whiskers for a maze exploration experience. This study draws on animal behavioral research to evaluate how the whiskers supported authentically cat-like experiences, with implications for future learning experiences. Technology allows humans to enhance senses and extend our bodies, giving us the ability to improve our quality of life. Scholars have explored how immersive virtual environments and computer-augmented perspective-taking can enhance learning and engagement. Some scholars have suggested that building relational connections is important in environmental and indigenous education. Building relational ties to non-human actors in nature can enhance environmental and biology education. Educators have used embodied experiences of insects like bees and animals like polar bears to help learners understand behaviors and impacts of climate change. Interacting with pets or neighborhood animals can also provide insights into entities with different sensory capabilities. Our work explores how technology can help people relate to animal behaviors, such as designing a cat-inspired whiskers wearable called the Whisker Beard. We conducted an embodied navigation activity to give participants a firsthand experience of having whiskers, aiming to encourage them to behave like cats. Our study addresses creating authentic animal-imitating experiences and includes an evaluation framework to understand participant engagement. In this paper, we describe the design of a sensory augmentation whiskers wearable and a maze exploration activity to test the experience of wearing whiskers. Our analysis methods evaluate the authenticity of an animal-like experience and discuss opportunities to extend this work. The technology and experience design aim to reshape science and science education by incorporating closeness and subjectivity in addition to distance and objectivity. The project aims to create spaces for learning and discovery that foster empathy and perspective-taking through wearable and mixed-reality technologies. By exploring the sensory experiences of pets, participants can engage in scientific inquiry with interspecies perspective-taking, encouraging empathy and connected ways of knowing. The agenda aims to unify efforts in scientific and social-emotional education by exploring the intersubjective realm of human-animal bonds. One challenge is the disconnect between human and animal experiences, as people can't fully understand what it's like to be their pets on a phenomenological level. Despite the challenge of understanding pets' experiences, most pet owners believe their pets feel something. People tend to evaluate animal behavior through a human lens, but acknowledging biological differences can help us better understand animals' lives. Nagel's thought exercise on imagining what it's like to be a bat highlights the mind-body problem humans face in truly understanding their pets' experiences. In this study, a wearable device is designed to offer humans the experience of exploring an environment using whiskers, aiming to provide a transspecies sensory experience and assess its validity by comparing behaviors in the new technologically-mediated umwelt with those of the species it describes. Wearables and mixed reality technologies have been used in various domains such as education, medical settings, natural environments, and performances. Sensory augmentation devices, created through wearables and mixed reality technologies, allow humans to experience phenomena they cannot physically process. This field enables sensory substitution and augmentation, providing additional senses for the hearing and visually impaired. These technologies range from implanted devices sending signals to the brain to external substitutes. Wearable technologies can provide tactile feedback on the skin, such as a \"vibratory vest\" for deaf individuals. They offer hands-on learning experiences and can increase engagement in STEM activities in the classroom. Wearables also have the ability to gather contextual information firsthand. The research focuses on how wearable technologies can foster empathy by helping humans understand the experiences of others, rooted in feminist educational theory. Wearables can promote empathy as a valued part of scientific discovery. Wearable devices can promote empathy in scientific discovery by connecting humans physically to the environment and enhancing their understanding of non-human animals' sensory capabilities. Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock emphasized the importance of getting \"a feel for the organism\" in her discoveries in maize cytogenetics. This sentiment could guide future wearable-mediated science education. Our work in this paper is motivated by human curiosity about the differences between species and explores how taking on the physical or perceptual characteristics of an animal helps people understand it. Specifically, we focus on how participants' behavior compares to navigation and foraging techniques that animals exhibit in the wild and in controlled laboratory maze experiments. Animals must constantly make decisions and consider tradeoffs during activities like foraging for food, avoiding predators, and searching for a mate. The exploration-exploitation problem in organizational learning and animal behavioral science involves trade-offs in foraging, avoiding predators, and searching for a mate. Animals use egocentric and geocentric navigational strategies while alternating between quick movement and searching in an environment. Animals primarily rely on geocentric strategies to explore unfamiliar areas, using cues and real-time feedback from the environment to continuously reorient themselves along a path. Thigmotaxis, such as \"wall-hugging,\" is a behavior where animals move toward or away from touch stimulus, often seen as a strategy invoked when animals are exploring new and unfamiliar environments. The Whisker Beard device mimics whiskers to provide tactile sensory feedback, resembling cat whiskers in appearance and function. Whiskers, or vibrissae, are rigid yet flexible hairs that aid in exploring unfamiliar environments by providing tactile feedback. Whiskers, different from hair, are thick and sensitive, sending signals to the brain. They are vital for survival, serving as a sensory substitute for poor close-sightedness in animals like cats. A helmet project inspired by whiskers uses infrared sensors to detect nearby objects and provide feedback to the wearer. Our project focuses on whisker-inspired designs for sensory augmenting wearable devices, specifically mimicking cat whiskers for perspective-taking experiences. The Whisker Beard used has four whiskers attached to acrylic cheek plates, protruding from the wearer's cheeks close to the mouth. Each whisker is 38.5 cm long, extending beyond the shoulders of an average-sized person. The Whisker Beard design includes flexible components like a flex sensor, polystyrene strips, and Sugru to mimic cat whiskers. A small connector at the end of the whisker attaches to the cheek. The device detects when the wearer brushes their whiskers against a surface, measuring the change in resistance and converting it to a voltage for vibration motor control. The device provides vibrotactile feedback to the wearer through an array of vibration motors on the scalp, varying intensity proportional to bend angle. Motors are placed on the scalp for better point discrimination, mimicking a cat's sensory perceptions bidirectionally. Software does not indicate whiskers' bend direction through haptic feedback. The Whisker Beard wearable allows participants to feel tension direction, aiding in animal-like exploration in a maze. Participants were blindfolded to rely heavily on whisker feedback, mimicking animal senses for maze navigation. The final maze design included multiple dead ends, corridors of different widths, vertically hinged flaps, and cutouts in the walls to promote exploration of the whiskers' affordances. The obstacles were designed to encourage cat-like behaviors such as rubbing one's face on a surface and navigating narrow spaces, creating an experience that removes participants from a human sensory experience within an exploration task. Participants were given the task of navigating a cardboard maze with 10 toy mice to collect resources, aiming to mimic animal behavior. The study focused on how participants used the Whisker Beard to navigate the maze and exhibit cat-like behaviors. The maze design encouraged exploration and cat-like actions, such as rubbing against surfaces and navigating narrow spaces. The study recruited six undergraduate college students who lived on campus in a dormitory to participate in a maze activity mimicking animal behavior. Some participants had previous experience owning cats, while others had owned dogs or knew people with cats. All participants completed the maze activity in 20-minute sessions on the same day. Participants were individually assisted in attaching the Whisker Beard to their face and familiarized with the device by correlating whisker bend with vibration intensity. They were then blindfolded and led into the maze room to collect toy mice within a 10-minute time frame while thinking aloud. Participants were asked to think-aloud during the maze activity to validate data coding and gather their impressions. They filled out a worksheet with questions about navigating with whiskers. A facilitated group discussion followed the activity. Participants engaged in a facilitated discussion after completing a maze activity where they were asked to share their thoughts on specific prompts. The data from their interactions and behaviors during the activity were analyzed to understand how the wearable and maze influenced their experiences in an animal-like way. An interrater reliability assessment was conducted by comparing annotations on maps of the maze to ensure consistency in coding. After analyzing participants' interactions during a maze activity, disagreements and agreements were marked based on event identification. The researchers calculated Cohen's Kappa to assess agreement on \"whisker interactions.\" An inter-rater reliability of k=0.62 indicated substantial agreement before coding continued. The researchers achieved substantial agreement with a reliability of k=0.62 before coding the rest of the data in parallel. They used audio and video recordings from five cameras to analyze participants' movements and interactions in the maze, generating content logs, time stamps, and aerial maps. Additionally, they identified four subsections of the maze representing different obstacles and areas. The researchers identified four subsections of the maze representing different obstacles and areas. They applied mapping methods to understand participants' interactions with the space and compared their movements to animal-like behavior. The researchers used color-coded maps to track participants' exploration and exploitation behaviors in the maze. They distinguished between whisker use for exploration and hand-swiping for exploitation. They also coded geocentric and egocentric strategies, as well as wall-hugging behaviors. Participants in the study exhibited patterns of exploration and exploitation, alternating between using their whiskers for navigation and hand-swiping for movement. The researchers categorized behaviors into geocentric and egocentric strategies, as well as wall-hugging behaviors. The study aimed to assess the authenticity of animal-like behaviors exhibited by participants and gather reflections on the wearable and the overall experience. Participants in the study spent majority of their time exploring the maze, alternating between exploration and exploitation. They caught an average of seven out of ten mice and used three common whisker techniques primarily in the long, straight parts of the maze. Participants in the study utilized three whisker techniques (A, B, and C) while navigating the maze, with some participants using all three techniques. They also employed a variety of geocentric and egocentric search strategies, with all participants relying on geocentric strategies. During the maze activity, all six participants primarily used geocentric strategies and occasionally employed egocentric strategies. They relied on touch and sound feedback from the whiskers, as well as tactile feedback from their hands and body. Wall-hugging behavior was observed as they navigated blindfolded. Some participants also mentioned creating internal maps and memories of the space. Participants primarily used geocentric strategies and occasionally employed egocentric strategies during the maze activity. They relied on touch and sound feedback from the whiskers, as well as tactile feedback from their hands and body. Wall-hugging behavior was observed as they navigated blindfolded, with participants spending an average of 68.6% of their time hugging the wall. The participant who hugged the wall the least had a higher tendency to bump into obstacles head first. Participants reflected on their experiences with the whisker technique, discussing the physical sensation and functional use of the whiskers. They described adapting to the whiskers and how it felt to have them, noting that the whiskers became a part of them and provided an additional sense. Participants discussed their experiences with the whisker technique, adapting to the whiskers and how it felt to have them. The focus was on using the whiskers to navigate rather than the physical sensation of the vibrations on the skin. Participants empathetically discussed their experiences with the whisker technique, imagining how it would feel to navigate without whiskers, and shared anecdotes about cats they know. Participants in the study discussed the challenges of navigating without their sight, comparing it to a cat without whiskers. They described feeling disoriented in the maze and empathized with animals' strategies. The results showed participants exhibiting behaviors similar to animals when searching for resources in unfamiliar environments. Participants in the study alternated between explorative and exploitative behavior while navigating the maze using their whiskers and hands. They spent more time exploring the maze than searching for mice, aligning with animal foraging behaviors. The study found that intervals of exploration were longer than intervals of exploitation, similar to animal foraging strategies. Participants in the study used their whiskers to enhance spatial awareness and mimic cat behavior, such as gauging the size and shape of objects. This behavior aligns with foraging behaviors and evolutionary factors behind the presence of whiskers. Participants in the study used their whiskers for navigation, looking for hidden passageways and obstacles. They relied on vibrotactile feedback and sounds to determine their path through the maze, along with other strategies. Participants in the study used geocentric strategies in an unfamiliar maze environment, relying on real-time physical feedback to navigate. As they revisited areas, they used internal recall from memory to identify their approximate position. Participants in the study used geocentric strategies in an unfamiliar maze environment, relying on real-time physical feedback to navigate. Being blindfolded disoriented them, leading to increased wall-hugging behavior to reorient themselves. Blindfolding made it challenging for participants to navigate without their sense of sight. Participants in the experiment found it challenging to navigate the maze while blindfolded, relying on vibrotactile and audio feedback from the walls. They drew connections to experiences with blind or deaf pets, highlighting the importance of sensory adaptation, particularly with whiskers. The study suggests that disorientation can lead to behavioral changes resembling those of a cat. Participants in the study experienced challenges navigating a maze while blindfolded, relying on vibrotactile and audio feedback. They considered what it would be like to rely on whiskers like a cat, noting the importance of front-facing whiskers for obstacle avoidance. The design issue of whisker placement was highlighted, with participants finding it frustrating that front-facing whiskers were not included in the original design. The study explored the use of whiskers as a sensory tool for participants in navigating a maze. A longer study period is suggested to allow for better adaptation to the whiskers, leading to more natural behaviors. The research aims to enhance intersubjectivity with animals and improve science education through wearable technology. Future designs will focus on modularity and customization, with additional sensing capabilities to mimic cat senses. The wearable device, named Dr. Bones, will support cat senses beyond whiskers by incorporating additional sensing capabilities like hearing. It will use the micro:bit as the primary controller for input and output modules, allowing participants to program their own modules using Makecode. Customizability will be a key feature, enabling users to create their own sensory augmentation systems and customize sensor placement on the wearable. This flexibility aims to engage young people in scientific ideas related to animals. The design of the wearable device, Dr. Bones, includes additional sensing capabilities like hearing and the ability to create front-facing whiskers for users. By adding three motors per whisker, the device can provide directional feedback through motor sequencing and drive intensity. This technology opens up new empathetic experiences and opportunities for exploring transhumanist aspects of gaining new sensory capabilities. The wearable device, Dr. Bones, offers new sensory capabilities like front-facing whiskers. It aims to explore transhumanist aspects and increase empathy for nonhuman animals. The device could also enhance understanding and relationships with pets or familiar animals. The Whisker Beard wearable device allows humans to experience new sensory interactions, enhancing empathy and understanding for non-human animals. It aims to support respectful relationships between species by providing firsthand perspective-taking experiences. The Whisker Beard wearable device offers participants the opportunity to experience sensory interactions from an animal perspective, specifically what it would be like to have whiskers. Observations show that participants were immersed in the sensory experience of being a cat with whiskers. Future iterations of the hardware will allow for more customizability, enabling participants to explore their pets' other senses. Next steps include designing a more immersive experience for participants to continue enacting animal-like behaviors. Our next steps involve investigating how participants can develop increased awareness of animals' sensory experiences to support empathetically-oriented design activities focused on improving animals' quality of life."
