    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Security Clearance Family Review Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that anti-nepotism laws were established to prevent unfair conduct in Federal hiring practices. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were appointed to senior White House positions in 2017, despite holding substantial financial interests. The Government decision could impact financial interests totaling up to $740 million. Questions on Form SF 86 inquire about foreign financial interests of applicants and their family members. Financial disclosures from March 31, 2017, show that despite divesting from direct leadership roles, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump's wealth is still tied to their previous businesses and real estate through trusts and company holdings. President Trump's refusal to disclose tax returns or divestiture agreements raises concerns about potential foreign financial influence on his relatives. Financial disclosures show potential foreign financial influence on Trump Organization and Kushner's businesses from state-owned entities like China's Anbang Insurance Group and Russia's VneshEconomBank. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON PROVISION OF SECURITY CLEARANCES TO RELATIVES OF THE PRESIDENT. Limitation on Security Clearances amended to include White House and Executive Office of the President. Prohibition on Security Clearances to Relatives of the President added, barring agencies from granting access to classified information to relatives of the President. The President cannot grant access to classified information to a relative for Federal employment without a favorable determination from the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. The Director reviews the relative's suitability for access based on commercial relationships. The Director of the Office of Government Ethics reviews the suitability of a relative for security clearance based on commercial relationships with foreign enterprises or financial institutions. The determination must be submitted to the President, the relative's employing agency, and specific committees in the House of Representatives within 60 days."
