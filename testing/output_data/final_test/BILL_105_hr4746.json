The Santa Clara River, a tributary of the Virgin River, flows through the reservation of the Shivwits Paiute Indian Band. The river has erratic flows and often does not provide enough water to meet all existing water rights. The United States has filed a water users claim for a reserved water right on behalf of the Shivwits in the ongoing Statutory Adjudication of Water Rights for the Virgin River system. The United States is asserting a reserved water right claim for the Shivwits in order to promote Indian self-determination and economic self-sufficiency. Developing water rights and facilities is crucial for viable Indian reservation economies, especially in arid western States. Resolving pending litigation will take years and be costly. After more than 5 years of negotiation, the Shivwits Band, along with various parties including the State of Utah and local water users, signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 1998 to settle water rights disputes and avoid prolonged litigation. The Shivwits Band signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 1998 with various parties to settle water rights disputes. As part of the agreement, the band will receive 4,000 acre-feet of water through the construction of water projects.

The Shivwits' water rights are settled through the execution of agreements and construction of projects. They will receive 1,900 acre-feet annually from the Santa Clara River, with a proportionate reduction in below average years. This includes 500.60 acre-feet specified in Water Right Nos. 81-2313 and 81-2425.

Additionally, there are plans for additional projects. The Shivwits have the right to participate in the Beaver Dam Wash Project and receive 1,000 acre-feet of water annually. They can also join other water projects like the Lake Powell Pipeline Project and purchase additional water rights. Additionally, a trust fund will be established.
