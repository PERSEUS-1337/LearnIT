Foreign countries can seek exceptions by reducing their crude oil purchases from Iran during a 180-day wind-down period. The State Department will assess countries' efforts to reduce crude oil purchases from Iran during a 180-day wind-down period, considering factors like quantity and percentage reductions, termination of contracts, and other actions showing commitment to decrease purchases. Consultations will be held with countries currently buying Iranian crude oil. During the 180-day wind-down period, countries like China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Turkey may face renewed pressure to reduce Iranian petroleum consumption. Exemptions were granted to countries like Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom during the peak of economic sanctions against Iran.

The process of removing a state from the list of sponsors of international terrorism involves a thorough review by various government departments, such as State, Commerce, Treasury, Justice, and Defense. Once a state is delisted, the Secretary of State publishes a notice stating that the government no longer supports terrorism, starting a 45-day countdown required by law.

On Transition Day, the United States will seek legislative action to terminate or modify nuclear proliferation-related sanctions under the JCPOA, including those under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act. This aims to align with the U.S. approach to non-nuclear weapon states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The JCPOA does not address the application of certain non-proliferation statutes related to transfers of sensitive equipment and technology.
