    "content": "The \"Clean Boating Act of 2008\" exempts recreational vessels from needing a permit for certain discharges like graywater, bilge water, and cooling water. The Clean Boating Act of 2008 exempts recreational vessels from needing permits for certain discharges. The definition of a recreational vessel is clarified as a vessel primarily used for pleasure, excluding those engaged in commercial use or carrying paying passengers. Management practices for recreational vessels are outlined in the act. Section 312 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include management practices for discharges from recreational vessels, excluding sewage, that are incidental to normal operation and exempt from permitting requirements. The Administrator, in consultation with relevant departments, will determine discharges subject to these practices. The Secretary of Commerce and interested States will determine discharges from recreational vessels that can have management practices to mitigate impacts on US waters. The Administrator will promulgate these determinations and develop management practices as needed. The Administrator will consider various factors when determining the use of management practices for discharges, including the nature of the discharge, environmental effects, practicability, impact on vessel operation, and compliance with laws and standards. The Administrator will consider international standards and economic costs when determining management practices for discharges. Timing for initial determinations is within 1 year of enactment, with reviews and revisions every 5 years based on new information. Performance standards for management practices will be established. Performance standards for management practices will be established by the Administrator in consultation with relevant federal agencies and states, taking into account specified considerations. The Administrator will establish performance standards for management practices, considering vessel classes, types, and sizes, distinguishing between new and existing vessels, and allowing for waivers as needed. Standards must be promulgated within one year of the specified date. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates will establish regulations for the use of management practices, including governing design and construction. These regulations must be reviewed every 5 years and revised if necessary based on new information available to the Administrator. The Secretary will establish regulations for recreational vessels' design, construction, installation, and management practices to meet performance standards. The regulations must be promulgated within 1 year of the Administrator's standards. The Secretary will establish regulations for recreational vessels, effective upon promulgation unless specified otherwise. The effective date considers the time needed to communicate the regulation to affected parties. This subsection does not affect the application of section 311 to discharges from recreational vessels. The regulations require owners or operators of recreational vessels to comply with management practices meeting standards established by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates. Failure to comply prohibits operation or discharge of any substances into US waters or the contiguous zone."
