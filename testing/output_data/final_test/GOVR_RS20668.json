    "content": "Most measures in the Senate are taken from the Calendar of Business, listing measures available for floor consideration under \"General Orders.\" Bills can be placed directly on the Calendar of General Orders upon introduction. Conference reports are not considered from the calendar but can be called up when conference papers are filed. The majority leader in the Senate is responsible for arranging the schedule of business and has priority for recognition and making motions regarding the floor agenda and scheduling. The standing rules of the Senate prioritize individual Senators' prerogatives over the majority. The Senate's agenda is greatly influenced by individual Senators' prerogatives, which they may exercise at any time. However, comity and compromise often lead Senators to relinquish these opportunities in exchange for efficiency and concessions. Measures typically reach the Senate floor through unanimous consent requests made by the majority leader, after consulting with interested Senators to avoid objections. The Senate may also agree to take up any measure by unanimous consent. The Senate may agree to take up any measure by unanimous consent, allowing for immediate consideration or scheduling for a future time. Unanimous consent agreements often include provisions for passing a measure without debate and allowing Senators to have their statements placed in the Congressional Record. Consultation and negotiation are used to craft these agreements. The Senate uses unanimous consent agreements to govern the consideration of measures, often including terms for debate and amendments. The majority leader negotiates these agreements to limit debate time and set rules for consideration. These agreements are crafted through consultation and negotiation, sometimes referred to as the \"clearance\" process. The Senate majority leader may use a motion to proceed to bring a measure to consideration if unanimous consent cannot be reached. This motion requires a simple majority for approval but is often subject to debate, potentially leading to a filibuster. Cloture can be invoked on the motion to proceed, regardless of the underlying measure, to limit debate. Optional processes for cloture on the motion to proceed were established in 2013. The cloture process for a motion to proceed allows for immediate voting without the usual 30 hours of post-cloture consideration if certain conditions are met. The motion to proceed can be non-debatable in specific circumstances, such as during the morning hour or for certain types of measures. During the morning hour, a non-debatable motion to proceed can be made on various measures, but it is not common in modern chamber practice. The Senate often adjourns with unanimous consent to expire the morning hour at the start of the next legislative day. Majority leaders seek advance clearance for unanimous consent to call up measures, using a network of information flow to notify Senators of scheduling proposals. The Senate uses a network of information flow to notify Senators of scheduling proposals and objections. Senators can place a \"hold\" on a measure, which can be enforced by objecting to a unanimous consent request or by offering a motion to proceed. The Senate allows Senators to place a \"hold\" on a measure, which can block its consideration by engaging in extended debate or threatening a filibuster. Holds are taken seriously by the majority leader when negotiating the Senate's agenda, and efforts have been made to regulate their use. The Senate allows Senators to place a \"hold\" on a measure, which can block its consideration by engaging in extended debate or threatening a filibuster. Section 512 of P.L. 110-81, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, outlines procedures for recognizing anonymous holds in the Senate. Treaties and nominations are considered in executive session under Senate rules, with treaties referred to the Foreign Relations Committee and nominations requiring referral to the appropriate committee before Senate consideration. The majority leader seeks unanimous consent to go into executive session for specific executive business. Alternatively, they can make a motion for executive session to consider a treaty or nomination. This motion is privileged, non-debatable, and takes precedence over other motions. The Senate may also agree to go into executive session without a specific item of executive business. The Senate may agree to go into executive session without specifying executive business. New precedents require a majority vote for cloture on presidential nominations. Multiple nominations can be considered together by unanimous consent. The Senate can consider multiple nominations together (\"en bloc\") but only by unanimous consent, with the requirement to consider a nomination separately upon objection by any Senator."
