    "content": "The Act titled \"Access and Openness in Small Business Lending Act of 2001\" introduces a new section called \"Small Business Loan Data Collection\" under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The Act \"Access and Openness in Small Business Lending Act of 2001\" introduces a new section requiring depository institutions to inquire about women- or minority-owned businesses applying for credit and maintain separate records of responses. Applicants have the right to refuse providing this information. Loan underwriters are not allowed access to this information. The Act \"Access and Openness in Small Business Lending Act of 2001\" mandates depository institutions to collect and maintain information provided by loan applicants separately. Loan underwriters are prohibited from accessing this information. The Act \"Access and Openness in Small Business Lending Act of 2001\" requires depository institutions to collect and maintain specific information from loan applicants, including details about the loan or credit applied for, amount requested, action taken on the application, location of the business, and revenue of the business in the previous fiscal year. Personally identifiable information is not included in this data collection. Depository institutions are required to collect and maintain specific information from loan applicants under the \"Access and Openness in Small Business Lending Act of 2001.\" This information excludes personally identifiable details such as name, address, phone number, and email. The data collected must be submitted annually to the relevant agency for enforcement. The \"Access and Openness in Small Business Lending Act of 2001\" requires depository institutions to collect and maintain loan applicant information under section 704. Information must be retained for at least 3 years and made available to the public upon request. Small institutions with total assets equal to or less than the exemption amount are exempt from this requirement. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 defines terms such as \"depository institution\" and \"minority-owned business\" for the purpose of the act. A depository institution includes credit unions, while a minority-owned business is one where over 50% ownership or control is held by minority individuals. The term 'women-owned business' refers to a business where over 50% of ownership or control is held by women, and over 50% of the net profit or loss goes to women. The term 'minority' is defined as per the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. 'Small business loan' encompasses loans described in specific provisions of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Access and Openness in Small Business Lending Act of 2001 amended various sections of the Code of Federal Regulations related to small business lending. Additionally, technical and conforming amendments were made to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The table of sections for title VII of the Consumer Credit Protection Act is amended by inserting a new item after section 704A. Effective Date: This section and its amendments will take effect at the end of a __-month period from the enactment of the Act."
