    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2005\" and outlines conditions for compelled disclosure. Conditions for compelled disclosure under the \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2005\" require clear and convincing evidence before a covered person can be compelled to testify or produce documents in a federal proceeding. The party seeking the information must have exhausted all other avenues of obtaining it and there must be reasonable grounds to believe a crime has occurred in a criminal investigation. The \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2005\" sets conditions for compelled disclosure, requiring clear evidence of a crime and the essential nature of the testimony or document sought. In non-criminal matters, the information must be crucial to a significant issue. Disclosure of a source's identity is necessary to prevent imminent harm. The \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2005\" outlines conditions for compelled disclosure, emphasizing the need to prevent harm to national security. Testimony or documents compelled must be limited to verifying published information and relevant surrounding circumstances. SEC. 3 allows Federal entities to compel covered persons to produce commercial or financial information unrelated to news. SEC. 4 permits compelled disclosure from third parties. Section 2 applies to compelled disclosure of records or communications related to business transactions between a communications service provider and a covered person. A court can only compel disclosure after providing notice to the covered person involved in the transaction. The court can compel disclosure of records or communications related to business transactions between a communications service provider and a covered person, but must provide notice to the covered person and an opportunity to be heard before the testimony or disclosure is compelled. Notice may be delayed only if the court determines that it would pose a substantial threat to a criminal investigation. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a \"communications service provider\" is defined as a person transmitting customer-chosen information electronically, including various types of providers as defined in the Communications Act of 1934. A \"covered person\" refers to an entity disseminating information through various means such as print, broadcast, or electronic media. A covered person includes entities that publish newspapers, operate broadcast stations, or run news agencies. This also extends to their parent, subsidiary, or affiliate companies involved in news gathering and dissemination. A covered person includes entities involved in news gathering and dissemination, such as employees who gather, edit, or disseminate news for such entities. The term \"document\" refers to writings, recordings, and photographs. A Federal entity is defined as an entity or employee of the judicial or executive branch with the power to issue subpoenas. A third party is someone other than a covered person."
