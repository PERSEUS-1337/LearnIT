Loan forgiveness for family law, dependency, and domestic relations attorneys is addressed in SEC. 428L. The purpose of SEC. 428L is to encourage qualified individuals to work as family law, dependency, and domestic relations attorneys. The Secretary is authorized to forgive student loan debt for eligible borrowers according to specified terms and agreements. The Secretary can forgive student loan debt for full-time family law, dependency, or domestic relations attorneys who are not in default on their loans. The forgiveness amount is limited to $6,000 per borrower per calendar year. The Secretary can forgive student loan debt for full-time family law, dependency, or domestic relations attorneys up to $6,000 per borrower per calendar year. Loan forgiveness requires a written agreement with terms including remaining employed full-time for a specified period (minimum 3 years) unless involuntarily separated. If a borrower commits misconduct or voluntarily leaves their employment before the agreed period, they must repay any benefits received. Failure to repay will result in the government recovering the amount owed. The Secretary has the discretion to waive recovery if it is deemed unfair. The Secretary may provide loan forgiveness under certain conditions, and borrowers must repay any benefits received if they commit misconduct or leave employment early. Repayments will be credited to the loan account. Loan forgiveness amounts shall be credited back to the original appropriation account and made available for the same purposes and period. Eligible borrowers must submit a complete application for loan forgiveness to the Secretary. Loan forgiveness will be provided on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to availability of funds. The Secretary is authorized to issue necessary regulations for implementing this section. The section authorizes regulations for loan forgiveness, defines 'family law, dependency, or domestic relations attorney', and authorizes appropriations of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and subsequent years.

The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study comparing States on legal representation for children, children's participation in their cases, preparation of dependency court judges, case tracking, and statewide foster care councils. The Comptroller General will submit a report to the House Judiciary Committee within a year of the Act's enactment. Congress believes State judicial leadership should use court performance measures to ensure accountability for improved child outcomes and resource allocation decisions. Sense of the Congress regarding the organization of State dependency courts includes enabling legal representation and meaningful participation for children and parents. Additionally, there is an emphasis on building a pool of qualified attorneys, providing adequate training, reasonable caseloads, and fair compensation for attorneys representing children in dependency courts."
