    "content": "The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) covered various programs including commodity price support, farm credit, conservation, research, rural development, and food programs. In 2007, the House and Senate worked on new farm bill versions, facing delays due to disagreements over tax provisions. Temporary extensions were used to continue provisions from the 2002 bill. Conferees announced a completed conference agreement in May 2008. The House and Senate completed the 2008 farm bill (H.R. 2419) with a conference agreement, which was later approved despite a veto by the Bush Administration. An error led to one title being omitted from the enacted law (P.L. 110-234), prompting the passage of a corrected version (H.R. 6124) that was also vetoed and overridden, becoming law as P.L. 110-246. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) replaced P.L. 110-234. The debate faced budget constraints and trade challenges. The Bush Administration proposed detailed changes, and various groups submitted recommendations. The farm bill debate was influenced by budget constraints imposed by Congress, with concerns about reauthorization or expansion of current farm programs. Budget projections showed lower baseline budget for agriculture programs due to high commodity prices. The Congressional Budget Office's baseline budget in March 2007 set spending constraints for drafting the new farm bill, approved by Congress in May 2007. In May 2007, Congress approved the FY2008 budget resolution for the new farm bill, including a $20 billion reserve fund for new spending over five years. The baseline budget projected lower spending for commodity support payments due to increased market prices. Baseline estimates for mandatory conservation and nutrition programs were higher for the next six years. Estimates for mandatory conservation and nutrition programs for the next six years were higher compared to the previous six years, influenced by the farm bill debate and international trade agreements. Progress on the Doha Round stalled in 2006 and 2008, impacting U.S. subsidy programs. The Bush Administration released detailed recommendations for the farm bill in 2007 to reform commodity support systems and comply with WTO obligations. The aim was to distribute federal program spending more evenly and protect farm policy from legal challenges. The Bush Administration released recommendations in 2007 to reform the farm bill and comply with WTO obligations. President Bush vetoed legislation that included certain revenue and tax-related provisions, as well as legislation that failed to implement policy changes like cuts in farm income subsidies. He recommended a one- or two-year extension of the current farm bill and a new farm bill in the next session. President Bush vetoed two bills related to the farm bill in May and June. The original farm bill, H.R. 6124, was vetoed on June 18 due to concerns about revenue and tax provisions, lack of policy reforms in farm income subsidies, and potential conflicts with WTO obligations. The 2007/2008 farm bill debate saw various proposals for program changes and new additions gaining support. Several organizations and interest groups, including state and national farm groups, released their own farm bill recommendations, representing diverse interests seeking objectives ranging from maintaining current programs to substantially altering or eliminating them. Some recommendations were incorporated into bills introduced by Members of Congress during the debate, while others were reluctant to change current programs due to strong support from long-time beneficiaries. Both the House and Senate Agriculture Committees conducted hearings in anticipation of the 2007 farm bill. In preparation for the 2007 farm bill, the House and Senate Agriculture Committees held hearings in Washington DC and across the country. The House completed its version of the bill in July, while the Senate approved its version in October. Conference negotiations were initially delayed due to differences between committee leadership and the Administration, as well as between the House and Senate. In 2008, Congress approved the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (H.R. 2419) after a series of temporary extensions and official meetings. The House passed the bill on May 14 by a vote of 318-106, and the Senate passed it on May 15 by a vote of 81-15. In 2008, the House and Senate passed the 2008 farm bill, which was later vetoed by the Bush Administration. The veto was overridden by both chambers, and the bill was enacted into law as P.L. 110-234. An enrolling error led to one title being omitted, prompting the passage of a corrected version (H.R. 6124), which was vetoed again by the President. The President vetoed H.R. 6124 on June 18, 2008, but both the House and Senate voted to override the veto, making it law (P.L. 110-246). The 2008 farm bill includes 15 titles covering various aspects of agriculture and replaces provisions from the 2002 farm bill. It also contains tax-related provisions to offset new spending initiatives. The 2008 farm bill includes five new titles covering horticulture, livestock, crop insurance, disaster assistance, commodity futures, tax, and trade provisions. It continues the framework of the 2002 farm bill with changes to program eligibility, payment limitations, target prices, and loan rates for commodities. It introduces the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program and addresses horticulture and livestock issues with two new titles (Title X and Title XI). Mandatory funding is provided for specialty crop block grants and pest and disease programs. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for crop block grants, pest and disease programs, farmers' markets, organic production, livestock and poultry marketing, country-of-origin labeling, nutrition programs, and funding for food assistance programs. It also increases benefits for the Food Stamp program and funding for various nutrition programs. The 2008 farm bill expands and modifies various programs related to international food aid, trade, conservation, energy, rural development, forestry, research, and crop insurance. It also reorganizes USDA's research, extension, and economic agencies and increases borrowing opportunities under the Farm Service Agency loan program. The 2008 farm bill includes a new farm bill title for crop insurance modifications, ongoing disaster assistance, and agricultural security measures. It also addresses animal quarantine inspections and includes revenue provisions to offset new spending. Additionally, the bill reauthorizes and modifies the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for crop insurance, disaster assistance, agricultural security, animal quarantine inspections, and revenue offsets. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the total cost of the bill at $284 billion over FY2008-FY2012 and $604 billion over FY2008-FY2017. The majority of spending is allocated to nutrition, commodities, conservation, and crop programs. The 2008 farm bill covers activities in nutrition (67%), commodities (15%), conservation (9%), and crop insurance (8%). Out of the projected $284 billion in total five-year net outlays, $42 billion will support commodity crops, $189 billion for food stamps and commodity assistance, $24 billion for conservation programs, and $22 billion for crop insurance. Additionally, there is nearly $4 billion in new spending for supplemental disaster assistance and $10 billion for trade, horticulture, livestock production, rural development, research, forestry, energy, and other programs. Tax-related provisions and cost savings from some programs are also expected. The 2008 farm bill is expected to generate additional funding through tax payments and cost savings from various programs, totaling over $10 billion over five years. The majority of new spending in the bill is allocated to disaster assistance, nutrition, and conservation programs. USDA will need to develop regulations and guidelines to implement the program changes, which will be subject to scrutiny in the coming year. The 2008 farm bill will require regulations to implement new program provisions, including revenue-based counter-cyclical programs, producer payment limits, country-of-origin labeling, state meat and seafood inspections, fruit and vegetable crop provisions, and organic agriculture requirements. The Supplemental Agricultural Assistance programs will also need regulations, with a focus on timely payments for crop disaster assistance. Additionally, the research title of the farm bill consolidates programs and planning in USDA's agricultural research, education, and economics mission area by merging three existing agencies. The 2008 farm bill requires new regulations for implementing various program provisions, including revenue-based counter-cyclical programs, producer payment limits, country-of-origin labeling, and organic agriculture requirements. USDA announced plans for developing implementation structures and procedures for the farm bill, including new requirements and regulatory guidelines for programs covering conservation, forestry, energy, and rural development. The USDA began working on a timeline for implementing the 2008 farm bill, identifying responsible agencies, and addressing cross-cutting issues. Reports suggest that additional funding may be needed beyond the $50 million provided by Congress. USDA representatives stated that over 150 individual regulations would need to be developed, with 40 regulations from the Farm Service Agency and 24 regulations requiring quick turnaround. The USDA is working on implementing the 2008 farm bill, with over 150 regulations needing development. Delays are expected due to a massive workload and possible backlog in Federal Register publications. The bill may have technical inconsistencies that will be rectified later. The 2008 farm bill continues the support framework of the 2002 bill, with revisions to payment limitations and adjustments to target prices and loan rates for commodities. It includes direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing loan programs for the 2008-2012 crop years, as well as pilot programs for revenue-based counter-cyclical and planting flexibility. Additionally, it eliminates benefits for farms with fewer than 10 acres. The 2008 farm bill maintains the support framework of the 2002 bill, with changes to payment limitations and adjustments to target prices and loan rates for commodities. Direct payments are reduced by 2% for crop years 2009-2011, with the ratio of base acres for payments changing from 85% to 83.3%. Advance direct payments are eliminated starting in 2012, with a delay in payment timing to achieve budget savings of about $1.1 billion in FY2012. Counter-cyclical payments and marketing loan support levels are adjusted accordingly. The 2008 farm bill adjusts support levels for counter-cyclical payments and marketing loans for various commodities. Some crops see increases in support, while cotton support is slightly reduced. Changes include increases in target prices for six commodities and loan rate increases for eight commodities. The bill does not change the \"beneficial interest\" rules for farmers. The 2008 farm bill maintains the \"beneficial interest\" rules, allowing farmers to lock in loan deficiency payments when market prices are low. The bill aims to give farmers flexibility in marketing their commodities but critics argue that government support may be unnecessary if farmers can sell above the support price. The Bush Administration prioritized reform in this area. The bill also introduces the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program with modifications, starting in 2009 with minimal changes to direct payments and marketing loans. The 2008 farm bill introduced the ACRE program in 2009, offering a revenue-based option for farmers to choose from. Participants in the ACRE program will receive reduced direct payments and lower loan rates. To qualify for an ACRE payment, state and individual revenue triggers must be met. The ACRE program, introduced in 2009 as part of the 2008 farm bill, offers a revenue-based option for farmers. To qualify for an ACRE payment, state and individual revenue triggers must be met, including the farm's actual revenue being less than the benchmark revenue. The program calculates payments based on the difference between actual revenue and the ACRE guarantee per acre, multiplied by a percentage of the farm's planted acreage. The White House has criticized the program for incorporating historically high market prices into the guarantee. The 2008 farm bill includes a pilot planting flexibility program for fruits and vegetables for processing in seven midwestern states starting in 2009. Farmers can temporarily plant base acres to certain crops, resulting in lower payments for that year but restored for the next crop year. The White House has raised concerns about the program's incorporation of historically high market prices into the guarantee. The 2008 farm bill includes a provision to temporarily plant base acres to certain crops in seven midwestern states, resulting in lower payments for that year but restored for the next crop year. The bill also eliminates payments to farms with fewer than 10 base acres of all crops, except for socially disadvantaged or limited-resource farmers and ranchers. The Senate provision eliminates base acres on land subdivided into non-farming uses, different from prior rules. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions to verify program beneficiaries' status twice a year using the Social Security database and sets regulations for deceased persons' estates to qualify for benefits. Payment limits are in place, with a $40,000 limit on direct payments and a $65,000 limit on counter-cyclical payments. The bill addresses issues of payments being made to deceased farmers or their estates beyond the specified time frame. The 2008 farm bill sets payment limits, with $40,000 for direct payments and $65,000 for counter-cyclical payments. Marketing loan benefits are now unlimited, with the elimination of the three-entity rule and requirement for \"direct attribution\" of program benefits to a living person. If a payment cannot be traced to a living person within four levels of ownership, the original entity's payment is reduced proportionately. The 2008 farm bill eliminates payment limits for marketing loan benefits and introduces new AGI measures. If nonfarm AGI exceeds $500,000 over three years, no program benefits are allowed. If farm AGI exceeds the limit, program benefits are also restricted. The 2008 farm bill introduces new AGI measures for program participants, with restrictions based on income levels. If a three-year average of farm AGI exceeds $750,000, no direct payments are allowed, but counter-cyclical and marketing loan benefits are permitted. Hard caps apply to income from both farm and nonfarm sources, with no exceptions except for the cap on farm AGI for direct payments. Married couples can split AGI as if filing separate tax returns to potentially remain below income caps and still receive program benefits. The 2008 farm bill introduces new AGI measures for program participants, with restrictions based on income levels. Married couples can split AGI as if filing separate tax returns to potentially remain below income caps and still receive program benefits. The bill continues the dairy price support program and Milk Income Loss Contract program to support milk prices and dairy farm income. The 2008 farm bill extends the Milk Income Loss Contract program through December 2012, with modifications to specify minimum purchase prices for dairy products. USDA can reduce purchase prices if net removals exceed limits. Payments to farmers are increased to 45% of the price differential, with a production limit of 2.985 million pounds. The 2008 farm bill increased the production limit for payments to 2.985 million pounds and adjusted the payment rate to reflect feed cost increases. The total net five-year increase in outlays for the bill's dairy provisions is estimated at $386 million. Dairy processors sought exemption from paying the federal milk marketing order minimum price when forward contracting with farmers. The 2008 farm bill allows dairy farmers to enter into forward price contracts voluntarily until September 30, 2012, with safeguards to prevent coercion by processors. It also establishes a commission to review federal milk marketing order policies and procedures, revises formal hearing procedures, includes Alaska, Hawaii, DC, and Puerto Rico in the dairy research program, lowers assessment rates for imported products, extends the dairy indemnity program, and introduces new USDA directives for dairy product pricing. The sugar program ensures price guarantees for sugar beet and sugarcane growers and processors without cost to the U.S. Treasury. USDA limits domestic sugar sales and restricts imports to maintain market prices above support levels, encouraging repayment of price support loans rather than forfeitures. Measures are in place to prevent a sugar surplus from unrestricted imports under NAFTA and other agreements. The 2008 farm bill mandates a sugar-for-ethanol program, requiring USDA to purchase excess U.S.-produced sugar to maintain market prices. The program will cost about $650 million over five years, with increased loan rates and a mandate for a domestic market share for the U.S. sugar producing sector. The Bush Administration opposed the program. The 2008 farm bill mandates a sugar-for-ethanol program, costing $650 million over five years. The Bush Administration opposed the program, citing concerns about increased government intervention and potential losses from excess sugar supply. The bill also reauthorizes and modifies conservation programs, with estimated new spending projected to increase by $2.7 billion over 5 years and $4.0 billion over 10 years. Total mandatory spending for the conservation title is projected at $24.3 billion over 5 years and $55.2 billion over 10 years. The USDA administers conservation programs totaling $24.3 billion over 5 years and $55.2 billion over 10 years. Programs include land retirement and working lands initiatives. Land retirement programs like CRP and WRP take land out of crop production for conservation purposes. Working lands programs offer assistance to improve land management practices. The conservation title of USDA programs includes changes to existing programs like EQIP, CSP, AMA, and WHIP. These changes expand eligibility, technical assistance, and producer coverage to include various types of lands and producers. The 2008 farm bill includes new conservation programs for socially disadvantaged, specialty crop, and organic producers. Agriculture groups support the increased funding, but wildlife groups are concerned about changes that may reduce benefits for wildlife protection. These changes include a reduction in CRP acreage cap, easing of sodsaver provision requirements, limitations on eligible lands under WHIP, and the establishment of a new permanent disaster fund. The 2008 farm bill introduces new conservation programs for various types of producers. The CRP, the largest conservation program, now has a reduced cap on enrollment. The bill encourages transitioning from land retirement to working lands conservation and allows for state, regional, and national initiatives. It also expands coverage to beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, permits managed grazing and wind turbine installation on enrolled lands, and requires certain program changes. The 2008 farm bill introduces new conservation programs for various types of producers, including the CRP with a reduced cap on enrollment. It allows for state, regional, and national initiatives, expands coverage to beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, permits managed grazing and wind turbine installation on enrolled lands, and requires certain program changes. Additionally, the bill establishes cost-sharing rates for conservation structures and modifies the pilot program for wetland and buffer acreage enrollment in CRP. It increases the WRP maximum enrollment cap and expands eligible lands to include private and tribal wetlands, croplands, grasslands, and lands meeting specific wildlife habitat needs. The bill introduces a new Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program and makes changes to the Grassland Reserve Program, including an acreage enrollment goal of 1.2 million acres by 2012. It also specifies criteria for program applications, requires annual surveys of the Prairie Pothole Region, and allows for fire presuppression and additional grazing-related activities on GRP lands. The farm bill makes technical changes to the Farm Protection Program (FPP) and provides additional budget authority of $773 million. It does not rename FPP to \"Farm and Ranchland Protection Program\" as proposed. The bill also expands the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) to cover soil enhancement practices. The bill did not adopt a Senate proposal to coordinate EQIP and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). The enacted bill expands the EQIP program to cover practices that enhance soil, water, air quality, and conserve energy for various types of land and natural resources. It sets aside 5% of spending for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, provides payments for tribal members and producers transitioning to organic production, and lowers payment limits. The enacted bill expands the EQIP program to cover practices that enhance soil, water, air quality, and conserve energy for various types of land and natural resources. It retains the requirement that 60% of funds be made available for cost-sharing to livestock producers and modifies EQIP's Conservation Innovation Grants program to cover air quality concerns associated with agriculture. Additionally, it replaces the Ground and Surface Water Conservation Program within EQIP with a new Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) to address water quality and quantity concerns on agricultural land. The bill provides additional budget authority for EQIP of $3.4 billion (FY2008-2012) and replaces the Conservation Security Program with a new Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) starting in 2009. The new Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) starting in 2009 eliminates the three-tier approach, removes 10-year contracts, and requires direct attribution of payments. It aims to enroll more than 13 million acres annually, with individual producer payments limited to $200,000 per entity in any five-year period. Eligible lands include priority resource concerns, private agricultural and forested lands, and nonindustrial private forest lands. Technical assistance will be provided to specialty crop and organic producers, with pilot testing of innovative new practices. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes WHIP at current funding levels, with limits on program eligibility focusing on developing wildlife habitat on private agricultural, nonindustrial private forest, and tribal lands. Priority is given to projects addressing conservation initiatives, with cost-share payments raised to 25% for long-term projects and a total payment limit of $50,000 per year. Program payments cannot be used for animal waste facilities. The 2008 farm bill expands USDA conservation activities, authorizes increased funding for programs like Grassroots Source Water Protection and Small Watershed Rehabilitation, and introduces new programs for Chesapeake Bay region conservation. It includes Hawaii in the AMA program and limits production on native sod. The bill also prioritizes the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program for funding. Total mandatory funding authorized is $438 million. The bill authorizes $438 million in total mandatory funding for FY2009-FY2012 for the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentives Program. This program encourages landowners to provide public access for wildlife-dependent recreation, with a 25% reduction in grants if migratory bird hunting opening dates are inconsistent for residents and non-residents. Additionally, the bill provides $50 million in mandatory funds for FY2009-FY2012 for the program. The sodsaver provision makes producers planting an insurable crop on native sod ineligible for crop insurance and disaster assistance for the first five years. This provision may apply to virgin prairie converted to cropland in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area, if elected by the state. The farm bill includes provisions to encourage participation in environmental services markets such as water and air quality, habitat protection, and carbon storage. USDA is directed to establish standards for quantifying environmental services from agriculture and forestry sectors, without funding authorization. For more information on conservation programs and funding, refer to CRS Report RL33556. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes programs for international food aid and U.S. agricultural exports. The bill extends P.L. 480 food aid programs through 2012 and renames the underlying act to Food for Peace Act. The bill authorizes $2.5 billion for appropriation. Title II is the largest U.S. food aid program, authorizing $2.5 billion annually for P.L. 480 Title II, which provides U.S. commodities for emergency relief and non-emergency projects overseas. Administered by USAID, the 2008 farm bill increases funding for various food aid program activities and allocates $4.5 million for studying and improving food aid quality. The 2008 farm bill increases funding for various food aid program activities, including pre-positioning of commodities overseas and assistance for stockpiling and rapid transportation of foods. It also provides funding for monitoring and evaluation of non-emergency programs, with a portion allocated for USAID's Famine Early Warning System. The bill retains an earmark for development food aid, starting at $375 million in FY2009 and increasing to $450 million in FY2012. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes funding for development food aid programs, including a \"safe box\" provision starting at $375 million in FY2009 and increasing to $450 million in FY2012. Private voluntary organizations supported the safe box concept for supply assurances, while the Administration opposed it for limiting flexibility in emergency food aid response. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes funding for development food aid programs, including the Food for Progress (FFP) and the McGovern-Dole International School Feeding and Child Nutrition Program. The bill provides additional funding for the McGovern-Dole program and reauthorizes the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust for emergency food needs. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes funding for development food aid programs, including the Food for Progress (FFP) and the McGovern-Dole International School Feeding and Child Nutrition Program. It authorizes $60 million for a pilot program for local or regional purchase of agricultural commodities for food aid programs. The proposal aims to allocate up to 25% of funds for this purpose, arguing it would make emergency responses more timely and cost-effective. Opponents fear it would undermine existing support for U.S. food aid and result in less aid being provided. The 2008 farm bill extends USDA's export market development programs through FY2012, maintaining funding for the Market Access Program (MAP) at $200 million annually and the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP) at $34.5 million annually. The bill revises export credit guarantee programs to comply with a WTO decision. The 2008 farm bill makes changes to export credit guarantee programs, repeals the Export Enhancement Program, increases funding for the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops program, and establishes a softwood lumber importer declaration program. The 2008 farm bill establishes a softwood lumber importer declaration program for reporting lumber imports to ensure compliance with the U.S.-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement. The Senate also included a resolution on lumber imports consistent with the bilateral agreement. For more information on farm bill trade and food aid programs, refer to CRS reports. The 2008 farm bill primarily focuses on funding the Food Stamp program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), and providing free fresh fruits and vegetables in schools. It includes provisions to extend expiring authorities and increase spending for most programs. The 2008 farm bill primarily focuses on funding the Food Stamp program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), and providing free fresh fruits and vegetables in schools. It includes provisions to extend expiring authorities and increase spending for most programs. The bill mandates new spending on nutrition programs, including changes to increase food stamp benefits and eligibility, renaming the program as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Total spending on these programs is estimated to increase by $3.2 billion over 5 years and $10.2 billion over 10 years. The 2008 farm bill focuses on funding the Food Stamp program and nutrition programs, including changes to increase benefits and eligibility. Major revisions include boosting income disregarded for benefit calculations, increasing minimum monthly benefit guarantee, disregarding income spent on dependent care, and loosening eligibility rules on assets. Other provisions include inflation-indexed funding for nutrition assistance grants. The 2008 farm bill focuses on funding the Food Stamp program and nutrition programs, including changes to increase benefits and eligibility. Provisions include continuing inflation-indexed funding for nutrition assistance grants to Puerto Rico and American Samoa, extending the authority for a Food Distribution Program on Indian reservations, simplifying administrative processes, expanding transitional benefits, giving more flexibility in imposing penalties on retail food stores, adding disqualification penalties for misuse of food stamp benefits, and requiring greater federal scrutiny of state efforts to privatize and use computers in food stamp administration. The 2008 farm bill focuses on funding the Food Stamp program and nutrition programs, including changes to increase benefits and eligibility. Provisions in the bill represent policy changes that were included in both the House and Senate bills, with some significant initiatives not adopted for policy reasons. Notably, the House proposal to limit state privatization of food stamp administration and the Senate's provisions on eligibility rules and dietary supplements were not included. The nutrition title includes increased funding for TEFAP, with additional outlays estimated over FY2008-FY2017. The 2008 farm bill significantly increases mandatory funding for food purchases, with an immediate $50 million infusion in FY2008 and annual purchases raised to $250 million in FY2009. Funding for the fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools is also dramatically increased. Additionally, the bill includes provisions for schools to use geographic preference for locally grown agricultural products and increases mandatory outlays by $274 million (FY2008-FY2012) and $1 billion (FY2008-FY2017). The 2008 farm bill increases funding for food purchases, including $20.6 million for the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program. It also supports community food projects, promotes health and nutrition through the Food Stamp program, and funds various food distribution and school garden initiatives. The House and Senate versions had few policy differences but varied in proposed spending, with the House bill's nutrition title estimated at $4.2 billion for FY2008-FY2012. The House and Senate bills for the 2008 farm bill differed in funding priorities. The House allocated 78% of new funding to food stamps, 14% to TEFAP, and 7% to fresh produce. In contrast, the Senate allocated 66% to food stamps, 10% to TEFAP, and 21% to fruits and vegetables. The House proposed permanent policy changes costing $11.5 billion over 10 years, while the Senate's changes were set to expire after FY2012, costing $6.7 billion over the same period. The 2008 farm bill House and Senate bills differed in funding priorities and extensions of expiring authorities. The House allocated funds to food stamps, TEFAP, and fresh produce, while the Senate allocated funds to food stamps, TEFAP, and fruits/vegetables. The House proposed permanent policy changes costing $11.5 billion, while the Senate's changes were set to expire after FY2012, costing $6.7 billion. The final bill made policy changes permanent and extended expiring authorities through FY2012. The 2008 farm bill prioritizes and subsidizes Farm Service Agency lending for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, increases lending limits to $300,000 per individual for direct farm ownership and operating loans, and extends the guarantee program for seller-financed land loans. It also creates a conservation loan guarantee program for conservation projects. The 2008 farm bill extends the suspension of \"term limits\" on guaranteed operating loans until December 31, 2010. It also includes a pilot program for \"individual development accounts\" for beginning farmers and ranchers. Additionally, the bill allows claimants in the Pigford decision to petition for compensation in civil court, with a total limit of $100 million for payment and debt relief. USDA is restricted from foreclosing if the borrower can show it is related to a Pigford claim. The enacted 2008 farm bill does not allow expansion of Farm Credit System lending authority, addressing technical changes in insurance premiums and expanding borrower eligibility for Bank for Cooperatives voting stock. Commercial banks oppose FCS lending authority expansion, citing unfair competition due to FCS's government-sponsored enterprise status. The Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 designated USDA as the lead federal agency for rural development, administering various programs with a focus on rural counties. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized and amended rural development loan and grant programs, introducing new provisions. The 2008 farm bill amends rural development loan and grant programs, redefines \"rural\" with modifications, and directs USDA to develop restrictions on housing density. It also requires a report on the impact of different rural definitions on USDA programs. The bill reduces mandatory funding but adds discretionary authorization, providing $194 million in mandatory spending. The enacted 2008 farm bill provides $194 million in mandatory spending for rural development programs, including funding for backlogged water and wastewater applications, a Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance program, and Value-Added Product Grants. It does not include mandatory funding for rural health care or child care facilities as proposed by the Senate. Other provisions include support for locally produced agricultural food products, grants for employment opportunities for disabled individuals in rural areas, and the establishment of a new Rural Collaborative Investment Program. The enacted 2008 farm bill establishes a new Rural Collaborative Investment Program and provides support for water and wastewater programs. It also authorizes assistance to the Housing Assistance Council, reauthorizes the Rural Business Investment Program, and supports rural broadband development. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes various rural development and grant programs, including the Distance Learning and Telemedicine program, library connectivity, and regional development authorities. It also establishes a new National Center for Telecommunications Assessment and supports rural broadband development. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes rural development programs and establishes new regional development authorities: Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, Southwest Border Regional Commission, and Northern Borders Economic Development Commission. The bill also directs USDA to conduct studies on rural transportation and electric power generation. USDA's Research, Extension, and Economics mission area includes agricultural research and support for education programs. The federally funded extramural activities in agriculture are managed by the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES), which includes agencies like Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Economic Research Service (ERS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and National Agriculture Library (NAL). Congress has addressed issues related to federal agricultural research management and funding, with a focus on the structure of ARS management and the possibility of establishing a National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The Institute of Food and Agriculture has struggled with funding under budget constraints to keep up with inflation. Efforts have been made to secure mandatory funds for research, with less reliance on discretionary appropriations. Proposals like the USDA task force report and CREATE-21 have been presented to Congress for consideration. The 2008 farm bill, known as H.R. 2398 and S. 1094, established the Research, Extension, and Education Office (REEO) under the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics. The REEO includes six divisions with directors to coordinate agricultural research, extension, and education programs. The Chief Scientist of USDA is designated as the Under Secretary. The 2008 farm bill established the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to manage extramural research. NIFA is an independent agency for food and agricultural sciences, administering competitive grants. It replaces CSREES and implements the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) with an annual budget of $700 million.

The Senate bill authorizes over $1 billion in new mandatory funding and over $2 billion in discretionary funding. Both chambers aim to fund these provisions through various revenue and cost offset measures. Many federal programs supporting renewable energy, including agriculture-based energy, fall outside USDA's jurisdiction and have origins outside the farm bill. The energy provisions in the 2008 farm bill include funding for renewable fuels mandate expansion and legislative proposals on renewable energy outside USDA's jurisdiction. Specialty crop sales contribute significantly to U.S. agricultural exports. Specialty crops, including floriculture, greenhouse, and nursery crops, make up nearly 50% of U.S. farm crop cash receipts. However, specialty crop producers do not qualify for commodity income support programs. The 2008 farm bill includes a new title for Horticulture and Organic Agriculture, reauthorizing the specialty crop block grant program to support marketing research and promotion for specialty crops grown in each state.

Federal law has prohibited state-inspected meat and poultry plants from shipping products across state lines, but there are efforts to allow state-inspected plants to sell products in interstate commerce. The 2008 farm bill allows state-inspected plants with 25 employees or fewer to opt into a new program for federal oversight, enabling them to gain the federal mark of inspection and ship interstate. States would receive 60% reimbursement of their costs. This Senate compromise package addresses concerns about enabling plants to switch from federal to state inspection.

The federal crop insurance program aims to protect crop producers from risks related to adverse weather and plant diseases. The crop insurance program aims to protect crop producers from risks like adverse weather, plant diseases, and insect infestations. Despite its expansion over the past 25 years, it has not fully replaced ad hoc disaster payments. Some policymakers want to expand the program in the farm bill or complement it with a permanent disaster payment program. However, others see it as a target for cost reductions to fund new initiatives in the farm bill. There are calls for private companies to absorb more program losses and reduce reimbursement rates for their operating expenses. The crop insurance program is facing potential reductions in federal support to cut costs, which could impact the industry's financial health and delivery of insurance. The enacted 2008 farm bill includes revisions to reduce program costs, with estimated net savings of $3.9 billion over five years. The savings are achieved through changes in premium receipts timing and payments.
