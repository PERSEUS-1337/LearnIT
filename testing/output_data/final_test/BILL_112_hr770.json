Congress finds that the Department of Homeland Security's mission is to protect the United States, with ICE enforcing laws related to border security and criminal smuggling.

BEST teams include personnel from ICE, CBP, DEA, ATFE, FBI, USCG, and USAO to enhance collaboration and information-sharing.
