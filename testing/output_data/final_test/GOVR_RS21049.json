    "content": "The United States has been concerned about threats to Latin American and Caribbean nations from terrorist groups. Some countries in the region have struggled with domestic terrorism, and international terrorist groups have used the region as a battleground. The State Department's terrorism report highlights U.S. concerns about terrorist threats in Latin America. Transnational criminal organizations pose a more significant threat to the region than terrorism, according to the 2015 terrorism report. In Latin America, the State Department noted challenges in combating terrorism due to corruption, weak institutions, and lack of resources. The primary terrorist threats in the region are from Colombian guerrilla groups FARC and ELN. Peace talks with FARC began in 2012, leading to a peace agreement in 2016. The Colombian government signed a peace agreement with FARC in September 2016, which was initially rejected by voters but later approved by Congress. Talks with ELN have stalled. U.S. policymakers have expressed concerns about Iran's relations with Latin American countries, noting a decrease in Iranian influence in the region. Iran's relations with Latin America have diminished since President Rouhani took office in 2013. Concerns have been raised about Iran's ties to Hezbollah in the region. President Rouhani has expressed intentions to increase economic, scientific, and cultural ties with Latin America. The 2015 terrorism report highlighted Hezbollah's presence in South America, including fundraising activities in the tri-border area and support in Venezuela. It also mentioned the region as a hub for various illegal activities that could fund terrorist organizations, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The 2015 terrorism report mentioned the presence of Hezbollah in South America, fundraising activities in the tri-border area, and support in Venezuela. It also highlighted the region as a hub for illegal activities that could fund terrorist organizations like ISIL. SOUTCHOM Commander Admiral Tidd estimated 100-150 foreign fighters from South America and the Caribbean had traveled to Syria and Iraq, but noted a significant decrease in outflow due to U.S.-led coalition success. Cuba was removed from the State Department's state sponsors of terrorism list in April 2015 as part of President Obama's policy shift on Cuba. In April 2015, President Obama justified rescinding Cuba's designation on the state sponsors list, stating Cuba had not supported terrorism and pledged not to in the future. This led to Cuba's removal from the list in May 2015. Venezuela remains on the list for not fully cooperating with U.S. antiterrorism efforts since 2006, resulting in a U.S. arms embargo. The U.S. arms embargo on Cuba was lifted in 2015 after being on the Section 40A list since 1997. Concerns have been raised about Venezuela's lack of cooperation on antiterrorism efforts, relations with Iran, and support for drug and weapons trafficking by senior officials. Three Colombian groups, including FARC and ELN, were designated as FTOs in 1997, with the AUC being delisted in 2014. The FARC, a leftist guerrilla group involved in drug trafficking, was significantly weakened by the government's military campaign. Despite this, they still have 7,000-8,000 fighters operating in Colombia, responsible for terrorist attacks, kidnapping, extortion, and illegal mining. After the killing of leader Alfonso Cano, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o became the new leader. Peace talks were initiated in 2012 by President Juan Manuel Santos. In 2012, formal peace talks with the FARC began, focusing on a six-part agenda. A peace accord was signed in September 2016 but rejected in a plebiscite. A second peace accord, addressing criticisms, was ratified by Colombia's Congress on November 30, 2016. The peace accord with FARC was ratified by Colombia's Congress on November 30, 2016. The U.N. Security Council served as a guarantor of the cease-fire until the end of 2016. There are concerns about the cease-fire holding, but some believe it will lead to reduced violence and economic growth. Critics argue that the accord still gave too many concessions to FARC, allowing their leaders to enter politics and avoid prison. The FARC and ELN terrorist groups decreased attacks in 2015, focusing on low-cost, high-impact tactics. The Colombian government reduced military operations against the FARC, resulting in less violence, except for a spike in April and May after an attack on soldiers in Cauca. The number of captured, killed, or demobilized guerrilla fighters decreased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014. The FARC and ELN terrorist groups decreased attacks in 2015, focusing on low-cost, high-impact tactics. The FARC continued to use the territory of Colombia's neighbors, while the ELN, with around 2,000 fighters, carried out attacks despite reduced resources. The ELN, like the FARC, funds itself through drug trafficking, kidnapping, and extorting oil and gas companies. In 2015, the group increased attacks on oil pipelines and continued kidnapping for ransom, hindering peace talks with the Colombian government. The ELN operates in rural and mountainous areas of Colombia and along the eastern border with Venezuela. Peace talks with the government have been delayed due to the group's refusal to release all kidnap victims. The AUC, a right-wing paramilitary group, carried out political killings, kidnappings, and drug trafficking. Despite demobilization efforts, it remained on the FTO list until 2014. Former members joined criminal groups known as Bacrim, with Los Urabe\u00f1os emerging as a dominant force. A Colombian NGO predicts territorial reorganization of narco-paramilitary groups post peace accord with FARC. Cuba's support for insurgents abroad ended in 1992 due to loss of Soviet subsidies. Cuba was listed as a state sponsoring terrorism until 2015, despite questions about its inclusion. In December 2014, President Obama announced a new policy towards Cuba, shifting away from sanctions towards engagement. As part of this change, a review of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism was ordered by Secretary of State Kerry. Critics argued that Cuba's presence on the terrorism list was a Cold War relic driven by domestic politics, diverting attention from more serious threats. Supporters cited Cuba's history of supporting terrorist acts and hosting fugitives as reasons to keep it on the list. President Obama directed Secretary of State Kerry to review Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The review was completed in April 2015, and Obama certified that Cuba had not supported international terrorism in the preceding 6-month period. The rescission of Cuba's designation took place on May 29, 2015. The memorandum of justification stated that Cuba had distanced itself from international terrorism and strengthened its counterterrorism laws. It mentioned no credible evidence of Cuba supporting Colombian guerrilla groups in the past six months but noted the presence of ETA members in Cuba. The justification for the agreement with Spain highlighted Cuba's harboring of fugitives wanted in the US and the need for a bilateral law enforcement dialogue. Secretary of State Kerry removed Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list and the annual determination identifying countries not fully cooperating with US antiterrorism efforts. Cuba had been designated annually since 1997. The Maoist insurgency in Peru, known as SL, has been operating as a terrorist group since 1980. Despite being significantly weakened in the 1990s with the capture of its leader, Abimael Guzman, SL remains active in the Apurimac, Ene, and Mantaro River Valley (VRAEM) in south-central Peru. The group sustains itself through drug production and trafficking, as well as extortion. Its combatant strength is estimated to be 250-300, including 60-100 hardcore fighters. The Maoist insurgency group in Peru, known as SL, has around 250-300 combatants, including 60-100 hardcore fighters. In 2015, they committed 13 terrorist acts. SL leaders were designated as significant foreign narcotics traffickers and sanctioned by the Treasury Department. Three leaders were indicted by a U.S. federal court in New York in 2014. The U.S. designated Victor and Jorge Quispe Palomino and Tarcela Loya Vilchez as Specially Designated Global Terrorists under Executive Order 13224, imposing sanctions on them for their involvement in terrorism. Concerns have been raised about Venezuela's lack of cooperation on antiterrorism efforts, senior Venezuelan officials supporting FARC's illegal activities, and Venezuela's relations with Iran. The Secretary of State has annually determined since 2006 that Venezuela is not fully cooperating with U.S. antiterrorism efforts. The United States has imposed an arms embargo on Venezuela since 2006 under the Arms Export Control Act. Various sanctions have been imposed on Venezuelan individuals and companies for supporting terrorist groups like FARC, Iran, and Hezbollah. Despite not being classified as a state sponsor of terrorism, Venezuela has been criticized for maintaining an environment conducive to terrorist activities. The 2015 terrorism report highlighted the presence of individuals linked to terrorist groups like FARC, ELN, ETA, and Hezbollah sympathizers in Venezuela. It mentioned FARC's use of Venezuela's border areas for incursions into Colombia and noted Venezuela's vulnerability to corruption at ports of entry. Despite this, Venezuela participated in negotiations between FARC and the Colombian government. The 2015 terrorism report raised concerns about Venezuela's vulnerability to corruption at ports of entry and its relations with Iran. There were worries about the close ties between Venezuela and Iran during the presidencies of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. However, analysts believe that Iranian relations with the region have decreased since Hassan Rouhani took office in 2013. Despite this, U.S. officials remain concerned about Iranian activities in the region. During Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency, Iran sought to increase ties with Latin American countries, using Venezuela as a gateway to the region. Iran and Hezbollah are linked to bombings in Buenos Aires in the early 1990s. U.S. officials remain concerned about Iranian activities in Latin America. During Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency, Iran strengthened ties with Latin American countries, using Venezuela as a gateway. Iran and Hezbollah are connected to bombings in Buenos Aires in the early 1990s. Current Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has not prioritized relations with Latin America, visiting the region for the first time in September 2016. Iran's Foreign Minister also traveled to seven Latin American countries in 2016 to enhance trade and cooperation post-sanctions. Iran has pledged to increase economic, scientific, and cultural ties with Latin America, despite U.S. officials remaining vigilant about Iran's activities in the region. Iran's main foreign policy focus remains the Middle East and South and Central Asia, where it perceives potential threats to its survival and tries to alter political outcomes in its favor. Iran has made efforts to engage with like-minded leaders in Latin America, but its level of involvement in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Lebanon surpasses its activities in the region. U.S. concerns about Iran's relations with Latin America stem from its ties to Hezbollah, which has been linked to bombings against Jewish targets in Argentina. Hezbollah's fundraising activities in the tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have raised concerns, although its primary funding comes from Iran. The cities of Foz do Igua\u00e7u in Brazil and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay have significant Muslim populations. The TBA, including Foz do Igua\u00e7u in Brazil and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, has a large Muslim population and is known for illicit activities like arms and drug trafficking, money laundering, and pirated goods movement. The State Department's 2015 terrorism report mentions Hezbollah's presence in the region, engaging in fundraising activities through both legal and illegal means. Venezuela's long-standing relations with Iran date back to their founding membership in OPEC in 1960. Iran's increased focus on Latin America began during President Ahmadinejad's rule in 2005 to overcome international isolation and reduce the impact of sanctions. This was driven by efforts to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties with countries like Venezuela, including joint ventures for tractor production. The personal relationship between Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez drove the strengthening of bilateral ties, leading to agreements in various sectors. Weekly flights between the two countries started in 2007 but were reduced in 2010. Venezuela under Ch\u00e1vez also played a significant role in Iran's relations with other leftist governments in the region, aiming to reduce U.S. influence. Iranian President Ahmadinejad visited Latin America multiple times from 2006 to 2013, including Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Cuba. His trips raised concerns among U.S. policymakers about Iran's efforts to deepen ties with the region. Promises of assistance and investment to countries like Venezuela and Nicaragua have not been fully realized. Despite Iranian President Ahmadinejad's multiple visits to Latin America from 2006 to 2013 to strengthen ties, analysts and U.S. officials view the trips as largely propaganda. The January 2012 trip excluded Brazil, diminishing its significance, with an adviser accusing President Rousseff of damaging Iran-Brazil relations. Iran under President Ahmadinejad opened six embassies in Latin America by 2009\u2014Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Uruguay. In 2012, Iran launched a Spanish-language satellite TV network to counter biased reporting. Reports of a large embassy in Nicaragua and Venezuela were inaccurate. The U.S. State Department officials disputed reports of Iran having one of the largest embassies in Venezuela, stating that the U.S. Embassy in Caracas has a larger diplomatic presence. Despite Iran's increased presence in Latin America, General Douglas Fraser of the U.S. Southern Command noted that Iran's focus in the region was primarily diplomatic and economic, with no significant military presence observed. In 2011, the Department of Justice filed criminal charges against Manssor Arbabsiar, a dual Iranian-American citizen, and Gholam Shakuri from Iran's Qods Force for a plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, DC. Arbabsiar met with a DEA informant in Mexico City, posing as a member of a drug trafficking organization, to arrange the murder with financial support from Shakuri. Arbabsiar pled guilty and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. U.S. officials expressed concern about the implications of the failed Iranian plot on terrorism. The failed Iranian plot in 2011 raised concerns about the nexus between terrorist and criminal groups, Iran's intentions, and the willingness of Iranian officials to conduct attacks in the United States. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper expressed worry about Iranian plotting against U.S. or allied interests overseas. Argentine Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman was also involved in the investigation. In 2004, Argentine Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman took over the AMIA investigation, which had been hindered by government mishandling. Nisman's appointment led to a new investigation, resulting in arrest warrants for nine individuals, including a Hezbollah militant and Iranian officials. INTERPOL issued Red Notices for the wanted individuals in 2007. In 2007, Red Notices were issued for Hezbollah militant Mughniyah and five Iranian officials. Argentina also issued an arrest warrant for Samuel Salman El Reda in 2009. President Macri has maintained these Red Notices, while the previous government under President Fern\u00e1ndez had shifted its stance on engaging with Iran over the AMIA bombing issue. In 2012, Argentina held talks with Iran led by Foreign Minister Hector Timerman to establish a joint Truth Commission for the AMIA bombing case. Despite opposition from Jewish groups and US Congress members, Argentina's Congress approved the agreement in February 2013. In May 2014, an Argentine court declared the agreement unconstitutional. In May 2014, an Argentine court declared unconstitutional the agreement with Iran to jointly investigate the AMIA bombing. Special Prosecutor Nisman criticized the agreement as interference in judicial matters. President Fern\u00e1ndez supported the agreement at the UN, but President Macri later decided to drop the appeal. Nisman's report in May 2013 alleged Iran's long-standing involvement in Latin America. The 500-page report by Nisman alleges Iran's long-standing involvement in Latin America, with key figures like Mohsen Rabbani coordinating activities in various countries. Abdul Kadir, a Guyanese national, was identified as an intelligence agent for Iran, involved in establishing an Iranian network in Guyana. The Nisman report revealed Iran's regional strategy involving intelligence bases in multiple countries to support terrorist acts, including the 1994 AMIA bombing. Nisman accused President Fern\u00e1ndez of trying to cover up the investigation to secure oil supplies from Iran. Nisman's death, initially ruled a suicide, is widely believed to be a murder by many Argentines, including President Fern\u00e1ndez. President Fern\u00e1ndez contended that Nisman was misled into accusing her government by elements in Argentina's Intelligence Secretariat. She called for the dissolution of the SI and a new intelligence service, the AFI, was established. Nisman's death led to a massive demonstration in Argentina. The investigation into his death continues, with skepticism about uncovering the truth. In December 2015, Judge Fabiana Palmaghini took over the case. In January 2016, President Macri ordered the declassification of state information related to Nisman's death. Judge Palmaghini ruled to elevate the case to federal courts after testimony linking Nisman's death to a group with ties to former President Fern\u00e1ndez. The case went back and forth between federal courts and Judge Palmaghini's jurisdiction until September 2016. In 2016, President Macri expressed belief that Nisman was murdered and called for a definitive investigation. Following Nisman's death, Argentina's attorney general appointed a team to continue the AMIA investigation, leading to court proceedings against 13 former officials in August 2015. During the 1990s, former intelligence and police officials, along with the head of DAIA and the owner of a van used in the AMIA bombing, were involved. President Macri established a special unit in December 2015 to investigate the bombing, led by Mario Cimadevilla. The United States has historically supported Latin American nations in their fight against terrorist groups, such as in El Salvador in the 1980s. The United States has employed various policy tools to combat terrorism in Latin America and the Caribbean region, including sanctions, antiterrorism assistance, law enforcement cooperation, and multilateral cooperation through the OAS. Efforts to combat drug trafficking and money laundering in the Andean region have also been seen as means of combating terrorism. U.S. attention to terrorism in Latin America increased after the 9/11 attacks, leading to increased antiterrorism assistance and cooperation against terrorism. The United States expanded assistance to Colombia in 2002 to include counterterrorism efforts against drug-financed guerrillas and paramilitaries. Border security with Mexico also became a focus, with concerns about terrorists transiting through Mexico. Congress enacted the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 to address Iran and Hezbollah activities in the region. The State Department report in June 2013 addressed the threats posed by Iran in the Western Hemisphere. It highlighted policy recommendations including border security, diplomacy, sanctions, and intelligence sharing. The report mentioned that Iranian influence in Latin America and the Caribbean was decreasing due to U.S. diplomatic efforts and sanctions. The United States imposes sanctions on terrorist groups in Colombia and Peru, triggering visa restrictions and financial sanctions. Treasury Department also sanctions individuals and companies in the region linked to terrorist groups like Hezbollah for drug trafficking. The United States imposed sanctions on terrorist groups in Colombia and Peru, triggering visa restrictions and financial sanctions. Additionally, Cuba was removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2015, while Venezuela remains on the list for not fully cooperating with U.S. antiterrorism efforts. Financial sanctions have been imposed on Venezuelan government and military officials for supporting FARC's weapons and drug trafficking. The US imposed sanctions on a Venezuelan company, CAVIM, for violating a ban on technology that could aid Iran in developing weapons. Sanctions against two other Venezuelan companies were lifted after the Iran nuclear accord. The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on individuals and companies in Latin America for supporting Hezbollah. The United States has imposed sanctions on individuals and entities in Latin America, including the tri-border Area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, as well as in Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela, for supporting Hezbollah. The US provides assistance to improve Latin American countries' counterterrorism capabilities through various programs funded by the NADR foreign aid account. The ATA program provides training and equipment to Latin American countries for airport security, hostage negotiations, bomb detection, and countering terrorism financing. Assistance was increased in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay due to U.S. concerns over illicit activities. Funding for Western Hemisphere countries was almost $8 million in FY2014, $5.1 million in FY2015, and $2.2 million in FY2016. The Administration requested $5.1 million for FY2017, with allocations for Mexico, Colombia, and other Latin American countries. The EXBS program helps countries develop export and border control systems. The EXBS program provides funding to Latin American countries to develop export and border control systems to prevent the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. Colombia is the sole recipient of CWD funding in the region, aiding in their demining program. Assistance from the U.S. increases Colombia's ability to clear mines and improvised explosive devices. Colombia received $3.5 million in CWD funding annually from FY2014 to FY2016, with a request for $21 million in FY2017. The Administration's FY2017 request was for $21 million for counterterrorism assistance in Latin America, including programs like the M\u00e9rida Initiative, Central America Regional Security Initiative, and Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. U.S. assistance also aims to strengthen democratic governance and improve state institutions. Latin American countries participate in U.S.-government port security programs. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) operated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection of DHS ensures that containers posing a terrorism risk are inspected at foreign ports before heading to the U.S. Ten Latin American ports participate in CSI. Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) established by ICE in partnership with Latin American countries combat trade-based money laundering. TTUs are in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. The United States participates in the Financial Action Task Force to combat money laundering and terrorist financing in Latin America and the Caribbean. The State Department evaluates countries' efforts in its annual reports on terrorism and international narcotics control strategy. In its 2016 report, the State Department identified 20 countries in Latin America or the Caribbean as \"major laundering countries\" or \"jurisdictions of primary concern\" due to significant financial transactions involving proceeds from serious crime. The report discusses money laundering efforts in each country and cooperation against terrorism through organizations like the OAS and the Rio Treaty. The OAS members invoked the Rio Treaty to combat terrorism and show solidarity with the United States after the September 11 attacks. They also signed the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism in 2002 to improve regional cooperation against terrorism. The OAS members invoked the Rio Treaty and signed the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism to combat terrorism and improve regional cooperation. The treaty committed parties to take actions against terrorism financing, deny safe haven to suspected terrorists, and cooperate on border security mechanisms, law enforcement, and intelligence sharing. Capacity building and training programs were also implemented to strengthen strategies against emerging terrorist threats. At its 16th regular session in February 2016, CICTE focused on the use of the Internet for terrorist and criminal purposes, cybersecurity, and legislative initiatives related to terrorism in the Western Hemisphere. The 111th Congress enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Disinvestment Act of 2010, which included sanctions on gasoline sales to Iran, leading to sanctions on Venezuela's state oil company in 2011. The 112th Congress passed the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012. The Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 (H.R. 3783, P.L. 112-220) required the Administration to develop a strategy to address Iran's hostile presence in the Western Hemisphere. Congress expressed concerns about Argentina's investigation of the 1994 AMIA bombing. In the 114th Congress, Senate resolutions were introduced regarding the AMIA bombing. S.Res. 167 called for an investigation into Alberto Nisman's death and expressed concern about Iran's activities in the Western Hemisphere. S.Res. 620 encouraged Argentina to prosecute those responsible for the bombing and Nisman's death. In the 114th Congress, Senate resolutions were introduced regarding the AMIA bombing and Nisman's death. H.R. 274 aimed to rescind Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The House-passed version of the FY2017 NDAA had a provision to block military cooperation with Cuba until certain conditions were met. The FY2017 NDAA conference report did not include language regarding Cuba's return of U.S. fugitives. Several initiatives were introduced in Congress to address the extradition of fugitives from Cuba to the United States. H.R. 4772 and H.R. 2189 were bills introduced in Congress regarding U.S. fugitives from justice, with one specifically targeting Cuba. Additionally, H.R. 4482 focused on enhancing border security efforts to prevent terrorism threats. The 114th Congress conducted oversight hearings on terrorism concerns in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs held hearings on Iran and Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere, border security challenges in Latin America, and terrorist funding in South America. The SOUTHCOM Commander expressed concerns about Iran's involvement in the region.
