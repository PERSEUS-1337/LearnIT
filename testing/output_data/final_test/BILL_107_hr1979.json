The \"Small Airport Safety, Security, and Air Service Improvement Act of 2002\" allows the Secretary to provide grants for the construction or improvement of nonapproach control towers at primary airports. The \"Small Airport Safety, Security, and Air Service Improvement Act of 2002\" authorizes grants for constructing or improving nonapproach control towers at primary airports, with specific requirements for reimbursement eligibility. The \"Small Airport Safety, Security, and Air Service Improvement Act of 2002\" authorizes grants for acquiring and installing air traffic control equipment at public-use airports that are not primary airports. The \"Small Airport Safety, Security, and Air Service Improvement Act of 2002\" authorizes grants for acquiring and installing air traffic control equipment at public-use airports for non-primary airports. This includes reimbursement for construction or improvement of nonapproach control towers meeting specific requirements. The \"Small Airport Safety, Security, and Air Service Improvement Act of 2002\" authorizes grants for acquiring and installing air traffic control equipment at public-use airports for non-primary airports, including reimbursement for the cost of acquiring and installing air traffic control, communications, and related equipment in towers after October 1, 1996. Airport sponsors must be participants in the FAA contract tower program to be eligible for these grants. The program allows airport sponsors to participate in the FAA contract tower program by paying a portion of the costs and being accepted by the Secretary into the program. The Secretary will seek future appropriations to pay the FAA's cost of operating the tower to be constructed. The sponsor must certify payment of its share of the contract cost. If the tower is constructed using specific funds, the FAA must consult the State. The administration has consulted with the State supporting the construction of a tower as part of its airport capital plan. The selection for funding is based on objective criteria, without considering congressional reports or designations. The Federal share of construction costs is limited for non-approach towers. The Federal share of the cost for constructing a non-approach control tower is capped at $1,100,000. Amendments are made to specify non-approach control towers in relevant sections. Existing towers receiving assistance before the enactment of this Act can continue to receive assistance under the previous terms. The Federal share for constructing non-approach control towers is capped at $1,100,000. Amendments specify non-approach control towers in relevant sections. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may enter into a lease or contract agreement with a private entity for the construction and operation of a non-approach control tower. The agreement must be negotiated to ensure integrity, safety of air travel, and protect U.S. interests. It may include a lease option for the U.S. to occupy general-purpose space in the facility, without requiring Federal ownership unless determined by the Administrator. The agreement between the Federal Aviation Administration and a private entity for a non-approach control tower must outline responsibilities, disclaim liability for the United States, and include terms deemed appropriate by the Administrator. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on using up to 10% of apportioned funds for airport sponsors to cover non-Federal costs of operating air traffic control towers. A report on the study's results must be submitted to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment."
