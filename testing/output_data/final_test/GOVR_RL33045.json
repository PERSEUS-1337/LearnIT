    "content": "The CDSOA, also known as the Byrd Amendment, requires duties collected from antidumping or countervailing duty orders to be distributed to petitioners and interested parties. Eight countries challenged the CDSOA in a WTO dispute, leading to authorization for retaliation by the European Union, Japan, Korea, India, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and Chile. Some countries have imposed increased tariffs on selected U.S. goods as a form of retaliation. The European Union, Canada, Mexico, and Japan imposed tariff surcharges in 2005. Congressional action was needed for the US to comply with WTO determinations. Efforts to repeal the CDSOA were made in the 109th Congress, with the measure eventually being repealed in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The CDSOA language was included in a report that passed the House and Senate in December 2005. A point of order in the Senate led to a slightly different version of the report being passed. There were multiple efforts to repeal the CDSOA in the 109th Congress, including amendments that were not voted upon. A bill to repeal the measure was proposed but not yet included in a larger bill. The controversy over the Byrd Amendment in Congress is part of a larger debate on U.S. trade policy. There is disagreement over the balance between benefits of liberalizing trade and costs to domestic industries. The 109th Congress has focused on U.S. compliance with WTO rulings, including the CDSOA controversy. The report discusses the controversy over the CDSOA in Congress, covering the background of the law, effects, and the WTO dispute settlement case. It also discusses the congressional debate on repealing the measure and options for Congress. Antidumping and countervailing duty investigations are triggered by petitions alleging injury from dumped or subsidized imports. Relief requires findings by the ITA and ITC on dumping, subsidization, and material injury to the domestic industry. The CDSOA aims to address the issue of dumped or subsidized foreign products in the US market after antidumping or countervailing duties have been assessed. It aims to prevent market prices from staying unfair, which can hinder domestic producers from investing in their businesses to remain competitive. The CDSOA is a unique trade policy concept. The CDSOA directs revenue from unfair trade to help those affected, disbursed by CBP to petitioners. Controversial for adding protection to US products without committee approval. The CDSOA amendment was inserted into the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2001 by Senator Robert Byrd. President Clinton expressed concerns about the subsidy provided to select U.S. industries and called on Congress to repeal or amend the provision. The CDSOA requires CBP to distribute duties collected under AD or CVD orders to affected domestic producers. The CDSOA allows CBP to distribute duties collected under AD or CVD orders to affected domestic producers. Distributions can be used for qualifying expenditures like manufacturing facilities, equipment, research, and development. The International Trade Commission sends a list of petitioners and interested parties to CBP for the distribution process. Trade Commission provides a list of petitioners and interested parties to CBP in support of investigations. CBP publishes a notice of intent to distribute offsets to affected domestic producers, who must demonstrate eligibility and certify qualifying expenditures. Antidumping and countervailing duties collected by CBP are placed in individual Clearing Accounts for each duty order. The duty order determines how duties are collected and distributed into Special Accounts for offset payments to claimants. Payments are limited by the total duties in the account, resulting in minimal payments to claimants. In FY2004, only 0.01% of total claims were available for disbursement. The CBP distributed $231 million in FY2001, $330 million in FY2002, $190 million in FY2003, and $284 million in FY2004 under the Subsidy Offset Act. FY2005 data is available on the CBP website. Industries receiving the largest CDSOA disbursements in FY2004 included producers of ball bearings, steel, petroleum wax candles, cement, and various food products. The CBP distributed significant amounts under the Subsidy Offset Act in FY2001-2004, with top industries receiving disbursements including ball bearings, steel, petroleum wax candles, cement, and various food products. Continued dumping of certain commodities suggests multinational firms may be moving production factors to U.S. affiliates to maintain profitability despite additional duties. In FY2001-2004, significant amounts were distributed under the Subsidy Offset Act to top industries like ball bearings, steel, petroleum wax candles, cement, and food products. Multinational firms may absorb additional duties as a cost of doing business to maintain profitability. Top companies receiving disbursements in FY2004 included Timken Company, Lancaster Colony Corporation, Micron Technology, Emerson Power Transmission, and International Steel Group. Top 10 CDSOA Disbursements by Company in FY2004 included Timken US Corporation, Timken Company, and MPB Corporation. Ohio received the largest amount of CDSOA funds, followed by Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, Texas, and New Hampshire. Some states received much less, with Vermont only receiving $1,130.81. No companies in Nevada or New Mexico received CDSOA offset payments. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act Disbursement Report for 2004 is available on the CBP website and has faced legal challenges in U.S. courts. A pending lawsuit argues that the CDSOA violates the First Amendment by conditioning eligibility for funds on support of antidumping investigations. Another claim that the CDSOA turns statutory provisions into penal law was rejected. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected a company's attempt to make CDSOA claims on behalf of an acquired producer who opposed an antidumping investigation. The court interpreted the law to prevent opposers from receiving payments directly or through acquired supporting parties. The court ruled that the CDSOA does not override confidentiality provisions, denying plaintiff companies distributions under the Byrd Amendment for duties on candles from China. The ITC properly excluded them from the list of affected producers due to late requests and confidentiality claims. Canada and Canadian industry groups filed a lawsuit against the United States, alleging that the CDSOA violates NAFTA. They argue that the CDSOA, as a provision of Title VII, does not specify its application to Canadian goods, making it unlawful for the United States to apply it. The United States unlawfully applied the CDSOA to distribute duties on Canadian imports to U.S. producers, leading to a WTO dispute. Retaliatory tariffs were imposed by the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and Japan in response. In 2005, WTO Panel and Appellate Body decisions were made regarding the CDSOA. The European Communities, along with other countries, requested consultations with the United States, arguing that the CDSOA violated WTO agreements. The complainants argued that the payments provided a strong incentive for domestic producers to file anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures, distorting their application. The CDSOA was challenged for distorting the application of anti-dumping and countervailing measures by providing incentives for domestic producers to file petitions. Mexico also argued that the payments under the act constituted specific subsidies, causing adverse effects. The WTO panel found that the CDSOA created impermissible specific actions against dumping and subsidization, providing financial incentives for domestic producers to file antidumping and countervailing duty petitions, undermining industry support requirements in the Antidumping and SCM Agreements. The Appellate Body upheld the panel's finding that the CDSOA constituted specific action against dumping and subsidization not allowed under WTO agreements, but reversed the panel on industry support requirements. The statute was deemed specific action because offset payments were linked to determinations of dumping or subsidies. The Appellate Body determined that the CDSOA constituted action against dumping or subsidization, creating incentives to end such practices. The statute was found to transfer financial resources to domestic competitors, falling within the prohibitions of WTO agreements. The AB recommended bringing the CDSOA into conformity with obligations. The WTO appellate body recommended bringing the CDSOA into conformity with WTO agreements. Complainants can seek authorization to suspend concessions or retaliate if the defending member does not comply within the agreed period. Countermeasures like duty surcharges can be imposed until compliance is achieved or a settlement is reached. A settlement was reached in a WTO dispute after the United States missed a deadline. Eight complaining Members sought authorization to impose retaliatory measures, while three others gave the US until December 27, 2004, to comply. The level of suspension of concessions must be equivalent to the harm caused by the infringing measures. The WTO Arbitrator authorized eight Members to impose countermeasures annually, equal to 72% of the CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year. The United States contested the requests for retaliation, arguing that it was not based on actual harm to complainants' exports. The WTO Arbitrator authorized eight Members to impose countermeasures annually, equal to 72% of the CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year. The Arbitrator used an economic model to determine the level of nullification or impairment of benefits caused by the CDSOA. Each Member needed to ensure that the total value of U.S. trade subject to the proposed duty increase did not exceed the level of nullification or impairment. In FY2003, $121 million was collected in duties on imports of co-complainants, with $87.12 million available for distribution among eight parties. Several countries requested authorization for retaliatory measures, while others entered agreements with the U.S. to not seek authorization for now but retain the right to retaliate in the future. On April 25, 2005, the EU imposed 15% customs duties on certain US products. Canada followed suit on May 5, 2005, with a 15% surtax on specific items. Complaining parties urged the repeal of the CDSOA, warning of potential retaliatory measures by July 2005. Japan and Mexico imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to the CDSOA, with Japan announcing a 15% tariff on various products and Mexico imposing a 30% tariff on certain milk products. The Mexican government imposed tariffs effective August 18, 2005, with rates of 30% on certain prepared milk products, 20% on wine, and 9% on chewing gum. The tariffs will remain in effect for 12 months and will be lifted when the US complies with the WTO decision. The CDSOA is linked to the US-Canadian dispute over softwood lumber, which has led to WTO and NAFTA complaints by Canada. The US has been imposing duties on Canadian softwood lumber since May 2002, totaling over $4 billion in deposited duties. Canada has contested final determinations in WTO dispute settlement proceedings and before binational panels under NAFTA regarding duty deposits with Customs and Border Protection. WTO and NAFTA panels ruled against the original ITC threat of injury determination, leading to a \"no threat\" determination issued by the ITC under protest in September 2004. The United States appealed the NAFTA panel decision to a NAFTA Extraordinary Challenge Committee, which upheld the panel decision in August 2005. In response to the WTO decision, the ITC found a threat of material injury and issued a Section 129 determination in November 2004. Canada requested a WTO compliance panel review and sought authorization to impose sanctions against the United States. A panel report in November 2005 upheld the U.S. threat determination, which Canada has appealed. Canada argues that the U.S. has no legal basis for maintaining antidumping and countervailing duty. Canada is concerned that the United States may not refund duty deposits if antidumping and countervailing duty orders on softwood lumber are revoked. The U.S. maintains that it can continue collecting these duties despite a negative threat of injury determination. Canada and Canadian producers have filed a suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade regarding this issue. Canada and Canadian producers have filed a suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade challenging the United States Trade Representative's direction to implement the November 2004 ITC determination. There is opposition in Congress to repealing the CDSOA, with Senators urging negotiations with trading partners for a positive resolution instead of changing the law. The CDSOA supporters in Congress are urging to preserve the law to protect jobs and American industry competitiveness. Senators have warned against repealing the law and have inserted provisions in appropriations acts to direct the USTR and Department of Commerce to initiate WTO actions. The CDSOA supporters in Congress are pushing to maintain the law to safeguard jobs and American industry competitiveness. Senators have cautioned against repealing the law and have included provisions in appropriations acts to instruct the USTR and Department of Commerce to start WTO negotiations on the distribution of monies collected from antidumping and countervailing duties. Some Members introduced legislation in Congress to repeal the CDSOA, with bills seeking to redirect funds to aid communities impacted by trade or deposit them in the U.S. Treasury. In the 109th Congress, a bill to repeal the CDSOA was included in a trade package proposed by the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee. In September 2005, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Grassley introduced amendments related to the CDSOA in H.R. 2862. One amendment would have required the USTR to assess if CDSOA funds distribution complies with U.S. WTO obligations. Another would have removed the CDSOA negotiation requirement. However, neither amendment was voted on. In October 2005, a provision to repeal the CDSOA was included in a House Ways and Means Committee-approved budget reconciliation resolution. The Entitlement Reconciliation Recommendations for Fiscal Year 2006, included in H.R. 4241, aimed to save $3.2 billion over five years by depositing remaining money in AD and CVD accounts into the Treasury. The Senate version of the budget reconciliation bill, S. 1932, did not include CDSOA repeal and faced opposition in the Senate. The Senate version of the budget reconciliation bill, S. 1932, did not include CDSOA repeal. Senators expressed concerns about potential changes to U.S. trade law, with Senator Grassley favoring repeal through the budget reconciliation package. The House later inserted the CDSOA repeal measure into S. 1932, passing an amended version of the bill. The House passed an amended version of S. 1932, including the CDSOA repeal measure, by a close vote. Despite objections, House and Senate conferees agreed to include a provision repealing CDSOA, allowing duties on merchandise before October 1, 2007. The conference report was passed by the House, and during Senate debate, Senators clarified the bill's requirements for duty distribution. The Senate approved the S. 1932 conference report in a 51-50 vote, with duties collected on products entering on or after October 1, 2007, to be deposited with the U.S. Treasury. The Senate approved the S. 1932 conference report with a 51-50 vote, Vice President Dick Cheney casting the deciding vote. A point of order in the Senate led to differences between the House and Senate versions, requiring the House to reconsider. The House approved the legislation on February 1, 2006, with a vote of 216-214. The Byrd Amendment controversy is part of a larger debate on U.S. trade policy and the balance between trade benefits and costs to domestic industries. The debate over the CDSOA revolves around the impact of trade on domestic industries and workers, with differing views on the measure's effectiveness in leveling the playing field for U.S. producers affected by unfair trade practices. Congress may face pressure to repeal the measure from both exporters facing retaliatory duties and domestic producers benefiting from it, reflecting broader disagreements on the merits of WTO membership. The WTO serves as a forum for trade negotiations and dispute settlement. U.S. trade policy is closely tied to foreign policy interests, with concerns about noncompliance affecting relations with other nations. Trade remedy actions, like the CDSOA, are controversial among economists and policymakers. Some argue that the CDSOA increases economic inefficiency, while others believe it is necessary to protect U.S. industries and jobs. Economists generally support trade liberalization for optimal economic welfare. Economic theory suggests that nations benefit from specializing in products they have a comparative advantage in and importing others. Trade barriers harm economies the most, and trade remedy actions introduce inefficiencies. Some economists argue that subsidization or dumping by other countries can benefit the U.S. economy in the long run. The CDSOA measure is criticized for providing double remedies to domestic producers, leading to economic inefficiency in trade actions. It also contributes to price increases on industrial inputs used by downstream industries like automobiles and housing. Downstream industries, such as automobile and housing, face higher costs due to trade remedies, leading to increased prices for their products. Retaliatory actions by the EU and Canada may make U.S. exports uncompetitive in foreign markets. The CDSOA benefits domestic firms but harms downstream producers, exporters, and consumers. The CDSOA may lead to unequal distribution of benefits within industries, giving some firms an advantage over competitors. Only firms supporting trade remedy actions are eligible for payments, disadvantaging those who do not support such actions. The CDSOA mechanism may disadvantage more efficient firms in domestic industries, as they may be less likely to support trade remedy petitions due to high costs. This has sparked intense debate within industries, such as when U.S. furniture makers filed a petition on wooden bedroom furniture from China, facing opposition from larger furniture retailers concerned about job losses and business impact. Many U.S. furniture manufacturers supported an investigation on wooden bedroom furniture from China, despite opposition from retailers worried about job losses. The CDSOA payments may discourage industries from staying competitive by prolonging production of a specific product instead of exploring more efficient methods. The CDSOA payments may encourage firms to increase output beyond market signals, driving down product costs. Supporters believe it helps U.S. producers compete with unfairly traded imports from China by enabling them to invest in new machinery and hire more workers. The CDSOA creates a disincentive for foreign exporters to dump goods and compensates domestic producers to maintain competitiveness, promoting trade fairness and preserving critical U.S. industries and jobs. Many countries limit competition in their economies, allowing chosen firms to charge higher prices at home. The CDSOA aims to offset lower foreign market prices by allowing chosen firms to charge higher prices domestically, potentially encouraging international trade. Research suggests it could lead to higher welfare for the domestic economy and lower antidumping duties if administrative authorities prioritize higher CDSOA payments for affected industries. Many policymakers believe in a rules-based trading system that reduces barriers to trade and enhances predictability. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism, created by the United States, is seen as an effective means to achieve this goal. Modifying existing statutes would be necessary to increase duty proceeds if desired, as the intent of trade remedy actions is to discourage dumping of merchandise. The WTO dispute settlement mechanism, supported by many policymakers, is seen as a unique and effective way to ensure trade practices align with GATT/WTO commitments. Some believe that in the CDSOA ruling, WTO panels overreached by creating obligations for the United States beyond what was agreed to, violating Article 3.2 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding. Supporters of the CDSOA believe that WTO panels infringed on U.S. sovereignty by mandating changes to U.S. laws and encroaching on the authority of Congress. They argue that the complaining parties failed to show sufficient evidence of harm from CDSOA implementation. Those in favor of repealing CDSOA argue that the U.S. and other WTO members voluntarily agreed to limit how they protect industries from import competition when they joined the WTO. The DSU states that violations of WTO agreements are presumed to have adverse impacts on other parties. The CDSOA nullifies benefits for complaining parties, even without proof of economic harm. Critics fear the law discourages alternative trade remedy actions like suspension agreements, as industries may pressure authorities for CDSOA disbursements. Many WTO members prefer suspension agreements for resolving trade disputes. The United States has ten suspension agreements in force, including measures on steel imports and tomatoes from various countries. WTO dispute settlement panels rejected arguments that the US violated agreements, stating that acceptance of alternative measures is voluntary. The CDSOA was enacted with concerns of emulation, but there is little evidence to suggest it led to an escalation of U.S. AD or CVD petitions. U.S. trade remedy initiations actually dropped after an initial increase in 2001. The number of U.S. trade remedy initiations has not increased significantly, possibly due to high transaction costs for filing AD and CVD petitions. While some industries receive substantial CDSOA payments, most companies receive much less. Concerns exist about other countries adopting similar laws, leading to a rise in trade remedy actions globally. The increase in trade remedy actions worldwide prior to 2001 could harm U.S. exports and international economic welfare. However, AD and CVD initiations have declined globally, with some attributing it to international restraint during Doha Round negotiations. Compliance with the Byrd Amendment ruling may benefit the U.S. in the ongoing WTO multilateral negotiations. Some observers believe that lack of action on CDSOA repeal could weaken the U.S. position in trade remedy negotiations, as many countries see trade remedy reform as crucial for a final Doha Development Agenda agreement. The gap in negotiating positions between the U.S. and other WTO countries on trade remedies is significant, and there are concerns about the USTR's ability to negotiate in favor of manufacturing constituents. The Bush Administration's support for CDSOA repeal has led to increased resistance. The Bush Administration's support for CDSOA repeal has led to increased resistance in Congress towards WTO rulings and proposals that might weaken U.S. trade remedy laws. Many CDSOA supporters believe in seeking a negotiated change in the Antidumping Agreement during DDA talks. The United States has FTAs with some of the complaining parties in the CDSOA dispute. The CDSOA dispute involves Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Chile, with potential impacts on trade agreements like the one with Thailand. The policy may increase costs for U.S. businesses, investors, and consumers, affecting the benefits of FTAs. The ongoing lumber trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada is complicated by billions in duties. The Bush Administration uses trade agreements to promote growth in developing countries. The CDSOA dispute involves countries like Indonesia and Thailand, vulnerable to terrorist groups. Some view the act as counterproductive to U.S. economic development goals in developing nations. WTO reports cannot change U.S. law, but a statute has been found in violation of WTO agreements. The CDSOA dispute involves countries like Indonesia and Thailand, vulnerable to terrorist groups. Some view the act as counterproductive to U.S. economic development goals in developing nations. A statute has been found in violation of WTO agreements, requiring congressional action for amendment or removal. Withdrawal of the violative measure is the main objective of WTO dispute settlement proceedings, with the possibility of sanctions if compliance is not met. Temporary retaliation is allowed until a mutually satisfactory arrangement is reached. If the CDSOA remains in force, U.S. traderemedy law will continue to benefit import-competing industries. Industries benefiting from successful AD and CVD petitions will continue to receive benefits under the act. Two complaining parties, accounting for a large percentage of U.S. exports, have taken steps towards retaliation, potentially affecting U.S. exporters in 2005. If the CDSOA is repealed, the U.S. would comply with WTO rulings, leading to potential instability for import-competing industries dependent on CDSOA disbursements. Congress may consider gradually reducing benefits, but complaining parties may still view them as WTO-inconsistent and retaliate. The Administration may negotiate a mutually satisfactory arrangement with complaining parties if the amended measure is fully repealed. Repealing the CDSOA would not affect other U.S. AD or CVD laws, and Congress could establish a new program to address adverse effects of international trade in a WTO-compliant manner. S. 1299 (Snowe) aimed to repeal the CDSOA and create a fund to assist communities affected by trade. The CDSOA supporters proposed a trust fund to assist communities affected by unfair trade, but some argued that the protection provided by the CDSOA could prevent job losses. Congress favored negotiations to distribute AD and CV duties similar to the CDSOA, which was supported by import-competing business associations. If agreed upon by WTO Members, the US would have the option to distribute duties in a WTO-compliant manner. Many economists are concerned that replicating the distribution of AD or CV duties to affected companies, as proposed by the CDSOA supporters, could lead to a proliferation of inefficient trade remedy actions globally."
