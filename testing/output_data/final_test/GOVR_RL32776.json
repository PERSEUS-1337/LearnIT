    "content": "Some observers suggest alternative funding approaches for Navy ship procurement, such as incremental funding and advance appropriations. These methods aim to enhance stability in shipbuilding plans and potentially increase the number of ships built within a set budget. Congress faces the decision of maintaining current funding practices or adopting these new approaches, which could impact Navy ship procurement and Congress's financial oversight role. The full funding policy in Navy ship procurement is crucial for Congress's oversight of Department of Defense programs. This policy affects future Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. Most Navy ships have been funded according to this policy since the late 1950s, ensuring the entire procurement cost is covered in the year of purchase. The full funding policy applies to all weapons and equipment procured by DOD, including Navy ships. It requires that the entire cost of an item be approved by Congress before a contract can be awarded for its construction. This policy was imposed in the 1950s to increase visibility and oversight of DOD procurement costs. The full funding policy, imposed in the 1950s, enhances Congress's oversight of DOD procurement costs by requiring approval of the total cost before awarding contracts. It aligns with key laws on government expenditures and is governed by OMB Circular A-11 and DOD Directive 7000.14-R for budget formulation. Full funding with regular appropriations in the budget year leads to tradeoffs within the budget year and increases accountability for achieving baseline goals. When projects are not fully funded, it can result in poor planning, higher costs, and cancellation of investments. The full funding policy for DOD procurement programs has been supported by Congress, GAO, and DOD. Executive branch regulations allow for advance procurement (AP) \"down payments\" in certain circumstances, such as for long-lead items or economic order quantity (EOQ) procurement under a multiyear procurement (MYP) arrangement. In Navy shipbuilding, advance procurement (AP) payments are used for long-lead items and advance construction work on ships. AP funding has been approved for nuclear-propulsion components of aircraft carriers and submarines, as well as conventionally powered Navy ships like destroyers and amphibious ships. This funding covers early shipyard activities for building the basic structure of a ship. The use of AP funding for shipyard advance construction activities is not recognized in executive branch budget regulations on the full funding policy. Congressional decisions to approve AP funding for ships not requested by the Navy could aim to generate shipyard work, create early financial commitments for future ship procurement, reduce construction costs, and enhance job security for construction workers. Multiyear procurement (MYP) allows the Department of Defense (DOD) to use a single contract to procure a set of end items scheduled to be procured across up to five fiscal years. This special contracting authority aims to improve sequencing of shipyard construction work and reduce the portion of a ship's cost funded in the year of procurement. Congress has granted MYP authority for a limited number of procurement programs. The law governing Multiyear Procurement (MYP) arrangements is set forth in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2306b, allowing funding to be used for long-lead components at the beginning of an MYP arrangement. This enables batch procurement of items in an efficient manner, such as the procurement of five sets of long-lead nuclear-propulsion components for the Virginia (SSN-774) class submarines over a five-year period. The DOD procurement items are typically funded through a single decision by Congress in the item's year of procurement, known as the full funding policy. However, some Navy and DOD ships have been procured with incremental funding in recent years, including DOD sealift ships, the attack submarine SSN-23, amphibious assault ships, destroyers, and an aircraft carrier. These ships were procured through the National Defense Sealift Fund (NDSF), which operates outside the DOD appropriations act and is not subject to the full funding policy. The DOD appropriations act does not apply to the procurement of certain Navy ships, leading to incremental funding for ships like LHD-8, SSN-23, LHD-6, LHA-6, DDG-1000s, and CVN-78. These cases deviate from the full funding policy typically used for DOD procurement. Incremental funding divides a weapon's cost into annual portions, allowing for progress payments to contractors each year. This approach was common before the full funding policy was implemented in the 1950s. Incremental funding in DOD procurement allows for the construction of a weapon after Congress approves the initial cost increment. Completion depends on future approvals. This method divides the procurement cost into annual increments, requiring multiple decisions for funding. Incremental funding in DOD procurement allows for the construction of expensive items like Navy ships in a given year without budget spikes. It also avoids bias against costly items and allows for better production economies by starting construction on multiple items within the allocated funding. Incremental funding in DOD procurement allows for better production economies and flexibility for future Congresses to halt funding for unnecessary items under construction. Congress replaced incremental funding with the full funding policy in the 1950s to make total procurement costs more visible and prevent future Congresses from being tied to funding decisions. This policy has been periodically reaffirmed to avoid starting procurement without understanding total costs. The Navy proposed split funding for procurement of various weapons in its budget submissions, dividing costs into two portions funded in different years to mitigate budget uncertainties and potential cost increases. The Navy proposed funding the lead DDG-1000 destroyer and lead Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program through the Navy's research and development (R&D) account instead of the ship-procurement account. Congress rejected this proposal and directed full funding for the lead DDG-1000 in the ship-procurement account, while fully funding the two lead LCSs in the R&D account. Advance appropriations have not been used in Navy ship procurement but have been utilized by other executive branch agencies for various programs. Advance appropriations is an alternative form of full funding permitted under executive branch budget regulations, lying between traditional full funding and incremental funding. Congress makes a one-time decision to fund the entire procurement cost of an item, which can then be divided into annual increments over multiple fiscal years. Unlike incremental funding, Congress does not need to approve each year's funding increment annually under advance appropriations. Under advance appropriations, Congress must actively cancel or modify future-year funding increments once the initial decision to fund an item is made. This form of funding is like a locked-in incremental funding, where funding increments will continue unless Congress intervenes. OMB Circular A-11 allows for advance appropriations to finance capital assets under specific circumstances, preferring full funding in the budget year. If spikes in funding cannot be managed, a mix of regular and advance appropriations can be proposed to fully fund a capital project. Principle 1 (Full Funding) is met when a combination of regular and advance appropriations provide sufficient budget authority for a capital project or investment. Full funding in the budget year with regular appropriations is preferred to avoid biasing tradeoffs in favor of the proposed asset. Advance appropriations, scored in the year they become available, may constrain budget authority and outlays. Advance appropriations can help address lumpiness in regular appropriations, ensuring all budget authority is enacted in advance for capital projects or useful segments. This approach improves planning, management, and accountability by matching funding to completion requirements and identifying costs and benefits beforehand. Advance appropriations involve a one-time decision by Congress to approve the entire procurement cost of an item, which can be divided into multiple increments over fiscal years. Supporters argue it offers advantages of incremental funding while avoiding some disadvantages. Opponents argue it ties the hands of future decision-makers. Opponents of advance appropriations argue that it could tie the hands of future Congresses by committing future budgets to items procured in prior years, potentially increasing ship-construction costs by causing work stoppages and restarts. This contrasts with full funding, where the Navy has access to funding for the entire construction cost without interruptions. In 2001, Navy officials considered using advance appropriations for ship procurement to avoid halting work and incurring additional costs. However, approval was not received from the Office of Management and Budget, and Congress did not adopt this funding mechanism for Navy ships. The report on the FY2002 defense appropriations bill expressed concern over the Navy's use of alternative financing mechanisms to increase shipbuilding rates. The Committee bill includes a provision prohibiting budgeting for shipbuilding programs based on advanced appropriations. Using incremental funding or advance appropriations could help reduce instability in Navy ship-procurement plans by avoiding budget spikes for expensive ships like aircraft carriers and large-deck amphibious assault ships. This approach could prevent the need to delay procurement of other ships in spike years. Using incremental funding or advance appropriations could potentially increase the number of Navy ships built within a given budget by avoiding budget spikes that cause instability in ship-procurement planning. Using incremental funding or advance appropriations in ship-procurement plans can prevent disruptions in production schedules, reduce costs, and increase the number of ships that can be procured. It allows for construction to begin on additional ships in the near term, improving production economies of scale, while still supporting higher rates of ship procurement in the future. Improving production economies of scale in ship procurement by using incremental funding or advance appropriations can reduce costs and increase the number of ships that can be procured. However, this strategy is dependent on securing expected funding in later years to maintain acceptable production economies of scale. Failure to secure this funding could result in poor production economies of scale in the future, leading to affordability challenges. Using incremental funding or advance appropriations can increase the number of ships that can be started in the near term by deferring procurement costs to future years. However, this may reduce the number of new ships that can be procured in those future years due to budget constraints. Using incremental funding or advance appropriations can marginally reduce ship-procurement costs and increase the total number of ships that can be procured over the long run for a given amount of ship-procurement funding. Incremental funding or advance appropriations can reduce ship-procurement costs, potentially allowing for the purchase of an additional ship with the same funding. However, these methods can also increase costs if funding increments are reduced or deferred, disrupting production schedules. Budget reductions may also impact prior-year ships funded through incremental funding or advance appropriations, requiring careful budget management to avoid production disruptions. The production schedule of prior-year ships could be affected by budget reductions, potentially leading to deferred procurement and increased costs. Congress may consider using incremental funding or advance appropriations for Navy ship procurement, which could temporarily reduce the number of new ships that can be procured. The options for funding Navy ship procurement include maintaining current practices, adhering to full funding policy, increasing incremental funding, using advance appropriations, and shifting lead-ship DD/NRE costs to the Navy's R&D account. Supporters argue that current funding practices provide flexibility for using incremental funding on a limited basis for certain ships, preserving the shipbuilding industrial base within available funding. Opponents believe these practices weaken adherence to the full funding policy and increase the chance of using advance appropriations for purposes other than funding long-lead items requested by DOD. Supporters argue for reducing incremental funding in Navy ship procurement to strengthen adherence to full funding policy and prevent funding of other DOD items using incremental funding. They believe budget spikes for aircraft carriers can be managed with advance planning. Supporters argue for reducing incremental funding in Navy ship procurement to strengthen adherence to full funding policy and prevent funding of other DOD items using incremental funding. They believe stability in Navy ship-procurement plans can be increased by better defining Navy requirements and reducing ship-procurement costs through measures like multiyear procurement and incentivizing shipbuilders to control costs. Opponents argue against depriving Congress of flexibility in funding practices and suggest using incremental funding when necessary. Supporters propose reducing incremental funding in Navy ship procurement to improve stability, lower costs, and preserve the shipbuilding industrial base. They suggest using incremental funding for aircraft carriers and all large-deck amphibious assault ships, as well as funding lead ships in the Navy's research and development account. This approach aims to avoid budget spikes and maintain flexibility in funding ship procurement. Supporters suggest reducing incremental funding in Navy ship procurement to enhance stability, lower costs, and protect the shipbuilding industrial base. They propose using incremental funding only for specific ships like aircraft carriers and large-deck amphibious assault ships to avoid budget spikes and maintain flexibility in funding. Critics argue that any use of incremental funding weakens the full funding policy and may lead to proposals for funding other DOD procurement items. Supporters propose reducing incremental funding in Navy ship procurement for stability, cost reduction, and industrial base protection. They suggest using incremental funding only for specific ships like aircraft carriers and large-deck amphibious assault ships to avoid budget spikes and maintain funding flexibility. Critics warn that this approach weakens the full funding policy and may lead to proposals for funding other DOD procurement items. Additionally, there is a suggestion to start using advance appropriations for ships like aircraft carriers or large-deck amphibious assault ships. Supporters argue that using advance appropriations for amphibious assault ships would avoid budget spikes and maintain funding flexibility. They believe this option would not weaken the full funding policy and reduce the risk of cost increases. Critics, however, contend that introducing advance appropriations into Navy ship procurement could relax the full funding concept in DOD procurement. The option to use advance appropriations for aircraft carriers or large-deck amphibious assault ships could relax the full funding concept in DOD procurement, according to critics. This could lead to potential cost increases in other ship-procurement programs. DD/NRE costs for each ship class are included in the lead ship's procurement cost. Including DD/NRE costs in the procurement cost of the lead ship can significantly increase its price compared to subsequent ships in the class. This practice is unique to ship procurement programs and not followed in other DOD programs like aircraft, ground vehicles, and missiles. One proposed solution is to fund lead ship procurement through the Navy's R&D account instead of the ship-procurement account, as suggested in 2004 and 2005. The Navy proposed funding lead ship procurement through the R&D account in 2004 and 2005. Congress rejected this proposal and directed full funding for lead ships in the ship-procurement account. An alternative approach suggested transferring DD/NRE costs to the Navy's R&D account as the final stage of the R&D process. The alternative approach suggested transferring DD/NRE costs to the Navy's R&D account as the final stage of the R&D process, allowing incremental funding for a ship class without violating the full funding policy. This option aims to align Navy ship-procurement programs with DOD procurement programs for aircraft, ground vehicles, and missiles. The House Armed Services Committee approved Navy's FY2008 procurement funding for various ships, including the amphibious assault ship LHA-6, DDG-1000 destroyers, and aircraft carrier CVN-78. The House Armed Services Committee approved Navy's FY2008 procurement funding for ships including LHA-6, DDG-1000 destroyers, and CVN-78, with split funding for some and full funding for others. The House Armed Services Committee approved Navy's FY2008 procurement funding for ships, recommending full funding for one DDG-1000 destroyer and design funding for a second. The committee expressed concerns about the use of incremental funding for shipbuilding, stating it does not address the Navy's overall funding challenges. The House Armed Services Committee approved Navy's FY2008 procurement funding for ships, recommending full funding for one DDG-1000 destroyer and design funding for a second. Witnesses emphasized program and funding stability as crucial for reducing shipbuilding costs and sustaining the industrial base. The committee supports the full funding policy for shipbuilding to ensure completion of ships and avoid funding instability. The committee has approved the use of split funding for certain ships in certain cases, but does not support a blanket policy for incremental funding for any class of ship. The Senate's FY2007 defense authorization bill authorizes four-year incremental funding for aircraft carriers like CVN-78, instead of the Navy's proposed two-year split funding. The Senate's FY2007 defense authorization bill authorizes incremental funding for aircraft carriers like CVN-78 over four years, with the possibility of contracting for long-lead items for CVN-79 and CVN-80 in FY2007. This funding arrangement is similar to an economic order quantity (EOQ) setup, covering three ships to be procured over a nine-year period (FY2008-FY2016). The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended approval of the Navy's proposed use of split funding FY2007 and FY2008 for procuring LHA-6 and the two lead DDG-1000s, as well as incrementally funding procurement of CVN-21 class aircraft carriers over four-year periods starting with CVN-78 in fiscal year 2008. This was in response to concerns about the low rate of shipbuilding driving up costs and reducing shipbuilding rates. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended split funding for procuring LHA-6, DDG-1000s, and CVN-21 class aircraft carriers over four-year periods to address the high shipbuilding costs and low shipbuilding rates. The committee emphasized stable ship requirements, increased funding, and flexibility in funding large capital ships as crucial elements to reverse the downward trend. The delay in procuring CVN-21 class aircraft carriers has led to increased costs and delayed fielding this vital capability. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended split funding for procuring LHA-6, DDG-1000s, and CVN-21 class aircraft carriers over four-year periods to address high shipbuilding costs and low shipbuilding rates. Concerns were raised about cost growth on the CVN-77 program, with recommendations to improve affordability for future aircraft carriers. The shipbuilder proposed savings through a stable procurement plan and economic order quantity material procurement for future carriers. The committee recommended a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class aircraft carriers. A report outlining advance procurement requirements for potential savings and escalation avoidance is to be submitted with the fiscal year 2008 budget request. None of the funds for CVN-79 and CVN-80 advance procurement can be obligated before 30 days following receipt of the report. Incremental funding for CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80 is authorized in the conference report on H.R. 5122. Section 124 authorizes the procurement of the first two DDG-1000 destroyers in FY2007 using split funding in FY2007 and FY2008 for the CVN-21 class aircraft carriers CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80. Congress supports the competitive procurement of follow-on ships for the DDG-1000 program, expecting full funding for each ship after the first two. The House Appropriations Committee recommended split funding for the amphibious assault ship LHA-6 in FY2007 and FY2008 but not for the two lead DDG-1000 destroyers. They instead recommended full funding for one DDG-1000 in FY2007, citing challenges in funding major procurement programs like the F-22 fighter and DD(X) destroyer with incremental or partial funding. The Committee recommends full funding for the F-22 fighter program and one DD(X) destroyer to avoid the use of incremental funding that could compromise budget transparency and oversight. The recommended funding of $2,568,111,000 for the DD(X) destroyer is the same as the budget request, but would have been allocated incrementally under the President's budget. The Committee recommends full funding for the F-22 fighter program and one DD(X) destroyer at $2,568,111,000. The Senate Appropriations Committee supports the Navy's request for FY2007 procurement funding for the first two DDG-1000 destroyers. The Committee recommends full funding for the F-22 fighter program and one DD(X) destroyer at $2,568,111,000. The report suggests funding one Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) in FY2007 instead of two, and rescinding funding for one of the three LCSs procured in FY2006 due to cost estimate discrepancies. The Navy's budget submission for the fifth and sixth LCS flight 0 ships revealed additional costs not included in the initial estimate, making it difficult to procure both ships without extra funding. The Committee recommends rescinding insufficient funds for the fourth LCS flight 0 vessel and reducing the budget request to fully fund one LCS seaframe in fiscal year 2007. This decision aims to keep the Navy on track to procure four LCS flight 0 ships by the end of fiscal year 2007. The conference report on H.R. 5631 approves the Navy's request for the initial FY2007 budget. The conference report on H.R. 5631 approves the Navy's request for the initial FY2007 procurement funding for the LHA(R) amphibious assault ship and the first two DDG-1000 destroyers, to be split funded in FY2007 and FY2008. The report allows for split funding of twin lead ships of the DDG-1000 class, based on low risk and well-understood total costs. The conferees approve split funding for the initial FY2007 procurement of the LHA(R) amphibious assault ship and the first two DDG-1000 destroyers, based on low risk and well-understood total costs. They make a one-time exception to the full funding principle due to unique circumstances with the shipbuilding industrial base and the DDG-1000 program. The Navy believes the cost and schedule risk in the DDG-1000 program is low enough to permit the twin lead ship acquisition strategy, with a total cost of $6,582,200,000 for the twin lead ships. The total cost to procure the twin lead ships of the DDG-1000 class is $6,582,200,000. The Navy must manage the program within this cost, with limited funding increases allowed only in emergencies or natural disasters. The House Armed Services Committee emphasizes the need for acquisition and budget reforms to stabilize production paths. The committee criticizes creative financing methods that delay shipbuilding costs and fail to control cost growth of vessel classes like the Virginia class submarine and future aircraft carrier CVN-21. Senate Section 122 of the FY2006 defense authorization bill is mentioned. The Senate Armed Services Committee's report (S.Rept. 109-69) allows for split funding for the aircraft carrier CVN-78 and amphibious assault ship LHA(R) in FY2007-FY2010. The CVN-78, a new class of carrier with advanced technologies, is facing a delay in delivery until fiscal year 2015, causing cost growth. The Senate Armed Services Committee's report allows for split funding for the aircraft carrier CVN-78 in FY2007-FY2010. The delay in delivery until fiscal year 2015 has caused a cost growth of approximately $400.0 million, driven by budget considerations rather than technical reasons. The committee directs the Navy to provide an updated funding profile to fully fund the remaining costs of the ship from fiscal years 2007 through 2010. The conference report authorizes incremental funding for the procurement of the aircraft carrier CVN-78 and the LHA(R) amphibious assault ship in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The House Appropriations Committee supports the LHA(R) program in Navy shipbuilding. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed grave concerns about the Navy shipbuilding program, citing unstable fleet inventory, program performance, and soaring cost overruns. They directed the Navy to reconsider split funding for the LHA(R) amphibious assault ship and follow the full funding principle to ensure budget stability before contract award. The Senate Appropriations Committee is concerned about Navy shipbuilding program costs and performance. They recommend giving the Navy financial management authorities to control costs and provide additional reprogramming authority for unforeseen funding shortfalls. The Senate Appropriations Committee is concerned about Navy shipbuilding program costs and performance. They recommend giving the Navy financial management authorities to control costs and provide additional reprogramming authority for unforeseen funding shortfalls. The new reprogramming authority aims to improve cost management, but the Committee urges a more proactive approach and suggests considering advance appropriations in future budgets for the shipbuilding program. The fiscal year 2006 President's budget includes funds for the DDG-51 destroyer program for program completion requirements and shutdown costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee is concerned about Navy shipbuilding program costs and performance. They recommend giving the Navy financial management authorities to control costs and provide additional reprogramming authority for unforeseen funding shortfalls. The fiscal year 2006 President's budget includes funds for the DDG-51 destroyer program for program completion requirements and shutdown costs. The requested funds are for a mix of Class and ship specific plan, basic construction, ordnance, certification, and inspection costs. The Department's decision to change its policy and budget for these costs after the last ship was appropriated is troubling as it obscures the actual cost to procure each ship and overstates savings attributable to the multiyear contract authority. The Navy's budget request for shipbuilding includes costs that, if not funded, would result in non-operational and undeliverable ships. The Committee is concerned about the contractual arrangement and directs the Secretary of the Navy to provide a detailed report on the costs by December 1, 2005. They recommend reducing the budget request by $195,654,000 until sufficient explanation is provided. The conference report on H.R. 2863 recommends considering split or full funding for the LHA(R) Program, with a reduction of $195,654,000 in the budget request. The report also discusses the Navy's potential use of advance appropriations for ship procurement in the 2007 budget. The report discusses the use of advance appropriations for ship procurement in the 2007 budget, including an amendment to increase the amount of advance appropriations by $14 billion to $37.393 billion. The amendment increased advance appropriations for ship procurement from $14 billion to $37.393 billion and included the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account for advance appropriations. The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 18 on March 17, 2005, and recent ships procured with incremental funding are discussed in the appendix. The amendment shifted procurement of military sealift ships and Navy auxiliary ships to the NDSF, bypassing traditional funding policies. This change allowed for partial financing of ships authorized in different years, deviating from the full funding policy typically applied to DOD procurement programs. The DOD used $546.4 million in FY1995 to help finance 16 LMSRs awarded between FY1993 and FY1997. The National Defense Sealift Fund operates on an oldest money first basis, not following traditional full funding provisions for ship acquisition. The SSN-23 Attack Submarine, Jimmy Carter, was procured in the FY1992 defense budget. In 1992, the George H. W. Bush Administration halted procurement of Seawolf-class submarines and proposed cutting funds for SSN-22 and SSN-23. Congress rejected the request to cut funding for SSN-22, suspended procurement of SSN-23, and allowed the Secretary of the Navy to decide on its reinstatement. In 1993, the Clinton Administration reinstated procurement of SSN-23 in FY1996 after $382.4 million had already been spent on it. Congress also made an additional $540.2 million available for SSN-23. The Administration requested additional funding of $1.5 billion to complete the cost of SSN-23, with Congress approving $649.1 million in FY1996 and $153.4 million in FY1998 for the ship. This left about $155 million to complete the total cost of the ship. In FY1998, Congress approved $802.5 million for the cost of SSN-23, totaling one-third of the estimated $2.4 billion. LHD-6 Amphibious Assault Ship was approved for procurement in FY1993 with only $305 million funding provided. In FY1993, $305 million funding was provided for the procurement of LHD-6 Amphibious Assault Ship. The conferees authorized the Navy Secretary to enter into a contract for the ship, with full funding requested in FY1994. The total cost of $893.8 million was split-funded, with most of the funding provided the following year. The Navy authorized funding for LHD-8 in FY2000 and FY2001, with incremental funding until FY2006. LHA-6 was proposed for split funding in FY2007 and FY2008. The first two DDG-1000 Destroyers were proposed for procurement in FY2007. The Navy proposed procuring the first two DDG-1000 destroyers in FY2007 using split funding in FY2007 and FY2008. Congress approved the funding for the two ships. The Navy also proposed procuring the aircraft carrier CVN-78 in FY2008 using split funding over nine years."
