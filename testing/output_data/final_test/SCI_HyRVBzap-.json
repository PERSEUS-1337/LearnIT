    "content": "Injecting adversarial examples during training, known as adversarial training, can improve robustness against one-step attacks, but not for unknown iterative attacks. To address this challenge, cascade adversarial training is proposed, transferring knowledge of adversarial training results. This method involves training a network from scratch by injecting iteratively generated adversarial images from defended networks and one-step adversarial images. Additionally, embedding space is utilized for classification and low-level similarity learning to ignore unknown pixel-level perturbations. Adversarial images are injected during training without replacing clean images, penalizing the distance between clean and adversarial embeddings. Cascade adversarial training, along with low-level similarity learning, enhances robustness against iterative attacks but reduces it against one-step attacks. Combining these techniques improves robustness in worst-case black box attack scenarios. Adversarial training increases network robustness against attacks, with networks trained using one-step methods showing limited robustness against iterative attacks. The method involves injecting adversarial examples during training and penalizing the distance between clean and adversarial embeddings. Cascade adversarial training transfers knowledge from already defended networks to enhance robustness against iterative attacks. It involves injecting iter FGSM images crafted from a defended network during training. This approach differs from using purely trained networks for adversarial examples. Additionally, low-level similarity learning is advanced by adding extra data augmentation techniques. In level similarity learning, additional regularization is added to encourage insensitivity to adversarial perturbations in deep features. Adversarial images are injected in mini batches without replacing clean images, penalizing distance between embeddings. The approach focuses on learning similarity of pixel-level differences between similar images to maintain high-level feature representation. ResNet models are trained on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets using this adversarial training method. The proposed adversarial training in dataset BID4 improves network robustness against adversarial images. Modifying the weight of the distance measure in the loss function controls trade-off between accuracies for clean and adversarial examples. Cascade adversarial training and low-level similarity learning increase accuracy against unknown iterative attacks but decrease accuracy for one-step attacks. They also provide better robustness against black box attacks. The one-step fast gradient sign method generates adversarial images by adding gradients multiplied by a factor. The text discusses various methods for generating adversarial images, including the one-step target class method, basic iterative method, iterative least-likely class method, and Carlini and Wagner attack. These methods aim to create adversarial images by manipulating the input data to deceive neural networks. Adversarial training injects adversarial examples during training by replacing clean examples with k adversarial examples from a mini batch. Lower accuracy indicates a successful black-box attack, while using the same network for both source and target is a white-box attack. Kurakin's method is a specific form of adversarial training. The proposed approach involves using Ensemble adversarial training with pre-trained vanilla networks to generate one-step adversarial examples for training. Transferability between purely trained networks and adversarially trained networks is demonstrated under black box attack using ResNet models for CIFAR10 classification. Test accuracies under black box attack are reported, showing high robustness against one-step attacks between defended networks. The observation shows that neural networks trained with the same method end up in similar optimum states, with defended networks showing high robustness against one-step attacks compared to undefended networks. Adversarial training may weaken the adversarial images from defended networks, resulting in lower accuracies against step attacks compared to undefended networks. Transferability of attacks remains strong between undefended networks or defended networks, especially under the \"iter FGSM\" attack scenario. The transferability of attacks is strong between undefended or defended networks, especially in the \"iter FGSM\" attack scenario. It is efficient to attack a network with examples crafted from another network trained with the same strategy. Cascade adversarial training proposes training a network by injecting iter FGSM images from a defended network. The proposed method trains a network with cascade adversarial training using iter FGSM images from a defended network. This enhances robustness against iter FGSM attacks by transferring knowledge of adversarial training results. Clean examples are included in the mini batch for generating adversarial images, followed by a forward pass with embeddings and softmax layer for classification. The proposed method enhances robustness against adversarial attacks by minimizing the distance between clean and adversarial embeddings through distance-based loss. Regularization in higher embedding layers helps ignore pixel-level perturbations, leading to improved performance. Adding regularization right before the softmax layer showed the best results, as it allows convolution filters to learn similarity for better performance. The total loss in the training process combines cascade adversarial training and low-level similarity learning. It includes parameters to control the weight of classification loss for adversarial images and distance-based loss. Bidirectional loss minimizes the distance between clean and adversarial embeddings. Different values for N were tested but did not show significant differences. The study explores the use of pivot loss to minimize distance between embeddings, utilizing clean embeddings as pivots for adversarial embeddings. The effect of low-level similarity learning on MNIST is analyzed using different training methods. Experimental details and accuracy results are provided in the appendix. Our method achieves better accuracy than Kurakin's method for all types of attacks on the MNIST dataset. Adversarial training with additional regularization increases robustness against various attacks, showing the success of low-level similarity learning in regularizing adversarial perturbations. Embedding space visualization is done using a modified ResNet model, comparing standard training, Kurakin's method, and our pivot loss on MNIST. In figure 4, embeddings between fully connected layers are visualized for standard training, Kurakin's method, and our pivot loss on MNIST. Adversarial images easily cross the decision boundary with standard training, while Kurakin's method minimizes distances between clean and adversarial embeddings. Our pivot loss further reduces distance and intra-class variation. Modified ResNet models show slightly decreased accuracy for clean and adversarial images compared to the original ResNet. The study involved training 20-layer ResNet models with pivot loss and varying \u03bb 2 values on the CIFAR10 dataset to analyze the impact of the distance measure weight. Results showed that higher \u03bb 2 values improved accuracy of iteratively generated adversarial images but reduced accuracy on clean images. Increasing \u03bb 2 above 0.3 led to training divergence due to overlapping embedding distributions of different classes. The experiment highlighted a trade-off between accuracy for clean and adversarial images, suggesting caution in using very high \u03bb 2 values. In the study, the transferability of iter FGSM images between different architectures was analyzed by training ResNet networks with varying initializations. High correlation was observed between iter FGSM noises from networks with the same initialization, while lower correlation was found in networks with different initializations, especially in deeper networks. The study analyzed the transferability of iter FGSM images between different architectures by training ResNet networks with varying initializations. Lower transfer rates were observed in deeper networks due to different states resulting from increased network size. To enhance cascade adversarial training benefits, using the same initialization for cascade and source networks is proposed. Training 110-layer ResNet models with/without pivot loss showed improved robustness against iterative attacks with low-level similarity learning. However, accuracy improvements against iterative attacks were limited, indicating the regularization effect of low-level similarity learning may not be sufficient. The study showed that low-level similarity learning's regularization effect is not enough for iterative attacks on complex color images like CIFAR10. Unlike MNIST cases, where pivot loss led to significant accuracy increase for iterative attacks, label leaking phenomenon was observed even without training a network with step FGSM images. Training a network from scratch with iter FGSM examples from a defended network showed varying results with different training methods. The study found that ensemble and cascade models improved accuracy against iterative attacks but decreased accuracy for one-step attacks compared to the baseline defended network. Additional data augmentation enhanced robustness against iterative attacks and weakened label leaking effects. Low-level similarity learning further enhanced robustness against iterative attacks, especially for fully unknown CW attacks. Knowledge learned from data augmentation through cascade/ensemble adversarial training enabled networks to learn partial knowledge of perturbations generated by iterative methods. The study found that low-level similarity learning enhanced robustness against iterative attacks, with clean embeddings potentially moving towards the decision boundary. Black box attack analysis was performed on cascade/ensemble networks with/without pivot loss, showing transferability of adversarial examples between networks trained with the same strategy. Source networks were re-trained using different methods for black-box attacks. The study focused on similarity learning and black-box attacks using source networks. Iterative FGSM attacks from ensemble models were found to be strong, with transferability between defended networks. Cascade adversarial training helped break the transferability issue between defended networks. The study explored improving worst-case robustness against black-box attacks by using multiple networks in cascade adversarial training. Ensemble/cascade networks with low-level similarity learning showed better accuracy under black-box attack scenarios, indicating enhanced robustness against iterative attacks. Transfer analysis revealed easy transfer of iter FGSM images between networks trained with the same strategy, leading to the proposal of cascade adversarial training as a method to enhance robustness. Improving robustness against iterative attacks through cascade adversarial training and low-level similarity learning in deeper networks. Challenges remain in training networks robust against both one-step and iterative attacks simultaneously. Future research is needed to enhance robustness further. In order to improve robustness against iterative attacks, future research is needed to enhance the accuracy for step attacks and clean images under white-box and black-box attack scenarios. Adversarial images are generated using \"step ll\" after applying random crop and flip on original images. Stochastic gradient descent optimizer is used with specific parameters for adversarial training, including generating adversarial examples within mini-batches. Different ensemble and cascade models are utilized for training on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. The study explores the impact of adversarial training on the softmax layer during test time using various methods like \"step ll\" and \"step FGSM\". Results show that adversarial training limits the drop in values for the true class compared to standard training, indicating improved robustness against iterative attacks. Adversarial training limits value drop for the true class and can even increase values in certain cases. It exposes gradient information but distorts gradients along the sign of the gradient direction. Results show improved margins for \"random sign\" added images. The method creates smoother shapes for the softmax layer, leading to better pixel-level regularization. Despite smaller embeddings for the true class, the standard deviation is less, resulting in better margins between true and false classes. The \"label leaking\" phenomenon occurs during adversarial training, where accuracies for adversarial images surpass those for clean images. This leakage happens even without providing true labels for generating adversarial images. Correlation between gradients of clean and adversarial images is used to measure error surface similarity. Black box attacks between trained networks with the same initialization tend to be more effective. The study shows that black box attacks are more successful between networks with the same initialization compared to those with different initialization. The method (R20 P 2) outperforms Kurakin's method (R20 B2) in one-step and iterative black box attacks. Networks trained with low-level similarity learning and cascade/ensemble adversarial training show better worst-case performance. Images crafted from ensemble model families remain strong on defended networks. The study explores black box attacks on networks with different initializations. The method (R20 P 2) outperforms Kurakin's method (R20 B2) in attacks. Networks trained with low-level similarity learning and ensemble adversarial training perform better. Adversarial images are crafted from ensemble model families for strong defense on networks. The CW L \u221e attack is computationally expensive, using limited test examples for optimization. The search for adversarial examples involves varying parameters c and \u03c4 for MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. The Adam optimizer with a specific learning rate is crucial for successful adversarial image generation. Our approach terminates the search after 2,000 iterations for each X, c, and \u03c4. If f(X + \u03b4) < 0 and ||\u03b4|| \u221e is lower than the current best distance, X adv is updated. The cumulative distribution function in FIG5 illustrates robust defense against CW L \u221e attack compared to other methods, with successful adversarial examples reported for MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets."
