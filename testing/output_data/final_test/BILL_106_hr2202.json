The Point Reyes Farmland Protection Act of 1999 defines \"eligible lands\" as parcels in Marin or Sonoma Counties located in specific coastal zones. The Point Reyes Farmland Protection Act of 1999 defines \"eligible lands\" as parcels in specific coastal zones from the boundary with Marin County north to Highway 1 and Doran Beach Road. An \"eligible entity\" includes State or local government agencies, or nonprofit organizations experienced in conservation easements. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior is defined as the \"Secretary.\" The purposes of this section include promoting conservation easements on eligible lands to protect agricultural lands, creating a public/private partnership for preservation efforts, and safeguarding the Point Reyes National Seashore investment. Grants may be provided by the Secretary for purchasing permanent conservation easements on eligible lands to preserve agricultural lands. Easements acquired using these funds shall be in perpetuity and negotiated between willing sellers and eligible entities. Easements acquired with funds from the Secretary must be held by the eligible entity. If the entity ceases to exist or is no longer a nonprofit, rights and obligations transfer to the United States. Consent of the landowner is required for acquiring interests in eligible lands with Secretary funds. Land purchases are prohibited with these funds. Matching Funds:\nThe Federal share of acquiring a conservation easement in eligible lands cannot exceed half of the total costs. Non-Federal share can be provided in various forms like property, money, services, or in-kind contributions. The Secretary may waive the match requirement for eligible entities with existing conservation easements until they receive Federal funds equal to the easements' fair market value. This section's authority is in addition to other land preservation efforts, and $60,000,000 is authorized for grants under this Act. The Secretary has authorized $60,000,000 for grants under this section."
