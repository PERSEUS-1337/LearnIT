    "content": "The United States and Bangladesh have a positive working relationship, focusing on development goals in areas like sustainable development, health, education, poverty reduction, disaster preparedness, and food security. Concerns about Islamist militancy have been raised by both countries. Bangladesh faces challenges with a political struggle between Islamic religious identity and secular identity based on Bengali nationalism, leading to demonstrations and street protests. The political challenges in Bangladesh include demonstrations, political gridlock, and rising conservative Islamist sentiment. The country also faces environmental stress from natural disasters and climate change, compounded by a growing population. Geopolitical rivalry between China and India may bring opportunities but also new tensions. The influx of Rohingya refugees from Burma adds to the instability, with implications for humanitarian, diplomatic, security, and geopolitical concerns. The predominantly Muslim Rohingya refugees have fled persecution in Buddhist-majority Burma to Bangladesh, with an estimated 582,000 refugees arriving since August 2017. Bangladeshi authorities are struggling to accommodate them, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged Burma to take back the displaced Rohingya. Political instability in Bangladesh, exacerbated by the rivalry between Prime Minister Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia, could threaten democracy as the 2019 parliamentary election approaches. Observers see little progress in resolving the political stalemate. The political situation in Bangladesh remains unstable, with the BNP resorting to protests to pressure the government. Potential causes of unrest include disputes over garment worker wages, rising food prices due to floods, and political violence in Dhaka. Demonstrations have turned violent, leading to fatalities, as reported by Odhikar. In 2016, 215 people were killed and 9,050 were injured in Bangladesh due to political violence. There are ongoing concerns about Islamist militancy, with several terrorist attacks in March 2017. The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has contributed to political instability by trying individuals accused of human rights abuses during the country's war of independence in 1971. In April 2017, the ICT handed down death sentences to two people convicted of war crimes during the 1971 war. In July 2017, an investigation was ongoing into a top BNP leader. The United States has a positive relationship with Bangladesh, working together on development, governance, trade, and security. In August 2017, U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells met with Prime Minister Hasina to discuss U.S.-Bangladeshi relations, focusing on security and energy cooperation. The United States engages Bangladesh through various dialogues to improve ties, including the U.S.-Bangladesh Partnership Dialogue and the U.S.-Bangladesh Dialogue on Security Issues. Bangladesh joined the U.S. Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund for security assistance. Bangladesh is joining the U.S. Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund to combat extremist Islamists and promote regional security. The U.S. has supported Bangladesh in peacekeeping operations and maritime security capabilities. Bangladesh is a significant contributor of military personnel to U.N. missions. Bangladesh received two U.S. Coast Guard cutters, the USS Jarvis in 2013 and the USS Rush in 2015, to enhance its maritime security capabilities. The country also participates in naval exercises with PACOM and conducts counterterrorism training with U.S. forces. Additionally, Bangladesh is involved in humanitarian operations like Operation Pacific Angel in the Asia-Pacific region. The United States has been a foreign assistance partner of Bangladesh since its creation in 1971, providing funding for law enforcement training and counterterrorism cooperation. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested $138 million in foreign assistance funding for Bangladesh, a decrease from the previous year. Bangladesh faces significant poverty and food insecurity issues, with a large portion of the population living below the national poverty line and struggling to afford basic necessities. In 2014, the United States partnered with Bangladesh on development initiatives including Feed the Future, Global Climate Change Initiative, and Global Health Initiative. USAID implemented programs to improve food security by increasing crop yields. Bangladesh was the 50th largest trading partner of the US in 2016, with exports worth $895 million supporting 6,000 US jobs. Major US exports to Bangladesh included grain, soybeans, cotton, and machinery. In 2015, U.S. goods exports to Bangladesh increased 169% from 2006 to 2016, with major exports including woven apparel, knit apparel, textile articles, headgear, and footwear. The United States and Bangladesh signed a Trade and Investment Cooperation Framework Agreement (TICFA) in 2013 to address bilateral trade and investment challenges. U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh amounted to $589 million in 2015, showing a 24.3% increase from 2014. In 2015, U.S. goods exports to Bangladesh increased significantly. American trade interests also involve developing natural gas reserves in the Bay of Bengal. The United States suspended Bangladesh's GSP benefits in 2013 over labor rights concerns. Despite efforts to improve labor conditions, GSP privileges have not been reinstated. The U.S. has urged Bangladesh to do more to protect workers' rights and address human rights issues. The State Department's 2017 Human Rights Report highlighted numerous abuses in Bangladesh, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, violence against marginalized groups, gender-based violence, and labor rights abuses. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom also raised concerns about attacks on religious minorities and secular individuals in the country. In September 2017, the United States expressed concern about the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh and provided significant humanitarian assistance. The country is a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature, where members of parliament are directly elected for five-year terms. The ruling Awami League and the Bangladesh National Party are prominent political parties in the country. The Awami League, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and the Bangladesh National Party, led by Khaleda Zia, are the main political parties in Bangladesh. The Awami League is seen as more secular, but there are concerns about the government's relationship with Islamist zealots. The country faces challenges in electoral processes, with limited political dialogue and a lack of leaders promoting peaceful processes. The United States has expressed concerns about political unrest and instability in Bangladesh, especially after the 2014 election. The AL won the 2008 and 2014 elections in Bangladesh, with the BNP boycotting the latter due to the lack of a neutral caretaker government. The AL's overwhelming victory in 2014 led to political unrest, including nationwide strikes and violent demonstrations. Khaleda Zia's motorcade was attacked by AL activists during campaigning in Dhaka, resulting in injuries to fifteen members of her entourage. In response to postelection unrest in Dhaka, the State Department expressed grave concern about the violence in Bangladesh. The Jatiya Party (Ershad) is supporting the current AL government, despite being considered the opposition. The largest Islamist party, JI, historically allied with the BNP, was banned from participating in the 2014 election. The AL and BNP collaborated to appoint a new election commission in 2017, but doubts remain about its independence. Observers speculate Sheikh Hasina is grooming her son for the next national election in 2019. Sheikh Hasina is grooming her son, Sajeeb Ahmed Wajed, to become the AL's next leader. Bangladesh has a history of tensions between the military and civilian governments, with multiple coups and presidents killed in military takeovers. The country returned to parliamentary democracy in 1991 after years of military rule. Prior to the 2008 general election, a military-backed caretaker government took power, seen by some as a de facto coup. In 2007-2008, the military supported an anticorruption program under a caretaker government, convicting 116 politicians and businessmen. Attempts to convict and exile Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia were made but later withdrawn to ensure their parties' participation in the December 2008 election. In 2015, concerns arose about a potential military coup due to political feuds, but none occurred. Tensions between the government and security forces over corruption and low wages led to a mutiny by the Bangladeshi Rifles in February 2009. The Bangladeshi Rifles mutinied in February 2009, killing 74 people, including 57 officers. The International Crimes Tribunal was established in 2009 to prosecute war crimes from Bangladesh's 1971 independence war. The U.S. government supports bringing Bangladeshi war criminals to justice and encourages a fair judicial process. Bangladesh and Pakistan were once one country before the 1971 separatist war, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions displaced. The International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh was established in 2009 to prosecute war crimes from the country's 1971 independence war. Leaders from the JI party and the BNP have been arrested and accused of war crimes, with some being convicted and executed. The trials have been criticized for favoring the prosecution and not allowing the defense to challenge witnesses. The International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh conducted five executions from 2010 to 2016, targeting JI members and a BNP member. In May 2016, Matiur Rahman Nizami, the JI Amir, was executed. In April 2017, two individuals were sentenced to death for war crimes. While some criticize the use of the death penalty, others support the tribunal's stance against Islamist extremism. The United States supports bringing to justice those who committed atrocities in the 1971 Bangladesh War of independence, emphasizing the need for a fair and transparent process. Political unrest and lack of labor-rights protections are key concerns for human rights in Bangladesh according to the U.S. Department of State's 2016 Human Rights Report. The 2016 Human Rights Report on Bangladesh highlighted significant issues including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, violence against marginalized groups, early and forced marriage, gender-based violence, and labor rights abuses. Over 500 Bangladeshis died in election-related violence in 2014, with reports of inter-party clashes causing further casualties in 2016. Unlawful detentions and forced disappearances were also reported, with prominent individuals being held without charge or access to legal representation. In 2016, Bangladesh's security forces detained nearly 15,000 people, many of whom were political opposition members. The government filed 37,000 lawsuits against the opposition, using accusations of terrorism to mobilize the elite Rapid Action Battalion. Human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and arbitrary detentions, were reported. In Bangladesh, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) has been accused of targeting opposition members, with Amnesty International finding police involvement in disappearance cases. \"Crossfire\" incidents in 2016 resulted in 118-150 deaths, with 34 attributed to the RAB. The RAB members were sentenced to death for killing a politician, but convictions are rare. The government has been cracking down on the media, with two editors facing consequences in 2016. In Bangladesh, media freedom is under threat as editors face charges of criminal defamation and sedition. The killing of secular blogger Dr. Avijit Roy by Islamist extremists highlights the clash between secular and rigid worldviews in the country. Islamist extremists have discredited secularism, creating a divide in Bangladeshi society. Secularism in Bangladesh is a contentious issue, with tensions between Islamists and Hindus. Attacks on religious minorities, including Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and Ahmadiyyas, have been on the rise. In 2014, there were numerous incidents of violence against Hindus, and in 2016, three Hindu priests were killed. The country's religious demographics show that Muslims make up the majority at 89.1%, while Hindus account for 10.0%. In Bangladesh, there is a rise in violent incidents against religious minorities, including Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and Ahmadiyyas. Human trafficking and unequal rights for women are also prevalent issues in the country. Reports indicate extensive human trafficking within Bangladesh and to neighboring countries like India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Police corruption and bribery are reported in ignoring trafficking crimes, leading to Bangladesh being placed on the Tier 2 Watch List. Additionally, a law was passed in 2017 legalizing marriage for girls under 18, despite existing concerns. In Bangladesh, a law was passed allowing girls under 18 to marry, potentially to gain popularity among religious groups. Child labor is a significant issue, with surveys showing high prevalence in slum settlements. Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Burma, face challenges as well. Since August 2017, an estimated half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh due to violence in Rakhine State. The United Nations condemned Burma for ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya, prompting the United States to pledge $32 million in aid. Since October 2016, humanitarian assistance has been provided for vulnerable communities displaced from Burma. The latest violence outbreak in August 2017 involved Rohingya insurgents attacking Burmese security forces, leading to displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya into Bangladesh. Previous incidents in October 2016 saw Rohingya militants attacking Border Guard Police bases, resulting in a disproportionate response from Burma's security forces. Human rights groups have documented alleged abuses in the region. Human rights groups have reported alleged abuses, including extrajudicial killings and mass rapes, associated with Burmese military operations. Approximately 74,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh to escape the crackdown by security forces. Before the recent influx of Rohingya into Bangladesh, there were three categories of displaced Rohingya in the country. Rohingyas considered Undocumented Myanmar Nationals lack access to state protections and services, making them vulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking. In 2015, Rohingya and Bangladeshis faced exploitation and human trafficking, with many taking to the sea to escape persecution. Armed groups in Burma forced Rohingya onto migrant boats, leading to an estimated 25,000 Southeast Asian migrants fleeing in the first three months of 2015. The group ARSA is uncertain in its ties to international terrorist groups, portraying itself as an ethno-nationalist defender of its people, though some view it as a militant group with potential terrorist links. The recent attacks against the Rohingya have raised concerns about potential recruitment by international terrorist organizations like Islamic State (IS), despite ARSA having no direct ties. A report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) in December 2016 detailed the emergence of ARSA, previously known as Harakah al-Yaqin (HaY), led by Rohingya emigres in Saudi Arabia. The ICG warned that a harsh response by Burma could radicalize parts of the Rohingya population. Unconfirmed reports suggest connections between some Rohingya and Pakistan's ISI, as well as terrorist groups in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The presence of dispossessed Rohingya in Bangladesh could be a fertile ground for terrorist recruitment, although ARSA has no direct links to terrorist groups. Bangladesh's policy is to prevent ARSA from establishing a base in the country, citing security concerns. The United States has urged Burma to protect the Rohingya population and allow a human rights fact-finding mission. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Southeast Asia called on the Burmese government to implement proposed suggestions. Asia Patrick Murphy urged the Burmese government to implement recommendations from the Rakhine Commission to address conflict, provide humanitarian aid, and promote development in the state. Some critics feel the U.S. government should do more to protect the Rohingya, with proposed legislation in Congress condemning human rights abuses and potentially imposing sanctions on Burma. The Department of State Appropriations Act specifies that funds to Burma cannot support individuals or organizations involved in gross human rights violations, including against the Rohingya. The bill prohibits funds for assistance to Burma, condemning violence against Rohingya. Bangladesh has admitted half a million Rohingya refugees, straining its capacity. Representative Royce urged Myanmar to protect all its people. Bangladesh is struggling to accommodate the influx of Rohingya refugees, with many living outside official camps. A new camp with 14,000 shelters is being established, but there are concerns about relocating Rohingya to an uninhabitable island. Health issues like respiratory infections and diarrhea are spreading among the Rohingya, highlighting the urgent need for clean water and sanitation. Bangladesh considers the Rohingya as forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals, not migrants. Bangladesh considers the Rohingya as \"forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals\" and has called for their repatriation. The government has started biometric registration of Rohingya in camps near Cox's Bazar and has worked with NGOs to provide access and protection services. The U.S. State Department has praised Bangladesh's efforts in responding to the humanitarian crisis. In the past, international human rights groups criticized Bangladesh for forcing back Rohingya fleeing from Burma and placing restrictions on aid organizations. Bangladesh has a history of mass migration to India in 1971 due to atrocities committed during its struggle for independence. The country's workers' rights and safety, especially in the apparel industry, have drawn international attention. The United States suspended Bangladesh's beneficiary status over concerns about workers' rights in 2013. The United States suspended Bangladesh's beneficiary status under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program due to concerns about workers' rights, leading to the loss of duty-free status for GSP-eligible products from Bangladesh. The country's garment industry, employing approximately four million workers, has faced scrutiny following factory disasters like the Rana Plaza collapse in 2013. Despite a $30 million fund established for compensation, many victims' families remain uncompensated. Several international brands like Children's Place and Benetton sourced clothing from the Rana Plaza factory. Following the Rana Plaza collapse in 2013, Bangladesh police charged the factory owner and others with murder. Inspections revealed safety hazards in all garment factories, leading to evacuations. The International Labour Organization initiated a project to improve building safety in Bangladesh. A 2016 fire at a packaging factory in Tongi, Bangladesh killed 23 people, highlighting the challenges of worker rights and unionization in the country. Bangladesh's economy heavily relies on foreign remittances, with efforts made to protect citizens working abroad through bilateral treaties. The garment industry in Bangladesh has provided many women with opportunities for independence, despite labor rights abuses. Over 80% of the country's exports come from the garment sector, where about 41% of Bangladeshi women are employed. The government's allowance of high recruitment fees has made many laborers vulnerable to trafficking. In Bangladesh, 80% of garment employees are women, which has deterred early marriage and reduced fertility rates. The country is a significant contributor to U.N. peacekeeping efforts, with troops serving in various missions, including in Africa. Bangladesh's troops have faced casualties, such as three soldiers killed in Mali in 2017. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) supports the country in strengthening its international peacekeeping capabilities. The United States is assisting Bangladesh in opening a new training facility at the Bangladesh Institute for Peace Support Operation Training (BIPSOT) to enhance its peacekeeping capabilities. Despite being one of the world's poorest nations, Bangladesh has seen significant GDP growth, with projections of continued growth. However, more efforts may be needed to accommodate the increasing number of youths entering the workforce. Bangladesh faces the challenge of accommodating the increasing number of youths entering the workforce, with about 2.1 million new entrants annually. The country heavily relies on the agriculture sector, but manufacturing, especially ready-made garments, plays a crucial role in its economy as the second-largest exporter globally. Garment exports exceeded $25 billion in 2016, comprising over 80% of total exports. Bangladesh heavily depends on foreign remittances, with $15 billion coming from overseas workers in 2015. However, remittances dropped by 14.5% in the 2016-2017 fiscal year to $12.8 billion. In 2017, Bangladesh faced a drop in remittances to $12.8 billion due to expatriate workers using informal channels. Gas prices were raised by 22.7%, causing protests, as the country relies on LNG for 53% of its energy needs. Bangladesh heavily relies on liquefied natural gas (LNG) for 53% of its energy needs, with gas reserves lasting another 10 to 12 years. The country is developing the Moheshkhali Floating LNG project with the International Finance Corporation and Excelerate Energy. The banking sector faces underlying risks due to large loans with few incentives to repay, leading to a high level of nonperforming loans in state-owned banks. Regulators have been ineffective in addressing issues like poor risk management and lack of penalties for defaulters. In 2016, Bangladesh's state-owned commercial banks saw a 37% drop in operating profits due to a high level of nonperforming loans. The country faces challenges in access to electricity, enforcing contracts, poor infrastructure, and corruption. Legislation is being considered to streamline business processes. In 2016, Bangladesh received a record amount of $2.3 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI), but could attract more by improving infrastructure, streamlining bureaucracies, and tackling corruption. Demographic pressures and environmental challenges, including climate change, may displace thousands, leading to strains on social services and regional instability. Bangladesh's economy is reported as the most vulnerable to climate change in the world. Bangladesh's economy is highly vulnerable to climate change, with 80% of the country's land on a floodplain and less than 5 meters above sea level. Rising sea levels could displace up to 18 million people by 2050, with many moving to cities like Dhaka. Riverbank erosion already displaces thousands annually, and cyclones are expected to become more intense. Bangladesh's government has invested over $10 billion to address climate change effects, focusing on strengthening river embankments, early warning systems, government capacities, and cyclone shelters. The country's population is projected to reach 200 million by 2050, leading to potential internal displacement and cross-border migration issues with neighbors like India. Bangladesh's government has invested in addressing climate change effects and is considering a carbon tax on fossil fuels. The country ranks low in food security, with high prevalence of underweight children and limited access to clean water. Despite being a major rice producer, Bangladesh remains food deficient. Bangladesh faces challenges with food security, particularly regarding rice production. Flash floods in April 2017 damaged a significant amount of rice, with estimates suggesting up to 2.2 million tons affected. Climate change effects, such as increased salinity levels and droughts, are projected to further impact rice production in the future. The government's rice reserves, meant to support farmers, have decreased due to import duties. Internal migration, particularly to Dhaka, has been observed as a result of unprofitable agriculture in some regions. The government in Bangladesh lowered the import duty on rice from 25% to 10% in June 2017 due to flash floods and rice-blast disease causing soaring prices. Waterways are vital for transportation, with projects like the Gorai River Restoration Project aiming to maintain resilience. Dredging is used to prevent waterways from becoming disconnected during dry months. The Gorai River Restoration Project was launched in 2009 to reconnect two rivers, but as of April 2017, it has not been successful. The U.S. and Bangladesh collaborate on counterterrorism efforts, with Bangladesh participating in the Antiterrorism Assistance program. In 2016, there was a significant increase in terrorist activity in Bangladesh. In 2016, Bangladesh saw a significant increase in terrorist activity. The government has a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and has made numerous arrests of terrorist suspects. Transnational terror networks are believed to operate in the country, with arrests of individuals linked to groups like Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan and Islamic State. Attacks claimed by Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent and Islamic State have resulted in casualties, including a deadly attack at Dhaka's Holey Artisan Bakery in July 2016. The Holey Artisan Bakery attack in Dhaka in July 2016 resulted in the deaths of several foreigners, including Italians, Japanese, a U.S. citizen, and an Indian. The government of Bangladesh initially blamed a domestic militant group, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), for the assault, downplaying any links to the Islamic State. Observers suggest the government is minimizing IS's presence in Bangladesh to leverage the perceived threat of domestic militancy. The government of Bangladesh is accused of using the threat of domestic militancy as an excuse to suppress dissent. Naming terrorist organizations strategically determines who takes action against them and benefits politically. After the bakery attack, connections between IS and Bangladeshi militants were revealed, with reports suggesting IS approved the attack beforehand. Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury, an IS coordinator in Bangladesh, praised the attack. Some analysts believe JMB has rebranded itself by associating with ISIS, but IS likely had minimal involvement in planning the Holey Artisan Bakery attack. Terrorists in Bangladesh are adopting new, more aggressive tactics, as seen in the attackers' refusal to retreat during the assault. This shift indicates a higher level of indoctrination among extremists in the country. The second half of 2016 saw a new level of indoctrination among Islamist extremists in Bangladesh, with a willingness to die for their beliefs. IS claimed responsibility for attacks on the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport and a failed attack on the Rapid Action Battalion barracks. Harkat-ul-Jihad-al Islami Bangladesh (HUJI-B) is a U.S.-designated terrorist group with links to Al Qaeda and Pakistani ISI operatives. Operations commander Mufti Abdul Hannan trained in Pakistan before fighting in Afghanistan. In March 2017, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence for Hannan due to his role in a 2004 attack on the U.K. high commissioner to Bangladesh, killing three police officers. Other events have revealed evolving terrorist networks in the region, such as an accidental bomb explosion in Indian West Bengal in 2014 that killed two suspected JMB members. JMB members have reportedly infiltrated from Bangladesh into India's border districts for recruitment. Several militant groups, including HUJI-B and JMB, have been banned, leading their members to form new groups like Jund al-Tawheed wal Khilafah (JTK). Islamist extremists have targeted secular activists and bloggers, with the Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) creating a hit list of 'atheist' bloggers linked to al-Qaeda. The AL government in Bangladesh has tried to appease Islamists by pledging to build mosques in every town with a $1 billion gift from Saudi Arabia. The AL government in Bangladesh is using a $1 billion gift from Saudi Arabia to build mosques in every town, in an effort to shield themselves from religious criticism. There is an ongoing struggle over secularism in Bangladesh, with Islamists discrediting it in the eyes of many. Bangladesh's geo-strategic location is important, impacting South Asia and Asia as a whole since gaining independence in 1971. India is increasing its role in the region due to China's Belt and Road Initiative, leading to competition with China in Bangladesh. Bangladesh's foreign policy focuses on trade, economic development, and diplomatic relations, while also maintaining ties with Muslim states. Bangladesh is a member of various regional cooperation organizations. Bangladesh is a member of regional cooperation organizations like SAARC and BIMSTEC, aiming for collaboration on trade, poverty reduction, and countering crime and terrorism. The country is also part of the BCIM group proposing an economic corridor connecting Kolkata and Kunming. China and India compete for influence in Bangladesh, especially in trade and energy routes. In 2015, Indian PM Modi's visit led to a Joint Declaration focusing on energy cooperation and transport connectivity. During the 2015 summit, Bangladesh and India signed an agreement clarifying their common border, removing a source of tension. India has expressed concerns about illegal Bangladeshi migrants crossing into its northeast, with estimates ranging from 12 to 30 million. In 2014, over $4 billion in remittances came to Bangladesh from India. India has historically been more supportive of AL governments due to their secularist outlooks. India has expressed concerns about militant groups using Bangladesh as a base for attacks. Indian Railways is pushing for an \"Iron Silk Road\" freight corridor to counter China's influence. In April 2017, Prime Minister Hasina visited India to sign agreements, including a $4.5 billion credit line. Water rights, especially regarding the Teesta River, remain a contentious issue between the two countries. Bangladesh and China have strengthened ties, with some favoring closer relations to balance with India. Bangladesh became a full member of CICA in 2014, with China and Russia as \"dual cores.\" China's low labor costs may make Bangladesh important in Chinese value chains. China announced a $40 billion Silk Road infrastructure fund in 2014. China announced plans to invest $890 billion in Belt and Road Initiative projects in 60 countries, including Bangladesh. The two countries signed investment deals totaling $13.6 billion during President Xi Jinping's visit, with a focus on infrastructure projects like railway construction and the Padma Bridge. China is also building ports in the Indian Ocean region, while Bangladesh previously chose not to negotiate with China for a deep water port in Sonadia. Japan has signed agreements with Bangladesh to finance and build a seaport at Matarbari, along with 4 power plants. Japan is also financing infrastructure projects in Bangladesh, including the Jamuna Railway Bridge and a mass rapid-transit system in Dhaka. Observers suggest that Japan may be countering China's influence in the Indian Ocean Region. China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner and arms supplier, with 82% of arms purchases from China between 2009 and 2013. In 2016, China delivered two submarines to Bangladesh, which was seen as a provocation by a former Indian navy admiral."
