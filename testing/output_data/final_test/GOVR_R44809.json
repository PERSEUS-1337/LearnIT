    "content": "The Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) supports international conservation efforts for various animals through five sub-funds. These funds receive appropriations from Congress and provide grants for activities such as habitat conservation, law enforcement improvement, and technical assistance in the species' home range countries. The MSCF funds conservation efforts for endangered species with support from partners and Congress. Funding includes appropriations for wildlife trafficking and habitat conservation. Semipostal stamps generate additional funds for conservation programs. Congress authorized the creation and distribution of these stamps to boost funding for MSCF. The Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp (MSCF stamp) was authorized by Congress under the Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Act of 2010. The U.S. Postal Service issues and sells the stamp, with proceeds going to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for distribution among the five MSCF sub-funds. The stamp, titled \"Save Vanishing Species,\" features an Amur tiger and was introduced in September 2011. The Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp (MSCF stamp) features an Amur tiger and was approved by the Postmaster General. Congress extended the sale of the stamp for an additional four years through the Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2013. As of November 2016, over 36.6 million MSCF stamps have been sold, generating $3.9 million for conservation projects in 33 countries. The Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp (MSCF stamp) has been successful in generating funds for conservation projects. From FY2012 to FY2016, $3.1 million from stamp sales leveraged $12.5 million in additional funds for conservation. The stamp's efficacy in raising funds for international conservation led to its reauthorization to address wildlife trafficking. Funds from MSCF stamp sales have supported efforts to combat wildlife trafficking. The FWS used MSCF stamp funds to support a program rehabilitating trafficked tigers in Indonesia. Semipostal stamps are sold with a surcharge for designated causes. USPS transfers a portion of the proceeds to the U.S. Treasury for allocation to federal agencies. Congress authorized semipostal stamps in 1997, with the first one being the Breast Cancer Research stamp. The Breast Cancer Research stamp was the first semipostal stamp sold in the United States in 1997 under the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act. This act allowed USPS to issue stamps priced up to 25% higher than standard, with 70% of proceeds going to the National Institutes of Health and 30% to the Department of Defense for breast cancer research. The Semipostal Authorization Act of 2000 expanded USPS's authority to issue semipostal stamps for causes deemed in the national interest, with funds going to federal agencies supporting the cause. The USPS has the authority to issue semipostal stamps, with a 10-year sunset provision that has not started yet. Recent changes to USPS regulations allow for the development and issuance of discretionary semipostal stamps. The Semipostal Authorization Act of 2000 granted USPS the authority to issue semipostals for a 10-year period. The USPS has the authority to issue semipostal stamps, with recent changes allowing for discretionary semipostal stamps to be developed and issued. The amended regulations state that USPS will issue one discretionary semipostal stamp at a time, with a total of five to be sold for a period of no more than two years each. Public proposals for the first discretionary semipostal were due in July 2016, and the final decision on which semipostals to issue rests with the Postmaster General. As of February 28, 2017, a decision had not been made on what semipostals to issue. If the MSCF stamp is not reauthorized in 2017, USPS could discontinue it and focus on other semipostal stamps. In 2017, USPS may discontinue the MSCF stamp and focus on other semipostal stamps as per amended regulations. Bills in the 115th Congress address semipostal stamps, with some proposing reauthorization of the MSCF stamp for four years and adding an African elephant design. Other bills suggest semipostal stamps for causes like the Peace Corps, combating invasive species, agricultural conservation, and supporting fallen service members' families. H.R. 128 would limit USPS's authority to issue semipostal stamps unless mandated by Congress. Many see semipostal stamps as a simple and cost-effective way to support various causes. Semipostal stamps are viewed as an easy and inexpensive way to raise funds and awareness for causes. Supporters of the MSCF stamp believe it has strong support and generates additional funds for conservation efforts. The stamp allows the public to participate in financing conservation and anti-wildlife trafficking efforts for targeted species. Additionally, semipostal stamps have the potential to raise significant funding, as seen with the success of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. Apart from raising funds for conservation, MSCF stamps can raise public awareness of wildlife trafficking. Collaboration with other countries could increase international awareness. Some concerns include USPS's limited interest in selling semipostal stamps and opposition from the philatelic community. Choosing among worthy causes for semipostal revenue is a challenge. USPS requested Congress's help in deciding on future semipostal stamps, acknowledging the difficulty of choosing among worthy causes. The success of semipostal stamps varies, with some generating millions for their causes while others generate less funding. Increased competition from more types of semipostal stamps may impact sales of the MSCF stamp, leading to suggestions that other causes could be prioritized for semipostal stamp programs. The sale of semipostals may not generate sufficient funds to support their existence. Factors affecting success include advertising, competition with other semipostal stamps, and the popularity of the cause. Concerns exist about the limited range of eligible uses for funds raised by MSCF stamps, suggesting the need for broader guidelines to address international conservation efforts."
