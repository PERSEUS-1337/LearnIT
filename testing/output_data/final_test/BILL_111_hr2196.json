    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Design Piracy Prohibition Act\" and includes amendments to Title 17 of the United States Code. The \"Design Piracy Prohibition Act\" amends Title 17 of the United States Code to protect fashion designs, defining a fashion design as the overall appearance of an article of apparel including its ornamentation and original elements. The term 'design' includes fashion design, except for vessels. 'Apparel' refers to clothing, accessories, and eyeglass frames. 'Trend' in fashion design means a popular concept that creates high demand for related apparel. The amendment to the United States Code now includes protection for fashion designs that have been made public for more than 6 months before registration. This extends the scope of design protection beyond vessel hulls. The protection term for fashion designs under the United States Code is 3 years, starting from the date of protection commencement. This extends the scope of design protection beyond vessel hulls. Section 1309 of title 17, United States Code, is amended to define an 'infringing article' as any article whose design is copied from a protected design without consent. This includes designs in various mediums but excludes illustrations or pictures in advertisements or similar media. The amendment to Section 1309 of title 17, United States Code, clarifies that a design shall not be considered copied from a protected design if it is original and not substantially similar in appearance. This applies to vessel hull and fashion designs, ensuring that secondary liability doctrines are applied in actions under chapter 5. The amendment clarifies that secondary liability doctrines apply to actions under chapter 5, extending liability to those infringing on vessel hull and fashion designs. Protection under this chapter is lost if registration for the design is not made within a specified time frame. Protection under this chapter is lost if registration for the design is not made within 6 months after it is first made public. Subsection (b) clarifies that the design must be offered for individual or public sale. Subsection (d) outlines the application process for registration with the Administrator. The application for registration of vessel hull designs and fashion designs must include a description of the design. The absence of a description will not prevent registration. The Administrator may require a brief description of fashion designs for the searchable database. Recovery for infringement is addressed in Section 1323 of title 17, United. Recovery for infringement and penalties for false representation under title 17, United States Code are amended to increase fines. Common law and other rights remain unaffected. Additionally, a searchable database for fashion design is proposed in Chapter 13. A searchable database for fashion designs protected under Chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code will be established by the Administrator. The database will be electronically searchable by apparel and accessory categories, include required information, and be accessible to the public without charge. A searchable database for fashion designs protected under Chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code will be established by the Administrator. It will include information on the status of designs such as registration, denial, cancellation, or expiration. Additionally, a conforming amendment will be made to the table of sections for chapter 13 of title 17. A searchable database for fashion designs will be established, with authorization of necessary appropriations. The Act and its amendments will take effect upon enactment."
