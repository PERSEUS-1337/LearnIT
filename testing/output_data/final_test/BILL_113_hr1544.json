The Secretary will coordinate planning requirements and administration of the initiative between the Federal Railroad Administration and the Federal Transit Administration. Federal incentives are outlined in Section 3. The Secretary will establish criteria for projects eligible for Federal incentives, including commercial development that generates revenue, increases tax base, promotes job growth, and enhances intermodal connectivity.
