    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that a war in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has resulted in the deaths of 2,500,000 people. The conflict began with the invasion of the DRC by Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi in August 1998, leading to further loss of life and human rights abuses, including child labor and mass displacement. The United Nations report highlights the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo, including diamonds, gold, timber, cobalt, coltan, coffee, ivory, and exotic animals. This exploitation is fueling human rights abuses such as child labor, forced displacement, rape, torture, and restrictions on political expression. The use of slave and prison labor in mining coltan, diamonds, and other minerals by Rwandans and Rwandan-supported rebels has been reported. This includes mining in World Heritage sites in the DRC, leading to environmental damage and reliance on bushmeat for food. Additionally, the United States imports unrefined tantalum, a component of coltan, from three of the top six nations. The DRC, Rwanda, and Uganda are major exporters of unrefined tantalum, a component of coltan, generating significant revenue in 1999. Mining activities in the DRC have led to increased logging, providing easier access to forest resources and rare woods. Illegal exploitation in the DRC has resulted in financial gains for the Rwandan Patriotic Army and top Ugandan military commanders and civilians. The United Nations Panel recommends tough measures to end the exploitation of natural resources and conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, including sanctions and improved regulations. Some US corporations processing tantalum have asked suppliers to certify the mineral's legality. Some US corporations processing tantalum have asked suppliers to certify that the mineral does not originate in the Congo region to avoid purchasing from there. The importation of colombo tantalite and tantalum from certain countries like Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, or the Democratic Republic of the Congo into the United States is prohibited. Importers must prove that the tantalum products are not derived from colombo tantalite originating from these countries. Overseas purchase of colombo tantalite and tantalum is also prohibited. Prohibition on purchasing colombo tantalite, tantalum, tantalum ore, or tantalum powder from listed countries by any US person. Civil penalty of up to $100,000 for violations. Definition of \"United States person\" includes citizens, legal entities in the US, and foreign entities controlled by US citizens. Prevention of transshipment. SEC. 4. PREVENTION OF TRANSSHIPMENT.\n\nCustoms Commissioner, with agency heads, to trace origins of colombo tantalite products to prevent transshipment through other countries to evade prohibitions.\n\nSEC. 5. TERMINATION OF PROHIBITIONS.\n\nProhibitions on listed countries cease when President certifies their withdrawal from Congo conflict and compliance with Ceasefire Agreement."
