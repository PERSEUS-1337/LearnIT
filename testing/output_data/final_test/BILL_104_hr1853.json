    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom From Nicotine Addiction Act of 1995\". The Congress acknowledges that tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of illness and death in the United States, resulting in over 419,000 unnecessary deaths annually. It is noted that tobacco is uniquely harmful as it can cause death when used as intended. The economic impact of smoking includes $50 billion in healthcare expenditures and $47 billion in lost productivity each year. Additionally, a 1988 report by the Surgeon General confirmed that tobacco products are addicting, with nicotine being the addictive substance, and the addiction processes are similar to those of heroin and cocaine. The Surgeon General's 1994 report concluded that nicotine in tobacco products is responsible for addiction in children. Among US adults who have smoked daily, 91% tried their first cigarette before age 20. Nicotine addiction leads over 3,000 children daily to smoking, eventually causing death in half of them. Tobacco is labeled a pediatric disease by the current Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The primary incentive for cigarette smoking is the immediate physiological effect of nicotine. Despite awareness of the dangers, nicotine addiction in children and adults continues to drive the widespread use of tobacco products. Tobacco manufacturers have the technology to remove nicotine from their products. Nicotine addiction drives widespread tobacco product use, destroying freedom of choice for millions in the US. The text chunk discusses the regulation of tobacco products, defining them as cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and smokeless tobacco. It also includes a definition of nicotine and mentions a reduction in nicotine content in tobacco products. The text outlines regulations prohibiting the introduction of adulterated tobacco products into interstate commerce based on nicotine content per cigarette, with decreasing limits from 1997 to 2002. The Secretary is required to set similar reductions for non-cigarette tobacco products. The text prohibits the introduction of adulterated tobacco products with excessive nicotine into interstate commerce. Enforcement includes penalties for introducing such products."
