It also supports non-SSA programs like Medicare and provides data for federal and state programs. Benefit payments for SSA's core programs are considered mandatory spending. The Social Security Administration's core programs are considered mandatory spending, while its discretionary spending for administrative expenses is controlled by annual appropriations. This report focuses on SSA's annual discretionary appropriations for administrative expenses, including projected spending on benefit payments and operating costs for FY2017. It also discusses the President's budget request for SSA and historical trends in the budget request and appropriation for the agency's administrative expenses. The Social Security Administration's core programs are mandatory spending, while discretionary spending for administrative expenses is controlled by annual appropriations. The data in the report can be found in SSA's FY2017 budget justification to Congress. SSA administers federal income support programs such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, and Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans. Social Security is a social insurance program that replaces a portion of an insured worker's income based on career-average earnings, while SSI and Special Benefits are public assistance programs providing a guaranteed minimum income to certain groups. All three programs are entitlements, meaning the federal government is obligated to pay benefits to individuals. Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) provides monthly cash benefits to insured workers aged 62 or older and their eligible spouses and children, as well as certain survivors of deceased insured workers. Workers become insured by working and paying Social Security taxes for a sufficient number of years in covered jobs. OASI benefits and administrative costs are paid from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, funded by current workers, employers, and self-employed individuals. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) pays monthly cash benefits to nonelderly insured workers with severe disabilities. Workers become insured by working in covered jobs subject to payroll taxes. SSDI benefits are paid from the Federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund, to which workers, employers, and self-employed individuals contribute. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides cash assistance to needy aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited income and assets. Monthly SSI benefits are reduced by other countable income, making it a program of \"last resort\" for low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities. States may provide state supplementary payments (SSP) in addition to federal SSI benefits. The Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans program provides cash benefits to low-income individuals aged 65 or older who were SSI eligible in December 1999 and are World War II veterans residing outside the United States. The program's costs are covered by general revenues. In FY2017, spending on various programs, including OASI, SSDI, SSI, and Special Benefits for Certain World War II, is projected to exceed $1.0 trillion, with benefit payments accounting for 98.4%. In FY2017, benefit payments for SSA's core programs are projected to exceed $1.0 trillion, with approximately 98.4% of total spending allocated to benefit payments. Administrative expenses for these programs are determined as a percentage of benefit payments, with costs associated with Medicare included in the total. Administrative outlays for SSA's core programs are considered mandatory spending and are not controlled by annual appropriations acts. Administrative outlays for SSA's disability programs are higher than OASI due to complexity, especially for means-tested SSI. Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans program has high administrative costs due to low benefit levels and decreasing recipients. Despite being mandatory spending, SSA requires resources for program administration. The SSA requires annual discretionary appropriations to support its programs and administration. The agency's accounts are typically funded through the LHHS appropriations bill. The President's budget request for SSA includes four accounts. The SSA's budget request to Congress consists of four accounts: Payments to Social Security Trust Funds, Supplemental Security Income Program, Limitation on Administrative Expenses, and Office of Inspector General. The Limitation on Administrative Expenses account funds core programs and non-SSA program administration. The President's FY2017 budget projects $39.2 billion in payments not controlled by annual appropriations acts. The SSA's budget request includes payments not controlled by annual appropriations acts, mainly from subjecting a portion of Social Security benefits to federal income tax. The President's FY2017 budget request includes $11.4 million for payments to the Social Security trust funds, with the majority of funding going towards the SSI program, an appropriated entitlement. Funding for SSI benefits is controlled through the program's authorizing statute, with mandatory spending enacted through annual appropriations acts. SSI-related administrative expenses are also funded through the annual appropriations process. The SSI program is paid out of general revenues and appropriated to SSA. The SSI account includes a main appropriation for benefits and administrative costs for the current fiscal year, as well as an indefinite appropriation for costs incurred after June 15. The SSI program includes an appropriation for benefits and administrative costs for the current fiscal year, as well as an indefinite appropriation for costs incurred after June 15. The FY2017 President's budget request includes $43.8 billion for current fiscal year program costs and $15.0 billion for SSI benefits in the first quarter of FY2018. Total SSI benefits payable in FY2017 are estimated to be $52.9 billion, with $14.5 billion coming from the FY2017 advance appropriation. The SSI appropriation in the FY2017 President's budget request includes $5.4 billion for administrative expenses, which cover initial disability determinations, hearings, appeals, and program integrity activities. Additionally, $5.2 billion is allocated for beneficiary services, research, and Medicare outreach. The FY2017 President's budget request includes $89 million for beneficiary services, $58 million for Title XVI research and demonstration projects, and an additional $2 million for costs associated with the Department of State's two-year special immigrant visa extension for Afghans. The LAE account funds SSA's administrative costs for various programs and supports Medicare and other non-SSA programs. The FY2017 President's budget request for SSA's LAE account is $13.1 billion, funded by various sources including Social Security trust funds, Medicare trust funds, general revenues, and user fees. This includes base LAE appropriation, program integrity activities, and user fee appropriations. The base LAE appropriation is $11.1 billion for SSA's administrative expenses. The FY2017 President's budget request for the base LAE appropriation is $11.1 billion, including costs for program integrity activities such as CDRs and SSI redeterminations. The BBEDCA allows for discretionary spending limits to be adjusted for program integrity work related to SSA's disability programs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 amended the cap adjustment levels to permit higher maximum adjustments for FY2017 through FY2019 and a lower maximum adjustment in FY2021. The FY2017 President's budget request includes $1.819 billion in program integrity funding, with a base amount of $273 million. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased program integrity funding for SSA's disability programs, allowing for higher cap adjustments and expanding the types of activities eligible for funding. This includes Cooperative Disability Investigations Units and fraud prosecutions by Special Assistant United States Attorneys. The CDI program involves multiple agencies investigating suspicious disability claims, while SAUSAs prosecute fraud cases referred by the OIG. The BBA 2015 clarified that continuing disability reviews include work-related CDRs for disabled Social Security beneficiaries. The FY2017 President's budget requests $127 million in LAE appropriations, with $126 million from state fees for SSI program administration and $1 million from non-attorney representative fees. The OIG investigates fraud, waste, and abuse in SSA's core programs and monitors improper federal benefit receipt. The OIG investigates fraud, waste, and abuse in SSA's core programs, monitors improper federal benefit receipt, and supports homeland security efforts. The FY2017 President's budget request for the OIG is $112 million, with funding from general revenues and OASI and DI trust funds. SSA became an independent federal agency in 1995 under the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994. The FY2017 Commissioner's budget for SSA administrative funding is $13.9 billion, including $13.6 billion for administrative expenses, $128 million for research, and $121 million for the OIG. The total FY2016 appropriation for SSA's LAE account was nearly $12.2 billion, 2.8% less than the $12.5 billion requested in the President's budget. The Commissioner's budget has consistently exceeded the President's request in nominal dollars since SSA became an independent agency. The final appropriation from Congress for SSA's LAE account has often been less than the commissioner's budget, except in a few fiscal years. In FY2014, the President's request included a legislative proposal for funding program integrity activities. Historical trends show a steady increase in appropriations for the LAE account over the last 20 years. The trend in SSA's LAE appropriation over the last 20 years has shown a steady increase, although the rate of growth has slowed since FY2010. Adjusting for changes in prices and wage growth reveals fluctuations in the appropriation value. The trend in SSA's LAE appropriation has steadily increased over the last 20 years, with a slowdown in growth since FY2010. Annual increases in payroll expenses can outpace inflation due to wages growing faster than prices. The value of SSA's appropriation for the LAE account in real terms has declined steadily from FY2010 to FY2016."
