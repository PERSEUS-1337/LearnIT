    "content": "President Obama signed the Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development in 2010, emphasizing the importance of foreign development assistance. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) aims to integrate climate change considerations into foreign assistance to promote sustainable societies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The GCCI includes adaptation assistance, clean energy assistance, and sustainable landscapes assistance programs. The Department of State and USAID focus on helping low-income countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America build climate resilience through bilateral and regional programs. Initiatives include addressing climate risks in infrastructure, agriculture, health, and water services, capacity building for decision-making based on science, and promoting good governance. Multilateral efforts supported by the United States target vulnerable countries with initiatives like the Least Developed Country Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund for climate resilience and food security. The Strategic Climate Fund coordinates strategies in vulnerable countries to address the risks of climate change. The United States supports vulnerable countries in addressing climate risks through clean energy programs delivered via multilateral trust funds housed in international financial institutions. These funds provide financial assistance for projects implemented by various organizations and aim to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies. The United States supports vulnerable countries in addressing climate risks through clean energy programs delivered via multilateral trust funds. These funds aim to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies and provide incremental funding for energy and infrastructure projects that support global environmental benefits. Bilateral efforts at the Department of State and USAID complement multilateral investments by shaping development policy and regulatory environments in recipient countries. Sustainable landscape programs aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The Department of State and USAID support country-driven policies for forest governance, monitoring systems, and efforts to halt deforestation. Multilateral initiatives like the Strategic Climate Fund and Global Environment Facility address deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions in lower-income countries. The United States also supports clean energy programs to reduce climate risks and accelerate clean energy technologies.

See the Appendix for a breakdown of the request. The potential authorizations and appropriations for international climate change initiatives administered by various agencies may raise concerns due to fiscal constraints, especially during economic downturns. Budget limitations could impact sustaining support for these programs. Some suggest prioritizing domestic needs over global concerns due to limited funds. Criticisms of financial assistance institutions include inefficiency, lack of transparency, and misuse of funds. Questions persist about the effectiveness of international aid in promoting economic development in lower-income countries. In spurring economic development and reform in lower-income countries, international assistance faces uncertainties in climate science. Prevailing research shows varying degrees of uncertainty in the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the global climate, leading to debates on the effectiveness of climate change assistance policies. Some argue for continued contributions citing commercial interests. Some argue that international climate change assistance benefits U.S. businesses by promoting low-emission economic growth, increasing trade, and enhancing job creation. Decreased funding may diminish American influence in global markets, allowing other economic powers like the European Union and China to take the lead. Some economists suggest that lower-income countries offer a cost-effective opportunity to mitigate global emissions. International climate change assistance can support natural disaster preparedness and help avoid future losses. Additionally, it is seen as a way to address national security concerns. Some view international climate change assistance as a way to address national security risks by helping lower-income countries become less vulnerable to poverty, social tensions, and environmental degradation. It is also seen as a means to enhance U.S. leadership in global environmental issues and influence international economic and environmental policies."
