Funds can be used for staffing, training, certification, accreditation, or capital expenditures. Local building code enforcement departments must have a code administration team with specific roles. Matching funds are required to be eligible for a grant under this Act. Local building code enforcement departments serving areas with different population sizes are required to provide matching, non-Federal funds in varying percentages to be eligible for grants under this Act.
