    "content": "The President submits a federal budget proposal to Congress annually by the first Monday in February. The Congressional Budget Office analyzes the proposal, and the House and Senate Budget Committees develop their resolutions. Differences are to be resolved by April 15. The resolution serves as a framework for legislative action. The report focuses on Medicaid and SCHIP, updated until the FY2009 budget is passed and the next President's FY2010 budget is released. The President's FY2009 budget contains proposals affecting Medicaid and SCHIP, including program expansions and cost-saving measures. Congressional Research Service provides contact information for staff by topic area. Both CBO and executive branch agencies offer estimates of current spending and proposed changes. Some proposals require legislative action, while others can be implemented administratively. The President's FY2009 budget includes proposals for Medicaid and SCHIP, with estimates of current spending and proposed changes provided by both CBO and executive branch agencies. Differences in treatment of legislative and administrative proposals lead to varying estimates of Medicaid and SCHIP spending. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the Social Security Act to exclude certain individuals with high home equity from Medicaid eligibility for long-term care services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the Social Security Act to exclude individuals with high home equity from Medicaid eligibility for long-term care services. The President's budget proposes limiting the allowable home equity amount to $500,000 for all states. The President's budget proposes limiting the allowable home equity amount to $500,000 for all states, eliminating the state option to increase the limit. This change would save $80 million in FY2009 and $480 million over the FY2009-FY2013 period. For more information on home equity and Medicaid eligibility, refer to CRS Report RL33593. Eligibility for Medicaid's long-term care services is limited to beneficiaries. Medicaid's eligibility for long-term care services, including home care and community-based supportive services, is based on state assessments for functional need and financial standards. Functional assessments evaluate if applicants require institutional care, while financial standards include pathways for those with income above 74% of the federal poverty level. Medicaid beneficiaries needing long-term care also receive acute care benefits like hospital care and physician services. The President's budget proposes a state plan amendment option for Medicaid to offer a modified benefit package of acute care services for selected long-term care beneficiaries. This would allow states to adapt private sector health insurance benefit packages to better meet the needs of specific Medicaid beneficiary groups. HHS estimates Medicaid would save $20 million in FY2009 and $650 million over FY2009-FY2013 by redesigning acute care benefits. States contract with managed care organizations for Medicaid services, including HMOs, PCCM programs, and PHPs. Managed care contracts vary in services provided and financial risk. Federal laws prior to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 limited states' use of managed care for Medicaid. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 added Section 1932 to the Medicaid statute, allowing states to require Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care without a waiver. Certain groups, such as children with special health care needs, were exempt from mandatory enrollment in managed care. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 added Section 1932 to the Medicaid statute, allowing states to require Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care without a waiver. Certain exempted groups include children under 18 meeting SSI disability standards, foster care or adoption assistance recipients, and dually eligible individuals for Medicare and Medicaid. The President's FY2009 Budget proposes repealing Section 1932(a)(2) to allow states to require currently exempted populations to enroll in managed care. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 added Section 1932 to the Medicaid statute, allowing states to require Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care without a waiver. Certain exempted groups include children under 18 meeting SSI disability standards, foster care or adoption assistance recipients, and dually eligible individuals for Medicare and Medicaid. The President's FY2009 Budget proposes repealing Section 1932(a)(2) to allow states to require currently exempted populations to enroll in Medicaid managed care programs covered under Medicaid state plans. HHS estimates savings of $100 million in FY2009 and $2.1 billion over the FY2009-2013 period by repealing the special rules. The President's budget proposes extending the Section 1915(b) waiver renewal period from two years to three years for Medicaid managed care programs. This extension is estimated to have no cost impact in FY2009 or over the FY2009-FY2013 period. The waivers must be cost-effective and cannot expand eligibility, but cost savings can be used to provide additional services to Medicaid beneficiaries. For more information on Medicaid managed care, refer to CRS Report RL33711. Under Medicaid, drug manufacturers must enter rebate agreements with HHS for Medicaid enrollees. Rebates ensure Medicaid pays the lowest price for drugs. Calculations depend on the drug type, comparing average manufacturer price to the best price offered. The President's budget proposes legislation to eliminate the \"best price\" from the rebate formula for certain drugs under Medicaid. This change aims to simplify rebate calculations and allow private purchasers to negotiate lower prices without affecting Medicaid drug costs. The President's budget proposes legislation to eliminate the \"best price\" from the rebate formula for certain drugs under Medicaid, allowing private purchasers to negotiate lower prices without impacting Medicaid drug costs. HHS estimates no cost impact in FY2009 or over the FY2009-FY2013 period. State Medicaid programs set prices paid to pharmacies for outpatient drugs, with federal reimbursements limited to a federal upper limit (FUL) established by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The President's budget proposes legislation to reduce FULs on multiple source drugs from 250% to 150% of the AMP of the lowest priced drug in the group, aiming to achieve additional savings in the Medicaid program. HHS estimates the proposal would save $195 million in FY2009 and $1.1 billion over the FY2009-FY2013 period. The new FUL formula has been issued in a proposed federal rule, but its implementation is on hold pending a legal determination. During FY2009-FY2013, Medicaid provisions of DRA 2005 were detailed in reports by CRS. Third party liability (TPL) requires third parties to pay for medical assistance under Medicaid before Medicaid acts as the payer of last resort. Additional background information on Medicaid prescription drugs can be found in CRS Report RL30726. States must ensure that third parties meet their legal obligation to pay claims before Medicaid covers an individual's care. If probable liability exists, states must reject the claim for cost avoidance. If liability is uncertain or the third party cannot pay, states must pay the claim and try to recover the amount. Exceptions exist for using the pay-and-chase method. States must use pay-and-chase for prenatal and preventive pediatric care, and when a Medicaid beneficiary's parent provides medical support but the provider has not been paid within 30 days. Medicaid beneficiaries may need to reimburse the state, with liens placed on their property for reimbursement. Federal law prohibits Medicaid liens on living beneficiaries' property but allows them on deceased beneficiaries' estates. The President's budget proposes legislation to expand Medicaid liens on deceased beneficiaries' estates in various situations, aiming to save $35 million in FY2009 and $470 million over FY2009-FY2013. The Social Security Administration is testing a financial account verification system in New York and New Jersey to confirm SSI eligibility. The SSA is testing a financial account verification system for SSI eligibility, with a small percentage of overpayments identified. The President's budget proposes legislation to extend and make technical corrections to the demonstration, estimating savings of $82 million in FY2009 and $1.2 billion over FY2009-FY2013. The President's budget proposes legislation to increase transparency in Medicare financial operations through an annual actuarial report. This proposal is estimated to have no cost impact in FY2009 or over the FY2009-FY2013 period. Medicaid, which is financed with state and federal general revenues, does not have a similar reporting requirement. The Medicare Board of Trustees oversees the financial operations of the Hospital Insurance trust fund for Medicare Part A services and the Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund for Medicare Parts B and D. No other CRS reports currently address this topic. When Congress replaced AFDC with the TANF block grant program in 1996, the federal government reimbursed states for 50% of administrative expenditures for AFDC, Medicaid, and food stamps. States often undertook shared administrative tasks for all three programs, with total federal spending unaffected by how costs were allocated. When TANF replaced AFDC in 1996, the federal match for cash welfare assistance ended, and the link between cash welfare and Medicaid eligibility was severed. States must allocate administrative costs for TANF, Medicaid, and food stamps based on benefits. TANF block grants are higher due to pre-1996 federal welfare spending, including administrative costs. Congress reduced federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs in most states to compensate. The President's budget proposes legislation to recoup Medicaid administrative costs included in states' TANF block grants, aiming to save $280 million in FY2009 and $1.8 billion over the FY2009-FY2013 period. This is part of efforts to reduce federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs in most states. The Performance Measurement Partnership Project was formed by CMS to select a common set of measures for Medicaid and SCHIP programs to assess care quality. The President's budget proposal would require states to monitor and report on Medicaid performance measures, linking performance to federal grant awards. States failing to meet thresholds could face FMAP or grant reductions until meeting performance measures. Reporting would start in FY2009 with a three-year phase-in for measures, and consequences would begin in 2012. The Administration on Children and Families (ACF) initiated the Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS) in 1993 to coordinate with state public assistance agencies and federal agencies. PARIS is an information-sharing project used to verify clients' public assistance circumstances. The PARIS program, initiated by ACF in 1993, helps agencies determine if public assistance clients receive benefits from other agencies. While grant funding has been exhausted, 42 states, DC, and Puerto Rico participate in PARIS in some form. A proposal suggests making PARIS participation mandatory for states to improve program effectiveness and reduce Medicaid spending by $5. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicare program through contractors, primarily health insurance companies. CMS implemented the correct coding initiative (CCI) in 1996 to ensure correct payment for claims. Medicare contracts use software to scan claims using CCI edits to detect duplicate services. The PARIS program mandate is estimated to reduce Medicaid spending by $5 million in FY2009 and $135 million over the five-year period from FY2009-FY2013. No other CRS reports address this topic. The proposal mandates Medicaid to participate in a National Correct Coding Initiative similar to Medicare's CCI. HHS estimates CCI would reduce Medicaid spending by $5 million in FY2009 and $105 million from FY2009-FY2013. Federal government shares costs of Medicaid services with states based on federal guidelines. The federal government shares costs of Medicaid services with states based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), which ranges from 50% to 83%. Administrative expenditures have a fixed federal match of 50%, with certain functions eligible for a higher match of 75%. The federal government shares costs of Medicaid services with states based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), which ranges from 50% to 83%. Administrative expenditures have a fixed federal match of 50%, with certain functions eligible for a higher match of 75%. The President's budget seeks legislation to set the federal reimbursement rate for all Medicaid administrative activities at 50%, which could save $950 million in FY2009 and approximately $5.5 billion over the FY2009-FY2013 period. The President's budget seeks legislation to provide federal reimbursement for family planning services based on the FMAP, aiming to save $570 million in FY2009 and $3.3 billion over the FY2009-FY2013 period. Under current law, case management is an optional Medicaid service that assists beneficiaries in accessing medical, social, and educational services. Targeted case management is provided to specific classes of beneficiaries or in specific areas. The federal government's share of the cost is based on the FMAP. Case management can also be claimed as a Medicaid administrative activity, with a federal match of 50%. The President's budget proposes setting the federal reimbursement rate for all case management activities at 50%, aiming to save $200 million in FY2009 and $1.1 billion over the FY2009-FY2013 period. Thirty-eight states will have an FMAP exceeding 50% in FY2009, resulting in the federal government covering a larger share of costs for case management as a Medicaid service. The President's budget proposes federal reimbursement to state Medicaid programs for Medicare Part B premium costs of Qualifying Individuals (QI-1s) based on the FMAP, requiring a state share. This would save $200 million in FY2009 and $200 million over the FY2009-FY2013 period. Under the budget proposal, the QI-1 program is re-authorized for one year with funding of $200 million to align the QI match rate. The program covers Medicare Part B premiums for low-income Medicare beneficiaries with income between 120% and 135% of the FPL. Congress established this group temporarily in 1997, and eligibility has been extended. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL32977. The QI-1 program, established temporarily in 1997, covers Medicare Part B premiums for low-income beneficiaries. Congress has extended eligibility for this group multiple times. The most recent extension was authorized under the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007. The President's budget seeks legislation to extend premium assistance for QI-1s through September 30, 2009, with estimated costs to Medicaid offset by state dollars and Medicare reimbursement. The QI-1 program covers Medicare Part B premiums for low-income beneficiaries and is seeking an extension through September 30, 2009. States are required to provide transitional medical assistance (TMA) to certain low-income families who would otherwise lose Medicaid coverage due to changes in income. This includes four months of TMA for families affected by increased child or spousal support collections or earned income. Congress expanded work-related TMA benefits in 1988, requiring states to provide at least six, and up to 12, months of TMA coverage to families losing Medicaid eligibility. The President's budget proposes extending expanded TMA requirements through September 30, 2009, costing Medicaid $35 million in FY2008, $485 million in FY2009, and $695 million over the FY2009-FY2013 period. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) established rules for employer-based health insurance plans to improve access and portability. One provision allows new enrollment outside of annual open enrollment for special reasons like exhausting COBRA coverage or gaining a new dependent. The President's budget proposes legislative changes to HIPAA, including defining Medicaid or SCHIP eligibility as a qualifying event for special enrollment into employer-based health insurance plans. This would allow beneficiaries to prove prior creditable coverage and limit pre-existing condition exclusion periods. The President's budget proposes legislative changes to HIPAA, including allowing Medicaid or SCHIP eligibility as a qualifying event for special enrollment into employer-based health insurance plans. This aims to improve coordination between Medicaid, SCHIP, and private employer-offered coverage. Additionally, SCHIP programs would be required to issue certificates of creditable coverage to recognize SCHIP coverage as prior creditable coverage under HIPAA's portability provisions. The President's budget proposes legislative changes to allow states more flexibility in determining cost effectiveness and information sharing with employers regarding Medicaid coverage for group health plans. This includes aligning Medicaid Employer-Sponsored Insurance options with open enrollment periods. The President's budget proposes legislation to extend the exemption for refugees and asylees from seven years to eight years in order to align Medicaid Employer-Sponsored Insurance options with open enrollment periods for group health coverage. This aims to streamline the implementation of these programs and generate $140 million in savings over the FY2009-FY2013 period. The President's budget proposes extending the exemption for refugees and asylees from seven years to eight years, allowing more time for citizenship process. HHS estimates the proposal would cost $32 million in FY2009 and $92 million over FY2009-FY2013. For more information, refer to CRS Reports RL31269, RL31630, and RL33809. The Medicaid LTC Insurance Partnership program allows certain individuals with private LTC insurance policies to qualify for Medicaid coverage without meeting the same means-testing requirements. States may disregard assets of the Medicaid applicant if payments have been made under a LTC insurance policy. Inflation protection standards require compound inflation for policies purchased by individuals younger than age 61. The LTC insurance policy must provide inflation protection based on the age of the purchaser. Some policies offer a Future Purchase Option for increasing benefits without new underwriting. The President's proposal aims to prohibit LTC insurance policies with Future Purchase Option inflation protection. The LTC insurance policies with Future Purchase Option inflation protection may not qualify as state-approved LTC Partnership policies. HHS estimates no cost to Medicaid for this administrative change in FY2009-FY2013. Medicaid program requirements can be waived by the Secretary of HHS under Section 1915(b) of the Social Security Act. For more information on the Medicaid LTC insurance program, refer to CRS Report RL33251 and CRS Report RL32610. The President's budget proposes clarifying which additional services may be provided under Section 1915(b)(3) using cost savings from waiver programs, aiming to generate $100 million in savings in FY2009 and $800 million over FY2009-2013. States can use managed care savings to offer extra health-related services to Medicaid beneficiaries under Section 1915(b)(3) waivers. These waiver programs are approved for two years and must be cost-effective. The President's budget proposes generating savings from waiver programs to offer additional services under Section 1915(b)(3), aiming for $100 million in FY2009 and $800 million over FY2009-2013. Medicaid pays for covered benefits but is limited by third party payer and \"free care\" rules, which restrict liability. Medicaid must pay only the remaining costs after other coverage is considered, and cannot pay for services available without charge. Both the Clinton and Bush Administrations provided guidance on these payment principles. The Bush Administration provided guidance on payment principles for school-based services, stating that services are not considered \"free\" if certain conditions are met. Providers must establish a fee schedule, determine third-party liability, and bill accordingly. Exceptions include services for children with IEPs or IFSPs under IDEA, Medicaid-covered services for Title V and WIC beneficiaries. The Administration proposes to codify the Medicaid \"free care\" policy, where providers cannot bill Medicaid for services provided to the public and other payers at no cost. This regulation would not have a cost impact in FY2009 or over the five-year budget forecast period. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established SCHIP, allowing states to cover low-income children above Medicaid eligibility levels. The SCHIP program, established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, provides health insurance for low-income children above Medicaid eligibility levels. States have options to enroll children in Medicaid, create a separate program, or use a combination of both. Nearly $40 billion was appropriated for SCHIP from FY1998 to FY2007. State allotments are based on the number of low-income children and uninsured children, adjusted by a health cost factor. In FY2008, there were four continuing resolutions for SCHIP appropriations until December 31, 2007. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 addressed SCHIP allotments for FY2008. The Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 appropriated funds to ensure states did not exhaust their federal SCHIP program funds before March 31, 2009. States with SCHIP programs receive federal reimbursement up to a cap, known as the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP), which is higher than Medicaid. States have three years to spend their annual allotment. The President's FY2009 Budget proposes increasing SCHIP state allotments by $19.7 billion through FY2013, in addition to the baseline $5 billion per year. States have three years to spend their annual allotment, with unspent funds reallocated among states based on specific rules. Some states have faced SCHIP fund shortfalls, exhausting all available federal funds by the end of a fiscal year. The Administration's proposed SCHIP budget targets children and pregnant women with family incomes under 200% of the FPL, with a \"hard cap\" set at 250% FPL. The plan includes enhanced matching rates for children below 250% FPL, with no new enrollments allowed above this threshold. Existing SCHIP enrollees above 250% FPL would be grandfathered in. Under the SCHIP budget proposal, children in higher-income families above 250% FPL would be subject to a new \"hard cap\" based on gross family income after a year off SCHIP. HHS plans to prevent SCHIP substitution for private insurance with a \"crowd-out\" policy applying to states exceeding 200% FPL for eligibility. States must have crowd-out strategies in place or face penalties for non-compliance. The August 17 letter outlines requirements for states with SCHIP income eligibility thresholds above 200% FPL. States must enroll 95% of Medicaid- and SCHIP-eligible children below 200% FPL or face penalties. Non-compliance results in a reduction in federal matching rate, capped at 5 percentage points. States meeting the enrollment target can expand their SCHIP income eligibility threshold to 250% FPL. Additionally, adults will transition out of SCHIP into Medicaid by December 31, 2008. The administration proposes transitioning adults out of SCHIP into Medicaid by December 31, 2008. A new allotment distribution formula will prioritize enrolling children in families with income under 200% FPL. HHS estimates the proposal will increase SCHIP outlays by $2.1 billion in FY2009 and $18.7 billion over FY2009-FY2013, and increase Medicaid outlays by $130 million in FY2009 and $235 million over FY2009-FY2013. Annual outreach grants of $50 million in FY2009 and $100 million in FY2010-FY2013 will help enroll uninsured children eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP. The House and Senate adopted their respective budget resolutions for FY2009 in March of 2008, with a conference agreement on the budget adopted in May. The budget resolution includes a trigger mechanism for bills that reduce revenue below CBO's baseline over five years. It establishes spending and revenue targets for discretionary spending and provides a framework for developing 12 annual appropriations bills to fund FY2009 federal programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $153.1 billion budget for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Social Security Administration. The Labor-HHS appropriations bill included an amendment regarding SCHIP requirements for children in families with incomes over 250% of the FPL. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 70) on March 3, 2008, which included provisions for Medicaid and SCHIP. It reserved funding for SCHIP reauthorization and imposed moratoria on federal rules for Medicaid and SCHIP programs. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 70) on March 3, 2008, which included provisions for Medicaid and SCHIP. It reserved funding for SCHIP reauthorization and imposed moratoria on federal rules for Medicaid and SCHIP programs. The curr_chunk discusses improvements in health, including making health insurance coverage more affordable, improving access to pediatric dental care for low-income families, and a pilot project on LTC provider background checks. It also mentions creating state internet sites for the disclosure of Medicaid payments. The House Budget Committee reported a budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 312) on March 7, which included provisions for Medicaid and SCHIP. It would authorize state internet sites for Medicaid payment disclosure and provide demonstration waivers for low-income individuals with HIV. The budget resolution contained deficit-neutral provisions for SCHIP reauthorization and incentives for health care quality and efficiency. The House budget resolution includes provisions for health care quality and efficiency, such as incentives for information technology and electronic prescribing. It also addresses mental health parity, Medicaid regulations, program integrity, and funding for health care fraud and abuse control. Sense of the House provisions highlight the need to reduce health care waste. The House and Senate filed a conference agreement on the budget resolution, including provisions for health care waste reduction, fraud, and abuse control, as well as funding for affordable health insurance coverage. Medicaid provisions in the agreement include a reserve fund for SCHIP reauthorization and deficit-neutral funds for various healthcare initiatives. The conference agreement includes provisions for increasing access to pediatric dental care, extending transitional medical assistance, health information technology, comparative effectiveness research, mental health insurance parity, providing quality health insurance for uninsured individuals, and using Medicare data to evaluate healthcare issues. Up to $198 million in funding could be appropriated for the health care fraud and abuse control program. The Medicaid and SCHIP programs are not controlled through annual appropriations. Medicaid's spending is based on benefit and eligibility criteria, while SCHIP has capped federal spending. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 provides SCHIP allotments through March 31. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA, P.L. 110-173) provides funding for SCHIP through FY2013. Congress can influence Medicaid and SCHIP spending through appropriations by restricting funds for specific activities. A bill, Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008 (H.R. 5613), proposes a one-year moratorium on seven Medicaid regulations. The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted to send H.R. 5613, proposing a one-year moratorium on seven Medicaid regulations, to the full House. The bill requires the Secretary to submit a report addressing specific problems the regulations aim to correct, how they will address these issues, and the legal authority for the regulations. Additionally, an independent contractor will prepare a comprehensive report to be submitted to relevant committees by March 1, 2009. The Senate introduced a similar measure to H.R. 5613, the Economic Recovery in Health Care Act of 2008 (S. 2819), which includes a moratorium on seven Medicaid regulations until April 1, 2009. S. 2819 also includes moratoriums on two additional Medicaid issues, one of which suspends guidance limiting states' ability to expand SCHIP coverage. The Senate passed the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 (H.R. 2642) on May 22, 2008, which included a moratorium on six Medicaid regulations until April 1, 2009. The House also passed an amended version of H.R. 2642 on June 19, 2008, giving expanded authority to the Secretary of HHS to review DAB decisions involving disagreements between the federal government and states. The Senate passed H.R. 2642 on June 26, 2008, and the President signed it into law on June 30, 2008. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (S. 3101) introduced new requirements for Medicare Advantage plans serving Medicaid beneficiaries. S. 3101 introduces new requirements for Medicare Advantage plans serving Medicaid beneficiaries, including quality monitoring, reporting, and extension of transitional medical assistance and abstinence education programs. It also addresses administrative review of federal financial participation disallowances under Medicaid and retains federal upper payment formulas for certain drugs. S. 3118 would address Medicare Advantage SNPs, following CMS regulations, removing a moratorium on SNPs, extending transitional medical assistance and abstinence education programs, and special DSH allotment arrangements for Tennessee and Hawaii. It also includes requirements for states to verify assets for Medicaid eligibility, reduce administrative payments, and limit inpatient hospital payment rates under certain conditions."
