    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Aviation Capacity Expansion Act\" and includes findings related to aviation. The National Aviation Capacity Expansion Act recognizes the crucial role of Chicago O'Hare International Airport in the national air transportation system. Efficient operations at O'Hare are vital for interstate air transportation across many states. O'Hare requires a design with multiple parallel runways to fulfill its role effectively. The Federal Government supports local decisions on new runway construction projects through programs like the Airport Improvement Program. It is crucial for the government to facilitate the redesign of O'Hare Airport and the development of a supplemental air carrier airport near Peotone, Illinois, as determined by the Governor of Illinois and the Mayor of Chicago. On December 5, 2001, an agreement was signed to modernize O'Hare International Airport, including east-west parallel runways, a south suburban airport near Peotone, addressing traffic congestion, maintaining Chicago Meigs Field, and preserving the quality of life for residents. Additionally, the importance of increasing commercial air service at Gary-Chicago and Greater Rockford Airports was recognized. The agreement signed in 2001 aimed to modernize O'Hare International Airport, including redesigning the airport. The policy of Congress requires the redesign and reconstruction of Chicago O'Hare International Airport and the development of a south suburban airport to improve the national air transportation system. The Federal Aviation Administration will facilitate the approval and implementation of the runway redesign plan upon Chicago's application for an airport layout plan. The implementation of the runway redesign plan for Chicago O'Hare International Airport and the development of a south suburban airport in Illinois are subject to federal environmental laws and criteria set by the Federal Aviation Administration. The State is prohibited from enacting laws related to this matter. The State is prohibited from enacting laws that interfere with Federal policy regarding the runway redesign plan for Chicago O'Hare International Airport and the south suburban airport in Illinois. Environmental reviews and approvals related to the plan must be expedited according to Federal law. The runway redesign plan at O'Hare Airport must comply with the Clean Air Act, and the EPA will revise the implementation plan if necessary. The plan includes 6 parallel runways oriented east-west for safe aircraft arrivals. The term \"south suburban airport\" refers to an additional air carrier airport near Peotone, Illinois. Approval for a runway redesign plan must not begin construction before January 1, 2011, if the runway is located more than 2500 feet south of existing runway 9R-27L. The Administrator will not approve the construction of runway 9R-27L before January 1, 2011. Chicago's airport layout plan must include public roadway access through the western boundary of O'Hare to passenger terminal and parking facilities, with construction costs covered by airport revenues. Approval of the runway redesign plan requires Chicago to provide acoustical treatment for single-family houses and schools within the 65 DNL noise contour for each construction phase, following FAA guidelines. The Administrator must approve Chicago's airport layout plan, including the runway redesign plan, ensuring that noise impact from aircraft operations at O'Hare is reduced compared to 2000 levels. The determination will be made using procedures specified in part 150 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations. The Federal Regulations require the Administrator to determine noise impact in terms of square miles and number of houses/schools exposed to 65 decibels or more using the DNL metric. The condition is enforceable by the Administrator using approved noise mitigation measures. Additionally, the Administrator will prioritize a letter of intent application for South Suburban Airport Federal Funding. The Administrator will prioritize a letter of intent application from the State of Illinois or a political subdivision for the construction of the south suburban airport within 90 days of final airport layout plan approval. Federal construction of the runway redesign plan will be initiated if construction does not begin by a specified date and Chicago agrees to it. Chicago must agree in writing to the construction of the runway redesign plan as a Federal project, enter into an agreement to protect the interests of the United States Government, and provide necessary land and property without cost to the government. The Administrator may make an agreement with the City. The Administrator may enter into an agreement with the City of Chicago for the runway redesign plan, acquiring necessary land and property in the name of the United States. Airport grant funds for Chicago O'Hare International Airport will be withheld until certain conditions are met until January 1, 2026. Chicago must meet certain conditions for the operation of Meigs Field, including providing all necessary services and maintaining the airport in good condition for public use from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 7 days a week. Chicago is required to provide all services at Meigs Field from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 7 days a week, including police and fire protection, tie-down, terminal, refueling, and repair services at actual costs. Grant funds cannot be withheld after January 1, 2006, unless it creates an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. If Meigs Field closes for reasons beyond Chicago's control, grant funds cannot be withheld. If Meigs Field closes for reasons beyond Chicago's control, the Administrator shall not enforce certain conditions. The State of Illinois can authorize the closure of Meigs Field. Net operating losses can be paid by the 2 air carriers at O'Hare International Airport. The City of Chicago can use airport revenues from O'Hare International Airport to fund Meigs Field's operation. Judicial Review: Orders issued by the FAA Administrator under this section are considered orders under title 49, United States Code, and will be reviewed according to specified procedures."
