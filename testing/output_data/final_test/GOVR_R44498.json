    "content": "The EELV program is facing challenges due to high launch costs, procurement concerns, competition, and reliance on Russian rocket engines. Congress has taken legislative action to address cost increases and legal challenges, with efforts by the Obama Administration and the Air Force deemed insufficient. The EELV program, initiated by the Air Force in 1994, aimed to provide affordable, reliable access to space. It evolved over the years to support National Security Space missions. The current EELV acquisition strategy was approved in 2011 and revised in 2013 to sustain two rocket-powered families. The EELV program, initiated by the Air Force in 1994, aimed to provide affordable, reliable access to space. The current strategy, approved in 2011 and revised in 2013, includes sustaining two major rocket-powered launch families, licensing the Russian-made RD-180 engine, pursuing block-buy commitments, and increasing competition to reduce launch costs. The program consists of two launch vehicle families, Atlas V and Delta IV, provided by United Launch Alliance. Some view the strategy as successful in reducing costs and ensuring reliable access to space, while others argue it is too costly and not competitive enough. The Atlas V and Delta IV, provided by United Launch Alliance, have launched various types of satellites into orbit for the Air Force, Navy, and National Reconnaissance Office. The Atlas V has launched commercial, civil, and military satellites, including the X-37B space plane, while the Delta IV has launched communication, weather, and reconnaissance satellites. United Launch Alliance was formed in 2006 as a joint venture between The Boeing Company. United Launch Alliance (ULA) was formed in 2006 as a joint venture between The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin. ULA operates five space launch complexes in Florida and California. The EELV program is managed by the Launch and Range Systems Directorate of the Space and Missile Systems Center. SpaceX is now certified to launch National Security Space (NSS) missions. SpaceX, a new player in the NSS launch community, is certified to provide NSS space launches and aims to enhance its launch capability with the Falcon Heavy. In the early 1990s, the U.S. space industry supported various launch vehicles, but faced increasing costs and operational issues. Congress directed DOD to develop a Space Launch Modernization Plan in 1994 to address these challenges. The Space Launch Modernization Plan (SLMP) recommended the EELV program to modernize space launch capabilities for the Department of Defense. The program aimed to reduce costs by 25%, ensure 98% launch vehicle design reliability, and standardize launch pads and interfaces. Congress supported these recommendations through the FY1995 NDAA, directing DOD to develop a new space launch vehicle strategy and allocate funds for reusable rocket technology and expendable launch vehicle development. The EELV program was initiated in 1994 with a competitive down-select to a single launch provider. Lockheed Martin and McDonnell Douglas were initially selected, but when Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997, Boeing took over the contract. The Air Force later revised the strategy to sustain two EELV providers, emphasizing competition between Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The EELV program initially aimed for competition between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, but the anticipated robust commercial market did not materialize. This led to increased prices for future contracts and program costs. Despite this, maintaining two launch providers provided DOD with confidence in assured access to space until a series of space launch failures in the late 1990s, including the loss of three national security satellites costing over $3 billion. The late 1990s saw the loss of three national security satellites costing over $3 billion, including a critical communications satellite (MILSTAR), an NRO reconnaissance satellite, and a DSP satellite. These failures influenced the transition to EELV launches and led to a review by President Clinton for necessary changes. The subsequent Broad Area Review (BAR) recommended increased contractor and government oversight in the EELV program to improve launch success. This led to higher costs but also significant improvements in reliability. Turmoil in the Air Force space community and among launch service providers in the early 2000s was driven by competition, cost increases, and the need for reliable access to space. The U.S. government stepped in to cover fixed costs for Lockheed and Boeing in the space launch market due to poor business prospects. The 2004 National Security Policy Directive (NSPD)-40 established the need for \"assured access to space,\" requiring DOD to fund annual fixed launch costs until they could certify this access without two providers. This was in response to the collapse of the commercial launch market and threats to the space industrial base. The 2004 National Security Policy Directive (NSPD)-40 established the need for \"assured access to space,\" requiring DOD to fund annual fixed launch costs until they could certify this access without two providers. In 2006, The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin announced plans to consolidate their launch operations into a joint venture\u2014ULA, which provided significant benefits that outweighed the loss of competition. Since then, the Air Force has procured EELV launches from ULA on a sole-source basis. Since 2006, the Air Force has procured EELV launches from ULA on a sole-source basis. By 2010, DOD officials predicted unsustainable cost increases in the EELV program due to instabilities in the launch industrial base and inefficient buying practices. In response, DOD reorganized its acquisition of launch services, leading to a new EELV acquisition strategy in November 2011. This strategy advocated for a steady launch vehicle production rate to stabilize the space launch industrial base. The new EELV acquisition strategy aimed to stabilize the space launch industrial base by renewing competition and obtaining insight into ULA program costs. DOD signed a contract modification in December 2013 committing to buy 35 launch vehicle booster cores over five years to negotiate better launch prices. The DOD signed a contract modification in December 2013 to negotiate better launch prices through improved knowledge of ULA contractor costs. Some disputed the DOD's estimates of cost savings, leading to the decision to open up to 14 additional NSS launches to broader competition. However, the number of EELV launches open to competition was reduced from 14 to 7 in the FY2015 budget request. This decision was influenced by the Nunn-McCurdy cost breach and perceived instabilities in the EELV acquisition strategy. The EELV acquisition strategy involved three phases: Phase 1 (FY2013-FY2019) included a sole-source block-buy from ULA for up to 36 cores and seven years of NSS launch infrastructure. Phase 1a (FY2015-FY2017) allowed competition for NSS launches to new entrants like SpaceX. Phase 2 (FY2018-FY2022) aimed for full competition among all providers, while Phase 3 (FY2023-FY2030) envisioned full competition with any certified provider. The strategy aims to maintain assured access to space and introduce competition. The Air Force views the transition off the RD-180 engine as a notable challenge due to legislative restrictions, creating uncertainty in the EELV acquisition strategy. In March 2012, the EELV program reported two critical Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breaches, leading to a reassessment. The program's cost was estimated at $69.6 billion in March 2013, a significant increase from the previous year. Causes for this cost growth included extending the program's life cycle, increasing the number of launch vehicles, unstable demand for launch services, and industrial base instability. The EELV program experienced a significant increase in estimated costs due to various factors, including extending the program's life cycle and industrial base instability. SpaceX and others criticized ULA's launch costs as being higher than what SpaceX would charge once certified by the Air Force for NSS launches. Detailed cost data are proprietary and not easily comparable, making it challenging to assess these claims. The Air Force, GAO, ULA, and SpaceX have provided launch cost data, but it is not directly comparable due to different cost model assumptions. SpaceX's cost figures for NSS launches lack a long history of actual cost data. Reliable and consistent cost data for comparison has been a frustration for many in Congress. The licensing of the Russian RD-180 engine for the Atlas V was driven by concerns after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The U.S. had concerns about Russian missile expertise being shared with hostile countries, leading to a partnership to acquire Russia's rocket engine capabilities. Initially, a license agreement was made for co-production of the RD-180 engine, later changed to stockpiling engines for the Atlas V. Congress expressed worry about reliance on a single Russian component in the EELV program. The vulnerability of the EELV program to reliance on a single critical Russian component, specifically the RD-180 engines in the Atlas V common core, has been a major policy concern highlighted in various defense authorization acts and studies. Congress has directed the DOD to assess the national security implications of continuing to use foreign components and propulsion systems in the program. After Russian incursions in Ukraine triggered U.S. sanctions in 2014, concerns over the vulnerability of the EELV program heightened. Sanctions led to Russian backlash, with Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin threatening to withhold RD-180 rocket engines unless guarantees were made for civilian use only. This prompted a need for change in the EELV acquisition strategy. Many in the United States were concerned about Russia potentially banning exports of the RD-180 engine to the U.S., prompting efforts to end reliance on it. Congress has taken steps to develop a domestic alternative, but some are not satisfied with the pace of the Air Force's efforts. The Air Force faces challenges in transitioning away from the RD-180 engine and towards a competitive launch market. SpaceX has raised concerns about lack of competition in the EELV program and has filed lawsuits against the Air Force. In 2014, SpaceX sued the Air Force over a sole-source contract with ULA for launch cores. A federal court questioned ULA's use of Russian-made RD-180 engines but later lifted the injunction. SpaceX alleged the Air Force did not provide proper pricing data and may have favored ULA. The Air Force requested the court dismiss the suit, arguing SpaceX lost its right to protest the contract award. The Air Force argued that SpaceX had not completed necessary certifying flights for its Falcon 9 at the time of the contract award, raising concerns about meeting requirements. Congressional debates ensued, and in 2014, experts discussed options for dealing with potential loss of Russian RD-180 engines in the EELV program. The Mitchell Commission recommended accelerating RD-180 buys to preserve schedules and promote competition, while also suggesting development of a new U.S. liquid rocket engine. The U.S. is investing $141 million to develop a new liquid rocket engine by 2022 to replace the RD-180. Congress supports maintaining current space access capabilities while transitioning to a domestic-produced engine. The FY2016 NDAA allowed ULA to use up to nine RD-180 engines for national security launches to ensure competition in the market during the transition period. The FY2016 NDAA allowed ULA to use up to nine RD-180 engines for national security launches, potentially enabling ULA to compete for competitive launches regardless of engine country of origin. This could include ULA's competition for up to two national security launch contracts before the end of the fiscal year. If Congress does not adopt a new appropriations measure, the terms of the most recent measure may be carried over. SpaceX is certified to launch into four of the eight NSS orbits using its Falcon 9 launch vehicle. The company plans to launch the Falcon Heavy later. SpaceX plans to launch the Falcon Heavy in 2016 to compete for NSS mission orbits. ULA is the only company with certified launch capability for NSS payloads, retiring the Delta IV Medium in 2016 to focus on developing the Vulcan launch vehicle. ULA signed contracts with U.S. rocket engine manufacturers for next-generation engine concepts. ULA is working on high fidelity plans to meet aggressive cost targets for a first launch by 2019. They have partnered with Blue Origin for the BE-4 engine and are also assisting Aerojet Rocketdyne with the AR-1 engine development. The AR-1 could be ready for a first flight on the ULA Vulcan about a year after the BE-4 Vulcan first flight in late 2019. Efforts are being made to transition away from the RD-180 engine to a domestic U.S. alternative for the ULA Vulcan launch vehicle. There are risks involved in this transition, including technical, program, and schedule challenges. If certain factors align in a worst-case scenario, the United States could face a situation where some national security space payloads may not have a certified launcher available. The transition away from the RD-180 engine for the ULA Vulcan launch vehicle faces challenges such as certification issues with alternative engines like the AR-1 and BE-4. Replicating the RD-180's performance and reliability record may not be achieved until well beyond 2030."
