    "content": "The \"Border Tax Equity Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings and declarations of policy are outlined in Section 2. The United States relies on direct taxes while many countries use value-added taxes (VAT) in addition to direct taxes. The average worldwide VAT tax in 2005 was 15.7%, with the EU countries ranging from 15 to 25%. Direct taxes like corporate income taxes rebated upon export are considered export subsidies under WTO rules, while indirect taxes like sales taxes and VAT can be rebated without being seen as subsidies. The WTO rules do not address subsidies for trade in services. Some countries impose taxes on imported services but exempt or refund taxes on exported services, disadvantaging US service providers. This disparate treatment of border taxes harms US agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers by acting as export subsidies for foreign exporters and subjecting US exporters to double taxation. The disparate treatment of border taxes results in a significant monetary disadvantage for United States exporters, estimated at $93 billion on goods and $47 billion on services. Foreign countries remitting VAT equates to export subsidies of approximately $201 billion on goods and $38 billion on services exported to the United States. This results in a total artificial disadvantage of up to $294 billion on trade in goods and $85 billion on trade in services for US producers. United States businesses have been complaining about border tax inequity for over 40 years. Since 1968, US Administrations and Congresses have tried to address border tax inequity. Congress has recognized the prejudicial effect of different treatment of border taxes on goods and directed the US to seek a negotiated solution through various acts like the Trade Act of 1974 and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Congress has recognized the prejudicial effect of different treatment of border taxes on goods and directed the US to seek a negotiated solution through various acts. The Competitiveness Act of 1988 and the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 aim to revise WTO rules regarding border taxes to address economic distortions and promote balanced trade relations. Congress emphasizes the need to address border taxes in WTO negotiations to rectify trade imbalances faced by US agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers if negotiations fail. Legislation may be necessary if WTO negotiations do not achieve the desired revisions to WTO rules on border taxes. Congress emphasizes the need for WTO negotiations to revise rules on border taxes to address trade imbalances for US agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers. Legislation may be required if negotiations do not succeed in achieving desired revisions. The United States Trade Representative must report to Congress within 60 days of WTO negotiations completion, certifying if U.S. trade objectives on border tax treatment have been met. Objectives include revising WTO rules on border adjustments for internal taxes to address disadvantages for countries relying on direct taxes. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 addresses the elimination of trade disadvantages in services related to direct and indirect taxes. It also calls for the revision of WTO rules to prevent differing treatment of border adjustments based on tax nature. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 aims to address trade disadvantages in services related to taxes, including border tax treatment negotiations in the WTO. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 addresses trade disadvantages in services related to taxes, including border tax treatment negotiations in the WTO. Subchapter G of the Internal Revenue Code introduces a tax on imports from foreign countries with an indirect tax system. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 introduces a tax on imports from foreign countries with an indirect tax system. The tax is imposed on imported goods or services based on the difference between rebated indirect taxes and those imposed at the US border. Importers are liable for paying the tax at the time of entry. The tax on imports is imposed at the time of entry and applies during a specific period until trade negotiating goals are met. The tax is collected by Customs and Border Protection and deposited into a special account for payments to qualified US exporters. Definitions include the Secretary of Homeland Security and the term 'importer'. The term 'importer' is defined as one eligible to file customs entry documentation for goods or the importer of services. The term 'time of entry' refers to the specified time for imports of goods. The regulations (19 C.F.R. 141.68) specify the time for imports of goods and services. A foreign country with an indirect tax system grants rebates on indirect taxes paid on exported goods or services, including value-added taxes (VAT). The curr_chunk discusses the imposition of a tax by the exporting country on the value added to goods and services in that country. This tax is also known as a goods and services tax (GST). The Secretary may establish rules and regulations to implement this tax. SEC. 314 of the Tariff Act of 1930 addresses payments to U.S. exporters to counteract discriminatory border taxes imposed by importing countries. SEC. 314 of the Tariff Act of 1930 allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to pay U.S. exporters the amount of indirect taxes imposed by importing countries, minus any U.S. taxes paid on the goods or services exported. The Tariff Act of 1930 allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to reimburse U.S. exporters for indirect taxes paid to importing countries. Payments must be made from a special account and additional funds can be appropriated if needed. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to prescribe rules and regulations for reimbursing U.S. exporters for indirect taxes paid to importing countries. Payments must be made from a special account, and additional funds can be appropriated if necessary. The requirement for payments applies until U.S. trade negotiating goals regarding border tax treatment are met. The country employs an indirect tax system and imposes indirect taxes on imports of goods or services at the border. Value-added taxes (VAT) are a type of indirect general consumption tax levied on the value added to goods and services at multiple stages of the production and supply chain. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATES. If the United States Trade Representative fails to certify to Congress that trade negotiating objectives regarding border tax treatment have been met, specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code and the Tariff Act will take effect after certain timeframes. If the United States Trade Representative does not certify to Congress by January 1, 2008, that trade negotiating objectives on border tax treatment have been met, section 314 of the Tariff Act of 1930 will apply to exports of services from the United States. Appropriations will be made as necessary for payments related to these exports. The Tariff Act of 1930 will apply to exports of services from the United States until the special account under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is established and funded adequately."
