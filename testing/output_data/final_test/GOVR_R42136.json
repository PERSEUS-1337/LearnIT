    "content": "Since 1917, the United States military has researched and used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones or pilotless aircraft. The Department of Defense defines UAVs as powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. UAVs are often combined with ground control stations and data links to form UAS, or unmanned aerial systems. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, can be used as a single air vehicle or as part of a UAV system (UAS) with multiple air vehicles, a ground control station, and support equipment. The United States first tested UAS during World War I but did not use them in combat until the Vietnam War. The versatility of UAS is exemplified by the AQM-34 Firebee, which was initially used as a target in the 1950s, then as an intelligence-collection drone in the 1960s, and later modified to deliver payloads and used as an armed UAV in 2002. UAS have been used in military conflicts such as Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, showcasing both advantages and disadvantages of unmanned aircraft. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, offer advantages over manned aircraft such as eliminating pilot risk and having aeronautical capabilities not limited by humans. They can perform dull, dirty, or dangerous missions without risking pilot lives and may be cheaper to operate. However, they have a higher crash risk and face complications when sharing airspace with manned assets. Advanced technologies have increased their use in various military conflicts. The advancement in military communications satellite bandwidth has made remote operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) more practical. The demand for UAVs increased due to the nature of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where persistent surveillance and prompt strike capability were needed. Israel's successful use of UAVs in 1982 operations in Lebanon led to the U.S. increasing funding for UAV capabilities. The U.S. increased funding for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) as they transitioned from experimental projects to acquisition programs. The Gulf War demonstrated the value of UAS, with platforms like the Pioneer providing intelligence for Navy battleships. The Air Force's Predator quickly added new capabilities and was used for surveillance missions in conflicts like the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The Global Hawk and armed reconnaissance missions further showcased the growing support for UAS. Congress has increased investment in unmanned aerial vehicles annually, with DOD requesting $3.9 billion for UAS procurement and development in FY2012. DOD's inventory of unmanned aircraft grew significantly from 2002 to 2010. UAS research and development funding has also increased due to the industry's growth and advancements in technology. Congress has shown strong support for UAS development, aiming to make one-third of the operational deep strike force fleet unmanned. Congress has directed the formation of joint program offices for commonality among UAS programs and required DOD to submit a UAS roadmap. Congress has encouraged DOD to speed up UAS acquisition and capabilities, including weaponizing the Predator and Hunter aircraft. UAS capabilities extend beyond the military, with the Department of Homeland Security also using them for missions. The Department of Homeland Security operates UAS for border patrol, raising legal issues for Congress. Unmanned systems are highly desired in the military for their versatility and persistence in tasks like surveillance and target designation, reducing risks for warfighters. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide intelligence, command and control, targeting, and weapons delivery capabilities, improving situational awareness and reducing risks in combat. They are favored for reducing risks to troops, cost efficiency, and conducting missions in high-risk areas. The number of UAS platforms is expected to increase significantly by FY 2021. Some military personnel highlight the cost savings of UAS compared to manned platforms, although the Congressional Budget Office warns against assuming significant savings. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) offer cost savings compared to manned platforms, but the Congressional Budget Office warns that savings are not guaranteed. While UAS are initially envisioned as low-cost, the high cost of advanced sensors and potential losses of aircraft can offset these advantages. UAS have a history of being used for intelligence gathering, reconnaissance, and observing opposing forces beyond direct line of sight. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have evolved from being used for intelligence gathering and reconnaissance to carrying precision-guided weapons for ground attacks. Some UAS are now being weaponized for combat missions, while others, like unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), are designed specifically for combat with greater payload, speed, and stealth capabilities. The Navy is exploring UAS for delivering cargo to ships at sea, and the Marine Corps is testing UAS for resupplying units in Afghanistan. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded contracts to two firms to demonstrate how UAS could resupply units in Afghanistan and locate personnel behind enemy lines. Research is ongoing to develop unmanned systems for aerial refueling tasks currently performed by tanker aircraft. In July 2010, a contract was awarded to demonstrate refueling by Global Hawk UAVs, with a successful test in March 2011 showing the Global Hawk's ability to receive refueling autonomously. The ability of current UAVs to fly missions analogous to aerial refueling missions has been demonstrated, with potential for UAVs to refuel manned aircraft. Future tasks could include air-to-air combat, with UCAVs being designed for air superiority missions. DOD is experimenting with outfitting UAVs with sensors and weapons for such missions, with reports of a Predator engaging in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft. UAS like the X-47B, Avenger, and Phantom Ray are not designed for air-to-air combat but are expected to perform various missions currently done by manned aircraft. Advances in technology have enabled UAS to undertake a wide range of missions, leading to ongoing innovation in their design and operation. This evolution is comparable to the rapid advancements seen in military aircraft during the 1930s and 1940s and the early Jet Age. The period of UAS innovation has coincided with ongoing U.S. combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, leading to a high demand for UAS capabilities in the field. Urgent-needs funding has allowed commanders to deploy new UAS directly to the field without lengthy procurement processes, resulting in the acquisition of multiple systems without efforts to reduce their number or consolidate functions across services. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is concerned about the Army and Air Force developing different sensor payloads for Sky Warrior and Predator when a common payload could be achieved. The Army believes a fully common solution is not warranted due to cost and capabilities differences. Different sensors can be installed on a common airframe to serve multiple service requirements. The General Atomics I-GNAT developed into the Air Force Predator and Reaper, serving as the basis for the Army Gray Eagle. The development of various unmanned aerial systems (UAS) like the Air Force Predator, Reaper, Army Gray Eagle, and DHS's Predator optimized for marine environments, along with Northrop Grumman's Air Force Global Hawk becoming the Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) system, shows a trend towards jointness in UAS development. The creation of a UAS Task Force in 2007 aimed to coordinate UAS requirements among services and prioritize joint acquisition programs. The UAS Task Force was created in 2007 to coordinate UAS requirements among services and prioritize joint acquisition programs. The development of UAS in DOD is federated, with individual military services carrying out programs ranging from combat tested to not yet tested systems. Sizes and ranges of UAVs vary greatly, from the 8-inch-long Wasp Micro UAV to the 44-foot-long Global Hawk. The UAS Task Force was established in 2007 to coordinate UAS requirements across services and prioritize joint acquisition programs. The DOD's UAV inventory has significantly increased to 7454 UAVs, including second-generation derivatives like Predator B and BAMS, with expanded mission capabilities beyond ISR applications. This growth is driven by the demand for UAVs in various roles such as strike capability, mine detection, border patrol, medical resupply, and force perimeter protection. The comparison between manned and unmanned aircraft inventories shows a shift towards unmanned aircraft, with UAS taking on a more prominent role due to user demand and budgetary support. Congressional support for UAS acquisition has increased, with a goal set for one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft to be unmanned within ten years. The Fiscal 2007 Defense Authorization Act mandated the development of a policy for unmanned systems in the Department of Defense, prioritizing unmanned systems in acquisition programs unless a manned system is necessary. This changed the default assumption for new systems to favor unmanned systems for military tasks. The congressional task is to assess the effectiveness of DOD's administrative processes in UAS development and acquisition. Centralization of UAS acquisition authority is debated to prevent duplication of effort, but concerns about stifling competition and innovation exist. UAS are increasingly seen as a valuable asset, not just a cheaper alternative to manned aircraft. Some UAS are now comparable in cost to manned aircraft, with the Global Hawk program estimated to cost $13.9 billion for 66 aircraft. The program has faced cost overruns, triggering Nunn-McCurdy breaches, and criticism from the Air Force for higher-than-expected costs. The Global Hawk drone program by Northrop Grumman has faced criticism from the Air Force for cost overruns and inefficiencies. Factors such as requirements creep and inconsistent management practices have contributed to the higher-than-expected costs. The addition of multiple sensors and the need for larger wings and more powerful engines have driven up the program's price. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) experienced requirements creep, evolving into a costly, long-range aircraft with a heavy payload before being canceled in 2006. The management of UAS programs has seen organizational changes, from military services to a Navy-run Joint Program Office (JPO) to the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) and back to the services under OSD. DARO, established in 1993 to manage airborne reconnaissance programs, including UAS, was disbanded in 1998 due to criticism of problems, redesigns, and accidents. Since DARO's disbandment in 1998, DOD UAS efforts have lacked centralized management. General oversight authority is under OASD(C3I), while program development and acquisition are managed by the military services. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force was established in 2001 by OSD to enhance joint coordination of UAS programs. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force, established in 2001 by OSD, works to standardize payload development and promote a common vision for UAS efforts. The Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the formation of a UAS Task Force to address acquisition and management issues. The task force published UAS Roadmaps in 2001, 2002, 2005, and 2009 to help realize a common UAS vision. In April 2009, a UAS roadmap was published as part of a DOD integrated roadmap that included unmanned systems for ground and sea warfare. The GAO criticized DOD in March 2005 for lacking oversight in UAV development efforts, suggesting the need for a central authority. Reports in 2005 indicated OSD was considering appointing a service as the executive agent for UAS programs, but later DOD abandoned this idea in favor of two smaller entities. The JROC announced DOD's shift from an executive agent to two smaller organizations focusing on UAV interoperability. The Joint UAV OIPT addresses interoperability issues, while the Joint UAV Center of Excellence enhances UAS applications. In 2007, a UAS Task Force was formed to lead on acquisition and management issues. The military services, SOCOM, and the Coast Guard are developing UAS with a need for a coordinated DOD-wide investment strategy to avoid duplication and maximize resources. Congress plays a role in arbitrating between competing UAS investments and impacting DOD's investment plan. Key questions include quantifying UAS cost, balancing spending between UAS and manned aircraft, and maximizing UAS capabilities through strategic investments. When comparing UAS capabilities to other aircraft, the cost of a remotely piloted vehicle can be misleading as it requires supporting elements like a ground control station, ground crew, and communication links. Analysts need to consider the cost of these supporting elements and operational infrastructure. Monitoring UAS costs can be complicated by budgeting conventions, with different services categorizing UAS funding requests differently. The Army's procurement of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) covers a wide range of items, with costs sometimes allocated to the Intelligence budget instead of the DOD budget. Congress may need to find a balance between UAS and manned aircraft spending. By 2013, DOD is projected to have spent over $26 billion on UAS, a significant increase from previous years. Despite the growing acquisition of UAS, their funding still represents a small percentage of total military aviation funding. Despite the recent acquisition of many UAS, they only represent 8% of military aviation procurement funding. Cost savings touted by UAS advocates may be offset by expenses for ground control stations and training for UAS operators. UAS may have higher attrition and maintenance costs compared to manned aircraft, making the overall system not always less expensive. The cost of UAS operation and maintenance can be high, but ground control stations can fly multiple UAVs simultaneously, helping to balance costs. Congress has raised concerns about the overall acquisition cost of UAS compared to larger weapon systems. Sensors significantly contribute to the cost of UAS, with some sensor payloads representing a large portion of the vehicle's flyaway cost. Growing sensor costs have prompted some observers to recommend equipping UAVs with self-protection devices, suggesting those UAVs are no longer considered expendable. Two schools of thought exist for employing UAVs in ways that could help balance cost with capability. One approach is to field many smaller, less expensive, and less capable UAVs controlled through a highly interconnected communications network. The Combat System aims to connect various UAVs like the Raven, Shadow, and Fire Scout with other weapons platforms. Two approaches are considered: one advocates for multiple cheaper UAVs with a robust communications network, while the other suggests fewer, more expensive, and capable UAVs like the Global Hawk. Both approaches have faced delays and funding reductions since 2003. The Global Hawk and other UAVs have faced cost increases and funding cuts due to management and technology issues. Key areas for investment in UAS development include interoperability, reliability, force multiplication/autonomy, and engine systems. Interoperability is crucial for seamless communication between UAS and ground components to enhance mission effectiveness. The DOD is focusing on advancing the interoperability of UAS to improve situational awareness and communication between different unmanned aircraft and ground elements. This includes integrating interfaces for situational awareness, surveillance data transfer, and weapons transfer. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1815, H.Rept. 109-89) aimed to enhance inter-platform communication by requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link for real-time situational awareness and sensor data transfer. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act aimed to enhance inter-platform communication by requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with a wideband data link for real-time situational awareness and sensor data transfer. To achieve interoperability, the services and industry need to focus on the Common Data Link communications system goal and invest appropriately. The finite bandwidth available for military aircraft may limit the expansion of UAS applications, necessitating a more robust information transfer system due to the increased use of UAS in conflicts. The Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aimed to provide unlimited bandwidth for U.S. Armed Forces but was canceled in 2009. The use of more autonomous UAVs was suggested as a solution to reduce bandwidth usage, but the transmission of data from UAV sensors still drives demand. For example, a single Global Hawk requires a significant amount of bandwidth. The use of UAVs in the military, particularly during the 1991 Gulf War, has been explored as a solution to reduce bandwidth usage. One approach is to operate UAVs from a manned stand-off aircraft, reducing reliance on satellites for communication. Experimentation is ongoing, with the goal of controlling UAVs from airborne platforms. However, there have been concerns about drone accidents, with significant costs incurred for each crash. In 2004, the Defense Science Board highlighted the high UAV mishap rates and the need for reliability upgrades. The 2005 UAS Roadmap showed that UAV mishap rates were higher than manned aircraft. The accident rates for Predator and Reaper drones dropped in 2009, with the Predator rate comparable to the F-16 fighter. The Defense Science Board also noted concerns about manned aircraft safety. The Defense Science Board's 2004 study highlighted advancements in manned aircraft design that led to lower mishap rates. However, some UAS, like Predator and Global Hawk, entered combat before completing development, making it unfair to compare their mishap rates with fully developed manned aircraft. The DSB report suggests that nominal upgrades and investments could reduce UAS mishap rates. Investments in emerging technologies like self-repairing flight control systems and advanced materials will enhance reliability and survivability in adverse environments. One priority is enabling one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs simultaneously. The goal for UAS manufacturers and users is to reduce the 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and increase autonomy and interoperability so one operator can control multiple UAVs. This advancement could significantly enhance combat capability but will require time and investment in control technologies. The Global Hawk and Scan Eagle UAVs have automated flight capabilities, but their actual autonomy is debated due to operator intervention in poor weather. The OSD rates UAV autonomy on a scale of 1 to 10, with an ACL of at least 8 needed for single-pilot control. The Global Hawk's ACL is around 2.5, and efforts are being made to improve autonomy for universal development. The Department of Defense is working on \"see and avoid\" technology for UAVs to operate autonomously and avoid other aircraft, aiming to increase the standard ACL for UAS to 4. Full automation of sensor capabilities would allow one operator to control multiple drones, with the goal of having one operator manage several UAVs. The Air Force has already tested a Predator upgrade that allowed one operator to control four UAVs during a mission. The next step is to consolidate the tasks of multiple mission payload operators into one or fewer. Fuel cell technology is being developed to increase the efficiency and reduce the detectability of mid-sized UAS. The Air Force is sponsoring projects to use fuel cells in smaller UAS, with successful flight tests already conducted. Key technologies for future UAS include lightweight batteries, effective data compression tools, stealth capabilities, and collaborative technologies. Key technologies for future UAS include management/data compression tools, stealth capability, collaborative technologies, robust on-board sense and avoid technology, open architecture systems for competition, propulsion systems for greater energy efficiency, and extended loiter time for missions like Electronic Attack and directed energy. Critics argue that producing multiple UAS with similar capabilities leads to unnecessary duplication. The lack of commonality among subsystems, payloads, and ground control stations hinders efficiency. For instance, the Army developed a new sensor for the Sky Warrior instead of using the comparable one on the Air Force's Predator. Services prioritize their own requirements, leading to inefficiencies in UAS production. The services prioritize their own requirements, leading to inefficiencies in UAS production. DOD officials have not quantified the potential costs or benefits of pursuing various alternatives, including common systems. Congress and DOD have increasingly pushed for more commonality among unmanned aircraft systems to maximize acquisition resources and meet increased demand. Table 5 compares performance specifications of UAS with electro-optical and infra-red sensors, showing majority feature an endurance of 5 to 24 hours, altitude of 10,000-25,000 ft, max speeds between 105 and 125 knots, and radiuses of 100 to 150 nm. The 2011 program acquisition unit cost for the MQ-9 Reaper is $28.4 million, just over half the $55 million estimate for the F-16 Falcon. F-16 can carry approximately four times the payload of the Reaper (10,750 lbs vs. 2,500 lbs). The F-16 can carry four times the payload of the Reaper (10,750 lbs vs. 2,500 lbs) and is a versatile combat aircraft. Manned aircraft may be more cost-effective for air-to-ground combat, while UAS like the Army's Shadow are useful for delivering medical supplies. UAS are also considered for electronic attack and psychological operations. One emerging mission area for UAS is homeland defense and security. One emerging mission area for UAS is homeland defense and security, with interest growing in using UAS for various domestic roles such as law enforcement surveillance, security monitoring of hazardous cargo, measuring radiation, and searching for forest fires in sparsely populated areas. Following Hurricane Katrina, the use of UAS like Global Hawk for \"consequence management\" and relief efforts has been suggested. Countries like South Korea and Japan have utilized UAS for agricultural purposes for decades. UAS support to civil authorities, such as JTF Katrina in 2005 and U.S. Border surveillance, is expanding, necessitating routine access to national airspace. Heavier-than-air UAS may not always be the best option for these new roles, with alternatives like manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites also being considered. Some defense contractors are developing unmanned blimps that can float for months at high altitudes, carrying heavy payloads. The OSD's UAS Roadmap includes lighter-than-air blimps and aerostat platforms for various roles like border monitoring and psychological operations. These platforms offer cost-effective border surveillance but lack maneuverability compared to UAVs like the Global Hawk. Some major UAS manufacturers are exploring lighter-than-air systems for homeland security missions. Space satellites offer benefits like invulnerability to attack and advanced capabilities, but tasking them can be challenging due to limited availability and lack of loitering capability. UAVs like Global Hawk are being considered as communication relays to substitute low-orbiting satellite constellations due to high space launch costs. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is working to find common ground for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to play a role in various civilian applications. Upgrading UAS collision avoidance capabilities is seen as crucial for integrating UAS into crowded airspace. The FAA granted the Air Force a certificate of authorization for national airspace operation in August 2003, marking progress in reconciling regulatory discrepancies. The FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Working Group is collaborating with the Department of Defense to ensure safe UAS operations and flight requirements. Industry faces challenges testing new UAS due to airspace restrictions. The DOD has been a major user of UAS for wartime applications, needing access to national airspace for training and deployment. In November 2009, Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley and FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt co-moderated an industry forum on UAS in the national airspace system. Administrator Babbitt emphasized the importance of sense-and-avoid technology for UAS integration. The House passed a proposed FAA reauthorization bill in 2011 that includes a provision for the safe integration of commercial UAS into U.S. airspace. The FAA is tasked with developing a plan to integrate commercial unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) into the national airspace system by September 30, 2012. A Senate bill also requires the FAA to accelerate this integration within one year of enactment. UASs are not truly unmanned as they require a significant number of personnel to operate. The widespread deployment of UAS may impact military personnel recruitment and retention. The Air Force is addressing retention issues by offering incentives to rated pilots flying UAS. Historically, concerns have been raised about the effect of UAS fielding on recruitment and retention. The impact of DOD's UAS programs on recruitment and retention is complex. The Air Force and Navy are actively reducing uniformed personnel, so increased UAS use may not have a significant negative effect on enlistments. The qualifications required to operate UAS vary among services, with the Air Force currently requiring pilot-rated officers for Predator and Global Hawk operators. The increased use of UAS in the military may attract personnel who are not qualified to fly manned aircraft or who prefer the benefits of flying unmanned aircraft. Flying armed UAS could be more appealing to some personnel, and it may offer a compromise between the excitement of flying manned aircraft and the hardships of deployments. The Air Force believes that operating UAS from control stations is a viable option for recruitment and retention. The Air Force sees potential in using UAS from control stations in the United States to attract personnel who may not be inclined towards active duty for manned aircraft. Some UAS, like the Global Hawk, operate autonomously and do not require a pilot, unlike the Predator. The Air Force maintains that their UAS are more technologically advanced and require trained pilots for effective operation. As UAS technology advances, there may be a review of the policy requiring pilot-rated officers to operate them, potentially boosting enlistment in other specialties. The potential of UAS to boost enlistment in other specialties by offering improved force protection and CAS capabilities over manned aircraft is a key consideration. Congress faces defense industrial base issues such as dependency on foreign suppliers, government subsidies for foreign competitors, and the promotion of competition and consolidation in the defense industry. DOD's pursuit of UAS raises interrelated issues relevant to national defense. The pursuit of UAS by the DOD raises concerns about its impact on the defense industrial base, particularly in relation to manned aircraft programs. Some argue that increasing UAS acquisition could divert funds and erode technical expertise needed for manned combat aircraft. However, others believe that the industrial base is evolving towards advanced UAS production, with the F-35 likely being the last manned tactical fighter. There are differing views on the future demand for manned aircraft post-JSF timeframe. Some argue that focusing on unmanned aircraft design could lead to the loss of crucial skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft, potentially weakening U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design. However, others believe that there is commonality between manned and unmanned combat aircraft, with major defense contractors already shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Northrop Grumman are shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to compete in the market. Boeing acquired UAS maker Insitu in 2008, while Northrop Grumman Corp. created a new business unit for UAS contracts and acquired Scaled Composites in 2007 for UAS expertise. This shift is seen as a way to maintain competitiveness in the evolving landscape of warfare, where unmanned aircraft are playing a significant role. The global UAS market is growing rapidly, with projections showing a significant increase in expenditures. U.S. companies need to compete effectively to capture market share, as failure to do so may result in other countries dominating the industry. Industrial expertise in UAS challenge areas is crucial for success in this evolving market. Advances in UAS technology and their role in national security raise questions for Congress regarding funding levels and potential impacts on future DOD budgets. Concerns about controlling the spread of UAS technology to dangerous groups or countries may require a balance between supporting legitimate U.S. exports and curbing proliferation. The increased reliance on UAS raises questions about future DOD funding needs and potential choices for UAS programs. Evaluating UAS effectiveness and the pace of development and integration are key considerations for DOD and the services. The current requirement for issuing road maps every two years for DOD UAS programs is being questioned. There is a debate on whether a standard metric should be established to determine the optimal pace and if management of these programs should be centralized. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz argues for better resource utilization by avoiding duplication in depots, ground stations, and training pipelines. The need for a uniform, DOD-wide policy on who can operate UAS is also being discussed. The discussion revolves around potential changes in the operation of DOD UAS, including the use of a mix of uniformed and civilian personnel, the role of contractors, needed capabilities, technological advancements, and FAA limits on access to domestic flight facilities. The need for a uniform, DOD-wide policy on UAS operation is also highlighted. In recent years, the pace of UAS development has accelerated, and the scope of UAS missions and applications has expanded. How should these efforts be managed to be cost-efficient, effective, and interoperable? Are DOD UAS acquisition plans responsive to congressional direction? Congress may assess DOD's current UAS efforts to verify that they match up with new investment goals and strategies. UAS costs compared to manned aircraft costs are being evaluated for new investment goals and strategies. Analysts suggest that unmanned aerial platforms could potentially take over many missions currently done by manned aircraft. The program status and funding of prominent UAS programs pursued by DOD are discussed, with potential replacement of manned aircraft by unmanned aircraft in the future. The section focuses on small man-portable UAVs, which are distinct from larger UAS programs like Predator or Global Hawk. These smaller UAVs are not weaponized and are popular with ground forces but do not receive as much congressional attention. Their cost and budget documentation is not as detailed as major UAS programs. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a highly recognizable UAS with integrated surveillance and armament capabilities. It has enjoyed accelerated development schedules and increased funding, leading to the development of other related UAS. The Predator is a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS with a 27-foot length, 7-foot height, and 48-foot wingspan. The MQ-1 Predator is a UAS with a 48-foot wingspan, long thin wings, and inverted \"V\" tail. It operates at 10,000 to 15,000 feet, with a max altitude of 25,000 feet. Each vehicle can stay on station for 24 hours, over 500 nautical miles away. The Air Force operates about 175 Predators, with plans for operations at various bases. The primary function of the Predator is reconnaissance and target acquisition. The MQ-1 Predator is equipped with a 450-lb surveillance payload including electro-optical and infrared cameras, a Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) sensor ball, and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for reconnaissance and target acquisition. It also has satellite communications for beyond line-of-sight operations and the ability to carry two Hellfire missiles. The MQ-1 Predator was upgraded with anti-tank ordnance, allowing for precision attacks on time-sensitive targets. The Air Force renamed it to MQ-1 for multi-mission capabilities. The Army's MQ-1C Grey Eagle, a larger version, entered production with longer endurance. It can stay airborne for 36 hours and carry electro-optical/infrared cameras, laser designators, communications equipment, and Hellfire missiles. The MQ-1 Predator was upgraded with anti-tank ordnance, renamed to MQ-1 for multi-mission capabilities. The MQ-1C Grey Eagle is a larger version with longer endurance, carrying cameras, laser designators, communications equipment, and Hellfire missiles. The program will have 124 aircraft, including 21 attrition aircraft and 7 schoolhouse aircraft, totaling 152 aircraft. The average procurement unit cost of a Grey Eagle system is $114.1 million. The MQ-9 Reaper, General Atomics' follow-on to the MQ-1, is a medium- to high-altitude, long-endurance Predator optimized for surveillance, target acquisition, and armed engagement. The Reaper is 13 feet longer with a 16-foot-longer wingspan and features a 900 hp turboprop engine. The MQ-9 Reaper is an upgraded version of the MQ-1 Predator with a 900 hp engine, reaching a maximum altitude of 50,000 feet, a speed of 225 knots, endurance of 32 hours, and a range of 2,000 nautical miles. It can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles or a mix of other weapons. General Atomics has delivered 65 out of 399 planned Reapers, with 43 currently operational. Operated by the 17th Reconnaissance Squadron, 42nd Attack Squadron, and 29th Attack Squadron. The 29th Attack Squadron at Holloman AFB, NM operates Predator-family UAS as part of a system with four air vehicles, a ground control station, and a primary satellite link. The unit cost for one Predator system in FY2009 was $20 million, while the average procurement unit cost for a Reaper system was $26.8 million. The RQ-4 Global Hawk is the largest and most expensive UAS in operation for the Department of Defense, with diverse surveillance capabilities. Concerns have been raised about the program's cost, leading to Nunn-McCurdy breaches in 2005 and 2011. The RQ-4B Block 30 was found \"not operationally suitable\" due to low air vehicle reliability. The RQ-4 Global Hawk is a large UAS with diverse surveillance capabilities, flying at high altitudes for long durations. Originally designed to be autonomous, it now requires frequent intervention by operators. The RQ-4B model has a larger airframe than the RQ-4A, with increased length and wingspan. Northrop Grumman increased the Global Hawk's size, allowing it to carry an additional 1000 pounds of surveillance payload. The UAS provides persistent high-quality imagery valuable in surveillance and interdiction operations, with sensors including SAR, digital camera, and IR sensor. The RQ-4B model is a multi-intelligence air vehicle with expanded payload capabilities. The RQ-4B Global Hawk is equipped with an open-system architecture for carrying multiple intelligence payloads, including SIGINT and ELINT sensors. The addition of the MP-RTIP payload will enhance radar capabilities. Future plans involve hyper-spectral sensors for improved imagery precision and laser communications for expanded information transfer. The goal is to create a UAS that works with space-based sensors to prevent tactical surprises. The Global Hawk, developed by Northrop Grumman Corporation, was granted authorization to fly in U.S. civilian airspace in 2003. The Air Force planned to acquire 51 Global Hawks at a cost of $6.6 billion. As of November 2009, they had 7 RQ-4As and 3 RQ-4Bs, with 32 more authorized through FY2011. The average procurement unit cost for the Global Hawk was $140.9 million. The Global Hawk program has faced cost overruns and increased expenses, with the average procurement unit cost reaching $140.9 million. Concerns over rising costs and accusations of mismanagement have led to debates in Congress and the Pentagon. The Air Force acquisition executive expressed dissatisfaction with the program during a 2010 review. Air Force acquisition executive David Van Buren and Chief Pentagon arms buyer Ashton Carter criticized the Global Hawk program for being unaffordable and facing delays. Reduction in requested aircraft led to price increases triggering Nunn-McCurdy. Concerns were raised about service unique requirements and vendor issues affecting system commonality and interoperability. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics must certify and notify Congress by March 31, 2011, regarding the communications requirements and acquisition strategies for Global Hawk and BAMS. A report from the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center on May 20, 2011, found limitations in the Global Hawk Block 20/30 system, specifically with the EISS imagery collector and ASIP sigint collectors. The Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance system, based on the Global Hawk Block 20 airframe, faces higher unit costs due to different sensors and a smaller fleet size. The BAMS fleet, with 68 aircraft, will be the world's largest purchase of long-endurance marinized UAVs, providing persistent maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. The MQ-4C BAMS UAS supports various missions including strike, signals intelligence, and communications relay to enhance efficiency in the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force. The RQ-4 drone features sensors for worldwide coverage and maritime target detection. It will have a communications relay capability to link forces and support Navy operations at sea. Each aircraft is expected to serve for 20 years. The Administration's FY2012 budget request documents set Milestone C for BAMS in FY2013, with initial operational capability in 2016. Efforts to integrate development between Navy BAMS UAS and Global Hawk programs have been a focus. A Memorandum of Agreement was signed between the Navy and Air Force for shared basing, maintenance, and training programs. A single pilot and maintenance training program is being established at Beale AFB, Calif., for both fleets. The Fire Scout, initially designed for the Navy, was later adopted by the Army as the interim Class IV UAV. Northrop Grumman based the design on a commercial helicopter, with the RQ-8B model adding a four-blade rotor for reduced acoustic levels. The Fire Scout, based on a commercial helicopter, has autonomous flight capabilities and a surveillance payload including a laser designator, IR camera, and EO camera. Initial tests for arming the Fire Scout were conducted in 2005, with plans to add small missiles soon. Future missions may include border patrol, search and rescue, medical resupply, and submarine spotting operations. The Fire Scout program has delivered six MQ-8 air vehicles to date, with plans for a future inventory of 131 RQ-8Bs for the Navy. The Army initially intended to use the Fire Scout for its Future Combat System program but canceled its participation in 2010. The FIRE-X project, now designated MQ-8C, aims to adapt Fire Scout software and navigation systems to a full-size standard helicopter. Northrop Grumman is set to supply 28 MQ-8C Fire Scout drones to the Navy. The Navy is awarding Northrop Grumman a contract for 28 MQ-8C Fire Scout drones to be fielded by the first quarter of 2014. The Fire-X drone will have longer flight time, range, speed, and payload capacity compared to the Fire Scout. The RQ-170 Sentinel, a stealthy UAS, is classified but known to be in operation. The RQ-170 is a stealthy UAS with a wingspan of 65 feet and powered by a single jet engine. It has two sensor bays on the upper wing surface and is used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Iran claimed to possess an intact RQ-170 after it entered Iranian airspace. The RQ-170 is a low observable unmanned aircraft system developed by the Air Force for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The Army initially planned to acquire 52 Hunter integrated systems but faced program turbulence, leading to the cancellation of full-rate production of the RQ-5A in 1996. However, the Army continued to use the seven systems already produced and acquired 18 MQ-5B Hunter IIs through low-rate initial production in FY2004 and FY2005. The MQ-5B Hunter II, with longer endurance and anti-tank munitions capability, is operated by multiple Military Intelligence Battalions. The RQ-5A can fly at altitudes up to 15,000 feet, with a speed of 106 knots and 12 hours of airtime. The MQ-5B has an elongated wingspan, more powerful engine, and can stay airborne for three extra hours at altitudes of 18,000 feet. The Hunter system consists of eight aircraft, ground control systems, and support equipment. The Army expanded the Hunter's missions to include weaponization for tactical reconnaissance/strike operations with the GBU-44/B Viper Strike precision guided munition, making it the Army's first armed UAS. In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection Bureau utilized Hunter for border patrol duties. The Army halted Hunter production in 2005, with 45 UAVs still in operation as of May 2011. In 2005, the Army stopped production of the Hunter UAV. By May 2011, 45 Hunter UAVs were still operational and receiving upgrades. The Army chose General Atomics' Warrior UAS for the Extended Range-Multi Purpose UAS program over the Hunter II. The RQ-7 Shadow became the primary airborne ISR tool for Army units worldwide after being selected for the tactical unmanned aerial vehicle program in 1997. The RQ-7 Shadow is the primary airborne ISR tool for Army units worldwide, expected to remain in service through the decade. Built by AAI Corporation, it has a range of 68 nautical miles, a flight duration of five hours, and can reach a maximum altitude of 14,000 feet. The upgraded version, RQ-7B Shadow, has a larger wingspan and fuel capacity for two extra hours of flight endurance. The Shadow UAS provides real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition information to the Army at the brigade level. It has a 60-pound payload with an E-O/IR sensor turret for day or night video relay to a ground station. The Army is considering expanding its missions to include medical resupply, delivering crucial items via parachute. The Shadow will be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link to network with battalion commanders and other air vehicles as part of the Army's Future Combat System plans. The Marine Corps is exploring arming the Shadow. The Marine Corps is considering arming the Shadow UAV. The program cost for a Shadow UAV system reached $11.1 million in FY2008. The Army procured 102 systems through 2009 and requested $25 million for 20 Shadow aircraft in FY2012. AeroVironment's Dragon Eye is a backpack-carried UAV used by the Marines for reconnaissance and surveillance. The Marine Corps procured 40 Dragon Eye UAVs in 2001 with an operational endurance of 45 minutes and a range of 2.5 nautical miles. AeroVironment was awarded a contract for 300 Dragon Eye systems, later revised to acquire Raven UAS instead. Each Dragon Eye system includes three air vehicles and one ground station, with a unit cost of $154,000. The electric-powered Pointer UAV has been used in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Pointer UAV, developed by AeroVironment, has a 9-foot wingspan and two-hour flight endurance. It requires two personnel for transportation. The Raven, a smaller version of the Pointer, is man-portable and equipped with advanced technology for navigation and payload. The Raven UAV provides reconnaissance, sniper spotting, and surveillance scouting for Army and SOCOM personnel. It is hand-launched with an electric motor, powered by a rechargeable battery, and can carry either an IR or E-O camera. The vehicle lands via a controlled crash and is composed of Kevlar plating for protection. Soldiers can be trained in-theater in a matter of days with the relatively simple system. The Raven UAV, adopted by the US Army in 2004, is a short-range system with 2469 air vehicles in service by 2007. The Army aims to acquire 2,200 Raven systems, with over 1,300 delivered so far. Developed by Insitu Group, the ScanEagle UAV is known for its long endurance and low cost, with a three-aircraft system priced at $167,000. It can reach altitudes of 19,000 feet, travel over 60 nautical miles, and stay airborne for nearly 20 hours. ScanEagle, equipped with electro-optical and infrared sensors, provides force-protection ISR for Marine Corps units in Iraq and is used by Special Operations Command. Operations began in 2004, with Boeing offering ISR services under a fee-for-service arrangement. The Navy awarded Insitu a contract for the Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS) for reconnaissance and surveillance purposes. STUAS, a Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System, provides maritime and land-based tactical reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition capabilities for the USMC and Navy. It offers real-time intelligence delivery to tactical commanders, persistent RSTA support for maneuver decisions, and force defense/protection for Navy ships, Marine Corps land forces, and Navy Special Warfare Units. Equipped with day/night video cameras, infrared marker, and laser range finder, STUAS can be launched and recovered from various environments and has a takeoff weight of up to 125 pounds with a range of 50 nautical miles. The STUAS system, with a takeoff weight of up to 125 pounds and a range of 50 nautical miles, will be procured by the services for training their own operators. Initial operating capability is expected in the fourth quarter of FY2013. In the mid-1990s, the Pentagon developed UAS for combat missions, resulting in separate UCAV programs for the Air Force and Navy. The programs merged in June 2003. The Pentagon merged separate UCAV programs for the Air Force and Navy in June 2003 to establish the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) project under DARPA. J-UCAS was later transferred to the Air Force but was cancelled in 2006 after spending over $1.45 billion. The Navy then issued a Request for Information for a carrier-borne UCAV called UCLASS in May 2010. The Navy is developing a platform called UCLASS to operate alongside manned aircraft in carrier air wings by the end of 2018. The system will consist of four to six autonomous aircraft with 11-14 hours of endurance, capable of aerial refueling and operating in hostile airspace with low-observable traits. Boeing and General have been awarded concept study contracts for UCLASS. The Navy has awarded UCLASS concept study contracts to Boeing, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman for autonomous aircraft to operate in contested airspace. Likely contenders include Northrop Grumman's X-47B with a wingspan of 62 feet, endurance of nine hours, and range of 1,600 nautical miles. The X-45C was expected to achieve speeds of 450 knots and altitudes of 40,000 feet, with a range of 1,200 nautical miles. Phantom Ray, developed by Boeing, is a contender for the Navy's UCLASS program. General Atomics is developing the Avenger, a third-generation Predator with long-endurance capabilities. The Avenger can stay in the air for up to 20 hours, operate at 50,000 feet, and fly at over 400 knots. The Avenger, developed by General Atomics, is a third-generation Predator with long-endurance capabilities. It can fly at over 400 knots with a Pratt & Whitney PW545B jet engine, making it 50 percent faster than the Reaper. A second and third Avenger are in production, with the ability to carry a 6,000 pound payload, a 50 percent improvement over the Reaper. Lockheed is also interested in entering an RQ-170 variant in the UCLASS competition. A new class of UAS is under development to provide more persistent platforms for ISR and data relay, including high altitude long endurance systems like the Boeing Phantom. Boeing Phantom Works proposed the Phantom Eye, a high altitude long endurance system using hydrogen-fueled engines to carry a 3,000-pound payload for 10 days. Aurora Flight Sciences unveiled the Orion, which uses hydrogen-fueled diesel engines to carry a 2,600-pound payload at 30,000 feet. AeroVironment's Global Observer can fly at 65,000 feet for five to seven days with a 400-pound payload. These are part of the HALE systems being developed for various endurance and payload capacities. The Global Observer airship can fly at 65,000 feet for five to seven days with a 400-pound payload, optimized for persistent communications and remote sensing. Several firms are developing unmanned airships for long-endurance missions, offering similar payload capacity but slower cruise speed compared to fixed-wing aircraft. The Army's High Altitude Airship program aims to build an airship capable of carrying a 2,000-pound payload at 65,000 feet for over 30 days."
