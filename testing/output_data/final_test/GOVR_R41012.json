    "content": "Senate committees are required to adopt rules that align with Senate Rule XXVI, governing their organization and operation. These rules must not conflict with Senate rules and detail how the committee handles order and procedure. They demonstrate how each committee addresses comity, fairness, power division, and responsibility allocation within its membership. For example, some committees mandate minority party presence when conducting business with less than a majority quorum. Senate committees must adopt their own set of rules, following the 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act, which requires committees to give authority to the chair while involving the ranking minority member in the process. Committees may require the agreement or notification of the ranking minority member before issuing subpoenas or starting investigations. The rules must be printed in the Congressional Record by March 1 of the first year of a Congress. Senate committees must adopt their own rules by March 1 of the first year of a Congress. While committee rules govern actions in proceedings, the Senate lacks enforcement power if a physical majority is present. There is no mechanism to enforce rules beyond those in the Senate's standing rules. For example, if a committee's rules require minority party presence for a quorum but the committee acts without it, the minority can express disapproval but cannot raise a point of order on the Senate floor. The report analyzes Senate committees' procedural profiles, considering formal rules, individual committee rules, traditions, and precedents. Committees may have unique provisions or structures in their rules, which can vary in detail. The report includes tables comparing key features of committee rules.

Three committees leave the decision to issue a subpoena to the full committee, and Ethics allows the chair and ranking minority member or a majority of the committee to approve.
