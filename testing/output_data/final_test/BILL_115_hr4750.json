    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"TPS Act\" and deals with the termination of grants of Temporary Protected Status. Section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to terminate new grants of temporary protected status for aliens, except for those with pending applications before the enactment date. Existing temporary protected status may be extended for eligible aliens. The alien granted temporary protected status will have a 3-year period starting from the enactment date. Documentation described in subsection (d) will be valid during this period, and subsections (c) through (h) will continue to apply. Permanent resident status will be granted to former TPS holders. The Secretary of Homeland Security will adjust the status of eligible aliens to lawful permanent residence if they meet specific criteria, including having had temporary protected status before a certain date and being admissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Secretary will establish a procedure for eligible individuals to apply for relief without removal proceedings or immediate visa availability. Minors can apply with a legal guardian. Aliens granted status under this section are not subject to numerical limitations. The Secretary may require an application fee from aliens applying. The Secretary may require an alien applying for permanent resident status to pay a reasonable fee. Biometric and biographic data submission is necessary for granting permanent resident status. Background checks using various data are required for security purposes. An alternative procedure is available for aliens unable to provide such data due to physical impairment. Background checks are conducted on aliens seeking permanent resident status to determine eligibility based on criminal, national security, or other factors. These checks must be completed before the Secretary grants permanent resident status. Aliens with pending relief applications and prima facie eligibility cannot be removed by the Secretary or Attorney General. The Secretary shall grant provisional protected presence and employment authorization to eligible aliens under this section until their application is denied or their status is adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident. An alien granted provisional protected presence is not considered unlawfully present in the US during the specified period, unless the Secretary rescinds it due to national security threats or unauthorized travel outside the country. Starting in fiscal year 2022, there will be a temporary reduction in immigrant visas. Beginning in fiscal year 2022, the total number of immigrant visas available will be reduced by 50,000 across family-sponsored, employment-based, and diversity categories. This reduction is temporary and will affect visas under specific sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Beginning in fiscal year 2022, the total number of immigrant visas available will be reduced by 50,000 across various categories. The reduction is limited and will not exceed the total number of individuals who have adjusted their status to permanent residents in previous years. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Homeland Security."
