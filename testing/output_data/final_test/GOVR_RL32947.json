    "content": "From an environmental quality perspective, the focus on animal agriculture has been on water resource impacts due to animal waste affecting water quality. Animal feeding operations can also emit particles and gases like ammonia and hydrogen sulfide into the air, raising concerns about air pollution and potential health effects. The EPA has the authority to address AFO air emissions under various laws. The EPA has the authority to address air emissions from animal feeding operations under laws like the Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The Air Compliance Agreement aims to monitor animal agriculture emissions while providing a \"safe harbor\" from liability for participants. Some industry sectors support the agreement, while others have concerns. The EPA's Air Compliance Agreement aims to monitor emissions from animal feeding operations, with industry groups expressing concerns. State and local air quality officials, as well as environmental groups, oppose the agreement. AFOs can impact air quality through various emissions, including gases, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and odor. Emission sources vary based on factors like weather, animal species, and manure handling systems. The EPA's Air Compliance Agreement aims to monitor emissions from animal feeding operations, with concerns from industry groups, state and local air quality officials, and environmental groups. Emission sources include gases, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and odor, with air emissions mostly coming from the microbial breakdown of manure stored in pits or lagoons and spread on fields. AFOs have environmental and human health impacts, with pollutants like ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and particulate matter causing concern. The animal sector of agriculture has undergone significant changes in recent decades, with approximately 238,000 animal feeding operations in the United States. The livestock and poultry industry has seen significant changes, with larger confined production facilities becoming more geographically concentrated due to technological innovation and economies of scale. Between 1982 and 1997, the number of U.S. operations with confined livestock decreased by 27%, while large feedlots with 300 animals or more increased by 88%. This shift has led to concerns about managing animal waste and potential environmental impacts. The livestock industry has seen changes with larger confined production facilities becoming more concentrated. This has raised concerns about managing animal waste and environmental impacts, particularly in relation to regulations under the Clean Water Act. Increased federal and state attention to air emissions from Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs) may lead to stricter regulation under the Clean Air Act and state programs. Livestock operations could also be subject to release reporting requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Emergency Planning. Livestock facilities emit hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, reportable substances under CERCLA and EPCRA. Federal courts found AFOs in violation of reporting requirements. Concern in agriculture community about potential legal actions. Enforcement of federal environmental laws such as CERCLA, EPRCRA, and the Clean Air Act requires accurate measurement of emissions from livestock facilities. Resolving questions about AFOs' contribution to air pollution is hindered by a lack of credible data. Public concern about AFO emissions is increasing. The EPA and agriculture industry groups negotiated a voluntary agreement called the Air Compliance Agreement in 2005 to gather air quality monitoring data on emissions from animal feedlot operations. AFOs were given a 90-day signup period, later extended to August 12, 2005, to participate in the agreement. The agreement aimed to collect and analyze data to address concerns about AFO emissions. The Air Compliance Agreement in 2005 allowed scientists to collect emissions data from AFOs for regulatory compliance. Participants were granted a \"safe harbor\" by EPA, with exceptions for criminal violations. AFOs in certain industries were eligible, with a civil penalty for participation. The Air Compliance Agreement in 2005 allowed AFOs to participate in a nationwide air monitoring program by paying a civil penalty. EPA estimated that up to 4,000 AFOs might sign up, with a small number selected for on-farm monitoring. EPA reserved the right to decline participation based on various factors. The Air Compliance Agreement in 2005 allowed AFOs to participate in a nationwide air monitoring program by paying a civil penalty. EPA expected agency officials to decide on the monitoring study within 30 days after the sign-up period. Signed agreements would be sent to the Environmental Appeals Board for approval. Monies collected from participants would go to a nonprofit organization set up by the AFOs. The Air Compliance Agreement in 2005 allowed AFOs to participate in a nationwide air monitoring program by paying a civil penalty. A nonprofit organization, the Agricultural Air Research Council, was set up by the AFOs to subcontract a science advisor and independent monitoring contractor for the monitoring study. EPA's role was to review and approve the study plan, collaborate with stakeholders, and use the data to develop methodologies for estimating annual emissions. Monitoring was to continue for two years to help AFOs determine compliance with federal law and the Clean Air Act. EPA expected results within 18 months. The EPA's Air Compliance Agreement in 2005 allowed AFOs to participate in a nationwide air monitoring program by paying a civil penalty. The agreement required AFOs to apply emission-estimating methodologies for eligible animal groups within 18 months after the monitoring study's conclusion. AFOs had 120 days to apply the methodologies, obtain air permits, and report releases of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. The agreement provided a waiver from liability for non-compliance with certain provisions of environmental laws retroactively up to the time of reporting releases or December 31, 2011. The Air Compliance Agreement in 2005 allowed AFOs to participate in a nationwide air monitoring program by paying a civil penalty. The agreement could be extended by mutual agreement without limit. Many livestock and poultry groups supported the agreement, stating that valid data is needed for developing public policy on emissions from animal agriculture. The air monitoring study linked to the agreement is crucial for establishing compliance criteria. Supporters believe the data will help EPA create charts for farmers to determine if they are subject to environmental laws. Additionally, producers need the protection provided by the agreement. Supporters of the agreement believe that producers need protection to volunteer their farms for the study, as potential penalties for violations are significant. Many argue that livestock operations should be exempt from certain reporting requirements, and groups like cattle feedlots and poultry producers have requested clarification from the EPA on this issue. Without changes, courts may continue to apply environmental laws to animal agriculture facilities. The courts will continue to apply environmental laws to animal agriculture without statutory change or clarification from EPA. The monitoring study is seen as an incentive for participants to provide data for national compliance determination. State and local officials and environmental groups strongly objected to the agreement, calling it a sweeping liability shield for the entire industry. EPA-industry negotiations excluded environmental groups and air program administrators, leading to objections from both parties. Environmental groups and industry stakeholders objected to the EPA's Air Compliance Agreement, leading to legal challenges. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2007, with the court ruling that the agreement falls within the EPA's enforcement discretion. One judge dissented, stating that the agreement could be in force for years, impacting emissions regulations for livestock operations. Some agriculture industry groups had concerns about the EPA's Air Compliance Agreement, arguing that it unlawfully exempts AFOs from certain environmental laws. Critics also questioned the broad liability shield provided by the agreement, citing a lack of data to justify it. Environmentalists and government researchers have documented emissions and adverse effects from AFO emissions. They argue that EPA has the authority to require AFOs to provide emission monitoring data under CAA Section 114 without an industry-wide exemption. Critics view the penalties in the agreement as a \"payment to pollute,\" especially compared to penalties available under other laws. EPA believes the agreement is the quickest way to address uncertainties regarding air emissions and bring the AFO industry into compliance with environmental laws. Critics are concerned that the agreement does not require AFOs to reduce pollution. Critics were concerned that the agreement did not mandate AFOs to reduce pollution or implement air pollution controls, despite being eligible for a lengthy CAA amnesty. They also criticized the open-ended timelines in the agreement, which could leave AFO emissions unregulated even if monitoring shows concerning levels. EPA's publication of emission-estimating methodologies would trigger AFOs' obligation to determine their emissions and comply with CAA requirements. EPA's emission-estimating methodologies are expected to be published 18 months after monitoring. Critics raised concerns about the small number of monitored sites, but EPA defended the sample size as sufficient for valid data collection. Increasing the number of farms to be monitored was deemed too costly and not adding significant value to the data. The National Research Council recommends a process-based approach for estimating emissions from animal production sectors, using data to develop accurate emission factors. This method involves analyzing farm components and simulating conversions and transfers to determine emissions based on processes. The EPA is developing a process-based model for estimating emissions from animal production, which will take years to complete. Critics raised concerns about the monitoring protocol lacking peer review by independent scientists. Despite EPA's assurance of scientific rigor, some critics still questioned the transparency of the study. Some critics raised concerns about the lack of public involvement in the external review process of an agreement that could limit states and localities' ability to enforce air pollution control laws. They were worried that the broad waiver of liability could hinder enforcement efforts. The agreement raised concerns about AFO's civil liability for violations and its potential impact on state and citizen enforcement. EPA maintained that the agreement did not undermine state or local enforcement authorities and did not affect key state enforcement tools. Critics also pointed out unresolved definitional issues and criticized EPA for lack of public involvement in the review process. After a monitoring study, EPA will issue guidance on treating emissions from different areas at AFOs as fugitive or nonfugitive emissions. Critics urge EPA to clarify this issue promptly through formal rulemaking. Additionally, EPA will provide guidance on defining the term \"source\" in relation to animal agriculture and farm activities, which has raised concerns among state and local air quality officials. Some industry groups and states believe AFOs do not warrant regulatory concern, citing federal court rulings. However, there are concerns about the agreement's details, especially for small farmers, leading to uncertainty about participation costs. Requests have been made for EPA to review public comments, make necessary changes, and provide more time for producers and processors.

Concerns about the agreement's details, especially for small farmers, have led to uncertainty about participation costs. Requests have been made for EPA to review public comments, make necessary changes, and provide more time for producers and processors to sign up. EPA extended the signup deadline until August 12, 2005, but the agreement remained unchanged from what was published in January 2005. Industry commenters objected to the agreement requiring an admission of liability and a \"civil penalty\" payment to participate, while EPA clarified that signing the agreement did not imply guilt. Payment of a penalty was required to obtain a release from liability for violations, according to EPA. Signing the agreement did not imply negligence or violation of laws. Some dairy farmers were concerned about potential impacts on farm programs and loans, but the Secretary of Agriculture assured that participation would not affect eligibility. Poultry and dairy groups expressed a preference for collaboration. The poultry and dairy groups preferred to work with their own chosen nonprofit organizations to manage their participation in the study, rather than a single organization representing the industry. Purdue University was chosen to oversee the study, with the dairy industry working with its Dairy Environmental Task Force and poultry and egg producers collaborating with researchers from the University of Georgia. Producers objected to the limited number of sites EPA planned to monitor, stating the monitoring program was too restricted. Environmentalists and industry groups criticized the proposed monitoring program for being too limited, with concerns about the data not accurately reflecting various factors influencing emissions from facilities. Industry groups feared future costly and scientifically inappropriate requirements from the EPA due to the protocol's limited monitoring not representing different types of operations within specific sectors of animal agriculture. The proposed monitoring program for emissions from animal agriculture faced criticism for its limited scope in representing various factors influencing emissions. Concerns were raised about the methodology's ability to account for differences in management styles, feed regimes, and financial obstacles for participation. Dairy farmers faced challenges in funding their participation due to the lack of a central mechanism like the national check-off program used by other animal producers. The Campaign for Family Farms and individual hog farmers objected to using mandatory pork check-off funds to support producers' participation in the Air Compliance Agreement. They petitioned the Secretary of Agriculture to halt pork check-off commitments for expenses related to the agreement, arguing that it was a way for large concentrated animal feeding operations to buy legal immunity from environmental laws. Despite the challenge, USDA approved the use of pork check-off funds. The EPA approved the use of pork check-off funds for the Air Compliance Agreement, despite objections. Over 2,500 agreements were ratified by the Environmental Appeals Board, representing 13,900 farms in 42 states. These farms make up more than 90% of the largest animal feeding operations in the US, including swine, dairy, egg-laying, and broiler operations. The agreements were deemed consistent with applicable statutes and regulations, allowing the monitoring study to officially begin. The EPA approved the use of pork check-off funds for the Air Compliance Agreement, allowing the monitoring study to officially begin developing quality assurance and site-specific monitoring plans for livestock sectors. In June 2007, EPA announced the two-year air monitoring study involving 25 swine, dairy, and poultry farms in nine states. Purdue University managed the monitoring, selected equipment and methods in consultation with EPA, and researchers from eight universities carried out the monitoring of pollutants emitted by AFOs. The monitoring study aimed to quantify aerial pollutant emissions from dairy, pork, egg, and broiler production facilities, provide data for emissions models, and promote national consensus on measuring emissions from livestock operations. Purdue University researchers conducted the monitoring from mid-2007 to 2009, with EPA releasing the data in January 2011. Greenhouse gas emissions were not measured, but pollutants like particulate matter, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and volatile organic compounds were included. The EPA released data and reports on monitored AFOs in January 2011. An analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project found that levels of pollutants exceeded health-based standards at some sites. EIP criticized aspects of the study design and recommended thorough peer review of the data. EPA acknowledged the need for peer review. EPA requested peer review of study data and methodologies for estimating AFO emissions from the Science Advisory Board. They also issued a \"Call for Information\" to gather additional peer-reviewed monitoring data on AFO emissions and waste management practices to improve emissions estimating methodologies. EPA sought more data as monitoring data alone was insufficient for developing a process-based modeling approach. The EPA is focusing on developing emissions-estimating methodologies (EEMs) for AFOs based on mass balance constraints, as recommended in NRC reports. Draft EEMs have been released for broiler AFO emissions and ammonia emissions from swine and dairy AFOs. Stakeholders have criticized the agency's initial efforts to develop EEMs using national monitoring study data. Critics have widely criticized the EPA's monitoring study data for its significant limitations, particularly the small number of sites that do not accurately represent various factors affecting emissions prediction. The study's focus on only 25 farms nationwide has drawn objections, especially regarding the development of a single EEM for different animal types and waste management systems. EPA's explanation for not creating separate EEMs due to insufficient data quality has also been challenged. Critics challenge EPA's data quality for developing separate EEMs, citing missing or confounded key data, including negative and zero emissions values. Disagreement exists on the use of such data. Critics also question EPA's criteria for data inclusion/exclusion and rejection of additional data submissions. Many fault EPA for not adopting a process-based, whole-farm modeling approach for estimating AFO emissions as recommended by the National Research Council. In April 2013, the EPA's Science Advisory Board rejected the agency's draft EEMs due to data limitations and methodology concerns. The SAB recommended expanding datasets and developing a process-based modeling approach for predicting air emissions, as suggested by the National Research Council in 2003. Industry groups argue that the current data is insufficient to support EPA's approach. Some stakeholders support EPA's current approach, while others urge the agency to move forward despite imperfect data to develop EEMs for air regulatory purposes. EPA is reprocessing data and seeking datasets from other studies to address SAB's criticisms. Delays in the process frustrate environmental groups, who believe a CAA regulatory program is necessary to tackle air pollutants from CAFOs. Concerns are raised about the relevance of emissions factors given advancements in livestock management practices and technologies since the data was collected. In 2005, poultry producers requested an exemption from reporting requirements for releases from poultry-growing operations, citing minimal risk to public health and burdensome reporting. In 2007, EPA proposed exempting releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms from notification requirements. The exemption would cover releases to the air from manure, digestive emissions, and urea. EPA justified the rule due to the industry's compliance burden with reporting requirements. The EPA proposed exempting releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms from notification requirements, drawing criticism from environmental groups and states. Industry groups support the exemption, while the Government Accountability Office raised concerns about EPA's monitoring activities and research on emissions levels. The EPA finalized the CERCLA/EPCRA administrative reporting exemption for hazardous substance releases from animal waste at farms in December 2008. The final rule exempts all livestock operations from reporting to federal officials and provides a partial exemption for reporting to state and local emergency officials. The basis for the exemption was questioned by the GAO, citing incomplete data collection efforts by the EPA. The final rule exempts large animal feeding operations from reporting to federal officials but requires reporting to state and local emergency officials. Critics raised concerns about emissions of chemicals like ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from animal waste facilities. Environmental advocates and industry groups challenged the rule in federal court. The final rule partially exempted releases from EPCRA, with industry groups intervening in support. Litigation led to talks for mediation, but the government requested a remand in 2010. EPA has not proposed a new rule yet, so the 2008 exemption rule remains in effect. Congressional attention has been limited, with developments driven by administrative and judicial actions. Members raised objections to the pending plan before the Air Compliance Agreement in 2005. Several Members wrote letters to EPA objecting to the pending plan, criticizing the proposal to exempt routine animal waste air releases from reporting requirements. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee members expressed skepticism about EPA's authority for the exemption, while others suggested exempting small farms. EPA and USDA witnesses supported the proposal, stating that the waiver would only affect reporting for emergency response situations, not other farm emissions or releases of hazardous substances from manure into the environment. No legislation has been passed regarding the Air Compliance Agreement. In the 112th Congress, bills H.R. 2997 and S. 1729 were introduced to clarify that manure is not considered a hazardous substance or pollutant under environmental laws. Proponents argue that existing laws are sufficient for regulating environmental releases from animal agriculture, while opponents believe exempting manure would hinder government and citizen response to hazardous substance releases. The bills H.R. 2997 and S. 1729 aim to clarify that manure is not classified as a hazardous substance or pollutant under environmental laws. Supporters seek to prevent EPA from requiring reporting of manure releases, while opponents argue that exempting manure could impede response to hazardous substance releases. EPA has expressed concerns about the broad impacts of H.R. 2997, which would limit the agency's ability to respond to environmental releases involving manure. The 113th Congress has not introduced any similar legislation to prevent the EPA from issuing CERCLA abatement orders for response to damaging releases."
