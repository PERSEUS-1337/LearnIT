    "content": "The \"Medical Device Competition Act of 2004\" may be cited as such. Congress acknowledges the importance of promoting competition in the medical device and hospital supply industries to ensure the availability of high-quality products at competitive prices. Hospital group purchasing can help reduce costs through bulk purchases, but it must comply with antitrust laws to maintain fair competition. Certain practices by some purchasing organizations have limited competition by excluding certain suppliers and device makers from the market. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission, should oversee the anti-kickback exemption for group purchasing organizations to prevent conduct that harms competition in the hospital supply and medical device industries. SEC. 3. ENSURING FULL AND FREE COMPETITION. Section 1128B(b)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act is amended to include new clauses regarding contracting, business, and ethical practices compliance with regulations, certification by the Secretary, and payment limits. The Secretary will issue regulations specifying contracting, business, and ethical practices contrary to antitrust law and competitive principles within 2 years of the Medical Device Competition Act of 2004 enactment. The Secretary will issue regulations to ensure that necessary products for patient care and worker safety are available, considering public policy goals of competition, innovation, and cost reduction in healthcare. Procedures will be established annually in consultation with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission. The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission, will issue regulations to clarify the definition of 'remuneration' under the Medical Device Competition Act of 2004, specifying reasonable costs associated with procurement and contract administration for compliance certification. The procurement of products and administration of valid contracts do not include marketing costs, extraneous fees, or any payment intended to unduly influence contract awards. A purchasing agent is authorized to act on behalf of individuals or entities providing services reimbursable under Federal health care programs. The text chunk discusses the implementation of contracts to purchase hospital supplies or medical equipment for individuals or entities providing services reimbursable under Federal health care programs. Clause (v) of section 1128B(b)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act will take effect 1 year after the enactment of the Act."
