    "content": "The \"Prescribe A Book Act\" is a new legislation that focuses on pediatric involvement in reading and education by amending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include Pediatric Early Literacy Programs. The term 'eligible entity' refers to a nonprofit organization that has shown effectiveness in providing training to healthcare providers on literacy promotion during pediatric health visits, delivering training through various medical education settings, offering technical assistance to healthcare facilities for implementing Pediatric Early Literacy Programs, and creating local healthcare opportunities. The Pediatric Early Literacy Program involves healthcare providers trained in promoting early language and literacy to encourage parents to read aloud to young children. It integrates developmental research into training curriculum and offers discounts on books for local healthcare facilities. The Pediatric Early Literacy Program aims to promote reading aloud to young children by providing developmentally appropriate books to families, creating literacy-rich environments in healthcare facilities, and offering training to healthcare providers. The Pediatric Early Literacy Program promotes reading aloud to children by providing books, creating literacy-rich environments, offering training to healthcare providers, and demonstrating effectiveness in improving parent behavior and children's language skills. The Secretary can award grants to eligible entities for Pediatric Early Literacy Programs. Eligible entities must submit an application and provide matching funds equal to at least 50% of the grant received. Grant funds can be used for various literacy promotion activities. An eligible entity receiving a grant under section 5622 must enter into contracts with private nonprofit organizations or public agencies to establish and operate a Pediatric Early Literacy Program. They must provide training and technical assistance to contractors and include terms determined by the Secretary for program effectiveness. Contractors are selected based on their priority to serve at-risk individuals. The Pediatric Early Literacy Program gives priority to serving at-risk children, including those from low-income families, without adequate medical insurance, enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, living in rural areas, migrant children, and those with limited library access. The Pediatric Early Literacy Program requires eligible entities to obtain books at favorable discounts and report on program effectiveness annually. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new subpart for pediatric early literacy programs, outlining definitions, program authorization, applications, matching requirements, use of grant funds, restrictions on payments, and reporting requirements. Eligible entities must obtain books at discounted rates and report on program effectiveness annually."
