    "content": "We introduce Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN), specialized architectures like Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNN) and Quantum Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (QGCNN). Applications include learning Hamiltonian dynamics, creating entanglement, spectral clustering, and graph isomorphism classification. Variational Quantum Algorithms are a promising class rapidly emerging in Quantum Computing. Recently, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have been shown to suffer from a quantum version of the no-free lunch theorem, making them difficult to train via gradient descent. Trotter-based ansatze have been popular in QNNs, with efficient optimization methods found. On the classical side, graph-based neural networks leveraging data geometry have seen success in deep learning applications in biophysics and chemistry. The proposed Quantum Neural Network ansatz allows for quantum and classical probabilistic inference on data with a graph-geometric structure. Graph Neural Networks have evolved from acyclic graphs to adapting convolution operators from CNNs for graph data. Graph Neural Networks have evolved to utilize message-passing frameworks like GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2016) for graph data processing. The framework involves node representations, message propagation functions, and adjacency matrices to compute node encodings. This approach assigns a quantum subsystem to each vertex in a graph, forming a global Hilbert space. Graph Neural Networks utilize message-passing frameworks like GCN for graph data processing. A quantum subsystem is assigned to each vertex in a graph, forming a global Hilbert space. The edges of the graph dictate communication between vertex subspaces, forming a quantum network with topology given by the graph. The most general Quantum Graph Neural Network ansatz is a parameterized quantum circuit on a network consisting of Hamiltonian evolutions. The Quantum Graph Neural Network ansatz involves a sequence of Hamiltonian evolutions with trainable parameters. The Hamiltonians act on the Hilbert space of graph nodes, with coefficients and index sets defining interactions. Terms within a Hamiltonian commute, but different Hamiltonians may not. This approach aims to avoid barren plateaus in training. In the context of avoiding barren plateaus in training, a specialized architecture called Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNN) is proposed. Parameters are tied spatially or over sequential iterations, similar to classical recurrent neural networks. The QGRNN ansatz involves a Trotter-based quantum simulation of evolution under a Hamiltonian. The Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNN) ansatz involves quantum simulation of evolution under a Hamiltonian for effective dynamics on a graph. Permutation invariance is crucial, requiring the Hamiltonian to lack local trainable parameters and only have global ones. This constraint ties the \u03b8 parameters over graph indices. The Quantum Spectral Graph Convolutional Neural Network (QSGCNN) is a variant of the Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNN) ansatz that focuses on Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatze. It recovers the mapping of Laplacian-based graph convolutional networks in the Heisenberg picture, using alternating layers of message passing, node update, and nonlinearities. The QSGCNN involves four different Hamiltonians for a given weighted graph with edge weights \u039b jk. The coupling Hamiltonian a\u015d is defined with edge weights \u039b jk, which are the weights of the graph G. The operators x j are quantum continuous-variable position operators that can be implemented on quantum computers. After evolving by the message passing step, an exponential of the kinetic Hamiltonian is applied. This step is considered a node update step, where the position operators of each node are mapped according to the Graph Laplacian matrix for the weighted graph G. The Graph Laplacian matrix for the weighted graph G is used in a spectral-based graph convolution step. Momentum can accumulate between layers, followed by adding non-linearity with an anharmonic Hamiltonian. This is then followed by an evolution according to the kinetic Hamiltonian, resulting in a nonlinear mapping. Repeating these steps in a sequence of layers yields a quantum-coherent analogue of node update prescription in the original graph. In this example, a Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Network can effectively learn the dynamics of an Ising spin system by comparing states at different times. The goal is to learn the target Hamiltonian parameters by evolving the initial state according to the QGRNN ansatz for a number of iterations. The QGRNN ansatz is trained using Adam gradient descent to minimize infidelity over batch sizes of different times T. Gradients are estimated via finite difference differentiation. The ansatz learns the Hamiltonian parameters accurately and undergoes a quantum phase kickback test on the learned GHZ state, showing a boost in Rabi oscillation frequency. A 7x boost in Rabi oscillation frequency for a 7-node network demonstrates reaching the Heisenberg limit of sensitivity for the quantum sensor network. Quantum Sensor Networks show promise in Quantum Sensing and Quantum Networking/Communication. Using a QGCNN ansatz, a GHZ state can be prepared without global knowledge of the quantum network structure. Using a QGCNN ansatz, a GHZ state can be prepared on a quantum network without global knowledge of the network structure. The advantage lies in the simplicity of quantum communication rounds being proportional to P, with local dynamics of each node being independent of the network structure. Validation of the accurate GHZ state is done through the quantum phase kickback test, showing the desired frequency boost effect for the trained network. The QSGCNN is applied to spectral clustering tasks, with results shown for varying multi-qubit precision. The single-qubit precision case involves modifying the QSGCNN construction and applying phase rotations and CNOT gates to concentrate phase shifts onto a single collector node. The QSGCNN is used for spectral clustering tasks by concentrating phase shifts onto a single collector node, leading to increased sensitivity to signals at super-classical levels. Low-qubit precision yields sensible results, suggesting spectral clustering as a promising application for near-term quantum devices. The Quantum Graph Convolutional Network (QSGCNN) was used to identify isomorphic graphs by applying a single-qubit precision encoding. The approach involved applying the QSGCNN ansatz to two graphs in parallel, sampling eigenvalues of the coupling Hamiltonian, and comparing the energetic measurement statistics. The Quantum Graph Convolutional Network (QSGCNN) was used to determine if two graphs are isomorphic by comparing energetic measurement statistics. The Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test was used to analyze the distribution of energies sampled at the output of the QSGCNN. A binary classification label was determined based on KS statistic values above 0.4. The dataset included balanced isomorphic and non-isomorphic pairs for training and testing, with 100 pairs for training, 50 for validation, and 50 for testing. The networks were trained using Adam gradient-based optimization. The Quantum Graph Convolutional Network (QGCNN) was trained using Adam optimizer with batch size 50. Figure 4 shows training and testing losses for different graph sizes and energetic samples. Tables 1 and 2 display classification accuracy for isomorphism using QGCNN. Results indicate high accuracy even with low sample sizes, suggesting QGCNN's capability in identifying graph isomorphism. Comparison with classical graph convolutional networks is left for future work, with the paper's results serving as a promising exploration of QGCNN applications in quantum dynamics. Future works should explore hybrid methods where one can learn a graph-based hidden quantum representation of a quantum chemical process using Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN). The QGNN could provide a more accurate model for the hidden processes leading to emergent chemical properties. Other potential future work includes generalizing the QGNN to include quantum degrees of freedom on the edges and incorporating quantum-optimization-based training of graph parameters via quantum phase backpropagation. Extending the QSGCNN to multiple features per node."
