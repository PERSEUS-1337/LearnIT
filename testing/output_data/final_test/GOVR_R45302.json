    "content": "The policy community has been focused on the federal government's role in protecting U.S. elections from foreign interference since the 2016 election cycle. Recent reports indicate ongoing attempts to interfere with the 2018 election cycle. Congress oversees the federal presence in campaigns and elections, but there is no single agency or statute for coordination. Multiple congressional committees, federal departments, agencies, statutes, and constitutional provisions impact the federal role in campaigns and elections. The federal role in campaigns and elections is limited. The federal government's role in campaigns and elections has expanded in the past 50 years, particularly in campaign finance and voting rights. Campaigns and elections are regulated differently, with the federal government primarily supporting states in administering elections. The Election Assistance Commission and Federal Election Commission are the main agencies devoted to campaigns and elections. The Justice Department administers federal laws related to electioneering and voting. The federal government's role in campaigns and elections has expanded in the past 50 years, particularly in campaign finance and voting rights. The Election Assistance Commission and Federal Election Commission are the main agencies devoted to campaigns and elections. The Justice Department administers federal laws related to electioneering and voting. Other agencies like the Department of Homeland Security are also more involved in elections now. The report is based on CRS research of statutory references to campaigns and elections, federal agency documents, and media accounts. U.S. Code citations are included throughout the report, reflecting a 2014 reclassification of federal election law. The report focuses on areas of law and public policy that directly impact federal campaigns and elections. It does not cover every aspect of federal involvement in this area, excluding agencies and provisions not directly related to campaign finance or election administration. The report also does not address banking law, as it is typically not related to campaign finance policy or election administration in the United States. The report excludes agencies prohibited from elections involvement and does not provide legal or constitutional analysis on standardized election procedures. Federal and state governments share responsibility for campaigns and elections. The report will be updated to reflect major developments. Themes of categories and roles organize the analysis. The analysis in the report is organized around two themes: categories and roles. Categories include campaign finance, election administration, election security, redistricting, qualifications and contested elections, and voting rights. Roles refer to specific governmental responsibilities within these categories, such as what the federal government does to support or regulate aspects of U.S. campaigns or elections. These categories and roles are not definitive and can overlap. Campaigns in the United States focus on persuading voters to win elections, while elections are highly regulated at the state level. Federal policy mainly governs campaign finance, with regulations on fundraising and spending. Campaign conduct is primarily regulated through campaign finance laws. The United States has strict regulations on campaign finance, including prohibitions on foreign involvement, contribution limits, and disclosure requirements for political committees. These rules primarily affect activities advocating for or against political candidates. Other laws may also impact campaigns, such as property disputes governed by state or local laws. The federal government's role in campaign conduct is limited, with federal campaign finance policy being silent on various aspects such as campaign management, field activities, voter targeting, and strategic relationships among political committees. The federal government plays a relatively small role in campaign conduct, as its focus is primarily on specific roles in elections due to constitutional and federalism limitations. The federal government's roles are limited by the Constitution and federalism, focusing on specific tasks that support states, territories, and localities. Federal duties involve multiple statutes, agencies, and public policy areas, including elections where they provide Census Bureau data for redistricting, fund election equipment upgrades, regulate campaign finance, and ensure voter non-discrimination. Additional details and relevant federal statutes are provided in the report's Appendix. The federal government's roles in U.S. elections are limited by the Constitution and federalism. They focus on tasks such as providing Census Bureau data for redistricting, funding election equipment upgrades, regulating campaign finance, and ensuring voter non-discrimination. Most aspects of voting and administering elections fall to the states, territories, and local election jurisdictions. States retain authority over election administration, voting methods, voter eligibility, and election security. The federal government primarily supports state, territorial, and local election jurisdictions, ensuring compliance with federal law. The Constitution and federal statutes establish the federal role in U.S. campaigns and elections. The Constitution assigns specific powers and responsibilities for federal government in election administration, including criteria for House and Senate elections, congressional apportionment based on decennial census, and authority over judging elections. Article II sets criteria for presidential elections, including allocation of electors among states and Congress determining the time for choosing electors and casting ballots. The Constitution outlines federal government powers in election administration, including criteria for House and Senate elections, congressional apportionment, and authority over judging elections. Congress determines the nationwide date for presidential electors to cast ballots. Amendments like the Twelfth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth, and Twenty-sixth address voting rights issues. Several major statutes impact the federal role in U.S. campaigns and elections. Modern campaign finance law originated in the 1970s with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and subsequent amendments. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) in 2002 made significant changes, including banning \"soft money\" in federal elections and increasing contribution limits. The Federal Election Commission was established as the enforcement agency for campaign finance laws. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) was enacted in 2002 after the disputed 2000 presidential election. It remains the primary federal statute for election administration, authorizing payments to improve election processes and requiring states to establish voter registration databases and provide provisional ballots. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 established the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to oversee election administration, disburse federal payments to states, conduct research, develop voting system guidelines, and accredit testing laboratories. It also created working relationships with other entities, expanded protections for military and overseas voters, and provided enforcement authority to the Justice Department. The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 established protections for military and overseas voters' access to election information and absentee ballots. Key provisions include requiring states to provide voter-registration materials at certain governmental agencies, accepting registration applications by mail using a federal form, restricting voter list purging, allowing address corrections at polling places, and designating a chief state election official for compliance. The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 established protections for military and overseas voters' access to election information and absentee ballots. It requires states to designate a chief state election official for compliance. The act also interacts with the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act and the Voting Rights Act. The Justice Department enforces NVRA civilly, and Congress has enacted laws to assist military voting since the Civil War. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) applies to eligible members of the U.S. military and other uniformed services serving away from home for voting, as well as their spouses, dependents, and overseas civilians. It encourages states to make voting easier for military and overseas voters by accepting absentee ballots without notarization, processing UOCAVA absentee ballots quickly, and providing outreach and assistance for military voting. The Justice Department enforces some UOCAVA provisions, and Congress enacted the Electoral Count Act in 1887 to address voting procedures. The Electoral Count Act of 1887, along with the Twelfth Amendment, establishes procedures for electoral college actions and Congress's joint session to certify results. State and federal laws address qualifications and vacancies among officeholders. The Federal Contested Elections Act applies to contested U.S. House elections, focusing on procedural and judicial provisions. Federal law has increasingly protected voting rights for over 50 years. The Electoral Count Act of 1887 and the Twelfth Amendment establish procedures for electoral college actions and Congress's certification of results. Federal laws have protected voting rights for over 50 years, including laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act (VAEHA) which aim to make voting easier for those who are disabled or elderly. The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act (VAEHA) was enacted in 1984 to make polling places and registration locations accessible to disabled or elderly voters. The Voting Rights Act (VRA) was originally enacted in 1965 to address voter suppression during the civil rights movement, with subsequent extensions and amendments. The 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, impacting the act's coverage formula for jurisdictions with a history of discrimination. The Voting Rights Act (VRA) prohibits states from using race-based qualifications in voting and redistricting, and allows for monitoring of elections by the Justice Department. Section 5 required preclearance for voting changes in certain jurisdictions, but is now inoperable after Section 4(b) was invalidated by the Supreme Court in 2013. The Voting Rights Act prohibits discrimination in voting based on race, color, or minority language status. The Justice Department monitors elections to protect voting rights and investigates prohibited election conduct. Federal statutes also address redistricting and apportionment. Title 18 of federal law prohibits various criminal activities related to campaigns and elections, including voter intimidation, fraudulent voter registration, and foreign nationals making campaign contributions. The U.S. Secret Service is authorized to protect major presidential candidates. Federal tax law also impacts campaign finance policy. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) contains provisions for the presidential public financing program and taxation of political campaigns, parties, and political action committees. It also regulates politically active tax-exempt groups and requires broadcasters to offer favorable rates for political advertising. Telecommunications law includes the \"lowest unit charge\" provision for campaign ads and mandates broadcasters to maintain a political file. The law requires broadcasters to maintain a \"political file\" of candidate requests for advertising purchases. Homeland security and cybersecurity statutes give authority to federal agencies in elections. The 2017 critical infrastructure designation has established new election roles for the Department of Homeland Security. Congress affects elections through legislation on campaign finance and voting rights. Additional provisions are included in the report's Appendix. Members of congressional leadership play a significant role in campaigns and elections, overseeing federal funds for election administration and appointments to key agencies. The Senate provides advice and consent for these duties. Around 22 congressional committees are involved in overseeing or appropriating funds for U.S. campaigns and elections. The Committee on House Administration and Senate Committee on Rules and Administration have primary jurisdiction over federal elections, overseeing the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Federal Election Commission (FEC). They also handle election contests within their chambers and provide guidance on chamber rules affecting campaigns. Congress appropriates funds for the EAC and FEC through omnibus appropriations laws. Other committees may address policy matters related to campaigns and elections. Table 3 provides a sample of federal election laws and campaign finance regulations. The House and Senate have specific requirements for air-travel provisions under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. Senate political committees file disclosure reports on paper with the Secretary of the Senate, while other federal political committees file electronically with the FEC. House and Senate rules govern Member and staff conduct during federal campaigns, including prohibitions on campaign activity in congressional offices and blackout periods for certain communications. The federal agencies involved in regulating U.S. campaigns and elections are briefly summarized in this section. The report does not delve into detailed discussions beyond their election responsibilities. The discussion is divided into agencies primarily focused on campaigns or elections, and those serving other policy areas with secondary election duties. Congress established guidelines for Member and staff activity during federal campaigns, including prohibitions on campaign activity in congressional offices and blackout periods for certain communications. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established by Congress in 2002 under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). It is the sole federal agency dedicated to election administration, coordinating best practices with states, providing voluntary certification of election equipment, and distributing HAVA federal funding. The EAC commissioners also serve on the Election Infrastructure Subsector Government Coordinating Council (EIS GCC) to coordinate information-sharing with other federal agencies and election administrators. HAVA generally prohibits the EAC from engaging in rulemaking, with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) being the only federal agency with that authority. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) enforces federal campaign finance laws, administers disclosure of campaign finance reports, and provides compliance guidance. The Census Bureau provides data for congressional apportionment and redistricting, conducts post-election surveys, and NIST offers technical assistance for elections. The NIST director advises on the EAC's Voluntary Voting System Guidelines and consults with the Defense Department's Federal Voting Assistance Program on cybersecurity and electronic ballot transmission. The DOD's primary role in U.S. elections is facilitating ballot access for military servicemembers through the Federal Voting Assistance Program. UOCAVA ensures timely access to federal ballots for uniformed services and overseas civilians. The U.S. Postal Service and DOD's Military Postal Service Agency handle mail for military personnel. DOD entities counter foreign threats to elections and National Guard units assist with election cybersecurity. Congress authorized DOD to address election cybersecurity vulnerabilities in exercises. HAVA funding supports voting access for disabled individuals. Department of Health and Human Services distributes funding for voting among disabled Americans. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a significant role in elections, designated as the Sector-Specific Agency for Elections Infrastructure Subsector (EIS). This includes prioritizing support for election jurisdictions, sharing threat information, monitoring systems, conducting vulnerability assessments, and assisting with identifying/responding to threats like cyberattacks. DHS serves as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Elections Infrastructure Subsector, coordinating information-sharing among governmental and nongovernmental entities involved in election administration. It also coordinates activities for the EIS Government Coordinating Council and assists the Sector Coordinating Council. The critical infrastructure designation does not grant regulatory authority over federal elections. Additionally, through the U.S. Secret Service, DHS protects major presidential candidates. The U.S. Secret Service, under DHS, protects major presidential candidates and leads security for national special security events. The Justice Department investigates and enforces federal election laws, including campaign finance violations and vote fraud. DOJ also collaborates with other agencies to respond to election interference. The FBI, a part of DOJ, conducts investigations related to election crimes. The FBI, under the DOJ, investigates violations of campaign finance and election laws, as well as other federal statutes. They contributed to an Intelligence Community Assessment on foreign influence in the 2016 elections. Annual financial reports to the Labor Department include union political activities supporting or opposing candidates. The State Department supports overseas civilian access to absentee ballots through UOCAVA, while the Global Engagement Center counters foreign propaganda. The Global Engagement Center (GEC) collaborates with various U.S. government agencies to counter propaganda and disinformation targeting U.S. national security. The Department of the Treasury, including the IRS and FinCEN, may assist in investigations related to election interference and prohibited foreign influence. The GEC also works with the Justice Department to administer sanctions in response to election meddling. The Department of the Treasury, including FinCEN, collaborates with the Justice Department and State Department to administer sanctions in response to election interference. Political advertising regulation falls under campaign finance law enforced by the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department. The Federal Communications Commission oversees telecommunications laws related to candidate advertising. The Intelligence Community focuses on foreign actors in security issues affecting campaigns and elections. The Intelligence Community (IC) focuses on foreign actors and security issues in campaigns and elections, not US political processes or public opinion. Reports of foreign interference in the 2016 election led to increased federal attention on intelligence and security concerns. A declassified Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) released on January 6, 2017, detailed Russian attempts to influence the 2016 US elections, leading to congressional oversight and federal activity on election security. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) communicates with states on election matters. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) administers communication with states during the electoral college process, transmitting state election certificates to Congress for counting electoral college results. The Voting Rights Act (VRA) authorizes federal election observers deployment by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The U.S. Access Board ensures equal access for disabled individuals to federally funded facilities. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires Access Board members' appointment to the Election Assistance Commission's (EAC) Board of Advisors and Technical Guidelines Development Committee. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights investigates discrimination based on color and race. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights investigates discrimination based on various factors. This includes research on voting and political participation. The VRA authorizes the commission to designate jurisdictions for post-election surveys. HAVA requires Civil Rights Commission members to be appointed to the EAC's Board of Advisors. Election administrators and political campaigns rely on the USPS for election and political mail. Courts do not have policymaking roles in U.S. campaigns and elections. Federal courts play a significant role in interpreting statutes related to campaign finance and elections, especially on constitutional questions like protected political speech. They can order federal election monitors to protect voting rights and adjudicate election disputes. The federal courts play a crucial role in adjudicating election disputes and interpreting laws related to campaign finance and elections. Despite limited involvement in administering elections, the federal government focuses on issues like transparent campaign financing, protecting voting rights, and upgrading election equipment. New challenges, such as threats from foreign actors and cyberattacks, highlight the need for federal intervention in campaigns and elections. The federal government's role in campaigns and elections is complex and interdisciplinary, with no single agency providing overarching coordination. Only the EAC and FEC focus solely on campaigns and elections policy. Greater coordination across agencies may be beneficial, but some argue that the existing system is based on unique statutes and agency expertise. Regulating campaigns and elections depends on connections to candidates and voting. Congress has the authority to regulate conduct related to campaigns and elections, but certain topics like issue advocacy and foreign propaganda are typically regulated outside of campaign finance laws. If Congress decides to expand regulations in the future, it may impact existing statutes and agencies discussed in this report."
