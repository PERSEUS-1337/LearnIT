    "content": "The \"Continuity in Representation Act of 2005\" requires special elections to be held to fill vacancies in the House in extraordinary circumstances. Section 26 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (2 U.S.C. 8) is amended to include special rules for holding special elections in extraordinary circumstances to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives. A special election must take place within 49 days after the Speaker of the House announces the vacancy, unless specified otherwise within a 75-day period. During the 75-day period after the announcement of a vacancy in the House of Representatives, a special election must be held either through a regularly scheduled general election or another special election authorized by the state's chief executive. Political parties must nominate candidates within 10 days of the Speaker announcing the vacancy. In extraordinary circumstances, when vacancies in the House of Representatives exceed 100, the Speaker can announce special elections to be held by authorized political parties or through methods approved by the state to ensure timely elections. In extraordinary circumstances, the Speaker can announce special elections for House vacancies. For challenges to such announcements, specific rules apply: the action must be filed in the District Court of the vacant seat's Member within 2 days, heard by a 3-judge court, and a copy of the complaint delivered to the House Clerk promptly. The final decision in a House vacancy action must be made within 3 days and is not reviewable. The executive authority of the State with the vacant seat can intervene in support or opposition. Special elections must ensure absentee ballots for military and overseas voters are transmitted on time. In special elections to fill a vacancy in representation, the State must ensure timely transmission of absentee ballots to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters. Absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters must have their ballots or election materials accepted and processed by the State if received within 45 days after being transmitted. This also applies to the District of Columbia and territories. The subsection outlines the application of federal election laws to special elections in the District of Columbia and territories, ensuring compliance with laws governing elections for federal office. The curr_chunk lists federal election laws applicable to elections for federal office, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act, Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, National Voter Registration Act of 1993, Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Help America Vote Act of 2002. The curr_chunk mentions the Help America Vote Act of 2002 as one of the federal election laws applicable to elections for federal office. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 is one of the federal election laws applicable to elections for federal office. Passed by the House of Representatives on March 3, 2005."
