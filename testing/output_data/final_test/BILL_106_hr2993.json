The term \"unilateral medical sanction\" refers to restrictions on medicine or medical device exports imposed by the US for foreign policy or national security reasons, unless part of a multilateral regime agreed upon by other member countries. The President cannot impose unilateral agricultural or medical sanctions on a foreign country or entity without submitting a report to Congress describing the proposed actions and justifications. The President must submit a report to Congress justifying any unilateral agricultural or medical sanctions on a foreign country or entity. Congress must approve the report through a joint resolution. Existing unilateral agricultural or medical sanctions will cease immediately, except for those related to specific agricultural programs or activities. The President can impose sanctions on a foreign country or entity without following the usual procedures in certain circumstances, such as during a declaration of war or when the sanction involves agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices controlled for national security reasons. The President can impose sanctions on a foreign country for national security reasons, including the development of chemical or biological weapons. Sanctions on countries supporting international terrorism will not affect current prohibitions on US government assistance. Unilateral agricultural or medical sanctions imposed must terminate within 2 years unless extended by the President.

Sanctions on countries supporting international terrorism will not affect current prohibitions on US government assistance. Unilateral agricultural or medical sanctions imposed must terminate within 2 years unless extended by the President. The President submits a report to Congress recommending the continuation of sanctions for up to 2 years, and Congress must approve the recommendation through a joint resolution. Congressional procedures prioritize the referral of reports and joint resolutions to the appropriate committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The joint resolution must not be reported before the eighth session day of Congress after its introduction. If a committee has not reported the joint resolution within 30 session days of Congress after its introduction, the committee will be discharged from further consideration, and the resolution will be placed on the appropriate calendar. Floor consideration includes a motion to proceed. Floor consideration includes a motion to proceed with a joint resolution after the committee has reported or been discharged from further consideration. Any member of the House concerned can move to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution at any time. The motion to proceed with a joint resolution is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and privileged in the Senate, not debatable, and not subject to amendment. The motion to proceed with a joint resolution is privileged in the House of Representatives and the Senate, not debatable, and not subject to amendment, postponement, or reconsideration. If agreed to, the joint resolution remains unfinished business until disposed of, with limitations on debate. Debate on the joint resolution is limited to 10 hours, divided equally between those favoring and opposing it. A motion to limit debate is allowed and not debatable. Amendments, motions to postpone, proceed to other business, recommit the resolution, or reconsider the vote are not allowed. The final passage vote on a joint resolution occurs after debate and a quorum call. Appeals on procedural rulings are decided without debate. Coordination with the other house is required before passage of a joint resolution. The House follows specific procedures when receiving a joint resolution from the other House. The joint resolution is not referred to a committee, and the final passage vote is based on the resolution from the other House. The House has specific procedures for handling joint resolutions from the other House. Once a joint resolution is received, it cannot be considered if the House has already dealt with a resolution from its own origin. The House's action on the resolution from its own origin will be considered its action on the resolution from the other House. This subsection is enacted by Congress as a rulemaking power of the Senate and House of Representatives. The subsection is part of the rules of each House regarding joint resolutions, superseding other rules if inconsistent. Each House has the constitutional right to change its rules related to procedures. The export of agricultural commodities or medicine to countries supporting terrorism requires one-year licenses and cannot receive federal financing or subsidies. The section requires quarterly reports to be submitted to congressional committees by agencies issuing licenses. It takes effect 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
