    "content": "The issue of executive discretion in balancing the rule of law with modern crises has been a key debate in liberal democracies. The US Constitution is silent on emergency power, leading to varied approaches by Congress and the President over the past two centuries. In the past, Presidents acted without congressional approval during crises, risking impeachment. Congress would later ratify or indemnify the President's actions. In the twentieth century, a new pattern emerged in handling emergency actions. In the twentieth century, Congress began delegating emergency powers to the President, allowing for the use of extraordinary powers during times of crisis. This shift towards governing via emergency power has been common among liberal democracies. The debate over whether this undermines the rule of law or is a necessary feature of modern constitutional orders continues. An example of this delegation is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is a twentieth-century delegation of emergency authority that grants the President extensive power to regulate economic transactions during a state of emergency. Some argue that IEEPA has become a source of unchecked executive authority, while others believe it is used to implement the will of Congress. There has been little discussion about modifying IEEPA. Recent presidential actions have brought attention to emergency powers under the National Emergencies Act (NEA) and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Congress may need to address how it has delegated authority under these statutes and consider choices made in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018. The First World War saw significant economic mobilization in Europe, while the United States remained relatively secure from invasion. During the First World War, the United States, unlike Germany and Austria-Hungary, was not under threat of invasion. President Wilson sought pre-authorization from Congress for expanded powers, leading to the passage of 22 statutes granting him control over various sectors of the economy. The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) was one of these statutes, giving the President extensive control over international trade, investment, migration, and communications with enemy entities. The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) granted the President extensive powers to limit trading or communication with enemies of the United States, censor foreign communications, and restrict enemy insurance companies. Section 5(b) of TWEA allowed the President to investigate, regulate, or prohibit activities under his prescribed rules and regulations. The Trading with the Enemy Act granted the President powers to regulate transactions involving foreign exchange, gold, silver, currency, and transfers of credit or property between the United States and foreign countries. The President could require individuals to provide complete information and documents related to such transactions. During the Great Depression, liberal democracies delegated more authority to their executives, similar to wartime powers. The U.S. Congress expanded the Trading with the Enemy Act, allowing the President to declare emergencies in peacetime and assume broad economic powers. This delegation was justified by likening economic crises to war. During the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt likened the economic crisis to war, seeking broad executive power from Congress to combat the emergency. This delegation of authority was justified by comparing economic crises to armed conflict, blurring the lines between military and economic powers. During the Great Depression, President Roosevelt declared a bank holiday to combat the economic crisis, claiming authority under Section 5(b) of TWEA. Congress later ratified his actions through the Emergency Banking Relief Act, granting the President the power to regulate transactions during times of national emergency. The TWEA amendment granted the President extensive powers to regulate the national economy during times of war and national emergency. This included control over foreign exchange, banking transactions, and the seizure of private property. Following the end of World War II in 1945, the allied powers established institutions and agreements to promote peace and liberalize world trade. Despite this, the United States continued to utilize emergency powers, such as the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), during the Cold War to impose economic sanctions. Presidents declared national emergencies under TWEA, granting them expansive authority over economic transactions. In 1950, President Harry S. Truman used TWEA to impose economic measures during a national emergency. In 1950, President Harry S. Truman declared a national emergency under TWEA to impose economic sanctions on North Korea and China. Subsequent Presidents used this authority to impose sanctions on Vietnam, Cuba, and Cambodia. TWEA was also used by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson for various economic regulations and controls. President Lyndon B. Johnson and President Nixon both utilized Section 5(b) of TWEA to impose economic measures in response to international events, such as the devaluation of the pound sterling and the end of the U.S. dollar's convertibility to gold. This reliance on emergency powers shaped postwar sanctions regimes and U.S. international monetary policy, with states of emergency being a key component in these actions. In Vietnam, revelations of domestic spying, assassinations of foreign political leaders, and the Watergate break-in led Congress to focus on checking the executive branch. A bipartisan special committee chaired by Senators Frank Church and Charles Mathias reevaluated the President's emergency powers, revealing that the US had been in a state of national emergency since 1933 with 470 emergency statutes granting extensive discretionary powers to the Executive. The special committee chaired by Senators Church and Mathias reevaluated the President's emergency powers, questioning the ability of a democratic government to function under a state of emergency. TWEA was highlighted as a controversial statute, with concerns raised about granting dictatorial powers to the President. The Department of Justice stated that TWEA granted the President broad regulatory powers over foreign exchange, banking, and property during times of war or national emergency. Critics argued that TWEA gave the President unchecked authority without congressional oversight. The criticisms of TWEA focused on the lack of congressional oversight, time limits on emergency declarations, and unclear limits on economic powers. Professor Harold G. Maier highlighted concerns about the broad scope of TWEA's authority not being limited to actual emergency situations. The National Emergencies Act (NEA) of 1976 reformed emergency powers under the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), requiring congressional oversight and restrictions on declaring and duration of emergencies. Congress can terminate emergencies through a joint resolution. Congress addressed the termination of national emergencies and the complexities of the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). Congress focused on preserving existing regulations and improving future use of TWEA, with a subcommittee spending over a year on reform efforts. The resulting legislation amended TWEA to address these concerns. Congress amended TWEA to only apply during a time of war, expanded the Export Administration Act, and created the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to give the President limited powers during a national emergency. During a national emergency, the exercise of emergency authorities should be limited to specific circumstances constituting a real emergency and not for other purposes. The emergency should be terminated promptly when the factual emergency is over and not used for different situations. The state of national emergency should not become a normal state of affairs. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act empowers the president to regulate transactions involving foreign exchange and credit transfers related to foreign countries. During a national emergency, the president can investigate and regulate transactions involving foreign countries or nationals, including importing/exporting currencies or securities. They can also confiscate property of foreign entities during armed hostilities. During a national emergency, the president has the authority to confiscate property of any foreign person, organization, or country involved in hostilities against the United States. The confiscated property will be vested in an agency or person designated by the President, to be used in the interest of the United States. These powers can be exercised to address threats to national security, foreign policy, or the economy originating outside the United States. The President can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) during a national emergency to address threats to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. The President must consult with Congress before using IEEPA and report to Congress the circumstances necessitating the exercise of authority. The President must provide detailed information on the circumstances, threats, authorities, actions, and countries involved when invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) during a national emergency. Reporting on actions taken under IEEPA is required every six months. The emergency can be terminated by the President, Congress, or automatically. Congress has made several amendments to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), including changes to civil and criminal penalties, expanding its scope after 9/11, and requiring a joint resolution to terminate a national emergency. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) protects the exchange of information or informational materials with foreign persons not subject to sanctions. Amendments in 1988 and 1994 expanded the list of protected rights. Unlike the Trading with the Enemy Act, IEEPA does not allow the President to vest assets, but this was amended in 2001 under the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act grants the President the authority to confiscate property of foreign entities involved in armed hostilities or attacks against the United States, with the confiscated property being vested in designated agencies or persons for the benefit of the United States. The USA PATRIOT Act grants the President the authority to confiscate property of foreign entities involved in armed hostilities or attacks against the United States, with the confiscated property being vested in designated agencies or persons for the benefit of the United States. Attorney General John Ashcroft emphasized the need for law enforcement to have the ability to seize terrorist assets and impose criminal liability on those who support terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act grants the President the authority to confiscate property of foreign entities involved in armed hostilities or attacks against the United States. Criminal liability is imposed on those who knowingly engage in financial transactions involving the proceeds of terrorist acts. Section 159 of this bill amends section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to provide the President with authority to freeze certain foreign assets within the jurisdiction of the United States. The Emergency Economic Powers Act grants the President authority to seize foreign assets in case of an armed attack on the US or when authorized by Congress to use force against a foreign entity. Proceeds from seized assets must be placed in a segregated account and used as per statute. Section 159 also amends the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, with technical changes that won't affect current implementation. The government has not used the vesting power to seize Al Qaeda assets in the US, opting for forfeiture instead. The government has used the Emergency Economic Powers Act to confiscate foreign assets, with the first instance occurring in 2003 under Executive Order 13290 by President George W. Bush to assist Iraq's reconstruction. This excluded diplomatic property and assets attached in satisfaction of judgments against Iraq. The government confiscated foreign assets totaling about $300 million under Executive Order 13290 by President George W. Bush to assist Iraq's reconstruction. The funds were blocked and transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq for humanitarian needs, economic reconstruction, disarmament, civilian administration, and other purposes benefiting the Iraqi people. The DFI was established by UN Security Council Resolution 1483 to freeze assets of the former Iraqi government and Saddam Hussein's regime, administered by the United States for reconstruction projects and ministry operations. The USA PATRIOT Act amended Section 203 of IEEPA to include the power to block assets during investigations and clarified the type of property subject to IEEPA. It also added a provision for judicial review of determinations based on classified information. These amendments were meant to clarify and codify existing practices. Since its amendment in 1977, the President and Congress have increasingly used IEEPA to impose economic sanctions for U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. Despite being initially intended to limit emergency authority, the use of IEEPA in emergencies has grown in scale and duration. There have been 54 declarations of national emergency invoking IEEPA since 1977, lasting on average nearly a decade. Most emergencies target specific countries, but since 1990, non-geographically-specific emergencies have also been declared. Since 1990, Presidents have declared non-geographically-specific emergencies under IEEPA for issues like weapons proliferation, global terrorism, and cyber activities. The use of IEEPA has expanded to target groups and individuals, not just foreign governments. Congress has also directed or approved the use of IEEPA in statutes. IEEPA is frequently cited when the President declares a national emergency under NEA authorities. Since 1990, Presidents have increasingly utilized IEEPA to declare national emergencies, with 54 out of 61 declarations under the National Emergencies Act involving IEEPA. As of March 1, 2019, there were 32 ongoing national emergencies, with almost all involving IEEPA. On average, emergencies invoking IEEPA last nearly a decade, with the longest emergency declared by President Jimmy Carter in response to the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979. The Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 led to the first national emergency declared under the National Emergencies Act, invoking IEEPA. This emergency is still ongoing as of March 1, 2019, primarily to address ownership issues of the Shah's disputed assets. The length of emergencies invoking IEEPA has increased over the decades, with an average duration of 4 years in the 1980s, 10 years in the 1990s, and 11 years in the 2000s. The number of ongoing national emergencies has steadily grown since the enactment of IEEPA and the NEA, with an average of 14 ongoing emergencies each year between 1979 and 2019, most of which invoked IEEPA. President Jimmy Carter invoked IEEPA in the first national emergency declared during the Iranian hostage crisis, blocking economic contacts between the US and Iran. Subsequent executive orders expanded the scope, affecting all goods, money, and imports from Iran. Many executive orders invoking IEEPA have specific geographic limitations, such as prohibiting imports from Nicaragua and transactions with the Government of South Africa. However, some national emergencies lack explicit geographic restrictions, like President George H.W. Bush's declaration in response to chemical and biological weapons proliferation. President George W. Bush, President Barack Obama, and other presidents have declared national emergencies in response to various threats, including terrorism, transnational criminal organizations, and cyber-enabled activities. These emergencies have global provisions and have become more frequent in the past 40 years. The stated motivations for declaring national emergencies have also expanded in scope. The use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by presidents has evolved over time. Initially, declarations of national emergencies were based on specific geographies or government actions. However, the rationales have expanded to include human rights violations, civil rights abuses, and other issues. This trend has increased in the past twenty years, with presidents using IEEPA to address a wider range of targets. Presidents have expanded the targets of IEEPA sanctions over the past twenty years, targeting groups, political parties, terrorist organizations, and individuals. Initially, sanctions were directed at foreign governments but quickly expanded to include geographically defined regions. Orders have also targeted specific foreign persons and those determined to be associated with them. The President has ordered the blocking of property and interests in property of foreign persons involved in international narcotics trafficking in Colombia, as well as those who support these activities. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13219 in 2001 to target persons threatening international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans. This order removed the qualifier \"foreign,\" allowing individuals in the United States, including U.S. citizens, to be targeted. The order authorizes the blocking of property and interests of persons involved in international narcotics trafficking in Colombia and those who support these activities. The use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) has evolved over time, initially targeting foreign states but now including individual persons regardless of nationality or location engaged in specific activities. This expansion allows for the targeting of individuals within the United States, including U.S. citizens, who are involved in activities such as international narcotics trafficking. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is used by Congress to authorize the President to impose sanctions on individuals engaged in specific activities, regardless of nationality or location. This authority has been utilized outside of national emergencies, with Congress directing the President to block certain transactions and determine penalties for violations. This trend dates back to 1986 when the President was first directed to use IEEPA authorities to assist Haiti in recovering assets diverted by its former government. The President is directed by Congress to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to assist Haiti in recovering assets stolen by former president-for-life Jean Claude Duvalier and others associated with the regime. This legislative pattern has been followed in subsequent laws with slight variations in language. The President is mandated by Congress to impose sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to block transactions involving property of individuals determined to be subject to the sanctions. Violators will face penalties as outlined in the legislation. The President is required by Congress to impose sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, with violators facing penalties outlined in the legislation. Additionally, Presidents have used this Act to preempt or modify congressional activity, as seen in President Reagan's declaration regarding South Africa in 1985. In 1985, President Reagan declared a national emergency and limited transactions with South Africa, despite similar legislation in Congress. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act has been crucial for imposing sanctions and limiting economic transactions. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) allows the President to limit economic transactions in support of national security and foreign policy goals by blocking transactions, freezing assets, and taking specified actions related to property. This authority can be used once a national emergency is declared, allowing the President to investigate, regulate, or prohibit foreign exchange transactions, transfers of credit, transfers of securities, and payments. The President has prohibited transactions and blocked property of individuals engaged in various activities such as malicious cyber-enabled activities, illicit narcotics trafficking, human rights abuses, corruption, and disrupting the Middle East peace process. This is done under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to support national security and foreign policy goals. The President has taken various actions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to prohibit transactions and block property of individuals involved in activities such as cyber attacks, narcotics trafficking, human rights abuses, corruption, and disrupting the Middle East peace process. This includes imposing maritime restrictions, prohibiting transactions related to weapons of mass destruction, deterring weapons programs of specific countries like Iran and North Korea, and blocking property of those engaged in cyber activities compromising critical infrastructures or human rights abuses. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) has been used by the President to target individuals involved in human rights abuses or corruption, blocking their property and transactions. While IEEPA has not been used to impose tariffs on imported products or enact primarily domestic policies, scholars suggest that its use in these scenarios could be permissible due to the global economy's interconnectedness. The disposition of frozen assets under IEEPA can serve as leverage for economic sanctions. IEEPA is a tool used for economic sanctions to influence foreign actors' behavior. Presidents have utilized frozen assets to resolve foreign policy issues, such as President Carter freezing Iranian assets during the hostage crisis in 1979. The blocked assets were later used to repay Iran. During the hostage crisis in 1979, frozen Iranian assets were used to repay outstanding U.S. bank loans, returned to Iran, transferred to a security account in the Hague for U.S. claims, and remained blocked pending further agreement. The United States also froze assets of the former Shah's estate and close relatives, which were unsuccessfully litigated for return to Iran. President Reagan recognized Delvalle as the legitimate head of government after he tried to dismiss General Noriega, leading to his own dismissal by the Panamanian Legislative Assembly. Economic sanctions were imposed on the Noriega regime, with U.S. banks advised not to disburse funds to them. Executive Order 12635 was issued to block all property and interests of the government of Panama, and regulations were put in place to require companies owing money to Panama to pay into an escrow account. After the U.S. invasion of Panama, frozen funds were used to repay debts owed by Panama to foreign creditors, with remaining funds returned to the successor government. In a similar case, the Trump Administration allowed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 access to Venezuelan government assets held in the United States. President Obama initially froze Venezuelan government assets in 2015. The Trump Administration froze Venezuelan government assets in 2015 and imposed new sanctions under IEEPA to freeze the assets of the main Venezuelan state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (Pdvsa). This action could significantly reduce funds available to the regime of Nicolas Maduro and channel them to Guaid\u00f3. There is precedent for using frozen foreign assets for purposes authorized by the U.N. Security Council, as seen in the case of frozen Iraqi assets after the first war with Iraq. The President used the UNPA and IEEPA to transfer funds for humanitarian relief and the United Nations Compensation Commission. Iraqi assets remained frozen until vested in 2003. In other cases, frozen assets were returned to successor governments, such as $237.6 million to the Central Bank of Yugoslavia and $217 million to the Afghan Interim Authority. The executive branch has typically opposed congressional involvement in such matters. Since 1996, U.S. nationals victimized by state-supported terrorism from designated countries have been able to sue for damages under an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Congress passed Section 117 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, allowing attachment and execution against state property for payment of judgments. Section 117 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, allows attachment and execution against state property for payment of judgments related to state-supported terrorism. The waiver authority granted to the President in this section has been used to protect blocked foreign government assets from attachment to satisfy terrorism judgments. Congress has taken additional actions to make frozen assets available to judgment holders, including mandating payment from frozen Cuban assets for compensatory damages awarded against Cuba under the FSIA terrorism exception. The Department of the Treasury vested funds from long-distance telephone services to compensate claimants in lawsuits against Cuba for terrorist acts. Congress enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to make frozen assets of terrorist states available to satisfy judgments for compensatory damages. In cases where a person has a judgment against a terrorist party for an act of terrorism, their blocked assets can be used to satisfy the compensatory damages. Waiver authority is provided for frozen foreign government property under certain conditions. Congress amended the FSIA in 2008 to revamp the terrorism exception, allowing judgments to be satisfied from the property of a foreign state, even if regulated by the US government. Proceeds from sanctions violations are directed to compensate former hostages of Iran and terrorist state judgment creditors. Certain real property and bank accounts owned by Iran can go into the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, along with $1,025,000,000 from a settlement agreement. The United States replenishes a fund through penalties and forfeitures for violations of sanctions regulations. Lawsuits challenging actions under IEEPA have mostly failed, with few successful challenges not seriously undermining the sanctions scheme. Presidential power under IEEPA remains broad. The Supreme Court's 1981 opinion in Dames & Moore v. Regan illustrates the broad presidential power under IEEPA. In this case, President Carter's executive order enforced compliance with the Algiers Accords to end the hostage crisis with Iran, requiring termination of legal proceedings, nullification of attachments and judgments, and resolution of claims through binding arbitration in the IUSCT. The President revoked licenses related to Iranian funds and nullified non-Iranian interests in assets acquired after a previous blocking order. The Supreme Court's 1981 opinion in Dames & Moore v. Regan showcased the broad presidential power under IEEPA. President Carter's executive order enforced compliance with the Algiers Accords, nullifying attachments and judgments, and directing claims to be resolved through arbitration in the IUSCT. The order revoked licenses related to Iranian funds and nullified non-Iranian interests in assets acquired after a previous blocking order. Subsequently, Dames and Moore sued the government, claiming that the President and Secretary of the Treasury exceeded their powers in affecting the case against Iran. The Supreme Court's 1981 opinion in Dames & Moore v. Regan highlighted the broad presidential power under IEEPA. The government's actions affected Dames and Moore's judgment against Iran, prejudgment attachments, and ability to litigate against Iranian banks. The government defended its actions based on IEEPA but the Court noted that while IEEPA did not directly authorize the President's suspension of claims, Congress' legislation suggested a general acceptance of the President's actions. The Supreme Court's 1981 opinion in Dames & Moore v. Regan emphasized the broad presidential power under IEEPA, highlighting that Congress cannot anticipate every action the President may need to take. Congressional silence does not imply disapproval, and legislative intent to grant the President discretion can be seen as an invitation for independent presidential responsibility, especially in foreign policy and national security matters. The Supreme Court's 1981 opinion in Dames & Moore v. Regan emphasized the broad presidential power under IEEPA, highlighting that Congress cannot anticipate every action the President may need to take. The Court cited Justice Frankfurter's concurrence in Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer to support the long-standing presidential practice of settling international claims by executive agreement. This practice, known to Congress and never questioned, can be considered a gloss on the President's Executive Power. Therefore, Congress's exclusion of certain express powers in IEEPA does not necessarily prevent the President from exercising them, especially when sufficient precedent exists. Lower courts have also examined IEEPA under various constitutional doctrines. Courts have upheld Congress's delegation of authority to the President to legislate new crimes, citing the \"intelligible principle\" requirement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) sufficiently constrains the President's discretion by limiting the exercise of authority to deal with national emergencies. A national emergency has been declared, with authorities delegated and defined. The Second Circuit upheld the constitutionality of IEEPA, stating that it pertains to foreign affairs where the President has greater discretion. The Eleventh Circuit examined whether Section 207(b) of IEEPA constitutes an unconstitutional legislative veto. In U.S. v. Romero-Fernandez, defendants argued that they violated an executive order issued under IEEPA. The Eleventh Circuit upheld the defendants' convictions for violating IEEPA regulations despite finding the legislative veto provision unconstitutional. Courts have also considered if actions under IEEPA violate the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prohibits private property from being taken for public use without just compensation, including regulatory takings that decrease property value. The Supreme Court ruled that nullifying prejudgment attachments under IEEPA regulations was not an uncompensated taking due to the contingent nature of the licenses. The broader purpose of the statute supported this view, allowing the President to control foreign assets through blocking orders. The President can control foreign assets through blocking orders, using them as a bargaining chip in negotiations during a national emergency. Individual claimants cannot minimize this bargaining chip through attachments or garnishments. Sanctions under IEEPA do not constitute a regulatory taking requiring compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The court ruled that suffering economic loss from sanctions alone does not qualify as a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment. Entities affected by sanctions imposed under IEEPA are unlikely to receive compensation for their losses. Persons whose assets have been blocked by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have found little success in challenging the loss of their assets. Courts have recognized that temporary blocking of assets does not constitute a taking because it does not vest title in the United States. However, some courts may analyze the initial blocking of assets under a Fourth Amendment standard for seizure. Some individuals argue that their right to due process has been violated. Some individuals claim their right to due process was violated when their assets were blocked by OFAC. Courts have found that temporary deprivation of property does not always require prior notice or a hearing, citing national security concerns in OFAC cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the designation of a charitable organization as a terrorist group and the blocking of its assets, stating it was necessary to combat terrorism and prevent asset transfers. The court also considered whether the organization's right to due process was violated by OFAC's use of classified information and lack of adequate notice and opportunity to respond. The Ninth Circuit applied the Eldridge test to determine if an individual received due process in the case of Al Haramain, finding the organization's property interest significant as OFAC's designation completely shut down its operations and froze all assets. The court found that civil penalties apply for unwitting violations, while criminal penalties, including up to 20 years' imprisonment, apply for willful violations. Designation as a restricted entity renders a domestic organization financially defunct indefinitely, despite the possibility of seeking administrative reconsideration and limited judicial relief. The government's interest in national security was emphasized, with the Ninth Circuit highlighting the importance of maintaining procedures in line with constitutional requirements. The Ninth Circuit emphasized the government's obligation to ensure fairness and protect private party interests in its procedures. Despite previous concerns about using undisclosed information, the court found that in this case, the presumption of unconstitutionality was overcome. While OFAC's failure to provide an unclassified summary was a due process violation, the court deemed it harmless. The Ninth Circuit found that while there was a violation of the organization's due process rights, the error was deemed harmless as it would not have affected the case's outcome. The organization argued that it was denied adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard by OFAC, which had failed to disclose reasons for its investigation and designation. Despite being deprived of due process rights, the court also considered this error to be harmless. Some courts have examined whether asset blocking under IEEPA regulations violated First Amendment rights, but challenges on these grounds have generally failed. Courts have ruled that there is no First Amendment right to support terrorists. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit distinguished advocacy from financial support, stating that blocking assets only affected the ability to provide financial support, not freedom of association. Additionally, a district court determined that government actions prohibiting charitable contributions are subject to intermediate scrutiny, not strict scrutiny. The district court applied a test to determine the lawfulness of designations and blocking actions, citing the Supreme Court's opinion in United States v. O'Brien. The government regulation must be within constitutional power, further an important governmental interest unrelated to free expression suppression, and the restriction on First Amendment freedoms must be essential to that interest. The court found the government's actions in issuing the Executive Order to be constitutional as it promotes the important government interest of preventing terrorist attacks. The restrictions on First Amendment freedoms are deemed necessary and not excessive. However, an appellate court found that a regulation barring coordinated advocacy with designated organizations based on content was subject to strict scrutiny. The court rejected the government's reliance on Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, finding that the regulation implicated the organization's right to free speech. The Export Control Reform Act of 2018 replaced the Export Administration Act, which was enforced through IEEPA by President Reagan after its expiration. The Export Administration Act of 1979 expired, leading to a national security threat. Presidents used IEEPA to maintain export controls during lapses. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13222 in 2001 to address the national emergency. The Export Administration Act of 1979 expired, leading to a national security threat. Presidents used IEEPA to maintain export controls during lapses. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13222 in 2001 to address the national emergency. Presidents Obama and Trump annually extended the 2001 executive order, with courts generally upholding the authority granted by IEEPA for these actions. The EAA regulations were made inoperative by the lapse of the EAA and could not be reinstated through executive order under IEEPA. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the application of the EAA as a statute allowing the government to withhold information under FOIA exemption 3, even though the EAA had expired. The court referred to legislative history as approval of using IEEPA to continue EAA provisions during lapses. The court upheld the application of the EAA provisions during lapses, citing legislative history supporting the use of IEEPA to continue EAA regulations. Congress acted with knowledge of the EAA's confidentiality provisions, and the President's practice of extending the EAA always included these protections. The D.C. Circuit later addressed appellate jurisdiction over a case involving sanctions for violating EAA regulations. The D.C. Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review the company's appeal directly, as the President does not have the authority to confer jurisdiction on the court under IEEPA. The appeal of the agency decision was determined to belong in the district court according to the default rule. The agency decision was determined to belong in the district court under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Congress may need to address issues regarding the delegation of authority under IEEPA and the NEA, as well as choices made in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018. The use of emergency powers under IEEPA has expanded despite efforts to restrain it, with presidents declaring and renewing national emergencies for extended periods. Globalization has diminished the limitation of IEEPA to transactions involving foreign interests, as most transactions now have some foreign involvement. Many criticisms of TWEA that IEEPA was meant to address, such as consultation and time limits, remain unresolved. Many criticisms of the NEA and IEEPA include the broad interpretation of \"national emergency\" and expanded presidential authority in a globalized era. Congress may now require a two-thirds majority to terminate a national emergency, despite scholars' concerns. The absence of explicit disapproval from Congress regarding the presidential use of IEEPA, along with some instances of approval, suggests possible congressional endorsement of its effectiveness. IEEPA requires a national emergency declaration based on an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. Fred Bergsten praised this requirement during the House markup of IEEPA. The language of \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" in the IEEPA statute emphasizes that such powers should be reserved for true emergencies. Congress could clarify the meaning of \"national emergency\" through statute or require factual findings by a court before exercising authority. The ambiguity in the existing statute may provide the executive with flexibility to address national emergencies promptly. While IEEPA applies to foreign transactions, the broad scope of \"any interest of any foreign country or a national\" raises concerns. The breadth of the phrase \"any interest of any foreign country or a national thereof\" in the IEEPA statute allows for executive discretion in foreign transactions. Presidents have utilized IEEPA since the 1980s to control exports during times when the Export Administration Act periodically expired. The current emergency declaration has been in place since 2001. The current emergency, ongoing since 2001, allows for executive discretion in foreign transactions under IEEPA. While Presidents have used IEEPA for trade restrictions against adversaries, it has not been used for imposing tariffs broadly. President Nixon used TWEA to impose a 10% tariff to address a balance of payments crisis. The scope of powers under IEEPA allows the President to prohibit financial transactions with designated individuals. The President can block financial transactions with designated individuals using IEEPA, which may exceed Congress's original intent. Congress can terminate a state of emergency under NEA with a resolution, but the Supreme Court's ruling requires a veto-proof joint resolution. Congressional action to terminate emergencies under NEA has been limited, possibly due to the difficulty of obtaining approval. Congress could assert more authority over the use of IEEPA by amending the NEA or IEEPA to include a \"sunset provision\" or a review mechanism. Senator Mike Lee introduced the Global Trade Accountability Act of 2017 in the Senate to require the President to report to Congress on any proposed trade action, including the use of IEEPA. The proposal includes a temporary unilateral trade action for a 90-day period, requiring Congress to approve the President's action within 60 days. Senator Lee introduced a bill in the 116th Congress to amend the NEA, requiring an act of Congress within 30 days for a national emergency to continue. Another approach involves Congress passing a resolution of disapproval if IEEPA authorities are invoked, as seen in the Trade Authority Protection Act. Congress could use CRA-style procedures to pass a joint resolution of disapproval under IEEPA, allowing for expedited consideration. Alternatively, Congress could amend the current disapproval resolution process in IEEPA or the NEA. Professor Harold G. Maier criticized TWEA for its broad executive interpretations of powers, similar to IEEPA. Like TWEA, IEEPA is central to U.S. sanctions, granting the President broad legislative authority. IEEPA, like TWEA before it, is a key component of U.S. sanctions. Congress has often approved the President's use of IEEPA, even directing sanctions without an emergency declaration. Concerns over the broad powers granted by IEEPA have been addressed by supporters who argue that Congress has implicitly and explicitly approved its use. In 2018, Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA), which repealed the expired Export Control Act. The Export Control Reform Act (ECRA) repealed the expired Export Administration Act of 1979 and became the new statutory authority for Export Administration Regulations. However, some export controls from the old act were not updated in the ECRA, requiring the President to continue using IEEPA for implementation. Congress may need to revisit these provisions related to deterring weapons of mass destruction proliferation."
