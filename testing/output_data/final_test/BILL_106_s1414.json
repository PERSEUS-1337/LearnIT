    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Equity and Payment Simplification Act of 1999\". Congress finds that medicare beneficiaries in need of home health services fall into 4 categories: post-hospital, short-stay; medically stable, long-stay; medically complex, long-stay; and medically unstable and complex, extremely high-use. The interim payment system for home health services under the medicare program is causing unintended consequences for the sickest, most frail beneficiaries. The sickest, most frail Medicare beneficiaries are losing access to medically necessary home health services covered under the program due to low per beneficiary limits set by the interim payment system. This is making it impossible for high-quality, cost-effective home health agencies to continue providing services and compete with others. Medicare beneficiaries in certain regions have limited access to home health services compared to those in other areas, leading to varying health needs among home health beneficiaries nationwide. SEC. 3. PAYMENTS TO HOME HEALTH AGENCIES UNDER MEDICARE. Revision of Prospective Payment System under Medicare for home health agencies is amended to change the cost reporting periods, effective from October 1, 1999. The payment basis for prospective payment amount to be paid to home health agencies is also modified. The payment amount to a home health agency for services provided to a beneficiary under Medicare is determined based on the applicable amount specified for the fiscal year. The applicable amount for beneficiaries under Medicare is as follows: $2,603 for subparagraphs (A) and (E), $3,335 for paragraph (3)(B), $4,228 for paragraph (3)(C), and $21,864 for paragraph (3)(D). The amounts are adjusted annually starting from fiscal year 2001. The Secretary determines the home health market basket percentage increase for each fiscal year, applied to the mix of goods and services in home health services. The Secretary determines and applies 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) to the mix of goods and services in inpatient hospital services for the fiscal year, with an area wage adjustment factor for geographic differences in costs. The Secretary establishes area wage adjustment factors reflecting wage levels for home health services compared to the national average. Factors may be used from section 1886(d)(3)(E) for adjusting applicable amounts for medical supplies annually. The Secretary determines the percentage increase in average costs of medical supplies for the fiscal year. Beneficiaries eligible for post-hospital, short-stay services must have had a recent hospitalization and suffer from post-operative or post-trauma illnesses or injuries. Beneficiaries eligible for post-hospital, short-stay services must have had a recent hospitalization and suffer from post-operative or post-trauma illnesses or injuries. A medically stable, long-stay beneficiary is one who has not been hospitalized in the past 6 months, requires acute medical treatment at home, and has impairments in daily activities. A medically complex, long-stay beneficiary under this title has had multiple hospitalizations or admissions to skilled nursing facilities within the past year, requires acute medical treatment at home for illnesses or injuries, and is experiencing impairments in daily activities. Medically unstable and complex beneficiaries under this title have had multiple hospitalizations or admissions to skilled nursing facilities within the past 6 months, require acute medical treatment at home for illnesses or injuries, and are experiencing impairments in daily activities. Beneficiaries under this title with impairments in daily activities are determined for home health services based on physician diagnosis and assessment, without any financial relationship with the home health agency. The Secretary may increase payment to a home health agency if it has higher costs or provides services not reflected in the payment determination. Regulations will assist physicians in making these determinations. The Secretary publishes the applicable payment amount for home health services annually. If a beneficiary switches agencies, payments are prorated. Amendments are made to the Social Security Act. Amendments to the Social Security Act require unique identifiers for physician claims for home health services after October 1, 1998, and eliminate a subsection. Amendments to the Social Security Act in 1998 include changing the effective date to October 1, 1999, and eliminating a contingency reduction. Payment rates for home health agencies are now based on location rather than the patient, with adjustments to wage calculations. The amendments made in 1998 to the Social Security Act changed the effective date to October 1, 1999 for services provided by home health agencies."
