    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Workforce Democracy and Fairness Act\". It addresses the timing of elections. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to ensure employees have freedom in collective bargaining by determining appropriate bargaining units based on community of interest. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to consider various factors when determining appropriate bargaining units, such as similarity of wages, skills, and job functions, as well as the integration of work flow and bargaining history. Employees should only be excluded from a unit if their interests are significantly different from others. The proposed unit should include additional employees based on a sufficient community of interest, except for accretions to an existing unit where overwhelming community of interest is required. A hearing must be held at least 14 days after petition filing for appropriate consideration of bargaining units under the amended National Labor Relations Act. An appropriate hearing for bargaining units under the amended National Labor Relations Act should be non-adversarial, with the hearing officer responsible for identifying relevant pre-election issues. Parties can raise any relevant issue before the hearing closes. The amended National Labor Relations Act requires a non-adversarial hearing for bargaining units, with the hearing officer identifying pre-election issues. Parties can raise relevant issues before the hearing closes, and the Board must acquire a list of eligible employees from the employer after final determination of the bargaining unit. The employer must provide a list of eligible voters to all parties, including employee names and one additional form of contact information chosen by the employee. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 30, 2011. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
