    "content": "The \"Patent Reexamination Reform Act of 1994\" defines a third-party requester as a person who requests reexamination of a patent but is not the patent owner. This Act also amends reexamination procedures under section 302 of title 35, United States Code. The \"Patent Reexamination Reform Act of 1994\" allows any person to request reexamination of a patent at any time by the Office based on prior art or section 112 requirements. A written request with a reexamination fee must be submitted, detailing how prior art applies to each claim or how the patent fails to comply with section 112. The Commissioner will promptly send a copy of the request to the patent owner. Within three months of filing a reexamination request, the Commissioner will determine if a substantial new question of patentability is raised. This can be based on prior art, patent publications, or failure to comply with patent requirements. The Commissioner will make a determination on a reexamination request within three months to see if a substantial new question of patentability is raised. The determination will be final and nonappealable, and a record will be placed in the patent file. If no substantial new question is found, a refund of the reexamination fee may be issued. The Commissioner will order reexamination of a patent if a substantial new question of patentability is raised. The reexamination will follow procedures similar to initial examination, allowing the patent owner to propose amendments. In a reexamination proceeding based on a third-party request, any proposed amendment to the patent must not expand the scope of the existing claims. All documents filed by the patent owner or requester must be shared with the other party. If the patent owner responds to an Office action, the requester can submit written comments within a month. These comments are limited in scope. In reexamination proceedings, comments filed are limited to issues covered by the Office action or the patent owner's response. All proceedings will be conducted promptly within the Office. The patent owner involved can appeal adverse decisions on patentability under specific sections of the law. A third-party requester in reexamination proceedings can appeal favorable decisions on patentability of any claim of the patent. However, if they participate in an appeal by the patent owner, they are estopped from later challenging the validity of any patentable claim determined on appeal. Once an order for reexamination of a patent has been issued, neither the patent owner nor the third-party requester can file a subsequent request for reexamination until a reexamination certificate is issued and published. Once a final decision has been entered against a party in a civil action under section 1338 of title 28, they cannot request reexamination of any patent claim that was at issue in the civil action. \"Section 308 prohibits reexamination after a final decision in a civil action under section 1338 of title 28. This is a conforming amendment.\" (a) Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.--Amends section 7(b) of title 35, United States Code, regarding the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences' review of adverse decisions and determination of priority and patentability in interferences.\n(b) Patent Fees; Patent and Trademark Search Systems.--Amends section 41(a)(7) of title 35, United States Code, related to patent fees and unintentionally delayed responses in reexamination proceedings.\n(c) Appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.--Amends section 134 of title 35, United States Code, regarding appeals to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences. Section 134 of title 35, United States Code is amended to allow applicants, patent owners, and third-party requesters to appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences after certain rejections or decisions by the primary examiner, upon payment of the required fee. An applicant, patent owner, or third-party requester dissatisfied with a final decision in an appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences under section 134 of title 35, United States Code, may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In ex parte and reexamination cases, the Commissioner must provide the court with the grounds for the decision of the Patent and Trademark Office. Section 145 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to allow for a civil action to obtain a patent after section 134. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATES. This Act will take effect six months after enactment and apply to reexamination requests filed on or after that date."
