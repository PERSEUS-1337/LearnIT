    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Christen O'Donnell Equestrian Helmet Safety Act of 2013\". The Congress finds that head injuries are the leading cause of hospital admissions and death in horseback riders, with over 100 deaths per year from equestrian activities. In 2012, 68,000 people visited the emergency room due to horseback riding injuries, with head injuries accounting for 22% of visits. Horseback riding causes 11.7% of sports-related traumatic brain injuries, with children under 19 making 3,638 ER visits per year for such injuries between 2001 and 2009. Between 75-80% of head injuries in horseback riding accidents occur while mounted on a horse, where helmets are typically worn. Racing organizations mandate helmets, resulting in fewer head injuries for jockeys. The U.S. Pony Clubs reduced head injury rates by 29% through mandatory helmet use. ASTM/SEI certified helmets, when properly fitted, can decrease head injury-related deaths by 70-80%. SEC. 3. STANDARDS. Every equestrian helmet manufactured after 9 months from the enactment of this Act must meet the interim standard ASTM F1163 and the final standard established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 60 days of the Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission mandates that all approved equestrian helmets must meet the interim standard ASTM F1163 and be certified by an accredited organization according to ISO Guide 65. Certain laws do not apply to this proceeding. The final standard for equestrian helmets must be effective within 1 year of issuance. Failure to meet the interim standard results in violation of consumer product safety standards. The final standard will be considered a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is authorized $500,000 for fiscal year 2014. An approved equestrian helmet meets the interim and final standards specified in the Act. Equestrian helmets are hard shell head coverings for equestrian events."
