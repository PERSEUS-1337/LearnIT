    "content": "The \"Drill Now Act of 2008\" allows for leasing on the outer Continental shelf in previously closed areas. The term \"opened area\" refers to areas that were closed to oil or gas leasing before the enactment of the Act but are now available for leasing. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for overseeing these leasing activities. The \"Drill Now Act of 2008\" repeals certain sections of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act and amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act to open new offshore areas for oil and gas development. The United States can designate national defense areas on the outer Continental Shelf through the Secretary of Defense with the President's approval. The Secretary is allowed to conduct leasing activities for any opened area before June 30, 2012, even if it was not included in the leasing program. Leases for submerged land within 25 miles of a state's coastline must prohibit permanent surface occupancy. The Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit revenues from leased tracts in opened areas, with 50% going to the general fund and 50% to a special account for allocation among states. For fiscal year 2009 and onwards, funds from leased tracts are allocated among states based on a formula inversely proportional to the distance between the state's coastline and the geographical center of the leased tract. No state can receive funds from a leased tract if its geographical center is not within the state. For fiscal year 2009 and onwards, funds from leased tracts are allocated among states based on a formula inversely proportional to the distance between the state's coastline and the geographical center of the leased tract. No state can receive funds from a leased tract if its geographical center is more than 200 nautical miles from the coastline of that State. Amounts made available under this section shall be administered without further appropriation, remain available until expended, and be in addition to any amounts appropriated under other laws. Judicial Review: Complaints challenging actions under this section must be filed in a US district court within 90 days of the action, or within 90 days of new grounds arising. The complainant must have known about the grounds for the complaint. Complaints for judicial review of the Secretary's actions can only be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Judicial review of the Secretary's decision on lease sales is limited to certain aspects. Judicial review of the Secretary's actions is limited to compliance with specific laws and administrative records. The Secretary's preferred course of action for leasing is presumed correct unless proven otherwise. The Secretary's actions are presumed correct unless proven otherwise, and judicial review is limited to specific laws and administrative records. Actions subject to review under this section are not eligible for judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings. Section 433 of the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008, which restricted oil shale leasing, is repealed."
