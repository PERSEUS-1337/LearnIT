    "content": "Federal courts have gatekeeper doctrines like standing and political question to limit certain plaintiffs and claims. Standing requires showing injury, causation, and redressability to invoke jurisdiction. Plaintiffs in climate change cases face challenges due to these doctrines. Plaintiffs in climate change cases may struggle to meet standing requirements, such as proving causation for their injuries. Previous court decisions have granted standing to state plaintiffs but not necessarily to private plaintiffs. Courts have not extended standing to private plaintiffs in climate change cases, who often struggle to establish standing. State courts may offer an alternative, but cases involving out-of-state GHG emissions are likely to be removed to federal court. The issue of Article III standing will still need to be addressed, including the question of whether Indian tribes can establish standing through parens patriae status, a concept rejected in a specific case. In Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp., an Alaskan native village seeks damages for coastal erosion allegedly caused by climate change. Standing issues have arisen in cases challenging agencies' discussion of climate change in environmental impact statements. The political question doctrine seeks to restrain courts from interfering in government branches' business. Six factors indicate a non-justiciable political question. The Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr in 1962 outlined factors for determining political questions, setting a high threshold for nonjusticiability. This doctrine has been prevalent in climate change nuisance cases, with many courts rejecting claims based on it. In 2011, the Supreme Court announced a barrier to common-law-based climate change claims by the Clean Air Act, making it unnecessary for courts to address standing and political question issues. Proactive responses to climate change involve mitigation and adaptation, with legal issues discussed in different sections. The Supreme Court confirmed EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007. The Supreme Court confirmed EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007. The Court instructed EPA to reconsider its 2003 denial of a petition to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles, emphasizing that the CAA includes GHGs as air pollutants and does not allow for non-regulatory approaches based on policy qualms. EPA began adapting the CAA to address climate change, facing challenges due to the statute's focus on regional air pollution rather than global climate issues. The EPA issued several key rules regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These include the \"endangerment finding\" in 2009, which determined that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that endangers public health. This finding triggered a duty for the EPA to set emission standards for new vehicles. The \"tailpipe rule\" in 2010 set GHG emission and fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles from 2012-2016. The \"tailoring rule\" in 2010 also addressed GHG emissions from stationary sources. The \"tailoring rule\" in 2010 aimed to relieve permitting burdens on PSD and Title V authorities due to EPA's tailpipe rule. It set higher tonnage thresholds for BACT application in new major emitting facilities. The D.C. Circuit upheld these actions in 2012, with the Supreme Court later reviewing EPA's determination. The Supreme Court's certiorari was limited to the question of whether EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements for stationary sources emitting greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (UARG) in 2014, the Court ruled that EPA does not have unqualified authority to apply permitting requirements to stationary source GHG emissions. This decision clarified that the CAA's definition of \"air pollutant\" as including GHGs does not automatically apply to all sections of the Act, such as the PSD and Title V provisions. The Supreme Court's ruling in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA clarified that the Clean Air Act's definition of \"air pollutant\" as including greenhouse gases does not automatically apply to all sections of the Act, such as the PSD and Title V provisions. The Court found that extending \"air pollutant\" to GHG emissions would create a significant administrative burden due to low emission thresholds and a large number of sources emitting CO2. The Court also rejected EPA's attempt to phase in the emission thresholds through the \"Tailoring Rule\" and allowed PSD new-source permitting for GHG emissions from sources emitting conventional pollutants in threshold quantities. The Supreme Court's ruling in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA clarified that the Clean Air Act's definition of \"air pollutant\" as including greenhouse gases does not automatically apply to all sections of the Act. EPA may impose PSD new-source permitting on GHG emissions from sources emitting conventional pollutants in threshold quantities. The Court's decision in UARG is seen as a win for EPA, leaving intact the approval of EPA's endangerment finding for GHG emissions from new motor vehicles. President Obama's speeches have highlighted the importance of addressing climate change. President Obama's 2013 and 2014 State of the Union speeches aimed to reignite the climate change debate in Congress. He warned that if Congress did not act soon, he would use executive actions to address climate change. The President's Climate Action Plan, announced in June 2013, emphasized that many of these actions would fall under the Clean Air Act (CAA). This raises questions about whether the EPA's endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles compels similar findings for other emission sources under the CAA. The EPA's endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles may lead to regulatory action under CAA section 111 for new stationary sources. Other CAA provisions like section 108 could also be triggered. EPA has already proposed performance standards for GHG emissions from power plants. The EPA's endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles could lead to regulatory action under CAA section 111 for new stationary sources. Other CAA provisions like section 108 may also be triggered, requiring national ambient air quality standards. EPA has proposed performance standards for GHG emissions from power plants. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the question arises whether the agency can be compelled to act on petitions for endangerment findings under the Clean Air Act. Courts must determine which provisions impose nondiscretionary duties on the agency. There is also debate on whether cap-and-trade or other flexible approaches can be used for greenhouse gas emissions control under different CAA sections. The Clean Air Act does not explicitly mention cap and trade, but it is authorized in certain sections like subtitle IV and section 110(a)(2)(A). This raises questions about the authority for cap and trade in other CAA sections. The Clean Air Act does not explicitly mention cap and trade, but it is authorized in certain sections like subtitle IV and section 110(a)(2)(A). The question of CAA authority for GHG cap-and-trade programs remains open. EPA's proposed rule for GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, expected in June 2015, will likely be the first litigation test for cap-and-trade. EPA maintains that CAA section 111(d) is broad enough to allow compliance through cap and trade, despite ambiguities in subsections of CAA section 111. The EPA's proposed rules under sections 111(b) and 111(d) of the Clean Air Act will likely face litigation due to issues surrounding emission standards for new and existing stationary sources. The focus is on the phrase \"adequately demonstrated\" in the context of carbon capture and sequestration technology. The EPA's proposed rules under sections 111(b) and 111(d) of the Clean Air Act may face litigation over the use of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology for power generation. The debate centers on whether CCS is \"adequately demonstrated\" for power plants, with case law suggesting that the standard looks towards future projections rather than current technology. EPA's reliance on CCS in the proposed rule could raise concerns about compliance with emission reduction requirements. The EPA's proposed rules under sections 111(b) and 111(d) of the Clean Air Act may face litigation over the ban on requiring specific emission reduction systems to comply with NSPS. Section 111(d) mandates states to develop performance standards for existing sources, raising legal issues regarding regulating CO2 emissions from power plants due to conflicting amendments in the CAA. The EPA's proposed rules under sections 111(b) and 111(d) of the Clean Air Act may face litigation over conflicting amendments in the CAA regarding regulating CO2 emissions from power plants. The argument revolves around whether section 111(d) allows EPA to restrict GHG emissions from existing power plants and the degree of flexibility it provides. The EPA's proposed section 111(d) rule for regulating CO2 emissions from existing power plants is based on four \"building blocks\" to reduce emissions, including beyond the fenceline approaches like substituting natural gas or low-carbon generation. The EPA's proposed section 111(d) rule for regulating CO2 emissions from existing power plants includes building blocks for reducing emissions. The court may consider the difference between CO2 emissions and other pollutants in past regulations. EPA has authority to enforce a plan if a state fails to submit a satisfactory one. Some view the Endangered Species Act as a tool to challenge projects producing GHGs due to climate change effects on habitats. GHG emissions contribute to climate change, leading to adverse habitat changes and potentially causing a \"take\" of protected species in violation of the ESA. Lawsuits connecting the ESA to climate change focus on how agencies consider climate change when making determinations like listing a species or designating critical habitat. The ESA requires the Fish & Wildlife Service to consider habitat effects in these determinations, but case law does not clearly show the ESA's stance on climate change impacts. The ESA is not commonly used as an enforcement tool for climate change arguments. Regulatory changes were made in 2008 to limit lawsuits based on climate change impacts on species, but these changes were later halted by Congress. The ESA is not commonly used for climate change enforcement. Regulatory changes in 2008 limited lawsuits based on climate change impacts on species but were later stopped by Congress. Recent modifications reinforce that there is no requirement to consult on greenhouse gas emissions' contribution to global warming and its impacts on listed species. NEPA now mandates federal agencies to consider climate change impacts in environmental impact statements. The scope of effects has not expanded, likely due to existing regulations limiting review to certain effects with reasonable certainty. Another regulatory change restricts lawsuits for incidental takes of polar bears to actions in Alaska. The agency's proposed project must address climate change impacts, as highlighted in court decisions and guidance from the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). CEQ suggests including GHG emissions information in NEPA documentation for projects subject to reporting requirements. However, clear thresholds for EIS inclusion have not been established by court decisions. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) emphasizes the importance of considering climate change impacts in NEPA documentation for projects. However, there is ambiguity regarding the threshold for including climate change effects in Environmental Impact Statements (EISs), leading to a lack of uniformity in how federal agencies address climate change in their EISs. This inconsistency has prompted pressure on CEQ to finalize its draft guidance on considering climate change in NEPA environmental reviews. The legal issues surrounding climate change in NEPA environmental reviews, including state NEPA-like statutes, are complex. California courts have debated using future conditions as a baseline for evaluating environmental impacts. Carbon capture as a method to mitigate climate change has gained attention alongside emissions reduction strategies. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a process to capture CO2 emissions at their source and store them underground, instead of releasing them into the atmosphere. Legal issues surrounding CCS technology include ownership and control of underground pore space. CCS technology is still in early stages of development, with operational questions to be answered. Understanding these legal issues is crucial for the development of CCS technology. Legal issues surrounding CCS technology include ownership and control of underground pore space, federal and state agencies permitting and regulating CO2 pipelines, concerns over liability exposure hindering CCS technology development, and federal constitutional constraints on state action related to GHG emissions. Federal statutes like the Clean Air Act and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act have been invoked to argue for federal preemption of state laws affecting GHG emissions. The Clean Air Act (CAA) preempts state standards on emissions control for new motor vehicles, with an exception for California to request a waiver. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) focuses on corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE standards) and prohibits states from regulating in a manner related to fuel economy standards when a CAFE standard is in effect. Ambiguity exists on what actions are preempted, as seen in a case involving city regulations on taxicab leasing. The court granted a preliminary injunction to cab owners who were required to only lease hybrid vehicles, finding a likelihood of preemption under the Clean Air Act and Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The issue of state actions restricting GHG emissions interfering with national foreign policy has been raised in litigation, especially for states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative committed to finding solutions for GHG emissions from imported electricity generation. State regulation of imported electricity may face challenges under the Federal Power Act, especially if it indirectly impacts interstate wholesale power rates. The dormant commerce clause could also come into play to ensure state laws do not hinder interstate commerce. The Dormant Commerce Clause (DCC) prohibits state laws that discriminate against out-of-state commerce or impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. It also bans state laws that regulate extraterritorially. DCC issues have arisen in cases related to climate change, such as in Rocky Mountain Farmers Union v. Corey where California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard was challenged for favoring in-state fuel production over out-of-state production. The Ninth Circuit ruled 2-1 that no DCC violation existed in a case involving a Minnesota statute that prohibits importing power from outside the state without an offset to reduce CO2 emissions. The court held that treating fuel based on carbon intensity was not discriminatory based on its out-of-state origin and did not regulate extraterritorially. This contrasts with a federal district court in Minnesota that found a DCC violation in a similar case. The court ruled that a Minnesota statute regulating CO2 emissions from out-of-state electricity production does not violate the DCC's bar on extraterritorial regulation. Challenges may also arise from California's cap-and-trade system and SB 1368, which sets emission standards for power contracts. The DCC objections have been raised to a state's prohibition on using out-of-state renewable energy to meet its renewable energy requirements. Lawsuits and petitions have been filed in multiple states, arguing that the government has a responsibility to protect the atmosphere and address climate change. Our Children's Trust, an Oregon nonprofit, is coordinating these legal actions. The public trust doctrine, rooted in ancient common law, asserts that certain natural resources are held by the sovereign for the benefit of the public. Lawsuits are being filed in multiple states, including ones seeking to apply the doctrine to the atmosphere. Our Children's Trust, an Oregon nonprofit, is coordinating these legal actions. Lawsuits are being filed in multiple states, asserting that the atmosphere is a public trust resource and the government has a duty to protect it. Despite some courts ruling against the plaintiffs, there has been some acceptance of the arguments in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The suit against the United States was dismissed due to jurisdictional issues. In Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico, courts have considered the public trust doctrine regarding natural resources, including the atmosphere. While some cases were dismissed, others may proceed to the merits. Rulemaking petitions have been denied in 27 jurisdictions, indicating a trend of negative outcomes in public trust litigation. The public trust doctrine is being expanded through suits and petitions, but courts are hesitant to intervene in matters like climate change due to lack of clear liability guidelines. Predictions suggest that liability lawsuits related to climate change will increase. The standing and political question hurdles are challenges for climate change plaintiffs. In a Supreme Court case, it was ruled that the Clean Air Act prevents federal judges from setting their own limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The Clean Air Act displaces federal common law of nuisance for claims seeking abatement of emissions. Questions remain on whether climate change impacts can still lead to federal common law nuisance actions for monetary damages and if state law claims can withstand federal law rulings. In Comer v. Murphy Oil Co, Mississippi landowners' state and federal tort claims against oil, coal, and chemical companies emitting GHGs were denied. They argued property-related harms from Hurricane Katrina were due to the defendants' GHG emissions. The plaintiffs in Comer v. Murphy Oil Co. claimed that the defendants' GHG emissions contributed to the intensity of Hurricane Katrina and sought damages. The district court ruled in favor of the defendants, citing the Clean Air Act and res judicata. The litigation in Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp settled justiciability issues. Inupiat Alaska natives sued energy companies for relocation costs due to climate change. The Ninth Circuit found the monetary damages claim displaced but left open the possibility of a state common law claim. Federal and private insurers are aware of the potential for increased payments due to climate change and extreme weather events. While there are currently no insurance policies explicitly covering climate change injuries, policies do exist that cover related issues such as flood, wind, freezing, heat, earth movement, or collapse. Coastal hurricanes present a significant issue in insurance-coverage litigation related to climate change. The issue of hurricane damage litigation in the context of climate change revolves around determining whether the damage is wind-caused or flood-caused, as insurance policies only cover wind damage. This distinction is crucial in cases like Hurricane Katrina, where factual questions arise regarding coverage for wind-driven water (\"storm surge\") and man-made causes under flooding exclusions. The issue of hurricane damage litigation in the context of climate change revolves around determining coverage for wind-caused or flood-caused damage in insurance policies. Questions arise regarding man-made causes under flooding exclusions and liability for greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change-related damage. Some policies cover damage from \"pollution,\" defined as substances classified as pollutants under environmental laws. The AES Corp. v. Steadfast Ins. Co. ruling by the Virginia Supreme Court set a precedent where insurance companies may not be obligated to provide defense for climate change-related damage. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA may be crucial in expanding policy coverage for damage traceable to GHG emissions. The issue of sovereign nations' liability under international law for failing to reduce GHG emissions has long been debated, but there have been no successful efforts to impose such liability. Principles from the international law of transboundary pollution may be applied to claims alleging GHG-caused injury. The Trail Smelter arbitration decision established that states have a duty to prevent harm to other states from activities within their jurisdiction. International law claims related to climate change are challenging due to proving specific environmental harms and attributing responsibility. Only one climate-change-related international law action has been filed against the United States. The Circumpolar Conference filed a petition against the United States with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, alleging that the US violated Inuit human rights by failing to restrict GHG emissions and causing climate change. The Inuit's rights to culture, property, health, life, and physical integrity were affected. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights can recommend measures for human rights protection and request states to adopt precautionary measures in urgent cases. The Inuit petitioned the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights regarding the United States' role in climate change, seeking a report on responsibilities and corrective measures. The Commission declined to process the petition due to insufficient information. Climate change is expected to worsen water scarcity, particularly in the western United States, raising concerns about existing water rights. Water rights in the western United States are governed by the \"prior appropriation\" doctrine, where the right of use is based on putting water to \"beneficial use.\" The doctrine of reasonable use, as outlined in the California Constitution, aims to prevent unreasonable water use. This system operates on a \"first in time, first in right\" basis, with junior appropriators facing limitations during water shortages. In the western United States, water rights are governed by the \"prior appropriation\" doctrine, where senior appropriators have priority over junior appropriators during water shortages. Government response to water scarcity may involve cutbacks in consumption or changes in the water rights regime. The transfer of water rights is debated, with some advocating for more efficient outcomes and environmental goals. In the West, explosive population growth has occurred in communities with junior water rights, while senior water rights holders include older municipalities, mining, and agriculture. States have developed mechanisms to allocate water during scarcity, exempting certain domestic uses. Climate change may lead to increased conflicts between exempted users and senior appropriators. In some cases, exempted users may leapfrog over senior appropriators' rights subject to compensation for property taking. Groundwater issues may arise, with recent Texas Supreme Court decision claiming outright ownership similar to oil and gas. Conservation of groundwater can be done without takings if water supply problems are shared by the public. However, a court found the state's permitting system for groundwater withdrawals effected a regulatory taking. The court found that the state's permitting system for groundwater withdrawals from the Edwards Aquifer resulted in a regulatory taking of the plaintiffs' land, leading to conflicts between public water needs and those of fish in streams due to low precipitation periods. Court decisions have addressed claims of Fifth Amendment takings of water rights and government breach of water-supply contracts, focusing on the distinction between physical takings of water and regulatory takings of use rights. The physical versus regulatory takings issue has been contentious in court, especially regarding water rights. The government's ability to prioritize public interests, like fish preservation, over individual water rights has been debated. Sea level rise is also a factor in redefining land-water boundaries in common law. The common law addresses shifting land-water boundaries, determining ownership based on the speed of the shift. Gradual shifts result in accretion, enlarging the owner's tract, while erosion leads to landward boundary movement. Sudden shifts are treated differently regardless of the circumstances. Sudden shifts in the land-water boundary, known as \"avulsion,\" do not change ownership lines, unlike accretion and erosion. Events like hurricanes can abruptly move the high water mark on a beach, but property lines remain unchanged. The question arises whether sea level rise from climate change will be considered avulsive or erosive, with scholars predicting courts will likely view it as erosion. The impact of sea level rise from climate change on property ownership is a unique situation not fitting traditional common law rules. Scholars predict that rising sea levels will likely transform private property into public property, with courts leaning towards erosion rather than avulsion. This change is not seen as a violation of property rights under the Fifth Amendment. The public trust ownership of coastal submerged lands and the adjacent intertidal zone expands automatically when erosion occurs, according to case law authority. In McQueen v. South Carolina Coastal Council, the state's high court decreed that wetlands created by the encroachment of navigable tidal water belong to the state as public trust property. The state's presumptive title to tidelands is not defeated by the fact that the lands were upland when acquired and tidelands were subsequently created by rising tidal water. This extension of public trust lands in traditional common law does not result in a Fifth Amendment taking from beachfront property owners. The public trust doctrine may impact coastal property rights, potentially leading to a \"judicial taking\" if courts expand its scope. While the concept of judicial takings has been proposed, no court has made a final decision on it yet. Cases from Texas and North Carolina highlight the constitutional issues that could arise in the future. The case of Severance v. Patterson in Texas involves the Open Beaches Act and public-access easements on beaches, which can migrate with the dune vegetation line due to sea level rise. This resulted in private land being encumbered by the easement, leading to removal orders for houses like Carol Severance's after Hurricane Ike moved the vegetation line landward. The Texas Supreme Court narrowed the circumstances for public access easement rolls in response to Fifth Amendment takings and Fourth Amendment unreasonable seizure claims in the Severance v. Patterson case. The court ruled that existing public easements in Galveston's West Beach do not roll landward due to avulsive events, reversing previous interpretations of the Texas Open Beaches Act. The Texas court ruling questions whether sea level rise should be considered gradual or avulsive, similar to a case in North Carolina where homes were ordered to be demolished due to gradual beach erosion. Maine also has rules anticipating landward migration of beaches under the Natural Resources Protection Act. The Maine rules dictate that structures must be removed if a coastal wetland extends to them for six months, and projects in coastal sand dune systems are prohibited if they may be eroded within 100 years due to changes in the shoreline. Climate change may lead to new areas experiencing flooding, causing resistance in updating floodplain designations due to potential loss in property value. The potential for climate change-related litigation regarding federal liabilities in connection with the design, construction, and operation of levees and dams by the Army Corps of Engineers may arise due to damage from extreme weather or sea level rise. Two statutes limit the United States' tort liability for harms from extreme weather or sea level rise related to levee/dam design, construction, and operation. The Tort Claims Act limits tort actions against the United States based on discretionary functions, including decisions related to the design, construction, and operation of dams and levees. The government is not liable for climate-change-related flooding if protective measures like levees and dams were installed. The government is not considered liable for climate-change-related flooding if protective measures like levees and dams were installed. However, significant flood-related damage that would not have occurred without the levee or dam could be considered a potential taking, regardless of any benefits conferred by the project. The Arkansas Game & Fish Comm'n v. United States case has expanded the definition of takings to include temporary floods, even if repeated, depending on various factors. This decision may also apply to non-repeated temporary floods, such as one-time intentional releases of water from levees or dams due to extreme weather events from climate change. The Corps of Engineers may need to purchase more flowage easements to flood private land legally. Residents in Virginia's Middle Peninsula oppose the proposal to rezone land for a dike against rising water. Hampton Roads faces significant sea-level rise risk. The issue of takings claims arises if rezoning devalues parcels or is seen as a physical taking. Climate change's impact on sea level rise raises questions of government liability for inaction. Negligence may be a factor when a city fails to address a specific hazard. The court ruled that a city's failure to prevent overflow from landfills did not constitute a taking claim but was negligence. Adaptation measures for sea level rise include shoreline armoring with manmade structures. The right to erect shore defense structures on one's property is a long-standing issue. Some states prohibit armoring on oceanfront properties to allow natural landward migration of the land-water boundary due to sea level rise. This allows for the creation of new wetlands and expansion of public trust lands. However, concerns arise regarding the impact on private property rights and potential compensation for consequences like collapsing homes. The issue remains unresolved by limited relevant litigation. The issue of armoring on oceanfront properties to allow natural landward migration due to sea level rise remains unresolved by limited relevant litigation. A taking claim was rejected in the case of McQueen v. South Carolina Coastal Council, where the denial of permission to build a seawall was not considered a taking of the plaintiff's property. The court found that the land had largely reverted to public-trust tideland belonging to the state by the time of the application denial. In the absence of armoring restrictions, sea level rise may lead to more beachfront landowners installing defensive structures, raising questions about liability for harm to neighboring tracts. States have shifted from the common enemy doctrine to a rule of reasonableness regarding interference with surface waters. Clarification is needed on what constitutes \"reasonable\" interference. In United States (Lummi Nation) v. Milner, the Ninth Circuit ruled that armoring structures do not block the landward shift of the ownership line between public and private land. The tideland owner has the right to an ambulatory boundary, and the upland owner cannot permanently fix the property boundary without consent. The ruling may have limited applicability due to the involvement of an Indian tribe and its federal trustee. The federal court created federal common law in a case involving tideland/upland boundaries, which is usually handled by state courts. A New Jersey municipality condemned an easement to build a dune on private beachfront property for storm protection, leading to a compensation dispute over the dune's impact on ocean views. Compensation awarded to the property owner was not reduced by the storm-protection benefit conferred. The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed the decision on compensation for a dune easement, stating that the distinction between general and special benefits should be abandoned. Landowners settled for one dollar based on the new standard, while a jury awarded $300 in a similar case. The low compensation amounts acknowledged that the benefit of soft armoring had a minimal impact on property value. The benefits of soft armoring to property owners are comparable to any reduction in property value, such as blocking ocean views. These small awards lower government costs and support measures to protect coastal communities from storms and sea level rise. Beach nourishment may become more common as sea levels rise due to climate change. Repairing storm damage may be preferred over relocating coastal populations inland. Members of Congress and the Supreme Court have shown support for beach restoration projects. In Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Dep't of Environmental Protection, the Supreme Court addressed objections to a Florida beach renourishment project by some affected property owners. The Court ruled that the state did not violate the Fifth Amendment by adding state-owned beach in front of eroded privately owned beach, as the shore owners failed to prove their littoral rights were superior to the state's right to fill its submerged land. The decision in Stop the Beach Renourishment allowed the state to fill in its seabed, treating the exposed land as an avulsion for ownership purposes. While it was a victory for beach renourishment efforts, legal challenges by littoral owners may continue due to state-specific precedent. The lack of property rights impairment in the case raises questions about how the benefit to beachfront property owners from renourishment affects takings analysis. This uncertainty may deter states from funding beach restoration projects. The costs of beach renourishment and protective measures on private property may be offset by compensation owed to property owners based on government benefits. Court decisions have approved reducing monetary awards to beachfront property owners based on storm protection benefits. Levees, armoring, and beach restoration are widely supported techniques by landowners. The focus is shifting towards \"managed retreat\" as a long-term solution for disaster-prone areas, instead of relying on structural protections like levees and beach renourishment. Concerns arise regarding takings issues with regulations that prohibit development or impose special requirements for rebuilding in flood-prone areas. The legal question arises whether sea level rise due to climate change may provide government defenses against regulatory takings claims. In Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, the Supreme Court rejected the state's assertion that a beachfront management act was immunized by asserting avoidance of public harm as its purpose. The Supreme Court in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council rejected the state's claim that a beachfront management act was protected from takings liability by asserting avoidance of public harm as its purpose. The Court held that the act did not fall under the category of state action based on \"background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance.\" The possibility of land being submerged in the future due to climate change may not be enough to avoid takings challenges, especially if the prohibition eliminates all land value. Even previous instances of land being submerged did not shield the state from takings liability in Lucas. The public trust doctrine does not extend as a defense to takings claims for lands not below the mean high water mark. The Lucas decision in 1992 did not consider climate change and focused on total takings, not partial ones. The question of reasonable investment-backed expectations for land prone to climate-change-induced extreme weather remains open. Can purchasers of disaster-prone land be charged with knowledge of climate change impacts and government restrictions on development? State disclosure statutes require informing buyers of flood risks. The property may be affected by floods or in a flood zone. The thin case law suggests that notice may not impact takings claims based on development restrictions. One argument is that coastal states could defend takings claims by framing land use regulations as public health measures due to sea level rise and severe storms. Public health effects could include salt-water intrusion, power outages, and contaminated stormwaters. Takings law has historically resisted claims based on public health measures. There is also a question of whether local jurisdictions could be successfully sued. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) plays a key role in discouraging construction in flood-prone areas due to climate change-related sea level rise and extreme rainfall. Local jurisdictions can be sued for failing to restrict development despite knowing about potential flooding risks. Participation in the NFIP is voluntary, with communities adopting floodplain management ordinances in exchange for subsidized federal flood insurance. The NFIP encourages communities to adopt floodplain management ordinances in exchange for subsidized federal flood insurance. Courts have rejected takings suits based on floodplain ordinances inspired by the NFIP. Future sea level rise may lead to stricter federal conditions for flood insurance, potentially raising takings issues. Recent changes in the law direct the NFIP to consider future sea level rise in creating floodplain maps, which could result in stricter requirements. Local jurisdictions question potential disinvestment in public infrastructure. Local jurisdictions are considering disinvestment in public infrastructure in low-lying areas to reduce repair costs from floods and sea level rise. Property owners may challenge this decision, such as discontinuing maintenance of eroding roads. Takings claims vary based on facts, with no reported decisions on federal disinvestment in coastal barrier islands. Governments may face legal challenges when considering disinvestment in public infrastructure in low-lying areas to mitigate repair costs from floods and sea level rise. Takings claims could be reduced by announcing disinvestment well in advance and ensuring it aligns with the retreat activity of residents and businesses in the area. Legal questions arise regarding the legal requirements for public and private actions during emergencies, including climate-change-related events, with emergency definitions often left ambiguous in statutes. There is no explicit exemption in federal environmental statutes for emergency response. Statutory provisions allow for relaxed regulation in emergencies, such as temporary waivers under the Clean Air Act and less prior study required for government emergency response under CERCLA. Federal agencies can take remedial actions in emergencies without observing regulations, consulting with the Council on Environmental Quality for alternative arrangements. However, actions not essential for immediate impact control remain subject to NEPA review. Agencies may temporarily suspend enforcement of regulatory requirements in affected areas due to special circumstances. Legal questions may arise post-natural calamity regarding rebuilding restrictions or prohibitions to minimize future damage. The rebuilding of structures after natural disasters may be subject to environmental requirements, even if it is in the same location as before. The Stafford Disaster Relief Act provides a broad exemption from environmental impact statements for emergency actions. The Stafford Disaster Relief Act provides an exemption from environmental impact statements for emergency actions, including restoring facilities to their pre-disaster condition. Department of Transportation regulations also allow for categorical exclusions from EIS preparation for reconstruction of highways, bridges, and rail and bus facilities. Limited NEPA case law suggests that federal involvement in constructing a similar replacement facility may not require an EIS if the original facility's environment is accepted as the baseline. The federal action might trigger the EIS requirement if the changed environment is viewed as the baseline. The Clean Water Act provides exemptions for emergency reconstruction of structures like dikes and levees. Nationwide permits issued by the Corps of Engineers cover reconstruction to varying degrees, making the process less expensive and time-consuming. Questions arise when localities use federal disaster relief funds to rebuild more resiliently. For example, after Hurricane Irene, Vermont requested FEMA reimbursement for upgraded culverts. The state requested FEMA reimbursement for upgraded culverts designed to handle more water under the Stafford Act. FEMA initially denied reimbursement due to concerns about the state's rebuilding standards meeting uniformity requirements. Antonio Guterres highlighted climate change as a key driver of forced displacement. Climate-related migrants are not considered a \"protected class\" in international or U.S. immigration law. The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees does not cover climate change refugees as they do not suffer \"persecution.\" Most people displaced by climate change are likely to stay within their own countries, falling outside the definition of a refugee. The United States does not consider climate-related migrants as refugees under international or U.S. immigration law. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires foreign nationals seeking asylum to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific characteristics. Temporary protected status may be granted in cases of natural disasters or civil unrest, providing short-term relief from removal."
