    "content": "Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a method to infer the reward function from an expert's actions in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A new approach using variational inference for learning the reward function is introduced, approximating the posterior distribution of the reward function with a Conditional Wasserstein Auto-encoder-IRL (CWAE-IRL) model. This model combines backward and forward inference without requiring knowledge of the agent's system dynamics. The proposed algorithm in IRL can effectively learn the reward function in complex environments without knowledge of the agent's system dynamics. Reinforcement learning, formalized as MDP, involves maximizing long-term rewards by taking optimal actions. Defining a proper reward function can be challenging, and techniques like reward shaping are used. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) infers the reward function from expert demonstrations. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a method for inferring the reward function from expert demonstrations. The algorithm is under defined, leading to different reward functions yielding the same policy. Various approaches have been used to address this issue, such as maximizing the difference in values between the expert's policy and the second best policy, applying the principle of maximum entropy, and using structured max-margin optimization to find the reward function that maximizes the margin between the expert's policy and all other policies. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) involves methods like a game-theoretic framework to improve policies based on expert behavior. Early algorithms required perfect knowledge of expert dynamics, but newer approaches relax this requirement by learning value functions or solving local control problems. Recent advancements in Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) have explored various methods for reward function approximation without requiring full knowledge of system dynamics. These methods include using non-linear deep neural networks as universal function approximators, moving away from hand-crafted features to learn highly non-linear reward functions efficiently. Recent advancements in Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) have explored methods for reward function approximation using deep neural networks. Fu et al. (2017) proposed an adversarial reward learning formulation, while Ramachandran & Amir (2007) introduced the Bayesian IRL algorithm. Zheng et al. (2014) described an expectation-maximization approach for solving the BIRL problem. Variational Inference has been used as an efficient method in this context. Variational Inference (VI) is an efficient strategy for approximating posterior densities in Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) is a neural network model that maximizes data likelihood and enforces latent variables to align with prior beliefs. Conditional VAE (CVAE) is a deep generative model for structured output prediction. The research proposes using a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) with Wasserstein loss function to determine a non-linear, continuous reward function from expert trajectories without the need for system dynamics. This approach aims to address the limitations of existing methods like Cascaded Supervised IRL (CSI) which rely on non-generalizable heuristics. The CVAE encoder learns the original reward function from expert trajectories without system dynamics. The decoder recovers the next state using the latent reward function. The algorithm runs on expert-supplied states without an MDP or agent in the loop, making it more effective and efficient. The auto-encoder estimates the reward function effectively and efficiently without knowledge of system dynamics. It uses expert state-action trajectories to generate a robust solution. The model operates in a reinforcement learning framework where the agent observes states, takes actions, receives rewards, and transitions to new states based on Markov Decision Process principles. The agent aims to maximize cumulative rewards in a Markov Decision Process framework. Bellman's equations define optimal policies and value functions. The Bayesian approach to Inverse Reinforcement Learning encodes reward function preferences as priors. Expert behavior data is used to determine optimal confidence levels. The Bayesian approach to Inverse Reinforcement Learning uses MCMC sampling to compute the posterior mean of the reward function, incorporating expert behavior data to determine optimal confidence levels. The likelihood of trajectory \u03c4 is modeled as an exponential distribution, with the posterior probability of the reward function computed using Bayes theorem. Variational inference is used in Bayesian frameworks for approximating the posterior distribution when it is intractable. It involves optimizing a family of approximate densities to minimize the KL divergence to the exact posterior. The optimized member of the family approximates the posterior, and the evidence lower bound (ELBO) is used as an objective function in Variational Autoencoders (VAE). The ELBO consists of two separate losses: one related to log-likelihood and the other related to divergence. CVAE uses Wasserstein distance for structured output prediction. It is a natural distance over probability distributions in the metric space, providing a minimum cost to move one distribution to another. EMD has practical applications in computer science like pattern recognition. In this paper, the inverse reinforcement learning problem is framed as a supervised learning task with latent variable learning. The reward function is formulated as a latent function dependent on the state, action, and next state. The CVAE framework uses the state-action pair as a class label and incorporates Wasserstein distance in the loss function. The proposed method in this paper uses the CVAE framework to encode the reward function as a latent variable, aiming to recover the next state from the current state and action. The network structure includes an encoder neural network generating a probability distribution of the reward function. Two hidden layers are utilized for processing input data in minibatches. The CVAE framework encodes (s t+1 , s t , a t ) samples into a latent space with mean and log-variance outputs. The decoder reconstructs \u015d t+1 from sampled r t, similar to IRL methodology. Samples are reparameterized from a standard normal distribution for forward inference in an MDP. The CWAE-IRL framework utilizes two hidden layers with dropout similar to the encoder. Despite theoretical expectations, the KL-divergence does not converge practically, resulting in large values for small samples. Tolstikhin et al. (2017) proposes a Maximum Mean Discrepancy measure based on the Wasserstein metric using a positive-definite reproducing kernel. The resulting CWAE-IRL loss function is applied to simulated tasks like objectworld and pendulum. Objectworld is a gridworld with NxN states and five actions per state. Actions have a 30% chance of moving in a random direction. Objects have inner and outer colors (red and green) with continuous features for Euclidean distance. Rewards are based on proximity to objects. Expert trajectories have a length of 16. Algorithms used are Maximum Entropy IRL and Deep Maximum Entropy IRL. Only continuous features are utilized. CWAE-IRL is compared to prior IRL methods like BIRL, Maximum Entropy IRL, and Deep Maximum Entropy IRL. Results show CWAE-IRL can recover the original reward distribution, while Deep Maximum Entropy IRL overestimates rewards in some areas. Maximum Entropy IRL and BIRL fail to learn rewards effectively. CWAE-IRL generalizes well over state spaces. The pendulum environment is a well-known control problem where the goal is to keep the pendulum upright with minimal force. The reward weights for angle, derivative of angle, and action are [1, 0.1, 0.001] respectively. CWAE-IRL algorithm captures reward scales accurately compared to other algorithms. The optimal reward weights for the pendulum environment are [1, 0.1, 0.001]. A deep Q-network (DQN) combines deep neural networks with RL to solve continuous state discrete action problems. DQN is trained for 50,000 episodes, while CWAE-IRL is trained using 25 trajectories. The error plot between recovered reward and actual reward shows a mean error around 0, indicating the proposed method's effectiveness. The proposed method is effective in recovering the correct reward for the majority of states and actions, with a mean error around 0."
