    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Dispute Resolution and Settlement Encouragement Act\". Arbitration in district courts is addressed in the Act. The \"Alternative Dispute Resolution and Settlement Encouragement Act\" amends Section 905 of the Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act to remove specific fiscal years. It also requires all United States district courts to authorize arbitration in civil actions and bankruptcy proceedings. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of title 28, United States Code, related to arbitration. This includes changes to the monetary limits for arbitration, certification of arbitrators, and the removal of certain limitations. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act. The Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act is amended by striking subsection (c). SEC. 3. AWARD OF REASONABLE COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES IN FEDERAL CIVIL DIVERSITY LITIGATION AFTER AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT. Section 1332 of title 28, United States Code, allows parties in a court action to make written settlement offers at least 10 days before trial. If the offer is accepted, either party can file a notice of acceptance with the court. The court allows parties to make settlement offers under Section 1332 of title 28, United States Code. If an offer is not accepted, a subsequent offer can be made. The court may exempt claims that are novel and important from this rule. If offers are not accepted, they have no effect on the final judgment. If a settlement offer under Section 1332 of title 28, United States Code is not accepted and the final judgment is not more favorable to the offeree than the last offer, the court may award costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees. The court may order the offeree to pay the offeror's costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, if the final judgment is not more favorable than the last offer, unless it would be manifestly unjust. Attorney's fees should be reasonable and based on an hourly rate acceptable in the community. The offeree may be required to pay the offeror's costs and attorneys' fees if the final judgment is not better than the last offer. Attorney's fees must be reasonable and based on an acceptable hourly rate in the community. The offeree's attorney's fees can be the actual cost incurred or a reasonable cost that would have been incurred for services related to the claim. This does not apply to claims seeking equitable remedies. SEC. 4. RELIABILITY OF EVIDENCE. Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is amended to require that testimony based on scientific knowledge must be scientifically valid, reliable, connected to the fact it is proving, and outweigh any potential dangers. Testimony by a witness receiving compensation contingent on the legal outcome of a claim is inadmissible. The amended Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence requires scientifically valid and reliable testimony connected to the fact it is proving, outweighing potential dangers. Testimony from a witness with a contingent compensation is inadmissible in criminal proceedings. The effective date of the amendments made by sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act varies, with section 2 taking effect immediately upon enactment, while sections 3 and 4 will take effect 180 days after enactment. Section 3 applies to civil actions commenced after its effective date, and section 4 applies to cases where a trial begins after its effective date."
