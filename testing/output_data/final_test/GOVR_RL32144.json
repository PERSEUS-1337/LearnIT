    "content": "This report analyzes state and federal laws regarding diploma mills, which offer academic degrees with little academic work. It covers criminal, civil, and common law ramifications for manufacturers, distributors, buyers, and users of phony degrees. The focus is on entities that provide diplomas without academic achievement standards. A diploma mill is defined as lacking accreditation and selling fraudulent degrees. Diploma mills have proliferated due to lax law enforcement and technological advances, with revenue exceeding $500 million annually. It is challenging to differentiate between fake and legitimate online institutions, making it difficult for policymakers to draft effective laws to shut down fraudulent operations. Diploma mills typically lack accreditation and display fraudulent characteristics. Diploma mills exhibit fraudulent characteristics such as unaccredited status, lack of academic requirements for admission, charging tuition based on degrees purchased, offering credits for life experience, guaranteeing quick diploma delivery, employing professors with degrees from unaccredited universities, having foreign addresses or PO boxes, and using misleading names. Diploma mills present risks to consumers, employers, and legitimate institutions of higher education. Individuals may unknowingly fall victim to financial scams by obtaining worthless degrees from these fraudulent entities. Employers hiring individuals with fake degrees may face liability and have inadequately trained employees. Additionally, the general public may be harmed by receiving professional services from individuals with fake credentials. State and federal efforts to shut down diploma mills have been inconsistent, with enforcement varying depending on jurisdiction and priorities. Diploma mills can easily move jurisdictions to avoid enforcement, and each state has its own laws against them. The federal government also takes action against diploma mills under separate laws. The federal government plays a role in overseeing education, including addressing diploma mills. While federal law does not explicitly prohibit diploma mills, fraudulent academic credentials are punishable under various federal statutes. Several governmental agencies, such as the FBI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, FTC, Department of Education, and DHS, are involved in addressing legal issues related to diploma mills. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Department of Justice (DOJ), and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are involved in prosecuting diploma mills. The FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service have the authority to investigate and prosecute diploma mills for fraud. The federal statutes on mail and wire fraud impose fines and prison sentences for using mail or telephone wire with intent to commit fraud. Violations can result in up to twenty years in prison. The use of fictitious names or addresses in connection with fraud can lead to fines and up to five years in prison. Attempting or conspiring to commit fraud carries the same penalties as successfully committing the crime. The Department of Justice can seek injunctions to prevent violations, and the Post Office can take preventative actions against fraudulent schemes. Federal enforcement of laws against diploma mills has varied over the years. The FBI and Postal Inspection Service have collaborated on criminal investigations of diploma mills, with a notable operation called DipScam in the late 1970s to early 1990s. This task force led to arrests and convictions under federal anti-fraud statutes, resulting in a decline in fake institutions. However, after the retirement of the top expert, diploma mills have resurfaced. Federal enforcement of laws against diploma mills has varied over the years. Investigations and prosecutions of diploma mills have declined as federal agencies focus on other priorities like combating terrorism and identity theft. The FTC also has regulatory authority over diploma mills, enforcing consumer protection laws against fraud and deceptive practices. The FTC prohibits schools from using deceptive trade names, misrepresenting accreditation, or issuing deceptive diplomas. It is deceptive to misrepresent the content of a course or offer unauthorized degrees without disclosure. The FTC prohibits deceptive practices in advertising educational degrees, with penalties for false or misleading ads. They have the authority to sue diploma mills and seek legal redress for consumers. Additionally, the FTC can seek injunctions in federal court to prevent false advertising. The FTC has the authority to take legal action against diploma mills for false advertising, but they have not pursued many enforcement actions. The Department of Education (ED) does not have the authority to accredit colleges and universities, but recognizes accrediting agencies for federal student financial aid eligibility. ED's regulatory authority is limited to overseeing institutions that receive federal funding for education activities. The Department of Education (ED) lacks oversight over institutions not participating in HEA programs, unable to determine if they are diploma mills. ED recognizes legitimate accrediting agencies, but cannot recognize fake accreditation agencies. They also lack regulatory jurisdiction over foreign accrediting agencies or institutions not in HEA programs. U.S.-based employers and academic institutions may rely on U.S. accrediting agencies recognized by ED to accredit foreign institutions. Private organizations provide credential evaluation services to verify foreign academic credentials for individuals with degrees or credits from non-U.S. accredited institutions. The Department of Education (ED) has taken steps to combat diploma mills by offering information on its website about recognized accrediting agencies and accredited institutions. The Department of Education maintains a list of recognized accrediting agencies and accredited institutions for students to verify legitimacy. They also facilitate interagency coordination to address diploma mills. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services confronts diploma mill issues in visa issuance. Existing immigration requirements and procedures include guidelines for evaluating academic or professional credentials, with provisions for advisory evaluations from credential evaluation services. Concerns about diploma mills' national security implications are addressed through screening visa applicants for terrorism and criminal grounds of inadmissibility. Federal agencies also deal with diploma mill issues, although they do not have direct regulatory authority. The IRS, DOJ, Secret Service, and OPM regulations are involved in prosecuting diploma mills for tax fraud and fraud against the federal government. Federal laws punish individuals for making false statements to federal agencies, affecting those using diploma mill degrees in federal employment. These anti-fraud laws and personnel rules directly apply to situations involving diploma mill degrees in federal jobs. Federal laws and regulations address the issue of diploma mill degrees in federal employment by establishing minimum educational requirements for certain positions. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is authorized to consider the character of job applicants and take action to protect the integrity of the service. Dishonest conduct and false statements are grounds for action against applicants, appointees, and employees. OPM may take action against individuals who use fraudulent academic credentials for federal employment, including cancellation of eligibility, denial of appointment, removal, or debarment. Falsification of security clearance forms could result in loss of employment or security clearance. OPM has made revisions to federal employment application forms and the USAJOBS website to combat diploma mill usage. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has made revisions to federal employment forms to combat the use of fraudulent academic credentials. This includes adding an accreditation field and instructing applicants not to list credentials from diploma mills or schools with low academic standards. OPM has also conducted training sessions for federal agency managers on detecting fraudulent credentials and plans to hire additional staff for oversight. Federal regulations prohibit the use of federal funds to pay for employees to receive phony degrees from diploma mills due to lack of accreditation. However, agency funds can be used to pay for individual training courses from unaccredited schools, with agency heads evaluating the training to meet program needs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigated federal payments for diploma mill degrees and found $170,000 in fees paid for employees with such degrees. 28 senior-level federal employees were identified with diploma mill degrees. The figures may underestimate the actual extent. OPM issued revisions to clarify federal employment policy on academic credentials and training programs. OPM revised its Qualifications Standards Operating Manual to specify that applicants from accredited institutions meet minimum qualification requirements for federal employment. However, applicants with credentials from pre-accredited schools are not eligible for student loan repayments. Federal employees can receive tuition reimbursement for individual training classes at pre-accredited or comparable institutions. Foreign schools may also qualify applicants for federal employment if they meet specific criteria. Federal agencies do not accept credentials from diploma mills for federal employment, including eligibility standards, student loan repayment, and employee training. OPM's personnel rules and federal statutes prohibit the use of fraudulent degrees, with potential criminal consequences for knowingly using fake documents. A federal employee who knowingly uses a fake degree for federal employment could face criminal charges, as it requires evidence of specific intent to defraud. This law does not apply to those who innocently believe their degrees are legitimate. Federal employees could potentially face criminal penalties for collaborating with a diploma mill to obtain agency funding for a fraudulent degree, as it may violate federal criminal laws regarding possession of false documents. Conspiracy to commit fraud against the United States government is a federal crime punishable by fine, imprisonment for up to five years, or both. State laws on diploma mills vary in strength and enforcement. Some states have strong laws against diploma mills, while others have weak laws or lax enforcement. Additionally, many states have general anti-fraud statutes or professional licensing laws. States like Oregon, New Jersey, and Illinois have strong laws against diploma mills. Oregon's Office of Degree Authorization approves schools offering degrees, validates degree claims, and terminates fraudulent activities. Schools must be approved by ODA to award degrees, and individuals cannot claim possession of a degree unless it is from an approved institution or accredited by a recognized agency. Oregon, New Jersey, and Illinois have strict laws against diploma mills. In Oregon, degrees must be from an institution approved by ODA or accredited by a recognized agency. New Jersey prohibits the buying or selling of fraudulent diplomas and using fake academic credentials. Violators face fines, while Illinois' Academic Degree Act aims to prevent misuse of academic degrees. Illinois' Academic Degree Act aims to prevent fraudulent academic credentials by prohibiting institutions from awarding degrees without authorization. Institutions must meet criteria for approval, including appropriate instruction periods and facilities. The Board of Higher Education can inspect institutions, and violations can result in fines, probation, or imprisonment. Some states like Illinois, Oregon, and New Jersey have strong diploma mill laws that are enforced, while others like Mississippi, Alabama, and Wyoming are considered diploma mill havens. Wyoming requires institutions without legitimate accreditation to be licensed, maintain facilities, and employ qualified instructors. Mississippi and Alabama lack specific laws targeting diploma mills. Despite prohibitions and penalties, Wyoming reportedly does not vigorously enforce its higher education licensing laws. Most states have laws targeting diploma mills, along with more general laws that can be used to shut them down. Enforcement of these laws varies from state to state, with few reported cases of criminal prosecution for fraudulent academic credentials. Successful prosecutions for fraudulent academic credentials can be rare due to challenges in determining jurisdiction and diploma mills easily relocating. Legislation at the state level is crucial, but enforcement agencies and public support are also necessary. Diploma mills may face legal action for negligent misrepresentation or fraud. Individuals injured by receiving a phony degree from a diploma mill can sue for damages if false representations were knowingly made by the mill owner/operator and relied upon to their detriment. Negligent misrepresentation suits can also be pursued if false information was communicated without reasonable care. State laws offer remedies against deceptive business practices, providing victims of diploma mill scams with potential legal recourse. Despite laws targeting diploma mills, these fraudulent institutions continue to operate, with a lack of interest in prosecuting cases at state and federal levels. While there have been some prosecutions, the overall enforcement efforts are unclear due to potential cases left unaddressed."
