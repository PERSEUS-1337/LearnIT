Congress finds that the irresponsible growth of the mortgage industry under Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's policies has cost the American people billions, potentially trillions, in the largest financial bailout in history. They demand accountability for poor judgment and wrongdoing by executives and board members. In June 2003, Freddie Mac admitted to misstating earnings by $5 billion from 2000 to 2002 to meet Wall Street expectations. In December 2004, Fannie Mae was found to have violated accounting rules, needing to restate earnings by up to $9 billion from 2001 to 2004. Shareholders, employees, and directors of both companies benefited from misguided or fraudulent practices. In 2007, former Freddie Mac Chairman and CEO Richard Syron received $18.3 million in compensation despite the stock losing half its value. Former Fannie Mae President Daniel Mudd received $11.6 million in compensation last year. Investigations have focused on accounting fraud, but not on policies that worsened the housing crisis and financial collapse. The boards of directors of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been held harmless despite their involvement in creating policies that led to overleverage and operating with just $83.2 billion of capital at the end of 2007. There is a need to fully understand what went wrong in the management of these enterprises. The management of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac led to Federal conservatorship due to potentially fraudulent board policies and practices. The focus is on understanding these mistakes to prevent their repetition in the future. The \"Independent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Investigative Commission\" is established to investigate the management of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, focusing on potential fraudulent practices that led to Federal conservatorship. The Commission will operate for two years, issuing a final report with necessary hearings and records from the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s to the present. The Commission will investigate the policies, practices, and board decisions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the 1990s to the present, their involvement in securitized mortgage instruments, the role of their boards in developing financial risk policies, and the actions of board members and executives. The Commission will investigate the policies, practices, and board decisions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac related to subprime mortgages, including the actions of board members and executives responsible for financial decisions and the overvaluation of risky mortgage investments. The Commission will investigate financial benefits received by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's executive officers and board members from 1990 to 2008, political contributions influencing housing policy, the role of the two entities in the housing market, and other matters as directed by the President or Congress. The Commission has full subpoena power and can hire staff as needed. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission consists of 9 members appointed by the President, including a Chairperson appointed with Senate advice. Recommendations from congressional leaders determine the other eight members, with a limit on party affiliation. Each member serves for the Commission's lifespan, and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. If there is a vacancy in the Chair of the Commission, the remaining members may choose an interim Chairperson until a new appointment is made. Members of Congress serving on the Commission will not receive extra pay but can be reimbursed for necessary expenses. The Commission must receive at least $5 million annually for its activities, with any fraudulently obtained assets by board members returned to the Treasury to cover expenses."
