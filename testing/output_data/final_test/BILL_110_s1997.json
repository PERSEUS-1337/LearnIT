    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Future Accountability in Retail Fuel Act\" or the \"FAIR Fuel Act\". It includes provisions for automatic temperature compensation equipment. Beginning 90 days after final regulations are issued, all new motor fuel dispensers in the US must have automatic temperature compensation equipment to ensure accurate volume measurement. Within 5 years, existing dispensers must also be equipped with this technology. State inspectors conducting annual inspections of motor fuel dispensers are authorized to check for automatic temperature compensation equipment. If a dispenser is found to be non-compliant, the inspector can notify the Federal Trade Commission. A follow-up inspection can be conducted no earlier than 180 days after noncompliance is detected. If a motor fuel dispenser is found to be out of compliance with regulations, the Federal Trade Commission will coordinate a follow-up inspection. The owner or operator of the retail fuel establishment will face a fine of $5,000 for each noncompliant dispenser, with an additional fine if noncompliance is found during a follow-up inspection. In this Act, fines of $5,000 will be imposed on establishments with noncompliant motor fuel dispensers. The collected fines will go into a trust fund. The term \"automatic temperature compensation equipment\" is defined. The Federal Trade Commission will start a rulemaking procedure within 90 days of the Act's enactment to enforce the requirements. Final regulations must be in place within a year. The Federal Trade Commission must issue final regulations within a year to implement the requirement for volume correction factor tables for gasoline and diesel fuel products sold to retail customers in the United States.
