    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bleeding Disorder Screening, Awareness, and Further Education (SAFE) Act of 2010\". The Congress finds that millions of Americans may have an inherited bleeding disorder, with Von Willebrand Disease being the most common. Many remain undiagnosed due to outdated diagnostic methods. Symptoms may become apparent during adolescence, but individuals often live with the health risks without realizing they have a bleeding disorder. Improved diagnosis of bleeding disorders, through expanded screening of adolescents, improved physician awareness, and additional research, could prevent unnecessary hysterectomies for women with undiagnosed bleeding disorders. Improved diagnosis of bleeding disorders in adolescents could prevent unnecessary hysterectomies for women with undiagnosed bleeding disorders. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a screening questionnaire for diagnosing bleeding disorders in adolescents and young adults, and disseminate it widely in adolescent populations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will prioritize grants for screening high school and college students for bleeding disorders. Technical assistance may be provided for grant recipients. Appropriations are authorized for implementation. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. SEC. 4. INCREASING AWARENESS AMONG HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.
