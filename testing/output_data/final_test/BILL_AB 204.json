    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature established oversight boards for individual successor agencies under the Redevelopment Agency Dissolution Act. All oversight boards in Los Angeles County will be consolidated into a single countywide oversight board by July 1, 2016 to prevent administrative gridlock and expedite property disposition. The Legislature established oversight boards for successor agencies in Los Angeles County under the Redevelopment Agency Dissolution Act. All oversight boards will be consolidated into a countywide oversight board by July 1, 2016 to ensure timely duties fulfillment. Each successor agency will have an oversight board with seven members, including appointments from the county board of supervisors and the city that formed the redevelopment agency. The oversight board for successor agencies in Los Angeles County will have seven members, including appointments from various entities such as the mayor, special districts, county superintendent of education, and Chancellor of the California Community Colleges. The oversight board for successor agencies in Los Angeles County will have seven members, including one member appointed by the county board of supervisors. The oversight board for successor agencies in Los Angeles County will have seven members, including one member representing the employees of the former redevelopment agency appointed by the mayor or chair of the board of supervisors from the recognized employee organization representing the largest number of former redevelopment agency employees employed by the successor agency at that time. If city or county employees performed administrative duties of the former redevelopment agency, the appointment shall be made from the recognized employee organization representing those employees. If a recognized employee organization does not exist for either the employees of the former redevelopment agency or the city or county employees performing administrative duties of the former redevelopment agency, the appointment shall be made from among the employees of the successor agency. In voting to approve a contract as an enforceable obligation, a member appointed pursuant to this paragraph shall not be deemed to be interested in the contract by virtue of being an employee of the successor. A member appointed to the oversight board for successor agencies in Los Angeles County shall not be considered interested in a contract due to being an employee of the successor agency for purposes of Section 1090 of the Government Code. If the county or a joint powers agency formed the redevelopment agency, the largest city in the jurisdiction may select one member. If no cities have territory in a project area, the county superintendent of education may appoint an additional member. If there are no eligible special districts, the county may appoint a member to represent the public. The oversight board of a redevelopment agency formed by a charter city and county consists of seven members appointed by various entities, including the mayor, special districts, county superintendent of education, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, and employees of the former redevelopment agency. The oversight board of a redevelopment agency is appointed by various entities, including the mayor, special districts, county superintendent of education, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, and former redevelopment agency employees. The appointment is subject to confirmation by the county board of supervisors. The Governor may appoint individuals to fill oversight board member positions not filled by May 15, 2012. The oversight board can direct the successor agency staff to assist in their duties, with costs covered by the agency. Board members serve without compensation and are protected by immunities applicable to public entities and employees. The oversight board requires a majority quorum for decision-making, with actions taken by resolution. Notices for board actions must be posted online. Members serve at the pleasure of their appointing entity. The Department of Finance may review oversight board actions, with notice provided electronically. Actions become effective in five business days unless a review is requested. The department has 40 days to approve or return actions for reconsideration. Each oversight board designates an official for communication with the department. The Department of Finance may review oversight board actions and has the authority to approve, modify, or return them for reconsideration. The county auditor-controller adjusts property tax allocations based on the department's actions, which are communicated to the successor agency. If an oversight board disputes a determination with the department, future recognized obligation schedules may reflect the resolution. The department can amend a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule to resolve disputes, but this will not impact past property tax allocations or create liabilities for taxing entities. Oversight boards have fiduciary responsibilities to holders of enforceable obligations and taxing entities benefiting from property tax distributions. Starting July 1, 2016, counties with multiple oversight boards will have only one appointed board member by the county board of supervisors. Individual appointments to up to five oversight boards are allowed. The oversight board members are appointed as follows: one by the county board of supervisors, one by the city selection committee or mayor in a city and county, one by the independent special district selection committee, one by the county superintendent of education or board of education, and one by the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges. The oversight board members are appointed by various entities, including the county board of supervisors, recognized employee organizations, and the Governor. The composition of the oversight board remains unchanged in counties with only one board created. The oversight board ceases to exist once all debts of the dissolved redevelopment agency are repaid. An oversight board can direct a successor agency to provide additional legal or financial advice and can contract with other agencies for administrative support. Decisions made by the oversight board take precedence over those made by the successor agency or its staff. In Los Angeles County, the oversight board operates independently until its successor agency dissolves it and the oversight board approves the resolution. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the unique circumstances of Los Angeles County."
