    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000\". It includes findings related to oil prices. The Congress finds that OPEC's actions in 1999 led to a significant reduction in global oil supply, driving prices from $11 to $30 a barrel. OPEC's goal of reducing oil stocks was highlighted in a hearing on the Northeast Energy Crisis. During a hearing on the Northeast Energy Crisis, it was noted that OPEC's aim to reduce oil stocks led to price increases in heating oil, gasoline, and diesel. Artificial supply constraints can cause market volatility, inflationary shocks, and threaten global economic recovery. The United States' transportation infrastructure is also a concern. The transportation infrastructure in the United States is strained, leading to financial struggles for many small to medium-sized trucking firms in the Northeast due to soaring diesel prices. Elderly and retired individuals in the region are also facing difficulties affording heating oil, often having to choose between groceries and warmth. Several key oil-producing nations relied on the United States military for protection during the Persian Gulf Conflict in 1990 and 1991. These nations still depend on the US for security, with a close economic and security relationship that is crucial for global security and cooperation. However, the continuation of current OPEC policies threatens this relationship. The United States policy towards oil exporting countries is influenced by their engagement in oil price fixing. The US aims to collaborate with other major oil importers to eliminate international oil price fixing. A report on these policies will be submitted to Congress. The President must submit a report to Congress within 30 days of this Act's enactment. The report will detail the economic and security relationship between the US and major oil exporting countries, including OPEC members. It will also cover the impact of these countries' coordination on the US economy and global energy supplies, along with information on assistance programs provided to these countries under relevant acts. The President will make a determination for each country described in paragraph (1) as per section 5. SEC. 5. Determinations by the President of major oil exporting countries engaged in price fixing. The report submitted by the President under section 4 includes a determination for each country on whether they are engaged in oil price fixing to the detriment of the US economy. It also includes a memorandum of justification for each determination, explaining if the country is not engaged in price fixing or if it is but not detrimental to the US economy. SEC. 6. REDUCTION, SUSPENSION, OR TERMINATION OF UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE: Within 10 days of the President's report to Congress, assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act will be reduced, suspended, or terminated for countries engaged in oil price fixing detrimental to the US economy.\n\nSEC. 7. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS. The Congress urges diplomatic efforts to address unsustainable oil prices for both exporting and importing countries. A report on these efforts must be submitted within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Congress must submit a report on the diplomatic efforts and results achieved within 90 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The term \"oil price fixing\" refers to agreements with oil-exporting countries to increase oil or gas prices by limiting production or setting minimum prices. OPEC stands for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries."
