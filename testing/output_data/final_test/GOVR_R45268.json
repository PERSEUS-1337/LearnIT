    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2019, comparing enacted FY2018 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request, and Congress's response. It provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and a list of CRS policy experts for consultation. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations focuses on legislative action and congressional issues related to discretionary funding amounts, not mandatory funding or other legislation. The report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2019, comparing enacted FY2018 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request, and Congress's response. It focuses on legislative action and congressional issues related to discretionary funding amounts, not mandatory funding or other legislation. The discussion of appropriations legislation involves specialized budgetary concepts, with the Appendix explaining terms such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments to discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act. All amounts in CRS reports on homeland security appropriations represent budget authority. Data used in this report for FY2018 amounts are derived from the explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 115-141, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017\u2014Division F of which is the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018. The explanatory statement also includes data on FY2018 supplemental appropriations for DHS enacted prior to the development of the consolidated appropriations act for FY2018. Data for the FY2019 requested levels and enacted levels are drawn from H.Rept. 116-9, the explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 116-6. Data on the Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation are drawn from. The process of enacting appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2019 involved the Administration's initial request, committee actions in the House and Senate, continuing appropriations, and the enactment of the consolidated appropriations bill. Data from the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, along with the Congressional Budget Office methodology, were used for scoring. The report does not compare this data with the Office of Management and Budget data due to technical scoring differences. The Trump Administration released its budget request for FY2019, including additional requests for resources for DHS. They requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS, a decrease of 0.6% from the previous year. The Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2019, a decrease of 0.6% from the previous year. Additionally, they requested an extra $6.65 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding and $165 million in OCO funding for the Coast Guard. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019, which was above the Administration's request and the enacted level for FY2018. The bill also included disaster relief funding and OCO-designated funding for the Coast Guard. The House Appropriations Committee marked up their version of the bill, H.R. 6776, which included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget. The House committee-reported bill for FY2019 did not include OCO funding for the Coast Guard and did not see action on the House floor. A consolidated appropriations bill with a continuing resolution was passed on September 28, 2018, as P.L. 115-245, which led to a partial shutdown of DHS for 35 days when annual appropriations lapsed. On February 14, 2019, the House passed a consolidated appropriations bill that included the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, with $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This was $1.69 billion more than FY2018 and $2.04 billion more than requested by the Administration. The bill also included $12 billion for major disasters, $5.35 billion more than requested, and $165 million in OCO funding for the Coast Guard. It passed the House by 300-128 and the Senate by 83-16. The homeland security appropriations bill, passed by the House and Senate, was signed into law by the President the next day. It allocates resources to every departmental component of DHS, with discretionary appropriations providing the majority of funding. The budget also includes fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Appropriations measures for DHS are typically organized into five titles, with the first four grouping components thematically and the fifth providing general direction to the department. When DHS was established in 2003, components of other agencies were brought together over a matter of months, in the midst of ongoing budget cycles. Congress and the Administration continued to provide resources through existing account structures when possible. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) at the direction of Congress. In 2014, DHS started developing a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format. Operating with numerous appropriations and programs hindered transparency and decision-making. By FY2019, most DHS components aligned their funding requests with the CAS. In FY2019, DHS components aligned funding requests with the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS). A visual representation in Figure 1 shows how funding is distributed across components based on appropriations categories. For example, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) receives most funding from Operations and Support, while FEMA gets most discretionary funding from the Disaster Relief Fund. In FY2019, DHS components aligned funding requests with the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS). Customs and Border Protection (CBP) receives most funding from Operations and Support, while FEMA gets most discretionary funding from the Disaster Relief Fund. The tables summarize enacted appropriations for FY2018, FY2019 requested appropriations, appropriations bills developed by committees, and final enacted annual appropriation in Division A of the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6). The text chunk discusses how appropriations are provided for a title's components in different parts of the bill, with supplemental appropriations for FY2018 shown separately. Totals of appropriations exclude resources provided by transfer or adjustments to discretionary spending limits. Adjustments are included in a separate total for discretionary funding. Total estimated budgetary resources available under the legislation and from other sources are also considered. Title I, Departmental Management and Operations, received $1.36 billion in net discretionary funding for FY2018, including appropriations for the Office of the Secretary, Executive Management, Management Directorate, Analysis and Operations, and the Office of the Inspector General. Total estimated budgetary resources for each phase in the appropriations process are provided at the end of each component section. The Trump Administration requested $1.60 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for components in Title I, Departmental Management and Operations. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3109 included $1.47 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding, $137 million less than requested by the Administration. The House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $1.48 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for components funded in Title I, which was $119 million less than requested by the Trump Administration and $122 million more than provided in FY2018. P.L. 116-6 included a total of $1.88 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. In FY2019, $1.88 billion in net discretionary funding was provided for components in Title I, including $51 million for financial systems modernization. This was $513 million more than FY2018 and $248 million more than the Administration's request. Table 1 provides detailed comparisons. Funding for the Management Directorate and Office of the Inspector General was also included outside Title I. Title II, Security, Enforcement, and Investigations, includes appropriations for various components such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and U.S. Secret Service. This title represents the majority of DHS's budget, accounting for about three-quarters of the annual funding. In FY2018, these components received $39.52 billion in net discretionary funding, with a total budget authority of $47.13 billion. The Trump Administration requested $38.41 billion for FY2019, which was slightly less than the previous year's funding. The FY2019 budget request for Title II, Security, Enforcement, and Investigations was $45 million less than FY2018, excluding supplemental appropriations. The total proposed resources for FY2019 were $1.01 billion more than projected for FY2018. The Administration sought additional funding for border barriers above the requested level. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3109 included $38.68 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for these components, which was more than requested by the Trump Administration and the amount provided for FY2018, excluding supplemental appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3109 included $38.68 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for security, enforcement, and investigations, which was more than requested by the Trump Administration and the amount provided for FY2018. The total budgetary resources projected under S. 3109 were $614 million less than the Administration's request, but $391 million more than projected for FY2018. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $41.28 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding, which was more than requested by the Trump Administration and the amount provided for FY2018. The total budgetary resources projected under H.R. 6776 were $2.08 billion more than formally requested by the Administration and $3.12 billion more than projected for FY2018. H.R. 6776 would have provided $2.59 billion more than S. 3019, largely due to the House Appropriations Committee recommending $3.35 billion more than its Senate counterpart for CBP's Border Security Assets and Infrastructure activity. P.L. 116-6 included $40.00 billion in net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title, exceeding FY2018 levels by $1.55 billion. Total budgetary resources projected for components funded in this title were $47.82 billion, $704 million more than requested by the Administration, and $1.75 billion more than provided in FY2018.

The Senate committee-reported bill for FY2019 included $6.65 billion in disaster relief funding, offsetting $228 million from unobligated balances. The House Appropriations Committee-reported bill included $13.70 billion in net discretionary funding, $861 million more than requested by the Trump Administration. Total budgetary resources projected would be $885 million more than the Administration's request. The House committee-reported bill for FY2019 included $18.27 billion in net discretionary funding, with $5.43 billion more than requested and $3.89 billion more than FY2018. Total budgetary resources projected for FY2019 were $5.46 billion more than requested and $3.44 billion more than FY2018. In FY2018, Title IV contained appropriations for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and DNDO, totaling $1.57 billion. The Trump Administration requested $1.53 billion for FY2019, $36 million less than FY2018. The FY2019 budget request for components in Title IV was $201 million higher than projected for FY2018, excluding supplemental funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee's reported budget included $1.53 billion in discretionary funding, $115 million more than requested and $79 million less than FY2018, excluding supplements.

Total budgetary resources under H.R. 6776 would have been $97 million more than the Administration's request and $297 million more than projected for FY2018. Total budgetary resources projected for FY2019 are $199 million more than requested by the Administration, and $400 million more than projected for FY2018. The fifth title of the FY2019 DHS appropriations act includes rescissions of prior-year appropriations. For FY2019, the Administration proposed rescinding $300 million in prior-year funding from the DRF. In FY2019, the DHS appropriations act included rescissions of prior-year appropriations, with $303 million in rescissions and $300 million from the DRF redirected to other activities within DHS. Funding for the Financial Systems Modernization initiative and Presidential Residence Protection costs were also included in the budget. Title V of S. 3109 and H.R. 6776 in FY2019 only funded specific initiatives, while Title V of P.L. 116-6 included funding for both the Financial Systems Modernization initiative and Presidential Residence Protection costs. Amendments in H.R. 6776 resulted in a $13 million increase in costs. For more information on FY2019 DHS appropriations, refer to CRS reports R44604, R44052, and R45262. The federal government spending process involves budget authority enacted by Congress, funds obligated by federal agencies, and payments made to liquidate those obligations. Budget authority is determined through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted budget authority. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority enacted by Congress. Budget authority can be indefinite, one-year, multiyear, or no-year. Obligations are incurred when agencies engage in transactions, creating a legal requirement for the government to pay, while outlays are the funds actually spent. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments to be made from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress. Gross budget authority is the total funds available for spending by a federal agency. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of a business-type transaction, not considered federal revenue but counted as negative outlays. The DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset an agency's discretionary budget authority, while others offset an agency's mandatory spending, which includes entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Secret Service retirement pay is funded by permanent appropriations. The DHS budget includes Secret Service retirement pay funded by permanent appropriations, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the budget contains Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process, with allocations known as 302(a) allocations. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary totals available to House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees then allocate the 302(a) funds among subcommittees for each bill as 302(b) allocations, which must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments can be made during the year by the appropriations committee as bills progress towards enactment. The appropriations bills progress towards final enactment with no subcommittee allocations developed for conference reports or enacted appropriations bills. Table A-1 shows comparable figures for the 302(b) allocation for FY2018, FY2019 President's request, and House and Senate subcommittee allocations for the Homeland Security appropriations bills. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending, with adjustments allowed to cover funding for overseas. The Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to raise statutory caps for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and other appropriations. Three justifications for adjusting discretionary budget authority caps have influenced DHS's appropriations process. Adjustments for emergency spending and overseas contingency operations are unlimited, while disaster relief is limited. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief was determined by OMB using a specific formula until FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the allowable adjustment for disaster relief by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. OMB estimated the allowable adjustment for FY2019 at $14.965 billion, with $12 billion used in appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund. No other annual appropriations utilized the disaster relief adjustment for FY2019."
