    "content": "South Africa is a diverse country with a population consisting of Black Africans, whites, Asians, and people of mixed race. The economy is the largest in Africa, with key industries including agriculture, mining (gold, platinum, chromium), automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, and food production. South African companies operate globally, with SABMiller being a prominent example. South Africa's economy is the largest in Africa, with key industries including agriculture, mining, automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, and food production. The country's stock exchange is among the 20 largest globally, and it is an upper middle income country. Despite economic strengths, income inequality is a significant issue, with many black South Africans living in poverty. Townships surround cities with shortages of water and electricity, leading to tensions and protests. South Africa is influential in African international relations, having served on the U.N. Security Council. South Africa is a member of the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. Human Rights Council. It was a founding member of the African Union and played a key role in creating NEPAD. The country has hosted major international conferences and is influential in African international relations. South Africa, a key player in African international relations, faces challenges with illegal immigration, high crime, and unemployment rates. Xenophobic attacks in 2008 displaced thousands and left many dead, with ongoing tensions and potential for further violence. South African officials have played mediator roles in African conflicts and actively support peacekeeping missions. They helped parties in the DRC sign a peace agreement in 2002. President Thabo Mbeki mediated in Cote d'Ivoire with less success. Nelson Mandela brokered a peace agreement in Burundi. South Africa contributes troops to peacekeeping missions, with over 1,200 troops in the DRC and 900 serving under the U.N.-African Union. South African officials, including former President Mbeki, have played key mediation roles in African conflicts. Mbeki prevented Sudan from chairing the African Union in 2006 due to its policies in Darfur. However, South Africa opposed tougher U.N. sanctions on Sudan and an ICC indictment of President al Bashir. Mbeki also mediated in Zimbabwe's political and economic crises in 2007, a role that sparked controversy. In late 2009, President Jacob Zuma and his team took over mediation efforts in South Africa's political and economic crises. The Republic of South Africa held its first universal suffrage elections in April 1994, with the African National Congress (ANC) winning control of the National Assembly. Nelson Mandela was chosen as President after being released from prison in 1990 following secret negotiations between the ANC and key white figures. Despite challenges and outbreaks of violence, a settlement was eventually reached in November. In November 1993, all-party negotiations led to a final agreement on a new constitution and free elections in South Africa. The ANC retained control of the National Assembly in the June 1999 elections, with Thabo Mbeki succeeding Mandela as President. Mbeki remained in power after the April 2004 elections, where the ANC won nearly 70% of the votes. The ANC continues to dominate South African politics due to its role in the anti-apartheid struggle. Thabo Mbeki served as both party and country president until December 2007. Following Thabo Mbeki's resignation as President of South Africa in September 2008, he was replaced by interim president Kgalema Motlanthe. This led to the formation of a breakaway faction known as the Congress of the People (COPE). Prior to the 2009 elections, the ANC held a 72% majority in the National Assembly, with the Democratic Alliance (DA) as its nearest rival with 12% of the seats. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, held about 6% of the seats. The IFP, largely Zulu in membership, has seen a decline in parliamentary seats over the years. The IFP has experienced a decline in parliamentary seats since 1994, while the ANC and DA have gained support. Other parties in parliament include the NNP, UDM, ID, and ACDP. The DA, the second-largest party, was formed in 2000 through a merger to challenge ANC dominance. The NCOP is a higher legislative body with limited powers, its members chosen by the provinces. The DP and NNP formed an alliance in 2000 to control the legislature of Western Cape Province and local governments. The alliance fragmented, enhancing the power of the ANC in South African politics. In 2001, the NNP left the DA to enter into a cooperative agreement. van Schalkwyk announced that the NNP would leave the DA and cooperate with the ANC, aiming to promote national unity. Critics suggested the move was to secure government appointments. Cape Town is a key opposition stronghold, with the DA winning control of Western Cape Province in 2009. Helen Zille replaced Tony Leon as head of the DA in 2007 and became Premier of Western Cape after the 2009 elections. In 2010, the Independent Democrats merged with the DA. The ANC has a long-standing alliance with COSATU and the SACP. The ANC has an alliance with COSATU and the SACP, but there is disagreement over economic reform programs. COSATU and the SACP criticize the government's GEAR strategy and advocate for state-led job creation programs. COSATU's general secretary emphasized the importance of the ANC representing the interests of workers and the poor. The ANC, COSATU, and SACP alliance is facing disagreements over economic reform programs. COSATU emphasizes the importance of the ANC representing the interests of workers and the poor, while former President Mbeki sees the ANC as a \"broad church\" bridging class divisions. COSATU has been critical of Mbeki's stance on the AIDS epidemic and launched strikes to protest job losses. The unions accepted a 7.5% pay raise offer from the government after demanding a 12% increase. Strikes in mid-2008 halted the mining industry due to protests against rising costs. Speculation arose about a potential split within the ANC as President Mbeki approached the end of his second term. His successor was expected to take over as President after the 2009 elections. Following the 2009 national elections, the ANC faced internal divisions as Jacob Zuma challenged Mbeki for party leadership. Zuma, known for his populist appeal and support from various groups, including COSATU and SACP, was embroiled in controversies such as a rape allegation and corruption charges. Despite speculation, Mbeki did not contest the leadership post. After facing political conspiracy and losing to Zuma in a secret ballot vote, Mbeki continued to face legal challenges, including a trial for racketeering, money laundering, fraud, and corruption. Despite initial victories, the case was eventually thrown out on procedural grounds, with allegations of interference from Mbeki's administration. After nine years in office, Thabo Mbeki resigned as President of South Africa following a High Court decision. One-third of his cabinet, including Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, resigned. Kgalema Motlanthe was elected as interim President. After Thabo Mbeki resigned as President of South Africa, a High Court ruling found Jacob Zuma ineligible to assume the presidency due to not holding a parliamentary seat. The Supreme Court of Appeal overturned the ruling, and Zuma appealed to have politically motivated charges dropped. Evidence of collusion emerged, leading to all charges being dropped by the National Prosecuting Authority. The DA party criticized the NPA for dismissing Zuma's case. If found guilty before the elections, Zuma would have been ineligible to become President. After Mbeki's resignation, high-profile ANC figures launched a new party, COPE, which gained momentum with defections from the ANC. COPE selected Reverend Mvume Dandala as its presidential candidate. COPE selected Reverend Mvume Dandala as its presidential candidate, known for his anti-apartheid activism but criticized for his lack of political experience. COPE's prospects were initially tied to Jacob Zuma's legal challenges, with allegations of ANC manipulation of the justice system. South Africans voted in the April 22, 2009, elections, with 18,000 expats registering to vote after a court ruling confirmed their right to participate. In the April 2009 elections, opposition parties challenged the ANC's decisions and advocated for direct presidential elections. Voter turnout was high at 77%, with the ANC maintaining dominance but losing its two-thirds majority in parliament. The DA gained control of a province, while COPE received 7.4% of the vote. The DA holds 67 seats and gained control of a province in the 2009 elections. COPE received 7.4% of the vote, gaining 30 seats in parliament. Jacob Zuma became President, with Motlanthe as Deputy President. Zuma's inauguration was on May 9, 2009, and he appointed a new cabinet the next day. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel was replaced by Pravin Gordhan, who allayed market concerns about economic policy shifts. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton welcomed the government's commitment to a strong economic program. Jacob Zuma's presidency saw key cabinet changes, with Health Minister Barbara Hogan moving to Public Enterprises and Aaron Motsoaledi taking over Health. Tokyo Sexwale became Minister of Human Settlements. Tensions within the ANC persisted, exacerbated by economic challenges. COSATU criticized the party's economic policies, leading to conflicts within the ANC and with the SACP and ANC Youth League, particularly Julius Malema's push for mine nationalization. In 2010, Malema was disciplined by the party for insulting Zuma. Zuma reshuffled his cabinet to improve service delivery. Municipal polls were scheduled for 2011. The $5.5 billion arms purchase from European countries has posed political problems for senior ANC members, including Zuma, for over a decade. Corruption allegations have been more pressing. The $5.5 billion arms purchase from European countries has posed political problems for senior ANC members, including corruption allegations involving Tony Yengeni and Jacob Zuma. Yengeni was arrested for corruption, forgery, and perjury related to a luxury car discount, while Zuma was accused of a corrupt relationship with his financial advisor, Schabir Shaik. Shaik was convicted of fraud and corruption, with evidence supporting payments made to him. The evidence overwhelmingly supported that payments made by Shaik to Zuma were bribes. Shaik was released on medical parole in March 2009. The Hawks closed the last two investigations related to the arms deal probe in October 2010, citing little prospect of convictions. Critics argue that questions related to the deal remain unresolved, including concerns about promised investments in South African industry. Another corruption scandal, \"Travelgate,\" involved 31 current and former MPs from the ruling ANC party accused of stealing $3 million in government funds through abuse of official travel privileges. Several corruption scandals have plagued South Africa, including \"Travelgate\" where MPs stole $3 million in government funds through abuse of travel privileges. Some MPs have left parliament, while others still serve in office. Another scandal, \"Oilgate,\" involved an allegedly corrupt oil deal diverting public funds into an ANC party campaign fund. Additionally, corruption scandals have involved the country's justice organs, such as the suspension of former chief prosecutor Vusi Pikoli in 2007. The suspension of former chief prosecutor Vusi Pikoli in 2007 led to allegations of prosecutorial excess by then-President Mbeki. Pikoli's suspension was believed to be linked to the subsequent arrest of national police commissioner Jackie Selebi, who was later convicted on bribery charges. The cases of Pikoli and Selebi highlighted political tensions within South Africa's law enforcement agencies. In late 2008, South Africa's premier financial crimes investigative unit, the Scorpions, was disbanded amid criticism from ANC officials, including Zuma. The unit's duties were transferred to the national police, leading to debates about tackling corruption at high levels. Despite opposition, the unit was renamed the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (DCPI), or \"the Hawks.\" The Hawks, formerly known as the Scorpions, lead investigations against organized and economic crimes in South Africa. President Zuma's appointment of Menzi Simelane as director of the NPA has drawn criticism for potential interference with the independence of the NPA. Simelane changed the NPA's media policy, restricting prosecutors from speaking to the media without prior authorization. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan estimates that corruption costs South Africa $3.6 billion annually. The South African government is facing an estimated $3.6 billion annual cost due to corruption, which is approximately 1% of the country's GDP. New initiatives have been introduced to combat public sector corruption, including the establishment of an anti-corruption authority to investigate tender fraud. Concerns have been raised about potential restrictions on press freedoms, exemplified by a court banning a leading newspaper from publishing a report on the \"Oilgate\" scandal in 2005. The Media Institute for Southern Africa criticized South Africa for setting a dangerous precedent against press freedom. Concerns were raised about the editorial independence of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. Advocacy groups opposed ANC proposals for a Media Appeals Tribunal and the Protection of Information bill, which could penalize journalists reporting on classified information. Parliament is reviewing the legislation, with a willingness to modify sections not compliant with human rights standards. Rights groups protested against the proposed laws. South Africa faced criticism for violating press freedom and arresting a journalist investigating a provincial ANC leader. The country has the largest HIV/AIDS epidemic globally, with nearly six million people living with the disease. AIDS is the leading cause of premature death in South Africa, with over 350,000 deaths reported in 2007. South Africa has the largest HIV/AIDS epidemic globally, with nearly six million people living with the disease. The country also has the second-highest global mortality figure at 170,000 deaths, with approximately 1.4 million children orphaned by the disease. Thabo Mbeki's stance on HIV/AIDS was controversial, with critics accusing him of diverting attention and funding from the pandemic. In 2000, he defended dissident scientists who claimed AIDS is not caused by the HIV virus, and in 2001, he rejected appeals to declare the AIDS pandemic a national emergency. Thabo Mbeki faced criticism for downplaying the importance of AIDS in South Africa, initially insisting that tuberculosis was the leading cause of death. However, under pressure, the government eventually tripled the national AIDS budget, supported antiretroviral treatment for rape victims, and launched a program for universal access to drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In 2002, a South African court ordered the government to provide the antiretroviral drug Nevirapine nationwide to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The South African Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) initiated the lawsuit, advocating for a nationwide program to save 20,000 babies annually. The ANC prioritized AIDS at its 2002 party conference, and in 2003, the Department of Health declared free antiretroviral drugs would be provided. After slow implementation, TAC threatened another lawsuit, leading to treatment provision at five hospitals in 2004 and gradual program expansion. Access to treatment for advanced HIV has significantly increased since then. Access to treatment for advanced HIV has significantly increased, with 30% receiving antiretroviral therapy in 2008. Critics questioned the seriousness of the Mbeki administration's response to the epidemic, especially after controversial traditional remedies were promoted at the International AIDS Conference in Toronto in 2006. International criticism led to calls for the health minister's dismissal. After the Toronto Conference prompted a shift in the government's position on HIV/AIDS, Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka was appointed to lead a new national AIDS commission. The government acknowledged shortcomings in its response and reached out to the AIDS advocacy community, leading to cautious optimism. TAC expressed growing enthusiasm for united efforts to combat the disease but questioned Mbeki's commitment after the firing of a key deputy in 2007. After the firing of Tshabalala-Msimang's deputy in August 2007, who criticized the Health Minister's controversial views on AIDS, South Africa still faces challenges in its response to HIV/AIDS. The emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and high rates of HIV/TB co-infection strain the healthcare system. President Zuma replaced Health Minister Barbara Hogan with Aaron Motsoaledi, who linked the doubling of South Africa's death rate to the Mbeki Administration's policies on AIDS. President Zuma announced a nationwide campaign on World AIDS Day in 2009 to encourage HIV testing and provide treatment for infants under one year testing positive for HIV by April 2010. He also promised increased access to ART for pregnant women and those with TB/HIV co-infection, along with more health clinics offering counseling and treatment. Activists praised the government's commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS. The South African government aimed to address land rights for the black majority dispossessed under apartheid laws. Targets included settling all land claims by 2008 and transferring 30% of white-owned agricultural land to African owners by 2014. While progress has been made, critics argue that the process is too slow. Negotiations with white farmers over land prices were limited to six months, with expropriation possible if no agreement was reached. Two white-owned farms were marked for expropriation by black South Africans. The South African government targeted settling all land claims by 2008 and transferring 30% of white-owned agricultural land to African owners by 2014. Two white-owned farms were marked for expropriation by black South Africans, sparking controversy over the potential adoption of Zimbabwe's land reform process. President Mbeki defended the government's study of various policies, including a discussion paper proposing a forced-sale principle to meet land transfer targets. The South African government is considering expropriating commercial agricultural land to achieve its 30% redistribution target. Previous attempts to transfer land have been slow, with only 6% of the target met in 2009. Critics argue that proposed legislation to accelerate the process by allowing expropriation for a public purpose is unconstitutional and could undermine property rights and deter investment. The Zuma Administration plans to resubmit legislation in 2011 for land redistribution in South Africa. They aim to address slow progress in transferring land to black beneficiaries, with a deadline extension to 2025 due to funding shortages. Critics warn that proposed measures could deter investment and undermine property rights. According to a South African think tank, the main land need in the country is for housing rather than farming. While demand for land among employed agricultural workers is low, those living on the land without other income sources have high aspirations for more land. This minority group poses a significant policy challenge. South Africa continues to face high levels of violent crime, including murder, robberies, car hijackings, and rape. The high crime rate in South Africa is attributed to wealth disparity, police force shortcomings, and lack of a comprehensive government approach. President Zuma aims to reduce serious crimes by 7-10% annually. Despite efforts to improve safety for tourists, some were deterred from visiting during the World Cup due to crime fears. The government deployed 40,000 new police officers for the event, resulting in a temporary drop in crime rates. During the World Cup held in June and July, South Africa's crime rate dropped, leading to fewer cases in special courtrooms. Fears of a terrorist incident, similar to the one in Mumbai in 2008, did not materialize. The South African Police collaborated with INTERPOL and other international partners for the event, receiving special anti-terrorism training. South Africa experienced its first recession in 17 years in 2009, with GDP growth rates fluctuating between 3% and -1.8% due to the global economic downturn. The growth rate is projected to increase to 3.7% in 2011. The growth rate in South Africa rose to 2.8% in 2010 and is expected to increase to 3.7% in 2011. Unemployment estimates range from 25% to 40%, far above the government's target of 15%. The poverty-stricken townships surrounding South Africa's cities remain a potential source of political instability, with periodic riots erupting to protest corruption and inadequate service delivery. Conditions in the townships have marginally improved. South Africa's townships have seen marginal improvements with increased electricity availability and clean water taps. The country's reform-oriented macro-economic policy in the late 1990s, known as the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, received international praise for promoting open markets and trade liberalization. However, despite achieving macroeconomic stability, unemployment continued to rise and income inequality persisted, particularly along racial lines. The average income of black households in South Africa almost doubled in the first decade after apartheid. The government announced a 22% rise in national income since 1999. The Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative aimed to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment rates by 2014. Slow privatization pace contributed to economic difficulties. The Mbeki government remained involved in various sectors despite its commitment to privatization. Delays in privatization were due to concerns about unemployment and criticism from labor unions. The government promoted black empowerment through the Black Economic Empowerment program to address racial inequalities in the business sector. The Black Economic Empowerment program, initiated in 1994 to address racial inequalities in the business sector, has seen an increase in black ownership and a growing black middle class. However, challenges such as a lack of skilled labor and complex regulations may hinder its progress. The government introduced the BEE Codes of Good Practice in 2007, which set empowerment requirements for companies. A new economic growth strategy in 2010 aims to revise the BEE codes to boost job creation, skills development, and investment. In the first decade of post-apartheid rule, South Africa's economic growth was attributed to sound macroeconomic policies and legislation aimed at improving competition. Despite being ranked as one of the top 35 easiest countries to do business in, investors are concerned about labor relations, high crime rates, and corruption. South Africa's ranking in corruption has fallen from 43 in 2007, with political risks and internal divisions seen as deterrents to investors. Concerns over a potential Zuma presidency were initially raised, but reassurance was provided through strategic appointments in key government positions. Pravin Gordhan, former head of South Africa's Revenue Service, will continue economic policies of his predecessor. Gill Marcus, Reserve Bank Governor, maintains monetary policy. South Africa aims for a larger role in global economic forums, being a member of G20 and invited to join BRIC. Market concerns have been allayed. Goldman Sachs analyst questions China's motives for inviting South Africa to join BRIC, citing the country's smaller economy compared to other emerging markets like South Korea, Mexico, and Turkey. South Africa, heavily impacted by the global economic downturn, faced job losses in 2009. President Zuma's pledge to create new jobs was hindered by revenue shortfalls and private sector retrenchment. Labor unions pose additional challenges to the administration. The South African Government faces challenges from labor unions and aims to create five million new jobs by 2020 through the New Growth Path strategy, which also emphasizes fiscal discipline and private sector involvement. Structural barriers like skills shortages may hinder goal achievement, with resistance to wage and bonus caps from ANC partner COSATU and the business community. The 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa aimed to boost tourism and economic growth, with significant symbolic value due to the country's history of apartheid and sports boycotts. Soccer played a crucial role in the lives of political prisoners on Robben Island. Soccer was important to political prisoners on Robben Island during apartheid. The Makana Football Association was formed after intervention by the International Red Cross. Nelson Mandela couldn't play, but Jacob Zuma was a founding member. South Africa invested $5 billion in infrastructure for the 2010 World Cup. South Africa invested $5 billion in infrastructure for the 2010 World Cup, including building a new airport in Durban, improving transportation links, stadiums, and security. The event drew over 3 million fans, but tourist numbers fell short of expectations. Despite this, the World Cup brought in approximately $500 million in foreign spending and may have boosted the country's GDP growth by 0.5%. In 2010, South Africa's economic growth was hindered by an overstretched electricity network, leading to severe power cuts that cost the economy millions. The mining sector was heavily impacted, causing global gold and platinum prices to rise. The government blamed Eskom for the crisis and began rationing electricity while investing in upgrading the infrastructure. South Africa is investing in upgrading its electricity infrastructure with a $3.7 billion loan from the World Bank to Eskom. Despite efforts, experts predict ongoing shortages and steep power bill increases. The government plans to increase renewable energy usage, cut carbon emissions by 42% in 15 years, and create 300,000 \"green\" jobs. A new subsidy plan to buy energy from renewable sources is set to start in 2011. Some doubt the government's commitment to these policies. The U.S. had a contentious policymaking history towards South Africa and the anti-apartheid struggle from the 1960s to the 1980s. The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 imposed sanctions against South Africa, despite President Reagan's veto. In the early 1990s, the U.S. supported South Africa's transition to democracy, viewing it as a model for other African countries. South Africa's leadership in regional roles, including launching NEPAD and peacekeeping efforts in various African countries, has showcased its capabilities as a stabilizing force. The country's involvement in conflict mediation and resolution has been recognized by the United States, leading to collaboration in resolving crises such as Haiti's political turmoil in 2004. Since 1992, South Africa has been a top recipient of U.S. aid, with funding increasing to $578 million in FY2010. The majority of this aid goes towards HIV/AIDS and health programs. The U.S. aims to shift its relationship with South Africa from donor to strategic partner, focusing on peace and security initiatives while phasing out development programs. Assistance continues to target HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and economic growth. The USAID programs in South Africa focus on fighting HIV/AIDS, promoting economic growth, and enhancing the country's capacity for regional peacekeeping and countering transnational crime. The South African government emphasizes budget transparency and ranks second in public spending transparency. The United States provides significant assistance through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), contributing over $2 billion since FY2004 and providing ARV therapy to nearly 917,700 patients in FY2010. The United States supports South Africa's efforts in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment through PEPFAR, providing ARV therapy to over 917,700 patients. The partnership includes funding for pregnant HIV-infected women, counseling, testing, and palliative care for millions of South Africans. Public education efforts promote healthy behavior to reduce transmission risk. A Partnership Framework was signed in 2010 to improve coordination, and the Obama Administration recognizes South Africa's leadership role. Additionally, a Trilateral Assistance Program supports South Africa in delivering foreign aid to other African countries. During Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to South Africa in August 2009, she pledged to deepen engagement with South Africa and launch a high-level strategic dialogue. The dialogue began in April 2010, focusing on law enforcement, trade, transportation, human rights, health, and agriculture. Prior cooperation between the U.S. and South Africa had already made progress in renewable energy, nuclear power, AIDS programs, and defense cooperation. Law enforcement authorities from both countries have also collaborated on terrorism investigations. South Africa has been involved in terrorism investigations, with concerns about Islamic militants hiding in the country and using its transportation and communication systems for illegal activities. There is worry about terrorists using South African travel documents, as some individuals with suspected ties to terrorism have been apprehended with these documents at various borders. The U.S. State Department has expressed concerns about fraudulent South African travel documents being linked to corruption within the Department of Home Affairs. The United States provides assistance to South African authorities, including the South African Police Service, to counter terrorism and prevent illicit trade in weapons of mass destruction. The Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection helped develop a law enforcement unit within the South African Revenue Service focused on WMD issues. The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has a Container Security Initiative team in Durban, supported by U.S. assistance for security training related to the 2010 World Cup. The U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control includes South African nationals in its Specially Designated Nationals List for terrorism links. In 2007, South Africa blocked UN sanctions on individuals linked to terrorism. South Africa opposed UN sanctions on individuals linked to terrorism, including Farhad Ahmed Dockrat and Dr. Junaid Ismail Dockrat. The country has differences with the U.S. over designating Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations. Despite cordial relations, diplomatic differences have strained U.S.-South African relations in recent years. South Africa has had close ties with Non-Aligned Movement countries and shown sympathy towards countries independent from the West. Initially opposed to locating AFRICOM on the continent, South Africa later allowed a historic visit by the USS Theodore Roosevelt and engaged in training exercises with the USS Arleigh Burke. Military relations are improving, but differences remain on issues like the war in Iraq and Iran. Former President Nelson Mandela criticized U.S. unilateralism on Iraq. South Africa's stance on human rights issues, particularly in the context of its role as a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council from 2007 to 2008, drew criticism from the United States and human rights activists. South Africa's decision to vote against a resolution on political prisoners in Burma and block discussions on human rights abuses in Zimbabwe while serving as President of the Security Council raised concerns. Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu also commented on the situation in Burma. South Africa's controversial stance on human rights issues, including voting against resolutions on Burma and Zimbabwe, drew criticism. Archbishop Desmond Tutu expressed disappointment in the country's actions, comparing them to supporting apartheid. Former DA leader Tony Leon also criticized the government for refusing to address the Zimbabwe situation. In July 2008, South Africa voted against a U.S.-sponsored resolution on Zimbabwe, aligning with Russia, China, Vietnam, and Libya. South Africa's stance on international issues included opposition to sanctions on Sudan and Iran, arguing they would not reduce tensions. However, after modifications, South Africa did vote for sanctions. The country also abstained from a U.S.-sponsored resolution on Lebanon, preferring a tribunal with \"Lebanese ownership.\" South Africa voted for sanctions against Iran in March 2007 to remind Iran of its responsibilities. Zimbabwe experienced political and economic turmoil, leading to a massive exodus of Zimbabweans in search of work. A cholera outbreak in 2008 and early 2009 worsened the situation, with an estimated four million Zimbabweans leaving the country by 2009. South Africa sent back those caught entering illegally. Zimbabwe's economy has slightly improved since the new government formed in early 2009. Since the formation of the new government in early 2009, basic goods are available in Zimbabwe. Less than 10% of the population is formally employed, leading many to seek economic opportunities abroad. South Africa suspended deportation of illegal Zimbabwe immigrants in April 2009 but ended the special dispensation in September 2010. Over one million Zimbabweans reside in South Africa, facing challenges in obtaining residency permits. Deportations may begin in April, causing concern among advocacy groups. Advocacy groups are concerned about possible deportations starting in April 2011. Xenophobic attacks in 2008 led to violence against Zimbabweans in South Africa, causing many to become homeless or return to their country. Resentment towards immigrants remains a potential trigger for violence. President George W. Bush referred to President Mbeki as his \"point man\" on Zimbabwe during a 2003 visit to Africa. The United States has criticized Zimbabwe's President Mugabe for human rights violations and imposed sanctions on Zimbabwean leaders. President Mbeki chose to engage with President Mugabe differently. President Mbeki's Zimbabwe policies faced criticism from South African leaders, including Mandela, Tutu, and COSATU. South African officials urge western countries to reconsider penalties on Zimbabwe. The US supports Zimbabwe's coalition government but remains critical of Mugabe and hardliners in the government, hesitant to ease sanctions. Concerns persist over political and press freedoms, government appointments, and lack of progress. Opposition and the US request SADC to intervene as mediator and guarantor. South Africa, as mediator and guarantor of the political agreement in Zimbabwe, is urged to press for reforms by the US and others. South Africa's strong trade relationship with the US includes agreements like TIFA and TIDCA. Instability in Zimbabwe could lead to illegal migration and impact South Africa. South Africa has a Trade, Investment, and Development Cooperative Agreement (TIDCA) with the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) since 2008. It is the largest market for U.S. goods in Africa, with key exports including transportation equipment, chemicals, and electronic products. South Africa benefits from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) with duty-free entry for most exports to the U.S. The Obama Administration allocated $13 million in foreign assistance for South Africa's economic development in FY2010. The request for $13 million aims to support South Africa's economic development by enhancing SMEs, financial services, and addressing skills shortages. The U.S. government also utilizes resources like a $43 million USAID fund for agriculture financing. Analysts predict political stability in South Africa despite tensions over land and wealth distribution. Social tensions in Zimbabwe over wealth distribution and service delivery have led to violent attacks on African immigrants. South Africa's stability depends on government efforts to fight poverty and AIDS. Concerns exist about the ANC becoming a one-party state, potentially leading to authoritarianism. ANC leaders argue for their commitment to transforming South Africa and uplifting the poor. The ANC leaders in South Africa aim to position their country as a leader in Africa and advocate for developing countries in global affairs. The country's success as a democracy is crucial for fulfilling these aspirations."
