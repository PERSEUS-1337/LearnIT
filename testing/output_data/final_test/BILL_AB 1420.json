    "title": "AB 1420",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that existing regulations for smaller diameter pipelines were insufficient to protect the community of Arvin, California from a serious gas leak in March 2014. They recommend reviewing and updating regulations for active gas pipelines four inches or less in diameter to prevent damage to life, health, property, and natural resources. The Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources has the authority to assess active gas pipelines for integrity. If a leak in a pipeline within their jurisdiction poses a risk to public health or safety, the local health officer must collaborate with the division and the pipeline owner to address the issue. The responsible party must test soil, air, and water for contamination from the leak and disclose results to the public. If the leak poses a serious threat, assistance including temporary relocation must be provided to affected residents. If deemed necessary, all affected residents must be notified. The responsible party is liable for costs incurred by the local health officer. Assistance and reimbursement for officer expenses do not exempt the responsible party from liability for damages. The division must review and update regulations for active gas pipelines in sensitive areas by January 1, 2018. The division must review existing pipeline integrity requirements to ensure the operation of active gas pipelines in sensitive areas by January 1, 2018. Operators need to submit up-to-date maps and locational information as part of compliance with pipeline management plan requirements. The division conducts random spot checks to verify accurate reporting of gas pipeline information. They maintain a list of active gas pipelines in sensitive areas, defined as locations near buildings or areas posing a threat in case of a leak. Section 3270.6 of the Public Resources Code requires prompt notification to authorities upon the discovery of a leak from an active gas pipeline in a sensitive area. This does not limit the supervisor's authority under other sections of the code. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
