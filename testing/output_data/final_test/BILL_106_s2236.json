    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Children's Day Care Health and Safety Improvement Act\" and includes findings related to child care. Congress finds that almost 13,000,000 children under age 6 in the United States spend time in child care, with many states lacking adequate safety standards. A study by the Consumer Product Safety Commission revealed safety hazards in licensed child care settings, highlighting the need for improved safety regulations nationwide. Compliance with national safety standards varies significantly by state. In 1997, 31,000 children ages 4 and younger were treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries in child care or school settings. The Consumer Product Safety Commission reported 56 children have died in child care settings since 1990. The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes safe facilities, equipment, and transportation in quality child care. A study of 133 child care centers found that 85% of directors believe health consultation is important for child care centers. Compliance with safety standards varies by state. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the terms \"child with a disability\" and \"infant or toddler with a disability\" are defined according to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. An \"eligible child care provider\" is a provider of child care services that is legally operating and meets state and local requirements. The term \"family child care provider\" refers to an individual who offers child care services for less than 24 hours a day as the sole caregiver in a private residence. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and \"State\" includes various states and territories of the United States. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $200,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2001 and additional funds for subsequent years. SEC. 5. PROGRAMS. Secretary to allot funds to States for child care health and safety programs. SEC. 6. AMOUNTS RESERVED; ALLOTMENTS. The Secretary reserves a small portion of funds for Guam, American Samoa, US Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands. States receive allotments based on specific calculations from the remaining funds after reservations are made. The formula for determining the allotment percentage for States involves factors such as the school lunch factor and the young child factor, based on population data provided by the Census Bureau. The allotment percentage for a State under the National School Lunch Act is determined by dividing the per capita income of all individuals in the United States by the per capita income of all individuals in the State, with limitations set at 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent. The allotment percentage of a State under the National School Lunch Act is determined based on per capita income, with a limit of 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent. Per capita income is calculated every 2 years and is the average of the annual per capita incomes for the most recent 3-year period with data from the Department of Commerce. The Secretary obtains data from federal agencies to determine allotments for States. The term \"State\" includes the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. State applications for child care health and safety funding must be submitted to the Secretary with specific information on state needs, program goals, and progress measures. Funds allocated must be used according to program goals. State that receives funding for child care health and safety must use the funds for activities such as training providers on preventing injuries, strengthening standards, assisting providers in meeting standards, and enforcing regulations. The funds allocated for child care health and safety are used for various activities, including increased inspections, providing health consultants, assisting providers in serving children with disabilities, conducting background checks, offering information to parents, and improving transportation safety for children in child care programs. Funds from this Act must supplement, not replace, other public funds for services for eligible individuals. Each State receiving an allotment under section 6 must annually submit a report to the Secretary detailing activities and progress towards goals outlined in their application under section 7."
