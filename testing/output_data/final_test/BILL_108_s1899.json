    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Cancer Act of 2003\". In 2003, Congress found that an estimated 1,334,100 Americans will be diagnosed with cancer, with 556,500 deaths. The National Institutes of Health estimated the overall cost of cancer at $171.6 billion. Additionally, 211,300 American women and 1,300 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,200 will die from it. 40,100 women will be diagnosed with uterine corpus cancer, with 6,800 deaths. In 2003, an estimated 147,500 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 57,100 will die of the disease. Incidence rates stabilized between 1995 and 1999, possibly due to increased screening and polyp removal. Screening for colorectal cancer can reduce deaths by at least 30 percent. Regular screenings can lead to early detection of various cancers, increasing the 5-year survival rate. (10) Various cancers such as lung, mouth, bladder, and pancreas are linked to tobacco use, causing a significant number of cancer deaths. Smoking alone contributes to one-third of all cancer deaths. (11) Over 1,000,000 skin cancers expected in 2003 could have been prevented with sun protection. (12) Around 9,000 new cases of childhood cancer are projected for 2003, with cancer being the leading cause of death in children aged 1-14. (13) Nutrition, physical inactivity, and other lifestyle factors are estimated to contribute to about one-third of the 556,500 cancer deaths expected in 2003. In 2003, cancer care for seniors must reflect true treatment costs. Death rates for common cancers are decreasing. Gleevec was approved as an effective cancer treatment in 2001. In 2002, Gleevec was found to stop the growth of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In early 2003, gene chips were used to predict breast cancer tumor spread. The Lance Armstrong Foundation defines cancer survivorship as living through and beyond cancer. In 2001, there were 9,600,000 cancer survivors in the United States. In 2001, there were 9,600,000 cancer survivors in the United States. Sixty percent of adults diagnosed with cancer survive at least 5 years. Over 80 percent of children diagnosed with cancer now survive at least 5 years. The Senate emphasizes the importance of achieving the goal of making cancer survivorship common and cancer deaths rare by 2015. Additionally, a national program for cancer registries is being enhanced to prepare for the future. The Secretary must develop a strategic plan within a year of the National Cancer Act of 2003 to enhance data sharing between State cancer registries and the SEER program. The plan aims to standardize data, improve data portability, increase data collection from healthcare facilities, and maximize the use of registry data for researchers and public health planners. The strategic plan aims to enhance data sharing between State cancer registries and the SEER program to improve data use in public health planning and research on cancer care quality and access. SEC. 102. ENHANCING EXISTING SCREENING EFFORTS. The text chunk discusses the grant and contract authority of states regarding applications for colorectal cancer screening strategies and outreach. States may prioritize applications that demonstrate equivalent quality in these areas. The State may prioritize grant or contract applications for cancer treatment strategies for uninsured women diagnosed with cancer found during screening if the quality is equivalent to other applications. The Secretary can waive the direct services requirement under certain conditions. The State can use the grant for a project to leverage private funds or if the requirement hinders the enrollment of qualifying women. The authorization of appropriations is amended for fiscal years 2004 through 2008. The Director of the CDC must submit a report on the success of the Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Initiative within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Initiative aims to increase public awareness, educate healthcare providers, monitor screening rates, promote patient-provider communication, support research efforts, and provide funding to State programs. SEC. 103. ENHANCED PATIENT EDUCATION. A new section is added to the Public Health Service Act to enhance patient education. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible entities to educate patients and families about effective medical techniques, pain management, cancer survivorship challenges, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, peer support programs, and community resources for quality cancer care. The eligible entities can apply for grants to increase access to quality cancer care through community resources. The Secretary may require specific information in the application. Authorization of appropriations is available for this purpose. SEC. 104. PRACTITIONER EDUCATION PROGRAM. A center must maintain a program for disseminating information on pain management, palliative care, and cancer survivorship challenges to patients, caregivers, and research participants to receive funding. The Secretary may provide additional funding to centers that develop relationships with community healthcare providers targeting underserved populations to improve access to quality cancer care. SEC. 105. ELEVATING THE IMPORTANCE OF PAIN MANAGEMENT AND CANCER SURVIVORSHIP THROUGHOUT THE NATION'S CANCER PROGRAMS. The National Cancer Program is being amended to include an expanded research program covering pain management, survivorship, and prevention of cancer from environmental exposure to carcinogens. It also includes research on populations with diverse genetic variation and geographic isolation. The National Cancer Program is being amended to include an expanded research program covering pain management, survivorship, and prevention of cancer from environmental exposure to carcinogens. It also includes research on populations with diverse genetic variation and geographic isolation. The program will assess and improve pain and symptom management for individuals with cancer, including end-of-life care and cancer survivorship. The National Cancer Program is being amended to include research on pain and symptom management, cancer survivorship, and prevention of cancer. This includes basic, clinical, and applied research on pain management and cancer survivorship for breast and gynecological cancers. The National Cancer Program is being amended to include research on pain and symptom management, cancer survivorship, and prevention of cancer. This involves basic and clinical research on pain management and cancer survivorship for various types of cancer, including prostate cancer. SEC. 106 amends the Public Health Service Act to include a Survivorship Research Program under the National Cancer Program. Establishment of the Office on Cancer Survivorship within the Institute to expand and coordinate cancer survivorship research activities. Collaboration with other agencies within the National Institutes of Health. A report on survivorship activities and future strategies to be submitted to Congress within a year. TITLE II--RESEARCH PROVISIONS\n\nSEC. 201. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE.\n\nOther Transactions Authority added to the Public Health Service Act for the National Cancer Institute. The Director of the National Cancer Institute may cofund grant projects with private entities for any purpose described in this subpart. The Senate acknowledges the inefficiency of multiple local institutional review boards for clinical trials and supports centralizing the process to expedite lifesaving treatments for cancer patients. The National Cancer Institute aims to enhance patient access to experimental therapies by integrating private manufacturers' trials into its database and providing education on accessing clinical trials online. The National Cancer Institute aims to improve patient access to experimental therapies by including private manufacturers' trials in its database and offering education on accessing clinical trials online. Additionally, it provides information on the FDA process for approving drugs and biologics for individual patients."
