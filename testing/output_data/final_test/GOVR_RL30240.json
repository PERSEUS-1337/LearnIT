    "content": "Congress has a long history of oversight over the executive branch, with techniques like special investigations, reporting requirements, and resolutions of inquiry. Recent developments have increased Congress's ability to check the Executive, with laws and rules enhancing its power. Explicit recognition of oversight in public law came with the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, requiring continuous watchfulness by committees. Since the late 1960s, Congress has shown increasing interest in oversight due to the expansion of federal programs and agencies, budget deficits, and divided government. Oversight occurs through various channels, from formal committee hearings to informal Member contacts with executive officials. Congressional oversight of the executive involves reviewing actions and regulations to ensure faithful execution of laws and efficient program management. The objective is to strengthen federal programs through better operations and service delivery, improving accountability and program performance. Systematic program performance evaluation using social science and management methodologies like surveys and cost-benefit analyses began in the late 1960s to address concerns of executive overreach and inefficiencies in federal programs. Increased oversight was called for to counter executive arrogation of legislative prerogatives and address instances of fraud, corruption, and incompetent management. Oversight in Congress is crucial to address fraud, corruption, and incompetent management in federal programs. Various methods, such as agency reports, inspector general offices, and the appropriations process, help evaluate agency performance and expenditures. Congressional oversight ensures accountability and effectiveness in government operations. Congressional oversight allows for detailed review of recent expenditures and reauthorizations of federal agencies and programs. This oversight can lead to abolishing ineffective programs, enhancing effective ones, and ensuring that federal programs adequately serve the public's needs. It also helps safeguard citizens' rights and liberties by uncovering abuses of authority and preventing their recurrence through legislative or administrative actions. Congressional oversight aims to review agency processes, monitor contractor use, promote cooperation between branches, examine personnel procedures, gather information for policymaking, investigate complaints and critiques, assess program effectiveness, compare programs, protect against unjust criticisms, and study federal evaluations. The Constitution grants Congress extensive authority to oversee and investigate executive branch activities through the power of the purse and the power to organize the executive branch. Congress can control funding, define spending purposes, and create, abolish, or reorganize federal departments and agencies. Congress has the authority to create, abolish, reorganize, and fund federal departments and agencies, as well as assign functions and grant new authority to administrators. It also has the power to make laws for executing its own enumerated powers and those of the executive branch. This includes powers such as taxation, regulation of commerce, declaring war, maintaining armed forces, and establishing post offices. The Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to make laws necessary for carrying out its powers. The Constitution grants broad authority to regulate and oversee departmental activities. This includes the power to confirm officers, conduct investigations, and inquire into executive branch operations to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. Impeachment provides Congress with a powerful oversight tool to investigate executive and judicial misbehavior and remove offending individuals from office. Laws such as the 1912 Anti-Gag Legislation and Whistleblower Protection Laws for Federal Employees augment Congress's authority to conduct oversight. The 1912 Anti-Gag Legislation and Whistleblower Protection Laws for Federal Employees prohibit civil service employees from communicating directly with Congress and protect whistleblowers from retaliation for disclosing information related to violations of law or mismanagement. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, protect whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community and prohibit the withholding of information from Congress. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 prohibits communication between officers or employees and Members, committees, or subcommittees. It also prohibits the expenditure of funds for enforcing non-disclosure policies that conflict with employee rights under E.O. 12958. The curr_chunk discusses various laws and acts that govern employee obligations, rights, and liabilities, including the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, Military Whistleblower Act, Whistleblower Protection Act, Intelligence Identities Protection Act, and others. It also mentions the 1921 Budget and Accounting Act establishing the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the 1946 Legislative Reorganization Act. The 1946 Legislative Reorganization Act mandated House and Senate committees to oversee laws and programs, authorized permanent staff for committees, directed the Comptroller General to analyze executive branch agencies, and established the Legislative Reference Service in the Library of Congress. The 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act revised the oversight function of House and Senate standing committees to review and study the application, administration, and execution of laws. The 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act enhanced oversight functions of House and Senate committees, requiring biennial reports, strengthening GAO evaluation responsibilities, and redesignating the Legislative Reference Service as the Congressional Research Service. Committees were also recommended to assess programs for annual appropriations. The 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act required House and Senate committees to include five-year cost estimates in their reports and increased the number of permanent staff for each committee. The 1972 Federal Advisory Committee Act directed committees to review advisory committees and consider abolishing or revising them. The 1974 Congressional Budget Act expanded oversight functions of House and Senate committees. The 1974 Congressional Budget Act expanded House and Senate committee authority for oversight, directed the Comptroller General to review and evaluate government programs, strengthened GAO's role in acquiring information, and established House and Senate Budget Committees and the Congressional Budget Office. The 1974 Congressional Budget Act established House and Senate Budget Committees and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), giving the CBO director authority to gather information from government departments. It also required legislative committee reports to include cost estimates for bills over the next five fiscal years. Congress has also strengthened oversight indirectly by creating study commissions and other mechanisms. Congress has established mechanisms within the executive branch to improve monitoring and control, providing oversight through statutes like the Inspector General Act of 1978, Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, Financial Integrity Act of 1982, and Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990. The government has implemented various acts to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in federal operations, including the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, Government Management and Reform Act of 1994, Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and Information Technology Improvement Act of 1996. The government has implemented various acts to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in federal operations. This includes the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which allows the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase troubled assets to strengthen the economy. It also established oversight organizations like the Financial Stability Oversight Board and Congressional Oversight Panel. The Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 established oversight organizations like the Stability Oversight Board and Congressional Oversight Panel. It also assigned audit responsibilities to the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the Comptroller General of the United States. Congress called on the GAO to report annually on areas of potential duplication, overlap, and fragmentation. House rules grant the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform a comprehensive role in oversight. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has oversight duties including reviewing government activities for economy and efficiency, evaluating laws reorganizing branches of government, studying intergovernmental relationships, and reporting an oversight agenda. House rules mandate oversight efforts by standing committees, including reviewing laws within their jurisdiction, investigating under Rule XI, reviewing tax policy impacts, and ensuring effective coordination of oversight plans. Each standing committee (except Appropriations and Budget) is responsible for futures research, forecasting, and special oversight authority over specific subject areas within their legislative jurisdiction. Committees with more than 20 members must establish an oversight subcommittee or require their subcommittees to conduct oversight in their jurisdictional areas. Committee reports on measures are required. Each standing committee must submit oversight plans for the Congress by February 15 of the first session, with the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform reporting an oversight agenda by March 31. Committees are to consult with other committees in developing these plans. The committee must consult with other House committees, review problematic federal laws, prioritize laws with permanent authority, and ensure coordination in reviewing laws, programs, or agencies. The committee must submit semi-annual reports to the House summarizing legislative and oversight activities, including actions taken and recommendations made. The reports must also include proposals to cut or eliminate inefficient, duplicative, or outdated programs. House Rule XI, clause 2 mandates standing committees to hold hearings on waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in government programs every 120 days. Committees must focus on documented instances of waste and mismanagement, and hold hearings if financial statements are not in order or if a program is deemed high risk by the GAO. The Speaker, with House approval, can appoint special ad hoc oversight committees for specific matters within the jurisdiction of multiple standing committees. Standing committees, except for Appropriations and Budget, are required to review and study the application of laws within their jurisdiction. They are also granted comprehensive policy oversight responsibilities. For example, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is authorized to study and review matters related to food, nutrition, and hunger. All standing committees, except Appropriations, must prepare regulatory impact evaluations in their reports. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has oversight duties including reviewing government activities for economy and efficiency, evaluating the effects of laws on reorganization, and studying intergovernmental relationships. Regulatory impact evaluations in committee reports must estimate the impact on individuals and businesses, economic effects, privacy impact, and additional paperwork resulting from each public bill or joint resolution. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was established in 1948 as an outgrowth of the Truman Committee to investigate government waste, fraud, and inefficiency. It operates under the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and has conducted numerous investigations since its inception. Casework and project work in a Member's office can uncover bureaucratic behavior and policy issues, leading to changes in agency policies and public law. Individual Members may conduct investigations or oversight studies, but lack the authority for official hearings. External agencies or research groups may be called upon to conduct investigations. The House and Senate utilize committees to conduct oversight investigations of federal activities and agencies. Committees like the House Committee on Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security have broad investigatory powers. Standing committees review government activities within their jurisdiction and have authority in oversight responsibilities. Certain House and Senate committees have special oversight of designated subject areas. Constituent letters and complaints often bring problems in federal programs to the attention of Members. Casework performed by a Member's staff can be an effective oversight tool. Casework and legislative staffs maximize service to their Member's constituents by establishing a relationship with subcommittees and committees. This interaction helps identify problems, assess their significance, determine causes, and recommend corrective action. Effective staffing and coordination are essential for casework to be a useful oversight technique. Committee staff play a crucial role in oversight by identifying cases for procedural changes, prompting congressional inquiry, and providing expert help for investigations. They have the experience and expertise to conduct effective oversight and may seek assistance from legislative support agencies or federal departments. Informal contacts with executive officials are also important for Congress's oversight efforts. Congress's oversight function is supported by key agencies like the Congressional Budget Office, Congressional Research Service, and Government Accountability Office. Other offices that assist in oversight include the House General Counsel's Office, House Parliamentarian's Office, House Clerk's Office, Senate Legal Counsel's Office, Senate Historian's Office, and Senate Library. Coordination among committees remains a challenge for Congress in conducting oversight. Oversight coordination between House and Senate committees is uncommon and usually occurs after major policy failures or conflicts. Intercommittee cooperation can minimize duplication and conflict, and prevent agencies from manipulating committees. Formal and informal methods can be used to achieve oversight coordination among committees. The House and Senate can establish select or special committees to probe issues and agencies, promote public understanding of national concerns, and coordinate oversight of issues overlapping the jurisdiction of standing committees. House rules require findings and recommendations of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to be considered by authorizing committees in a timely manner and published in their reports. Oversight plans must include ways to maximize coordination among committees sharing jurisdiction. Joint oversight hearings and informal agreements among committees are common methods for oversight coordination. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 enhanced Congress's budget shaping capacity by creating new entities and establishing procedures for determining budget policy as a whole. The House and Senate Committees on Commerce collaborate with appropriations subcommittees to oversee regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission. The new budget process established by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 allows Congress to determine budget policy, prioritize national programs, and ensure consistency in revenue, spending, and debt legislation. It coexists with authorization and appropriation procedures, requiring committees to submit budgetary views and estimates and new contract and borrowing authority to go through the appropriations process. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established a new budget process for Congress to prioritize national programs and ensure consistency in revenue, spending, and debt legislation. The Act allows committees to submit budgetary views and estimates, and new contract and borrowing authority to go through the appropriations process. The Budget Act reforms aim to strengthen oversight by enabling Congress to relate program priorities to financial claims on the national budget. Each committee receives a fixed amount in a budget resolution, incentivizing scrutiny of existing programs to make room for new programs or expanded funding. Congress exercises significant control over government agencies through the authorization process, which involves oversight tools like hearings and reports. An authorization statute shapes government programs and agencies, setting legislative policy and funding limits. The authorization-reauthorization process educates Members about agency work and allows them to direct agency efforts. The authorization process allows Congress to control government agencies through oversight tools like hearings and reports. It educates Members about agency work and gives them the opportunity to direct agency efforts. Periodic authorizations improve the likelihood of systematic scrutiny, while non-statutory controls increase committee influence. The appropriations process is crucial for Congress's oversight role, as it stems from the constitutional requirement that all money must be appropriated by law. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have significant power in oversight due to Congress's power of the purse. If agencies do not comply with informal directives from authorization committees, sanctions can be applied or directives can be converted into statutory commands. The Committees on Appropriations oversee budget requests and agency performance, using past records for assessment. Their recommendations hold significant power in Congress and the federal government. Appropriations legislation includes controls on fund usage and specified funding levels for agencies and programs. The appropriations legislation sets funding levels and controls on fund usage for agencies and programs. Nonstatutory controls, such as legislative language in committee reports, provide detailed instructions to agencies. Agencies are not legally obligated to follow non-statutory recommendations, but failure to do so may lead to a loss of funds and flexibility the following year. Congress has the power of investigation, rooted in the Constitution and upheld by Supreme Court decisions. The House of Representatives is expected to function as a \"grand inquest\" based on parliamentary precedents. Investigations in Congress can be conducted by individual Members, committees, staff, or outside organizations. They serve to ensure honesty in law administration, provide information for policy decisions, and inform the public. Congressional hearings establish a public record of nominees' policy views for accountability. Senate committees scrutinize nominees' qualifications, independence, and policy preferences since the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. The Senate committees dedicate time to scrutinize the qualifications, independence, and policy preferences of presidential nominees during confirmation hearings, as mandated by the Constitution. This process allows for oversight and influence on nominees' policies and programs. The confirmation process serves as an oversight tool to provide policy direction, inform nominees of congressional interests, and extract future commitments. Oversight continues post-confirmation to ensure commitment fulfillment. Impeachment is a unique oversight tool for extreme cases. The President has alternative appointment authority without Senate consent. Impeachment is a unique oversight tool for extreme cases involving the President, Vice President, and other federal civil officers. The House of Representatives has the power to impeach with a majority vote, while the Senate conducts the trial and requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the individual. In Nixon v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled on the use of a 12-member committee in an impeachment proceeding. The committee does not make recommendations or rule on relevancy, materiality, and competency. It provides a transcript and evidence to the full Senate for consideration, which then decides on conviction. The impeachment process involves the House voting to impeach and the Senate voting to convict, with only eight cases resulting in conviction. The most recent executive impeachment trial was President Clinton in 1998-99, and the most recent judicial impeachment trial was U.S. District Court Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. in 2010. Constitutional and procedural issues were addressed in past impeachment proceedings, with some questions remaining ambiguous. The Constitution defines grounds for impeachment as \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" The interpretation of \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" varies among legislators. Impeachment applies to the President, Vice President, and civil Officers of the United States. Members of Congress are not subject to impeachment. William Blount, a U.S. Senator, was impeached in 1797 but expelled instead of facing trial. Congressional oversight and investigations can sustain and vindicate. Congressional investigations, historically significant from events like Teapot Dome to Watergate, play a crucial role in upholding Congress's constitutional authority. This section outlines the legal and procedural aspects committees face during oversight and investigations, emphasizing Congress's prerogatives to maintain legislative integrity. Congressional committees conduct oversight and investigations, including subpoenas, staff depositions, and hearings. The section discusses contempt of Congress and limitations on congressional authority, such as executive privilege. It also addresses legal issues like the Privacy Act, access to grand jury materials, and classified information. Congress has broad authority to obtain information. The Supreme Court has established that congressional oversight and investigations are essential to the legislative function, even without specific authorization in the Constitution or statutes. The Court emphasized the broad power of Congress to conduct inquiries, including into waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within the government. Congressional oversight and investigative authority is implied from Article I of the Constitution and rests with the House of Representatives and Senate. The power to inquire into corruption, inefficiency, or waste within government departments has been recognized by the Supreme Court. This authority has been delegated to standing committees of Congress, allowing them to investigate matters within their scope. A congressional committee's investigative purview is substantial and wide-ranging if it satisfies jurisdictional requirements and has a legislative purpose. Establishing committee jurisdiction is crucial for obtaining information from the executive branch or private entities. Claiming lawful jurisdiction allows the committee to inquire and request information, but access may be subject to privileges asserted by the targets of the inquiry. The jurisdiction of a congressional committee is defined by the enabling chamber rule or resolution, which outlines the committee's authority and limitations. Courts will refer to the rule itself and legislative history to determine the scope of the committee's power. House Rule X and Senate Rule XXV establish the organization and jurisdiction of standing committees. Special investigations may be conducted by standing committees, joint committees, or special subcommittees. The congressional power of inquiry is broad but not unlimited, as it must be in aid of the legislative function. The Supreme Court has emphasized that Congress cannot use its investigative power solely for exposure and cannot delve into private affairs without justification. The jurisdiction of a congressional committee is defined by specific rules and resolutions, ensuring that committees do not overstep their authority. The Congress is not a law enforcement or trial agency, with functions of the executive and judicial departments. Inquiries must have a legislative purpose or be conducted under constitutional powers. Courts generally presume a legislative purpose for investigations, even if not explicitly stated in the authorization. In In re Chapman, the Court upheld a resolution authorizing an inquiry into corruption charges against Senators, stating that the questions were pertinent to the inquiry. The resolution directed the committee to investigate whether Senators were speculating in sugar stocks during the consideration of a tariff bill. The Court did not speculate on potential actions by the Senate based on the investigation's findings. The Senate had jurisdiction to pursue an inquiry into reprehensible transactions, indicating they were deserving of condemnation and punishment. The right to expel applies when an offense is deemed inconsistent with a Member's trust and duty. The Senate's actions were within its constitutional powers and legitimate object, not encroaching on its province. The Senate had the right to investigate reprehensible transactions without needing to declare in advance its legislative purpose. The investigation was deemed legitimate to aid in legislating, as seen in McGrain v. Daugherty. The Senate's investigation was deemed legitimate to aid in legislating, as seen in McGrain v. Daugherty. The resolution directing the witness to be attached was in line with obtaining necessary information for legislative and other actions deemed necessary and proper. The possibility of \"other action\" was criticized for being vague, but it did not invalidate the proceeding. The right interpretation is that it did not detract from the lawful nature of the investigation. The Senate's investigation was deemed legitimate for legislating purposes, as supported by specific problems relevant to legislation. The types of legislative activities justifying investigative power include legislating, appropriating, oversight of the executive branch, and informing Congress on national matters. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's power to investigate various national concerns, including foreign and domestic subversive activities, labor union corruption, and civil rights violations. While the Court has a broad interpretation of legislative purpose, it also recognizes limits, such as when a committee appears to be conducting a trial rather than an investigation to assist in legislative functions. Congressional oversight methods vary, but as long as Congress acts within its constitutional power, the Judiciary cannot intervene based on motives. Congressional oversight methods have evolved over time, with committees now relying more on staff communication and informal information gathering before resorting to formal procedures like issuing subpoenas and holding hearings. This section also discusses Congress's authority to grant witnesses limited immunity for obtaining information. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's authority to issue subpoenas for obtaining information necessary for legislation. This includes granting witnesses limited immunity to gather testimony protected by the Fifth Amendment. The power of inquiry, with the accompanying process to enforce it, has been deemed essential for the legislative function. Committees and subcommittees are authorized to issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents. Congressional committees have the authority to issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents, with rules varying on how subpoenas are issued. Subpoenas can be served by the U.S. Marshal's office, committee staff, or the Senate or House Sergeants-At-Arms, and can be enforced even on aliens in the United States. Compliance with subpoenas by U.S. nationals and aliens abroad can be more challenging. Challenging the legal sufficiency of a subpoena faces judicial obstacles, with the Supreme Court ruling against enjoining congressional subpoenas. Witnesses' main recourse is to refuse compliance, risk contempt, and raise objections as a defense. Committees can utilize staff-conducted depositions as part of their investigatory power, with specific authority granted by Senate and House resolutions. Procedures for depositions include notice, transcription, the right to counsel, and resolving objections. Staff depositions offer significant advantages for gathering information for investigative hearings. Staff depositions provide advantages for committees in complex investigations, allowing for quick and confidential sworn testimony without lengthy hearings. Private testimony encourages candid responses, verifies statements, and helps in witness preparation. Additionally, staff depositions can be conducted outside of Washington, D.C. without the need for field hearings with Members present. Congress has improved the efficacy of staff depositions by reinstating their applicability in criminal investigations. The efficacy of staff depositions has been improved by re-establishing the criminal prohibition against false statements during congressional proceedings, including depositions. However, there are disadvantages such as unrestrained staff engaging in tangential inquiries and depositions providing a \"cold record\" of testimony. Committees must adopt written rules of procedure, publish them in the Congressional Record, and provide witnesses with a copy of the rules. Failure to do so can result in the invalidation of a perjury prosecution. Rules for quorum requirements in congressional committees differ between the House and the Senate. House committees need at least two Members present for testimony, while the Senate allows testimony with just one Member. Some committees may require a higher quorum for sworn testimony. Quorum must be met at the time of testimony for perjury purposes. Reduced quorum rules do not apply to subpoena authorizations. Senate committees need a one-third quorum, while the House requires a majority unless authority is delegated to the chairman. Both chambers limit closed session meetings. The House limits closed session meetings based on defamatory or incriminating testimony, requiring a majority vote for release. Chairs typically give opening statements in oversight hearings to define the subject matter. Witness swearing is at the chair's discretion, with some committees mandating it for all witnesses. Perjury sanction applies if desired by the committee. The committee has the discretion to administer oaths to witnesses for potential perjury sanctions. False statements, even without an oath, can still lead to criminal sanctions. Witnesses have the right to be questioned before making a statement, with rules on statement length and submission. Questioning can be structured with alternating members or conducted by staff. Witnesses can review and correct their testimony, and are allowed to have counsel present. The House and Senate committees have rules regarding the role of counsel, with limitations on coaching witnesses. Committees have authority to control counsel's conduct and can punish breaches. Witnesses have constitutional protections, including the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Fifth Amendment protects witnesses in congressional investigations from self-incrimination. Witnesses can assert this privilege, and if two-thirds of the committee votes for it, the witness can be granted immunity to testify without fear of prosecution based on that testimony. Immunity has been used in major investigations like Watergate and Iran-Contra. The decision to grant immunity in congressional investigations, as seen in cases like Watergate and Iran-Contra, is a political decision made by Congress. The legislative branch has the power to decide whether to prioritize testimony over prosecution. Committees must weigh the need for a witness's testimony against the risk of jeopardizing a criminal prosecution if the witness is granted immunity. The burden is on the prosecutor to prove that a case was not based on a witness's immunized testimony in criminal prosecutions. Appellate court decisions in high-profile cases like Iran-Contra have made this burden more difficult, as seen in the cases of Oliver North and John Poindexter. Despite efforts to avoid exposure to immunized testimony, the appeals court remanded the cases for further determination on the use of such testimony. Upon remand in high-profile cases like Iran-Contra, the independent counsel moved to dismiss prosecutions due to inability to meet strict standards set by the appeals court. Congressional committees have issued over 300 immunity orders since 1970, with nearly half related to the 1978 investigation into JFK and MLK assassinations. The contempt power is Congress's strongest tool to enforce compliance with demands for information. The Supreme Court has recognized the contempt power as essential for Congress's legislative authority, allowing for punishment or coercion of individuals who obstruct compliance. Both the House and Senate can cite witnesses for contempt through inherent power or criminal contempt procedures. Witnesses may be imprisoned as punishment or for coercion, with the purpose of ensuring compliance with demands for information. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to use punishment or coercion to ensure compliance with demands for information. While historically utilized, it has not been used in over 75 years due to its cumbersome and time-consuming nature. In 1857, Congress enacted a statutory criminal contempt procedure as an alternative to the inherent contempt process. The statute, now codified at 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7192 and 194, allows for fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to one year for failure to comply with subpoenas. The criminal contempt procedure requires approval from subcommittees, full committees, and the full House or Senate before being certified by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House for prosecution by the U.S. Attorney. This procedure has been the primary method for punishing contempt since 1935. Since 1935, the criminal contempt procedure has been the main method for punishing contemptuous conduct, with 13 cabinet-level or senior executive officials cited for contempt since 1975. However, the effectiveness of this process against executive branch officials remains uncertain, as seen in cases involving EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford in 1982 and Attorney General Eric Holder in 2012. In 2012, during contempt proceedings against Attorney General Eric Holder, the U.S. Attorney refused to forward the contempt citation to a grand jury, effectively ending the criminal contempt process. The unresolved question is the U.S. Attorney's \"duty\" under Section 192 to enforce contempt citations. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate, giving the U.S. District Court jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce Senate subpoenas or orders. The Senate Office of Legal Counsel can bring suit to enforce Senate subpoenas, but not for executive branch subpoenas. The court will review the subpoena's validity, but cannot stop congressional proceedings. The court's jurisdiction is limited to aiding Congress in enforcing the subpoena. The Senate Office of Legal Counsel can enforce Senate subpoenas through civil enforcement procedures, allowing for flexibility and the opportunity to raise defenses. The House can also pursue civil enforcement under certain circumstances by adopting a resolution finding the person in contempt. The House can adopt a resolution to find a person in contempt and authorize civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena. This procedure has been used in the past against high-ranking officials. Witnesses who give false testimony under oath can be prosecuted for perjury. To prosecute for perjury before Congress, a quorum must be present when the false statement is made. House committees require two members for a quorum, while Senate committees need only one. Statements made in the presence of committee staff without deposition authority are not prosecutable. Witnesses giving false testimony under oath can be prosecuted for perjury, while unsworn statements are not typically subject to perjury charges. \"False statements in congressional investigations can result in a fine of up to $250,000 or imprisonment for up to five years. Congress's oversight powers are limited by the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights. While not all provisions apply, some may restrict Congress's authority.\" The First Amendment restricts Congress in conducting oversight and investigations, requiring a balance of private and public interests. Unlike the Fifth Amendment, it does not give a witness an absolute right to refuse to respond to congressional demands for information. The Court has emphasized the requirements for protecting the rights of witnesses in cases involving the First Amendment during congressional investigations. While the First Amendment has been asserted by witnesses to resist congressional demands for information, it has not been used to overturn a criminal contempt of Congress conviction. The Court has narrowly construed the scope of a committee's authority to avoid First Amendment issues in a criminal contempt of Congress case. In a 1976 investigation, the Standards of Official Conduct Committee subpoenaed news media representatives, including Daniel Schorr, for unauthorized publication of a report. Mr. Schorr's role in publishing the report was deemed a defiant act by the ethics committee. The House committee found that Daniel Schorr's publishing of a report was defiant, but chose not to cite him for contempt. The committee's decision was influenced by a desire to avoid a clash over First Amendment rights. In a separate incident, CBS president Frank Stanton refused to provide subpoenaed materials to a House Subcommittee on First Amendment grounds. After Stanton declined to provide subpoenaed materials, the House Subcommittee voted for a contempt citation, which was then reported to the full House. However, the House failed to adopt the citation and instead sent the matter back to the Committee. During the debate, concerns were raised about the potential impact on press freedom and the government's involvement in regulating the press. The Fourth Amendment protects congressional witnesses against unreasonable subpoenas. The Fourth Amendment protects congressional witnesses against unreasonable subpoenas, which must be reasonably specific in their scope. The subpoena in question was deemed too broad, constituting an unreasonable search and seizure. The subcommittee's inquiry was broad, requiring the subpoena to specify the subjects of the documents sought with reasonable particularity. The subpoena for documents must be specific to avoid being deemed unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Witnesses must comply with the subpoena or provide legal grounds for noncompliance. The D.C. Circuit emphasized the importance of informing the reasons for noncompliance to avoid contempt. The witness must inform the subcommittee of any objections to a subpoena, and if unable to produce documents, must provide a valid reason to avoid contempt. The application of the exclusionary rule in congressional investigations is uncertain and depends on the specific circumstances. Unlawfully seized documents by a congressional committee may not be admissible. The exclusionary rule prohibits unlawfully seized documents by a congressional investigating committee from being used as evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to witnesses in congressional investigations but cannot be invoked by organizations. The Fifth Amendment privilege protects a witness from testifying but not against a subpoena for existing documents. The privilege can be invoked when there is a reasonable fear of self-incrimination. There is no specific verbal formula for invoking the privilege. The Fifth Amendment privilege allows a witness to refuse to testify if there is a fear of self-incrimination. There is no specific verbal formula required to invoke the privilege, and a committee should recognize any reasonable indication of its assertion. The witness does not need to specify the exact hazard they fear, and the validity of the privilege can be reviewed by the committee. The Supreme Court has advised that the privilege only needs to be evident from the context of the question asked. The Fifth Amendment privilege allows a witness to refuse to testify if there is a fear of self-incrimination. To reject a claim, it should be clear that the witness is mistaken and answers cannot incriminate. The privilege may only be waived intelligently and unequivocally. Providing testimony in a criminal proceeding may waive the right to invoke the Fifth Amendment for subsequent questions related to that disclosure. The \"testimonial subject matter\" waiver is a limited waiver of Fifth Amendment protections, covering only the details disclosed. In the congressional context, the application of this doctrine is not clearly established by the Supreme Court. When a witness asserts the privilege, the full house or committee may seek a court order directing the witness to testify and granting use immunity, not transactional immunity. This means the witness's testimony or evidence derived from it cannot be used against them in a subsequent criminal prosecution, except for perjury or contempt related to their testimony. The witness can be granted use immunity by a court order from the full house or committee, allowing testimony that cannot be used against them in a criminal prosecution, except for perjury or contempt. The order must be approved by a majority vote or two-thirds of the committee, with notification to the Attorney General required. The court's role in issuing the order is considered ministerial, and once the witness has been asked a question and invoked their privilege, the order becomes legally effective. The Fifth Amendment's due process clause requires that the pertinency of interrogation to the committee's inquiry must be clear to the witness at the time of questioning. In a contempt proceeding, a witness must be informed of the committee's ruling on objections raised. The executive branch can respond to congressional requests with an assertion of... Executive privilege, in response to congressional requests, asserts the protection of decision-making processes within the executive branch and presidential communications. United States v. Nixon established this constitutionally based privilege to safeguard direct presidential decision-making. The Court in United States v. Nixon established executive privilege to protect presidential decision-making processes. While the privilege is not absolute, it can be overcome by a showing of need. In Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, the court held that presidential communications are presumptively privileged but can be overcome by a sufficient showing of need from Congress. Later cases have provided little guidance on evaluating claims of executive privilege in response to congressional subpoenas. The presidential communications privilege can only be asserted for documents authored by or solicited and received by the President or close advisers. Cabinet secretaries or employees are not considered to have \"operational proximity\" to the President. The presidential communications privilege applies to documents related to direct decision-making by the President, both pre- and post-decisional. It is a qualified privilege that can be overcome by a showing of need. The deliberative process privilege can protect executive branch documents created during the decision-making process. The deliberative process privilege shields predecisional and deliberative executive branch communications to protect the quality of agency decisions. It does not protect entire documents and can be overcome with a showing of need. The privilege allows government officials to debate alternative approaches in private. Additionally, it may protect against disclosure of proposed policies before they are fully considered or adopted. The deliberative process privilege shields predecisional and deliberative executive branch communications to protect the quality of agency decisions, allowing officials to debate alternative approaches in private. The scope of this privilege in the context of a congressional subpoena has not been fully examined, but it may have roots in the constitutional separation of powers. The assertion of this privilege could impact the disclosure of information to Congress, as Congress's oversight authority is limited by constitutional privileges. The ongoing litigation regarding enforcement of a subpoena issued to the Attorney General as part of a congressional investigation of Operation Fast and Furious involves the deliberative process privilege, which is a common law privilege that the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform argues cannot shield the disclosure of documents subject to a constitutionally-rooted subpoena. The district court judge in the case has questioned the Committee's argument. The judge has not yet ruled on the dispute over executive privilege in response to a subpoena. Limited case law exists on attorney-client privilege claims before congressional committees, but appellate court rulings on similar privileges in other investigative contexts have raised questions. Congress's broad investigative authority is based on its constitutional prerogative, especially in cases of waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration. The attorney-client privilege, however, may not be applicable in this context. The attorney-client privilege is a judge-made exception to full disclosure in the adversary process, to be narrowly construed and confined to the judicial forum. Committee discretion in accepting a claim of attorney-client privilege involves weighing the legislative need for disclosure against potential harm to the witness, considering factors like the strength of the claimant's assertion, document pertinency, document availability, and witness cooperation. The attorney-client privilege is a judge-made exception to full disclosure in the adversary process, to be narrowly construed and confined to the judicial forum. Committee discretion in accepting a claim of attorney-client privilege involves weighing the legislative need for disclosure against potential harm to the witness, considering factors like the strength of the claimant's assertion, document pertinency, document availability, and witness cooperation. Recognition of non-constitutionally based privileges, such as attorney-client privilege, is a matter of congressional discretion, with the validity of the claim being a key factor. The House Commerce Committee subcommittee issued subpoenas to Mr. Franklin L. Haney and his attorneys for documents related to the planned relocation of the FCC offices. Despite asserting attorney-client privilege, they were cited for contempt. The firm agreed to turn over the documents if the contempt citation was withdrawn. The D.C. Bar's Ethics Committee issued an opinion stating that attorneys should seek to quash or limit congressional subpoenas to protect client confidences. If objections are overruled and documents are ordered to be produced, attorneys are permitted, but not required, to comply unless there is a judicial order forbidding it. The opinion advises attorneys to exhaust all avenues of appeal before producing subpoenaed documents. The D.C. Bar's Ethics Committee advises attorneys to seek to quash or limit congressional subpoenas to protect client confidences. Attorneys are allowed to comply with a subpoena if objections are overruled, but they are advised to exhaust all avenues of appeal before doing so. The congressional committee ultimately decides whether to accept a claim of attorney-client privilege. Congressional committees are not legally required to allow a witness to decline to testify based on testimonial privileges. They are not obligated to follow court rules for procedures in hearings, as each house has the authority to make its own rules. While committees may choose to recognize privileges for confidential communications, it is at their discretion. Historical precedent suggests that committees often recognize privileges for confidential communications at their discretion. Congress has enacted laws limiting its own access to certain information, such as tax returns under 26 U.S.C. Section 6103(f). Other committees must obtain a resolution specifying the purpose for accessing such information if needed. The requested information is to be provided only during closed executive sessions of the requesting committee. Statutory restrictions on oversight include 50 U.S.C. Sections 3091-3093, governing congressional oversight of intelligence activities. The President must ensure that congressional intelligence committees are informed of intelligence activities and promptly notified of any illegal activities. The Director of National Intelligence and other heads of intelligence entities have a duty to protect classified information. The executive branch must inform congressional intelligence committees of all intelligence activities, excluding covert actions, to ensure oversight. Court rulings indicate that statutes restricting public disclosure do not limit congressional access to information. The courts are unlikely to interpret statutes as restricting Congress's access to information once it is in their control. Congressional disclosure of confidential information may not be prevented if it falls under the Speech or Debate Clause privilege, despite arguments from the President, executive branch, and private parties citing statutes like the Trade Secrets Act for non-disclosure. The Trade Secrets Act criminal provision prohibits disclosure of trade secrets by federal officers, but it likely doesn't apply to Congress or its employees due to oversight prerogatives and Speech or Debate privilege. Disclosure to Congress of confidential information would be considered authorized by law. In cases where a congressional inquiry faces resistance in accessing information due to a general nondisclosure statute, the committee may need to negotiate with the target, accept redactions, or issue a \"friendly subpoena\" for legal assistance. If a congressional demand is enforced in U.S. courts, they may seek help from foreign countries to enforce the court order. U.S. courts can request assistance from foreign countries through mutual legal assistance treaties or letters rogatory to obtain evidence located outside the United States. Letters rogatory are formal requests for testimony or evidence, issued when no mutual legal assistance treaty exists. The enforcement of a congressional subpoena in a foreign jurisdiction depends on the specific wording of the treaty. The United States can request assistance from foreign countries through mutual legal assistance treaties or letters rogatory to obtain evidence located outside the country. The specific wording of the treaty must be consulted for enforcement, as seen in the example of the U.S. and U.K. mutual legal assistance treaty allowing various forms of assistance in criminal investigations and prosecutions. The treaty applies to criminal matters and allows officials to treat civil or administrative hearings as proceedings under the treaty. The U.K. may not view a congressional committee hearing as a \"proceeding\" under the U.S.-U.K. mutual legal assistance treaty, and may decline to enforce a letter rogatory despite principles of international comity. The Supreme Court has ruled that U.S. courts can assist foreign courts without reciprocity. Many countries use reciprocity to assess compliance with letters rogatory. U.S. compliance with other countries' letters rogatory can indicate potential reciprocal compliance abroad. The applicable statute allows a U.S. district court to aid a foreign court if the person sought for discovery is in the district, the discovery is for a foreign tribunal, and the application comes directly from the foreign tribunal. The requirement that evidence be for use in a \"proceeding before a foreign tribunal\" may pose a challenge for a foreign governmental body in a similar situation. Congressional committees may face challenges when seeking judicial assistance abroad for subpoenas, as they are not commonly considered \"tribunals\" with the authority to make binding adjudications. The Iran-Contra investigations highlight the difficulties and the need for creative solutions in securing international cooperation. The Iran-Contra investigations faced formidable obstacles, including a short deadline, competition with an Independent Counsel investigation, and difficulties obtaining information from Swiss bank accounts. Committees issued an order for Major Richard V. Secord to release his offshore bank records, but he refused to sign the consent directive. The Committee sought a court order for Mr. Secord to release his offshore bank records, but he refused citing his Fifth Amendment right. To obtain the records, the Committees granted use immunity to a target in Paris in exchange for the documents, with approval from a district court under Rule 28. The House Committee issued a commission to the chief counsel, similar to a subpoena, to obtain financial documents from a witness. The tactic proved effective in obtaining the documents, showcasing the adversarial nature of congressional oversight and investigations when targets refuse to disclose information. The Privacy Act restricts federal agencies from disclosing records without consent, but Congress retains its right to access information. Statutory limitations do not apply to executive disclosures to Congress or its committees. The Privacy Act restricts federal agencies from disclosing records without consent, but Congress retains its right to access information. The exemption allows disclosure to the House or Senate, or committees with jurisdiction, but not to committees without jurisdiction, minority Members, or individual Members of Congress without consent. Court rulings have interpreted the exemption narrowly, applying only to a House of Congress or committee, not individual congressmen. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires publication of agency information in the Federal Register and allows public access to certain materials. FOIA mandates disclosure of records upon request, with exemptions. It also provides for appeals when access is denied. FOIA applies to executive departments and agencies. FOIA applies to executive departments and agencies, excluding Congress. Records of Congress, including the House, Senate, committees, and Members, are not subject to disclosure under FOIA. The statute does not authorize withholding information from Congress, as it has a special right of access to privileged information. Congress must have wide access to executive branch information for effective performance of its responsibilities. When seeking information for legislative or oversight purposes, congressional committees do not act under FOIA but under Congress's oversight authority. Agencies cannot withhold information from Congress citing FOIA exemptions. Individual Members can request agency records, not under FOIA but as any person. The DOJ interprets that congressional requests for agency records do not fall under Congress's oversight authority, allowing FOIA exemptions to prevent disclosure. Congress may seek grand jury evidence, but Rule 6(e) maintains secrecy unless authorized by a court or for a judicial proceeding. The rule of grand jury secrecy allows for exceptions, with court-approved disclosures requiring a strong showing of particularized need to prevent injustice in another judicial proceeding. The need for continued secrecy in grand jury proceedings requires a strong showing of particularized need to access material covered by Rule 6(e). Legislative entities have successfully obtained such material in the past, demonstrating that mere relevance or convenience is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement. In certain cases, congressional committees have been granted access to grand jury documents if they are acting within their legislative authority. However, courts are more hesitant to disclose information that reveals what occurred before the grand jury. The courts have been reluctant to order disclosure of grand jury documents, citing concerns about revealing the scope of investigations. Congressional committees investigating matters with pending federal litigation may face resistance from the DOJ due to various rationales. The DOJ has historically argued against disclosure of government strategies in legal proceedings to protect prosecutorial discretion and prevent interference with the President's duty. This stance was reiterated in a 1982 investigation regarding EPA enforcement strategies. Attorney General William French Smith expressed concerns about congressional influence on investigations if information was disclosed. The DOJ disclosed internal prosecutorial documents following congressional pressure, emphasizing the need to protect advice memoranda and deliberative documents related to criminal charges. This was to maintain the integrity of prosecutorial decision-making and avoid polarization in the criminal justice process. The courts have acknowledged the potential harm of congressional hearings on pending cases, highlighting the political choice Congress faces. While Congress has the authority for oversight and investigation, the decision to pursue a congressional investigation of pending cases is solely within Congress' discretion. The Iran-Contra Independent Counsel noted that Congress has the power to decide whether to prioritize destroying a prosecution over holding back information. The power to decide whether to prioritize destroying a prosecution over holding back information is a political decision of the highest importance. Information classification standards are outlined in Executive Order 13526, allowing certain officials to classify information based on national security concerns. Information is classified at three levels depending on the potential harm of its unauthorized disclosure. Information is classified at three levels: \"top secret\" for exceptionally grave damage, \"secret\" for serious damage, and \"confidential\" for damage to national security. The original classifying officer must specify the danger of disclosure and set a declassification date based on sensitivity. If no earlier date is set, declassification occurs after 10 or 25 years. Access to classified information is restricted to those who demonstrate eligibility, sign a nondisclosure agreement, and have a need to know. Information cannot be taken off agency premises without permission, and each agency must have systems in place to control distribution. The Executive Order does not provide guidance on disclosures. The Executive Order does not provide instructions on disclosures to Congress. Members of Congress do not receive security clearances but are presumed trustworthy. They must still meet the \"need to know\" requirement, which the executive branch has the final authority to determine. The 'need-to-know' determination for disclosures of classified information to Congress is made through established decision-making channels at each agency. Congressional aides and other legislative branch employees must undergo the necessary security clearance process to access classified information. While classification alone may not be a legal basis to withhold information from Congress, practical and political concerns may justify limiting access. Committees have discretion to negotiate with the Administration on access to classified material. Committees and subcommittees have discretion to negotiate with the Administration on access to classified information during investigations. They can choose to review documents at secure facilities, allow redactions, limit staff access, and hold non-public meetings. While not legally required, these measures can aid in obtaining the materials sought. Only one information access dispute related to classified information has reached the courts, involving the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee subcommittee investigation. The subcommittee investigation in 1976 involved allegations of improper intelligence gathering and warrantless wiretapping. Subpoenas were issued to AT&T for national security request letters, leading to negotiations with the DOJ. The DOJ sought an injunction to prevent AT&T from turning over all records, citing potential national interest damage. The district court deferred to the President's final determination. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit addressed claims of absolute rights by Congress and the Executive Branch regarding a subpoena related to national security materials. The court concluded that while congressional subpoena power is generally immune from court interference, it is not absolute when conflicting with a constitutional interest asserted by another branch of government. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit addressed claims of absolute rights by Congress and the Executive Branch regarding a subpoena related to national security materials. The court declined to rule on the merits of the claim, directing the parties to continue negotiations. After reaching an impasse, the parties found themselves back before the court, which rejected the executive branch's claim of absolute constitutional authority. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the executive branch's claim of absolute constitutional authority in a case involving a subpoena related to national security materials. The court emphasized that Congress's investigatory power is not absolute and that the [Speech or Debate] Clause does not immunize congressional investigatory actions from judicial review. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the executive branch's claim of absolute constitutional authority in a case involving a subpoena related to national security materials. Rather than ruling on the merits of the constitutional conflict, the court attempted to fashion a compromise that would force the parties back into negotiations. DOJ was allowed to limit the sample size of the unedited memoranda and prohibit committee staff from removing their notes from the FBI's possession. If the Subcommittee alleged inaccuracy or deception, the materials were to be forwarded to the district court for in camera review and any remedial action the court found necessary. The AT&T court never ruled on the merits of the dispute and never resolved the constitutional conflict between the branches. AT&T stands for the proposition that executive control over national security documents and congressional access claims are not absolute, but subject to potential judicial review after exhausting attempts to resolve differences. It also supports the challenge of third-party subpoenas in federal court and the need for access to \"sensitive but unclassified\" information in oversight of executive branch agencies. \"SBU information, classified as sensitive but unclassified, can pose access issues for congressional committees. While being labeled as \"sensitive\" doesn't justify withholding it from Congress, there are valid reasons to respect agency classifications. SBU material comes in various forms, some authorized by law like the TSA regulations. Disclosure of such information may be restricted if deemed unwarranted.\" The TSA regulations allow for the withholding of sensitive security information (SSI) if it would invade personal privacy, reveal trade secrets, or be detrimental to transportation security. Congressional committees are authorized to access this information, and there are no penalties for their disclosure. Members of Congress, committees, and staff are not considered \"covered persons\" subject to the SSI regulations. The regulations allow for withholding sensitive security information (SSI) from Members of Congress, committees, or congressional staff. Agencies have their own information protection regimes like \"for official use only\" (FOUO), which is not classified but may be protected from public disclosure. FOUO information is not automatically exempt from disclosure under FOIA and is not intended to be withheld from other governmental entities. The regulations allow for withholding sensitive security information (SSI) from Members of Congress, committees, or congressional staff. FOUO information can be shared with other governmental entities, including Congress, as part of its broad authority to obtain information from executive agencies. Minority Members have some rights in the investigatory oversight process, but cannot independently initiate official committee investigations, hold hearings, or issue subpoenas. The regulations allow for withholding sensitive security information (SSI) from Members of Congress, committees, or congressional staff. Minority Members have some rights in the investigatory oversight process but cannot independently initiate official committee investigations, hold hearings, or issue subpoenas without the permission of a majority of the committee or its chair. In a legal case, a federal district court dismissed the attempt of a ranking minority member to compel disclosure of documents from agencies under the FOIA and the Administrative Procedure Act, stating that the dispute was primarily with fellow legislators. The Senate rules provide effective means for minority-party Members to support oversight objectives through filibustering and unlimited debate on bills or amendments. These rules emphasize the rights of individual Senators and minority groups, allowing them to delay or prevent legislative business. Additionally, Senate rules can aid the minority in gaining investigatory rights, such as the right of extended debate in committees where cloture cannot be invoked. The Senate rules allow minority-party Members to filibuster and control debate in committees, providing opportunities for delay and leverage. Senators can also utilize parliamentary rights and procedures to advance their goals, such as floor recognition and committee referrals. The \"rule of seven\" allows minority participation in oversight. The \"rule of seven\" allows seven Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee or five Members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to request information from executive agencies, which must be provided. However, there is no established judicial right of action to enforce this statute when agencies refuse to disclose information. The statute originated from a 1928 Act that repealed legislation requiring the submission of 128 reports to Congress, many of which were considered obsolete and of no value. The legislative history does not clearly state the statute's purpose. The purpose of 5 U.S.C. Section 2954 is unclear, as it only empowers two committees to request information from agencies without a clear enforcement mechanism. Agency refusals to comply are not subject to criminal contempt, and there is uncertainty regarding its connection to the 128 reports abolished in 1928. The 2001 case Waxman v. Evans involved minority party members of the House Government Reform Committee seeking court enforcement of a document demand for 2000 Census data from the Secretary of Commerce under Section 2954. Congressional plaintiffs argued for agency compliance with information requests, while the government contended that the court should not intervene in a political information access dispute between Congress and the Executive. The court was urged to refrain from hearing the case based on equitable discretion. The government argued for a narrow interpretation of Section 2954, stating that it only preserved Congress' access to certain information. The case became moot on appeal to the Ninth Circuit due to a parallel FOIA suit. The Ninth Circuit deemed the case moot as a parallel FOIA suit led to the release of information. In Waxman v. Thompson, House Government Reform Committee members sued to compel the release of cost estimates during Medicare reform legislation. The government opposed, arguing for a narrow interpretation of Section 2954. The government opposed congressional plaintiffs' claims, arguing lack of standing and jurisdiction. The district court ruled plaintiffs lacked standing based on Raines v. Byrd, stating injury was institutional, not personal. The court dismissed the suit as the plaintiffs did not prove their votes were nullified. Congressional oversight involves investigations into scandals, abuses of authority, illegal conduct, and unethical behavior, potentially leading to resignations, firings, and impeachment proceedings. Notable examples include the Senate Watergate Committee investigation and the Church and Pike select committees' inquiries into intelligence agency abuses. The Church and Pike select committees' inquiries in the mid-1970s into intelligence agency abuses; the 1981 select committee inquiry into the ABSCAM scandal; the 1987 Iran-contra investigation during the Reagan Administration; the multiple investigations of scandals and alleged misconduct during the Clinton Administration; and the Hurricane Katrina probe in 2005 during the Bush Administration have led to intense interest in Congress, the executive, and the public. Investigative hearings may be televised or webcast, resulting in extensive news media coverage. These investigations are undertaken by various organizational arrangements, including temporary select committees, standing committees and subcommittees, specially created subcommittees, or specially commissioned task forces within an existing standing committee. Specially created investigative committees usually have a short life span. Specially created investigative committees have a short lifespan and require additional staff with specialized expertise. Staff can be hired from the private sector, existing congressional offices, support agencies, or executive agencies. These panels are often given investigative authorities not typically available to standing committees. Special panels are often given investigative authorities not usually available to standing committees, such as staff deposition authority and the ability to obtain tax information. Oversight preparation involves determining the laws, programs, and agencies within a committee's jurisdiction to understand its oversight responsibilities. House and Senate committees may prepare documents outlining these responsibilities for each subcommittee. House and Senate committees may prepare documents outlining the agencies, laws, programs, activities, functions, and required reports within their jurisdiction. They can request assistance from legislative support agencies to identify federal programs. Oversight hearings can be held to brief members and staff on agency operations and new legislation implementation. Oversight hearings are crucial for monitoring agency operations, evaluating new legislation implementation, and identifying areas vulnerable to waste or mismanagement. These hearings help committee members stay informed, facilitate discussions on important issues, and provide background information for making legislative decisions. The oversight hearings are essential for monitoring agency operations and evaluating new legislation implementation. Committee members can enhance their ability to focus on meaningful issues by accumulating, organizing, and evaluating relevant data. Standing committees should regularly monitor the application of laws and implementation of programs within their jurisdiction to encourage active administrative review. The Senate and House of Representatives committees must oversee the execution of laws by administrative agencies. Committee personnel should maintain liaison with agencies to gather useful information for oversight hearings. Specific letters should be sent to agency witnesses to ensure they provide relevant testimony and avoid evasive statements. Casework is a crucial tool for Members of Congress to address constituents' issues with federal agencies. It involves resolving problems and identifying limitations within the bureaucracy. An example cited involved a man who was mistakenly declared dead by the Social Security Administration, leading to a disruption in his Medicare benefits. Through casework, the man's benefits were reinstated after intervention from the congressional office. Casework is essential for addressing constituents' issues with federal agencies and identifying limitations in the law. It allows for correction of bureaucratic errors and can lead to changes in laws based on problems discovered. Legislative oversight techniques include periodic auditing of executive departments to hold officers accountable for public funds and administration. Government auditing goes beyond verifying accounts and transactions, with agencies like the Government Accountability Office pioneering evaluation of claimed achievements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluates claimed achievements for compliance with objectives and resource efficiency. Auditors are guided to assess program success, cost-effectiveness, objective clarity, and benefit-cost ratio. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluates program costs, benefits, alternative approaches, and information accuracy for Congress to monitor effectively. Management must have reliable information for supervision and control, internal review, and audit facilities for program operations and fiscal integrity. Internal audit reports are essential for oversight, but agencies may be hesitant to share them with Congress. Various governmental and private organizations conduct audits, including federal agencies with statutory Inspector Generals and state/local audit offices. Congressional staff can seek assistance from the GAO for finding or commissioning audit reports. The Federal Register, available at https://www.federalregister.gov/, is published daily by the Office of the Federal Register, NARA. It provides regulations and legal notices issued by Federal agencies, including presidential proclamations, executive orders, and other documents of public interest. Final regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Subscription options include receiving the table of contents via email or RSS notification. To subscribe to the daily table of contents and create customized subscriptions, visit the \"User Information\" page at https://www.federalregister.gov/learn/user-information. The website also offers social media tools for sharing documents on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and RSS feeds. Documents are available for public inspection in the Office of the Federal Register the day before publication, with the list accessible at https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection. Regular monitoring of the Federal Register can help committees and staff identify proposed rules for congressional review. Additional information on regulatory actions by federal agencies can be found at http://www.reginfo.gov/public/. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) oversee regulatory actions by federal agencies. Committee staffs and support agencies aid in investigations and evaluations of laws and agency performance. The Government Accountability Office is heavily involved in audits and program evaluations. The 1974 Budget Act and Legislative Reorganization Act authorize House and Senate committees to enlist outside contractors for assistance in oversight activities. Committees can contract with independent research organizations, employ professional investigators, utilize federal employees, or establish advisory panels. Public exposure of problems through the media can lead to more responsive officials and solutions. Effective communication with the media is crucial for oversight activities. Effective communication with the media is essential for oversight activities. Understanding the different media forms and their advantages is key. Timeliness, brevity, and accuracy are crucial when dealing with wire services. Personal contact with wire service reporters yields the best results. Knowing the operational procedures and deadlines of daily newspapers is important. Weekend stories should be given to reporters mid-week. Magazines focus on why something happens, not just what happened. Weekly publications require personal meetings or phone calls for responses. Conferences, releases, personal meetings, and telephone conversations are more effective for communication with the media. Deadlines vary, obtain information on operational procedures. Topically oriented magazines and newsletters are produced by publishing firms using periodical press galleries in the Capitol. House and Senate rules identify procedures for radio and television broadcasting of committee hearings. News of committee oversight activities may appear on television in various forms. Washington-based news organizations may provide daily television coverage. Washington-based news organizations may provide daily television coverage of Congress to independent television stations. Public television and cable news organizations occasionally broadcast live coverage of committee oversight hearings. To encourage television coverage of a committee's oversight activities, staff should alert correspondents and bureau chiefs in advance, notify news services of scheduled hearings, and reserve a hearing room large enough for television cameras if widespread media interest is anticipated. To promote television coverage of committee oversight activities, staff should alert media in advance, provide background information, make committee members available for interviews, and distribute videos discussing relevant issues. Keep network news programs informed of the committee's activities. To maximize media coverage of committee oversight activities, staff should inform the media in advance, make committee members available for interviews, and facilitate live television and radio appearances. Time is crucial, with radio reporters needing immediate congressional reactions. Contact radio reporters directly through the House and Senate press galleries, preferably between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. for interviews. To maximize media coverage of committee oversight activities, staff should inform the media in advance and make committee members available for interviews. Press conferences between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. are preferable, as early morning and late afternoon conferences may have low attendance. Check with press galleries for scheduling information and consider using committee rooms or member's offices for conferences. Notify press galleries in writing for coverage. To maximize media coverage, notify press galleries in advance for press conferences. Press conferences should be open to all with a brief opening statement followed by questions. Prepare answers in advance and keep the conference to about half an hour. A good news release should be concise, include contact information, and quote the member directly. Members and committees can use the Internet to communicate with media representatives and constituents to explain their views and positions with respect to oversight activities. The Internet allows for direct communication with the citizenry, reducing reliance on traditional journalistic sources. Lawmakers can engage in online discussions with citizens, use social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and establish websites to gather input on executive branch departments and programs. Congress relies on information from agencies to oversee executive branch departments and programs. Efforts have been made to increase reporting and consultation provisions to ensure access to data, resulting in around 4,000 reports annually. Concerns about unnecessary reports have led to initiatives to eliminate them. The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Acts of 1995 and 1998 were influenced by recommendations from the Vice President's National Performance Review and the GAO. However, the reduction in required reports has not kept up with new requirements, such as those in the 2001 act to Prevent the Elimination of Certain Reports. Reporting requirements impact various government entities and can vary in specificity and frequency. Reports may be periodic or event-driven, calling for agencies to study and provide information. The CFO Act of 1990, as Amended, requires agencies to provide information about their activities to Congress, including specific operations, projects, or programs. There is an increase in statutory provisions and committee reports specifying conditions for prior consultation with Congress. The CFO Act of 1990 aims to enhance financial management in the federal government by creating new positions in OMB and major federal agencies. These positions include chief financial officers in 23 agencies, with additional agencies like DHS and SSA included later on. 17 of these positions are filled by presidential appointees subject to Senate confirmation. The CFO Act of 1990 aims to improve financial management in the federal government by establishing new positions in OMB and major federal agencies. This includes chief financial officers in 23 agencies, with additional agencies like DHS and SSA added later. The act requires agencies to enhance accounting systems, financial management, and internal controls to prevent fraud and misuse of government resources. It also mandates the submission of audited financial statements annually and the production of reliable financial information for executive and legislative use in federal program financing, management, and evaluation. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires federal agencies to submit strategic plans, annual performance plans, and government-wide performance plans. Strategic plans outline five-year goals based on agency missions and statutory authority, while annual performance plans set yearly goals to measure program results. The focus of GPRA is on outcomes and achieving goals effectively. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) focuses on outcomes and accomplishments of programs, rather than outputs. Agencies issue annual plans and assessments to Congress, starting from FY1999. GPRA also calls for government-wide performance plans and goals, managed by the Office of Management and Budget. The Congressional Review Act established a mechanism for Congress to review and disapprove federal rules. Agencies must submit reports to Congress before rules go into effect, major rules have a 60-day waiting period, and all rules can be subject to fast-track disapproval. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to review and disapprove federal rules, with a 60-day waiting period for major rules. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 enhances oversight responsibilities of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982 aims to improve government program management by strengthening internal controls, accounting systems, and financial reports. It requires consistent accounting standards, safeguarding of assets, and ongoing evaluations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. The Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982 requires agencies to report annually to the President and Congress on the condition of internal control systems and actions taken to correct weaknesses. It is connected to the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, which mandates a financial management status report to congressional committees. The Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 aims to prevent cash management practices that allow one government level to earn interest at the expense of the other. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agencies to purchase cost-effective information technology, giving more responsibility to individual agencies and establishing the position of chief information officer (CIO). The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of 1972 established requirements for the management and oversight of federal advisory committees to ensure impartial and relevant expertise. The General Services Administration (GSA) administers federal advisory committees as required by FACA. Since 1998, GSA has maintained a specialized database for collecting data on advisory committee activities, which is publicly available online. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) replaced the Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA) to enhance information security in the government. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 (ATDA) expanded the requirement for audited financial statements to all executive branch agencies in the federal government. This act aimed to improve federal agency compliance with information security standards and guidelines, including submitting information security programs to annual independent reviews. The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA) requires audited annual financial statements for all covered executive agencies to ensure compliance with financial management system requirements and address deficiencies within specified timeframes, reflecting ongoing efforts to reform financial management in the federal government. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4) limits federal government's ability to impose costs on state and local governments through unfunded mandates. It includes revised congressional procedures and new requirements for federal agency regulatory actions. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 limits federal government's ability to impose costs on state and local governments through unfunded mandates. It includes revised congressional procedures and new requirements for federal agency regulatory actions. President George W. Bush signed the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act into law on September 26, 2006, which aims to provide greater transparency on how federal funds are spent. The act requires OMB to establish a searchable website for information on federal grants, loans, and contracts. The House of Representatives can request factual information from the executive through resolutions of inquiry. These resolutions are approved by the House and ask for specific information from the President or heads of departments. They are not meant to request opinions or trigger investigations. Resolutions of inquiry can be useful in obtaining information and are not redundant with the previous paragraphs discussing transparency in federal funding. A resolution of inquiry in the House of Representatives can trigger other methods of obtaining information, such as supplemental hearings or the legislative process. It is privileged and must be considered within 14 legislative days. If not reported, any member can move to bring it to the floor. Congressional rules separate authorizations and appropriations in a two-step legislative procedure. Exceptions to the general principle that Congress should not make policy through appropriations include permitting \"limitations\" in bills and adding \"riders\" to control agency actions. House rules allow for limitations in appropriations bills, which can be an effective oversight device by restricting the use of funds for certain purposes while still appropriating for others. Limitations in appropriations bills can strengthen Congress's control over federal spending by reducing unnecessary expenditures. House Rule XXI allows for limitations, but was amended in 1983 and 1995 to restrict their number and give the majority leader a central role in considering limitation amendments. Unlike limitations, legislative riders are extraneous additions to bills. Riders in authorization and appropriations bills may face challenges in the House and Senate. Congress delegates authority to the executive branch with conditions for review and possible disapproval of proposed actions. This oversight can be done through legislative veto or advance notification processes. The proposed executive actions would be submitted to Congress for disapproval by a committee or both houses. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled legislative vetoes unconstitutional, but Congress has continued to enact them through informal arrangements. Since the Chadha decision, Congress has continued to rely on legislative vetoes, with hundreds enacted into public law, often in appropriations acts. These vetoes are exercised by the Appropriations Committees, where funds may not be used or executive actions may not begin until approved within a specified time limit. Informal legislative vetoes also occur, where an executive official pledges not to proceed with an activity until Congress or certain committees agree to it. During the 101st Congress, a \"bipartisan accord\" was reached on funding the contras in Nicaragua, with the Administration agreeing not to obligate funds beyond November 30, 1989, without approval from relevant committees and congressional leadership. Statutory provisions often require the executive branch to inform Congress before taking certain actions, allowing time for legislative intervention. This \"report and wait\" provision has been upheld by the Supreme Court. The independent counsel law, originally enacted in 1978, allowed for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate alleged violations of federal criminal law. The law was reauthorized multiple times before expiring in 1999. The Attorney General could trigger the mechanisms of the law upon receiving information alleging a violation. The independent counsel law allowed for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate federal criminal law violations by certain high-level officials. The Attorney General could seek an independent counsel for individuals with conflicts of interest, including members of Congress, after a review process. The independent counsel law allowed for the appointment of a special prosecutor by a federal three-judge panel. The Attorney General was authorized to request the appointment, and once appointed, the independent counsel had full investigatory and prosecutorial powers. There was no specific term of appointment, allowing them to serve until their duties were completed within their limited jurisdiction. The independent counsel law allowed for the appointment of a special prosecutor with defined jurisdiction. The independent counsel could be removed from office by the Attorney General for good cause, physical or mental disability, or other impairing condition. The procedures for appointing and removing the independent counsel were upheld by the Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson. Investigation by the independent counsel could overlap with congressional committees' efforts on the same issue. Congress could delay legislative investigations to accommodate the independent counsel. The Attorney General could be requested to apply for an independent counsel by Congress, but it was not mandatory. The independent counsel was required to submit an annual report to Congress on their activities. The independent counsel was subject to congressional oversight and required to report any impeachment-worthy information to the House of Representatives. Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr forwarded a report to the House in 1998, suggesting President Clinton may have committed impeachable offenses. The House impeached Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, but the Senate did not convict him. The independent counsel statute expired in 1992 due to criticism of Lawrence Walsh's investigation of Iran-Contra. It was reauthorized in 1994 but faced objections during Kenneth Starr's investigations into Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky. Congress let the statute lapse in 1999. Without reauthorization, the Attorney General can appoint a special prosecutor to investigate specific matters. For example, in 1993, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske to investigate when the statute expired. Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske in 1993 to investigate the Clintons' involvement in Whitewater and the death of White House aide Vincent Foster. In 1999, regulations were promulgated for the appointment of Special Counsels to conduct investigations in certain sensitive matters. Special counsels have less independence than independent counsels and can be removed for various reasons. Inspectors general have substantial independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in federal departments and agencies. Inspectors general (IGs) have significant independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse within federal departments and agencies. Established as nonpartisan and independent offices, OIGs exist in over 70 federal agencies, including all departments and larger agencies. The Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, governs the majority of IGs and outlines their appointments, powers, and responsibilities. Additionally, the Act created OIGs in 12 federal establishments and later amendments in 1988 expanded this to include designated federal entities (DFEs). The Inspector General Act of 1988 established IGs in designated federal entities (DFEs) and expanded reporting obligations. The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 created the Council of the Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) and added budget protections. IGs typically have jurisdiction over a single agency but some have authority over multiple agencies. Examples include the IG of the IC, the IG for the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the IG for the Federal Reserve. The Inspector General Act of 1988 established IGs in designated federal entities and expanded reporting obligations. The IG Reform Act of 2008 created the Council of the Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency and added budget protections. Statutory IGs are authorized in over 70 federal establishments, designated federal entities, and other agencies. They may vary in appointment method, authorizing statute, and branch. The appointment of Inspectors General can be grouped by criteria such as the method of appointment, authorizing statute, and branch of government. IGs in federal establishments are appointed by the President with Senate consent, while those in designated federal entities are appointed by the head of the parent agency. Some IGs are appointed by the President under separate statutory authority. Two permanent executive agencies, the Inspector General in the Central Intelligence Agency and the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, operate under their own statutory authorities. Each IG is appointed by the President with Senate consent and is removable by the President. Two temporary programs, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, operate under separate authorities with unique appointment structures. The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) is appointed by the President with Senate consent under separate statutory authority. Five legislative branch IGs are appointed and removable by the head of their affiliated agency. The IG Act outlines three main purposes for inspectors general: conducting audits and investigations, providing leadership, and recommending policies for promoting efficiency. The Inspectors General (IGs) are responsible for coordinating policies to promote efficiency, prevent fraud and abuse, and inform agency heads and Congress about program deficiencies. They have broad authority to conduct audits and investigations, access records, and have acquired additional responsibilities over time, such as those outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. Inspectors General (IGs) have broad powers to access records, request assistance, subpoena information, administer oaths, hire staff, and manage resources. They can receive complaints from agency employees and implement cash incentive programs for disclosures. However, they are not authorized to take corrective action themselves. IGs have reporting obligations to Congress, the Attorney General, agency heads, and the public, including reporting suspected violations of federal law promptly to the Attorney General and submitting semiannual reports. Inspectors General (IGs) have broad powers and protections that support their independence, including the authority to hire their own staff and report serious problems immediately to the agency head for submission to Congress within seven days. They are required to report semiannually to the agency head, who must submit the unaltered report to Congress within 30 days. The IG's reports are made available to the public within 60 days of submission. Inspectors General have the authority to determine their priorities and projects independently. They may conduct reviews requested by various parties but are not obligated to unless mandated by law. IGs serve under the \"general supervision\" of the agency head and report exclusively to them or the next in rank. Presidentially-appointed IGs have a separate appropriations account to prevent funding interference. In contrast, DFE IGs' budgets are part of the entity's budget and may be reallocated. The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 amended the budget process for establishment and DFE OIGs. OIG budget estimates are to be provided to the affiliated agency, and the President must include the IG's original budget estimate in his budget submission to Congress. Similar provisions apply to inspectors general for the CIA and Intelligence. Inspectors general for various agencies are appointed and removed differently, but all follow laws to ensure impartiality. They are selected based on integrity and expertise in various fields. Presidential appointees can only be removed by the President or through impeachment. Designated federal entity IGs have varying appointment structures, removal procedures, and term limits. The appointment and removal procedures for inspectors general in different branch agencies vary. The DFE IGs can be removed by the agency head with notification to Congress, while the USPS IG can only be removed \"for cause\" with the concurrence of at least seven presidentially-appointed governors. The Dodd-Frank Act requires a two-thirds majority of board or commission members for removal of an IG in designated federal entities where the board or commission is the DFE head. Coordination among IGs and controls over their actions are maintained through various channels. The Council of the Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) was created by the IG Reform Act of 2008 to aid coordination among IGs and provide professional training. CIGIE includes all statutory IGs and other relevant officers, with the council chairperson being an inspector general and the executive chairperson being the OMB deputy director of management. Other coordinating bodies also exist for IGs. Other interagency mechanisms, such as the Council of Inspectors General on Financial Oversight and the Intelligence Community Inspectors General Forum, have been established by law to facilitate coordination among IGs. Additionally, administrative organizations like the Homeland Security Roundtable and the Defense Council on Integrity and Efficiency have been created to coordinate IG activities in specific areas. The Defense Council on Integrity and Efficiency, chaired by the DOD inspector general, investigates alleged misconduct by OIG officials. A special Integrity Committee in CIGIE handles allegations of wrongdoing by inspectors general. Congress relies on various sources for oversight support, including the Congressional Research Service.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was established in 1921 as part of the Executive Office of the President. OMB assists the President in preparing budget proposals, supervises budget administration in the executive branch, coordinates agency activities, and reviews agency rules. The Office of Management and Budget oversees the review and approval of agency rules, reduces the burden of information collection on the public, manages information dissemination, statistics, archives, privacy, security, and information technology. It also promotes better governmental management and makes recommendations on administrative organization and operations. The Office of Management and Budget assists in coordinating agencies' legislative proposals, executive orders, and information systems for the President. It also establishes financial management policies, regulatory reform programs, and procurement policies to improve efficiency and reduce fraud. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plays a key role in reducing fraud, waste, and abuse in government agencies. It coordinates with inspectors general and provides budgetary information to Congress. The Congressional Budget Office, House and Senate Budget Committees, Appropriations Committees, and legislative committees play key roles in the annual budget process. Discretionary spending overseen by the Appropriations Committees makes up one-third of federal spending. Ways and Means and Finance Committees oversee over $1 trillion in spending through various measures. Ways and Means and Finance also manage tax collection, tax expenditures, and some user fees. The activities of various committees involved in the annual budget process are supported by a wide range of budgetary information available to them. The Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2012 includes the President's budget proposals and economic analyses, Federal spending details, borrowing and debt information, and other technical presentations. The Analytical Perspectives volume also contains supplemental material with detailed tables showing the budget by agency, account, and function.

The President's budget and executive agency budget products include legislative proposals, explanations of work and funds needed, general provisions, and budget amendments. Additional communications such as the Mid-Session Review and Statements of Administration Policy are issued after the initial budget submission. These documents are available on the web and provide more information on the President's budgetary recommendations. The President's budget and executive agency budget products lack sufficient information for committees to develop legislation. Justification materials and legislative proposals provide further budgetary details. Internal executive papers are often not shared with Congress. Appropriations Committees hold hearings on federal departments' requests, with submissions ranging from hundreds to thousands of pages. Budget Committees in the House and Senate also play a role in the budget process. Budget Committees in the House and Senate conduct hearings on federal budget policy, while other committees provide \"views and estimates\" on programs in their jurisdiction. Internal agency studies and budget reviews offer detailed information on individual programs. The budgeting documents, evaluations, and priority rankings of individual agency programs can provide insights into executive branch views of program importance. Committees can gather useful information from beneficiaries, private organizations, and interest groups to evaluate program performance. Various methods like investigations, hearings, surveys, and websites can be used to solicit feedback on federal programs. This feedback can help committees assess program performance and identify issues with federal agencies. Numerous think tanks, universities, and interest groups monitor public policy issues and advise on federal agency performance. Organizations like the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) aim for a more effective and ethical government. NGOs worldwide also work on various social, political, scientific, and environmental issues. NGOs like Greenpeace, Amnesty International, and the Red Cross work with governments, corporations, and foundations globally. They provide legal, scientific, and policy analysis, shape national and international commitments, and change institutions and norms.
