    "content": "The \"Local Government Landfill Compliance Deadline Act\" aims to give county and city officials more time to make environmentally responsible decisions regarding municipal solid waste landfills. It allows for temporary exemptions for certain landfills from meeting revised criteria. During a 1-year period starting on October 9, 1993, existing municipal solid waste landfills meeting specific criteria are temporarily exempt from having to comply with any new regulations that come into effect after January 1, 1993. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency can make exceptions to this rule. The exemption for existing municipal solid waste landfills from new regulations after January 1, 1993, can be revoked if the owner/operator did not make a good faith effort to comply with revised criteria before October 9, 1993. The owner of a municipal solid waste landfill can apply for a 180-day extension of an exemption if compliance with revised criteria is not achievable within the specified 1-year period due to factors beyond their control, such as litigation or adverse weather conditions. Adverse weather conditions or breakdown in negotiations can delay landfill construction or use, requiring alternative waste disposal arrangements. Delays in siting, permitting, or patenting a landfill may be due to technical assistance unavailability or purchasing procedures. Procedures for purchasing, leasing, permitting, or patenting a site on Federal land, including necessary environmental assessments or impact statements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Mandatory extension prohibits disapproval of applications if failure is due to Federal reasons. During the exemption period, a landfill must comply with prior criteria if the failure to obtain necessary approvals has hindered compliance with revised criteria. Beginning on October 9, 1994, all municipal solid waste landfills must adhere to revised criteria issued under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. No civil action can be taken against a landfill exempt from meeting certain requirements under the Act. SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF EFFECTIVE DATE OF FINANCIAL ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. The Administrator will revise financial assurance requirements for municipal solid waste landfills to broaden available mechanisms and consider the financial circumstances of small municipalities and counties. The revised regulations will take effect two years after promulgation. During the specified period, financial assurance requirements for municipal solid waste landfills will not apply. SEC. 4. GROUND WATER MONITORING. The Administrator will issue regulations exempting small landfills from ground water monitoring requirements if they are in communities with transportation interruptions or limited waste management alternatives. The regulations exempt small landfills in areas with limited precipitation from ground water monitoring until 2 years after the enactment of the Act."
