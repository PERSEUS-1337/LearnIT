    "content": "State and local governments issue debt for public capital projects like schools, buildings, and roads. Occasionally, they also issue debt for private multifamily housing projects, which receive similar tax benefits. Congress limits tax-exempt bonds for private activities to prevent overuse. These bonds are classified as governmental or private activity bonds, with interest on governmental bonds being tax-exempt. The federal tax code allows state and local governments to use tax-exempt bonds for qualified private activities, which are projects that would otherwise be considered private. The current tax exemption for these activities has evolved over time, with key events in 1968 and 1988 shaping the treatment of private activity bonds. The Supreme Court's 1988 case on federal tax treatment of state and local government debt upheld the registration requirement for tax-exempt debt. It also ruled that bond owners have no constitutional right to tax exemption and states cannot issue bonds at lower interest rates. The Supreme Court ruling in 1988 confirmed that states cannot issue bonds at lower interest rates than other issuers. Congress has the authority to restrict state and local tax-exempt debt issuance and modify rules for tax-exempt bonds for private activities. Congress limits the amount of tax-exempt debt for private activities and encourages selected activities through exemptions or tax-exempt financing. The private activity bond volume limit was established to address concerns about tax-exempt bonds used for private activities, such as inefficient capital allocation and increased costs for traditional governmental activities. The limit and qualified activities list were modified under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to prevent higher-income individuals from avoiding taxes through tax-exempt investments. The inefficient allocation of capital from tax-exempt private activity bonds leads to higher costs for traditional government activities. As the volume of tax-exempt bond investments increases, issuers must raise interest rates to attract investors, impacting government projects like schools and public infrastructure. In economic terms, raising interest rates to attract investors is like a retailer lowering prices to attract customers. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for issuers, leading to less progressive income tax regimes and expanding deficits. This can ultimately result in higher interest rates for all debt-financed projects. The debate over tax-exempt bonds for private activities continues, with proponents arguing that the benefits outweigh the costs. Proponents and opponents are exploring ways to modify the rules for private activity bonds to support their positions. Uncertainty surrounds the potential effects of these proposed modifications due to the complexity of the rules and definitions. This report provides an overview of bond fundamentals and a detailed examination of private activity bond rules and definitions. Tax-exempt bonds for governmental purposes and qualified private activities offer lower interest rates due to their tax-exempt status, which subsidizes state and local investments. This allows investors to achieve similar after-tax returns compared to taxable bonds. Tax-exempt bonds offer lower interest rates due to their tax-exempt status, allowing investors to achieve similar after-tax returns compared to taxable bonds. Researchers can derive implied marginal tax rates based on market data. The \"interest rate spread\" compares tax-exempt bonds to taxable bonds, with differences influenced by the tax bracket of buyers bidding up interest rates. In December 2008, the average high-grade corporate bond rate was 5.05% while the average high-grade municipal (tax-exempt) bond rate was 5.56%. The lower interest rate for taxable corporate bonds was due to the Federal Reserve Bank injecting liquidity into the economy and state/local governments facing fiscal stress. State and local governments were under fiscal stress, leading to a higher interest rate for municipal debt in the bond market. The collapse of the municipal bond insurance market further increased the perceived risk of municipal bonds. Average tax-exempt bond interest rates were at 3.00% and taxable bonds at 3.67% in 2016. The ratio of tax-exempt debt to taxable debt remained high at 0.82. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily addressed the differential treatment of interest income from qualified private activity bonds under the alternative minimum tax. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily suspended the alternative minimum tax on interest income from tax-exempt private activity bonds, leading to higher interest rates on these bonds. Repealing the AMT or exempting certain bonds from it would increase investor demand and lower interest costs. The increased attractiveness of private activity bonds would lower interest costs for the issuer. Private activity bonds primarily benefit private entities and are defined by the tax code. Two conditions determine if bonds are taxable: more than 10% of proceeds used for private business and meeting the security test. Private activity bonds are defined by the tax code and are taxable if more than 10% of the proceeds are used for private business and pass the security test. Bonds that meet both criteria can still qualify for tax-exempt financing if identified as qualified private activity bonds. Qualified private activity bonds, also known as tax-exempt private activity bonds, must pass a private loan financing test to maintain their tax-exempt status. If more than 5% or $5 million of the bond proceeds are used to make loans to non-governmental entities, the bond loses its tax-exempt status. Certain activities are considered qualified private activities and are eligible for tax-exempt financing, even if they would typically fail the private activity or private loan tests. The list of qualified private activities has expanded to 27 from the original 12 defined by the tax code. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 expanded the list of qualified private activities to 27 from the original 12 defined in 1968. To qualify for tax-exempt financing, at least 95% of the net bond proceeds must be used for qualified purposes, with issuance costs not exceeding 2%. The 1968 act also mandated that interest payments on industrial development bonds be included in taxable income. The 1968 act introduced changes based on the theory that industrial development bonds were not obligations of a State or political subdivision. It established private use and security tests, exceptions for small issuers, and specified private activities eligible for tax-exempt bond financing. The 1986 act expanded the list of qualified private activities and added qualified hazardous waste facilities while limiting exemptions for sports facilities and privately owned airports. After the 1986 act, there were additions to the list of qualified private activities for tax-exempt financing. Congress also created special zones for tax-exempt private activity bonds for economic development projects. The Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community program had different debt rules for each round, with limits on the amount of bonds issued per zone. The Empowerment Zone program had different debt rules for each round, with limits on the amount of bonds issued per zone. Round II EZs had lifetime caps based on urban vs. rural designation and population. Urban EZs with population less than 100,000 could issue up to $130 million, while those with population greater than 100,000 could issue up to $230 million. The New York Liberty Zone was established after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The NYLZ was created after the 9/11 attacks with tax benefits, including the \"Liberty Bond\" program allowing up to $8 billion in tax-exempt bonds. The deadline for issuing these bonds was extended multiple times until January 1, 2014. A recent extension created tax-exempt bonds for rail to highway transfer facilities, with a national limit of $15 billion and no state volume caps. The Secretary of Transportation allocates these bonds. The Gulf Opportunity Zone (GOZ) was created after the hurricanes in 2005 to encourage investment and rebuilding in the gulf region. The GOZA 2005 expanded private activity bonds and relaxed eligibility rules for mortgage revenue bonds. The GOZ represented a significant portion of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama's economies. The GOZA 2005 increased the volume cap for private activity bonds in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (GO Zone) for Hurricane Katrina recovery in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. This added approximately $2.2 billion for Alabama, $7.8 billion for Louisiana, and $4.8 billion for Mississippi over the next five years. Qualified project costs include residential rental projects and nonresidential real property. The GOZA 2005 increased the volume cap for private activity bonds in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (GO Zone) for Hurricane Katrina recovery in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. This added approximately $2.2 billion for Alabama, $7.8 billion for Louisiana, and $4.8 billion for Mississippi over the next five years. The provision also allowed for advance refunding of certain tax-exempt bonds, providing a significant tax benefit to the Gulf states. The GOZA 2005 provision allowed for advance refunding of certain tax-exempt bonds in the Gulf states, providing a significant tax benefit. P.L. 115-97, the 2017 tax revision, disallowed the federal income exclusion of interest income earned from advance refunding bonds issued after December 31, 2017. Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi were able to advance refund billions of dollars under this provision. In response to the housing crisis of 2008, Congress included provisions in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) to assist the housing sector. This included exempting interest on qualified private activity bonds for residential rental projects and mortgage bonds from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Additionally, HERA created $11 billion of volume cap space for qualified mortgage bonds and residential rental projects, which could be carried forward through 2010. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) included bond-related provisions in response to the financial crisis and economic recession. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included provisions to make bond finance less expensive for designated facilities. This included expanding the definition of qualified manufacturing facilities to include intangible property, creating recovery zone facility bonds for investment in distressed areas, and providing $2 billion for tribal governments to issue tax-exempt bonds for economic development. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $2 billion for tribal governments to issue tax-exempt bonds for economic development purposes. If tax-exempt bonds no longer qualify, the interest becomes taxable, and bond holders are responsible for remitting forgone taxes to the Treasury. Retroactive taxability findings require returning previous tax benefits, while prospective findings mean future interest payments would be taxable. The IRS may require issuers to pay penalties for noncompliance findings regarding tax-exempt bonds. The federal government limits the issuance of private activity bonds to specific activities, with an annual state volume cap that has increased over the years. Small states benefit from a minimum volume cap of $311.38 million in 2018. The 2018 volume cap for states and territories is listed, comparing it to state personal income in 2016. Certain activities have different treatment under the cap, such as bonds for high-speed rail and solid waste facilities. Public educational facilities have a separate cap of $10 per capita or $5 million. Bonds for green buildings, highway-freight transfer facilities, and recovery zone facilities are also subject to specific caps. The 2018 private activity bond volume cap for all states and the District of Columbia is over $37.5 billion. California can issue up to $4.15 billion in new volume, but this is less than the national average when measured against total personal income. Recovery zone facility bonds were allocated to states and local jurisdictions based on employment decline in 2008. In 2018, California's private activity debt issuance is below the national average, with $0.19 for every $100 of personal income. Vermont, on the other hand, can issue up to $1.00 of debt per $100 of personal income. The disparity in debt allowance is due to a two-part volume capacity calculation, with a minimum of $311.38 million for all states regardless of population. Each state independently allocates its volume capacity based on personal income. Private activity bond allocation is determined by volume capacity, with roughly half carried forward to the next year. Unused capacity can be carried forward for up to three years before being abandoned. Loosening restrictions could reduce administrative costs but may lead to concerns about inefficient capital allocation. The tax code outlines technical rules for tax-exempt bonds, including limitations on bond maturity, land acquisition, property purchase, public approval, issuance costs, and private activity bonds. Tax-exempt bonds have complex tax laws and financial properties. A reading list is provided for further exploration.
