    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implements federal pesticide policies under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). This report defines key terms, provides a brief history of the laws, describes the pesticide registration process, and lists references for more detailed information. It highlights key provisions rather than providing a comprehensive inventory of sections. The curr_chunk discusses the regulation of pesticide products under FIFRA and FFDCA, with approximately 18,000 pesticide products in use. EPA is required to regulate the sale and use of pesticides through registration and labeling. Familiar examples of pesticides include chemicals used to kill, repel, or control pests. The broad definition of \"pesticide\" in FIFRA Section 2 includes chemicals used to kill, repel, or control pests, such as insects and weeds in agricultural crops. It also applies to products used for controlling mold, mildew, algae, and other nuisance growths. EPA is directed to restrict pesticide use to prevent adverse effects on people and the environment. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) regulates pesticide use in the United States, requiring registration and labeling for approved uses. EPA registers each pesticide product for specific uses, and older products must be reregistered periodically. Establishments that manufacture or sell pesticides must register with EPA and comply with record-keeping requirements. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) regulates pesticide use in the United States, requiring registration and labeling for approved uses. Facility managers must keep records and allow inspections by regulatory officials. The FFDCA Section 408 authorizes EPA to establish maximum allowable residue levels (tolerances) for pesticides in food production to ensure safety. Foods with residues exceeding tolerance limits are considered \"unsafe\" and \"adulterated\" and cannot be sold in interstate commerce or imported to the United States. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) regulates pesticide use in the United States, requiring registration and labeling for approved uses. FIFRA authorizes EPA to fund registration-related activities by collecting fees from pesticide registrants. Federal pesticide legislation was first enacted in 1910, authorizing the USDA to set standards for insecticides and fungicides. In the 1970s, major changes were made to federal regulations on pesticide production and use. The responsibility for administering the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) was shifted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. A complete revision of FIFRA in 1972 was prompted by concerns about the toxic effects of pesticide exposure. The 1972 law replaced the original 1947 law and directed EPA to register pesticide products and assess their safety based on current scientific knowledge. In 1978, substantial changes were made to FIFRA (P.L. 95-396) to streamline the pesticide reregistration process. The amendments required EPA to review groups of products with the same active ingredients on a generic basis, allowed registrants to share data generation costs, and authorized EPA to suspend registrations if required test data was not provided promptly. The 1988 amendments further accelerated reregistration by focusing on older pesticides, authorizing additional fees, and establishing the Reregistration. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) established a new safety standard for pesticide residues on food, required special protection for children, directed EPA to reassess high-risk pesticides first, facilitated registration of pesticides for minor uses, and mandated periodic reviews of all registered pesticides. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) mandated periodic reviews of all registered pesticides, authorized collection of fees to support reregistration and tolerance reassessments, and extended fee authority through FY2008. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 mandated fees to support reregistration and tolerance reassessment activities. PRIA 1 extended deadlines and established new registration service fees. PRIA 2 reauthorized and revised fee provisions through FY2012. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2012 (PRIA 3) revised fee collection provisions and extended reauthorization through FY2017. Certain fee collections are authorized on a reduced basis through FY2019. FIFRA's authorization for appropriations expired in 1991, but funding has continued. EPA's authority to issue and enforce regulations under FIFRA is mostly permanent. The original FFDCA of 1938 established the current law's structure, requiring the FDA to set tolerances for poisonous substances in food. The FDA, previously part of USDA, was directed by Congress in 1954 to set residue tolerances for pesticides in raw agricultural commodities. The Food Additives Amendment of 1958 expanded this requirement to include food additives, with a provision known as the Delaney Clause prohibiting potential cancer-causing agents in food. In 1970, the EPA took over the authority to establish tolerances for pesticide residues, while FDA retained enforcement responsibility for imported or domestically sold food. In 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act revised pesticide residue tolerance setting requirements, redefining terms and establishing a new safety standard. The Act of July 22, 1954, authorized funding for FFDCA enforcement. Fees for tolerance assessments were authorized by FFDCA Section 408(m), but collection was prohibited in 2004. The EPA requires pesticide manufacturers to submit scientific data on toxicity and environmental behavior when registering a pesticide. More than 100 different tests may be required, depending on the potential toxicity. Analytical methods must be identified to test food for residues of active and inert ingredients. EPA also requires determining the amount of residue that could remain on crops and food products. The EPA evaluates pesticide registration based on toxicity and environmental data submitted by manufacturers. They determine safe residue levels on crops and food products, establish tolerances under the FFDCA, and specify approved uses and storage methods on product labels. Federal regulations for pesticide labels preempt state, local, and tribal regulations. The EPA evaluates pesticide registration based on toxicity and environmental data. Pesticide products are classified as general or restricted use, with restricted-use pesticides requiring training and certification for application. States and tribes are responsible for certifying pesticide applicators. FIFRA Section 3 allows for conditional registrations under certain circumstances. The EPA has the authority to collect fee revenues to accelerate its activities for pesticide registrations under FIFRA and FFDCA. Section 3 registrations require a maintenance fee from pesticide registrants annually. Section 33 of FIFRA describes a fee system for new pesticide registrations and amendments. The EPA collects fees for pesticide registrations and tolerance actions, which are deposited in the Pesticide Registration Fund. PRIA 1 established the fund and prohibited additional tolerance fees under FFDCA Section 408(m). PRIA 3 extended the prohibition on registration service fees without congressional appropriations. The EPA Office of Pesticide Programs collects fees for pesticide registrations and tolerance actions, ensuring that appropriated funds for specific functions are maintained. PRIA 3 requires authorization for fee collection in advance in appropriations acts. Tolerance petitions for pesticides on food-related crops must include relevant information. The FFDCA requires EPA to respond to petitions for pesticide tolerance on food crops by establishing safe residue levels. EPA registrations preempt state restrictions based on lower residue levels, but states can petition for exceptions if public health is at risk. EPA assesses safety based on total exposure to the pesticide allowed by the tolerance. The FFDCA requires EPA to establish safe residue levels for pesticide tolerance on food crops, preempting state restrictions. EPA assesses safety based on total exposure to the pesticide, ensuring a 'reasonable certainty of no harm' with an ample margin of safety. EPA continues setting standards to ensure safety as mandated by the Committee on Commerce. The FFDCA requires EPA to establish safe residue levels for pesticide tolerance on food crops with a 100-fold safety factor. The FQPA limits benefits considered in tolerance setting, allowing higher residue levels only if necessary to avoid greater risks or disruptions in food supply. EPA can modify existing tolerances for potential carcinogens. The FFDCA requires EPA to establish safe residue levels for pesticide tolerance on food crops with a 100-fold safety factor. Higher tolerance levels may be set for potential carcinogens with no known level of exposure at which no harm is anticipated. The tolerance level must be safe for infants and children, with limits on cancer risk and non-threshold effects. EPA can modify existing tolerances for potential carcinogens. The Committee expects EPA to establish tolerances for pesticides that provide a 'reasonable certainty of no harm' with a negligible increase in lifetime risk. This standard applies to both raw and processed foods, considering cumulative exposure from various sources. Congress mandated EPA to review all existing tolerances against this standard by August 2006. EPA interprets negligible risk as a one-in-a-million lifetime risk. FDA and USDA are tasked with monitoring pesticide residue levels in food. The FDA and USDA monitor pesticide residue levels in food in interstate commerce and enforce tolerances through food inspection programs. EPA is responsible for making pesticide registration data publicly available, with some information protected as trade secrets under FIFRA. Companies can register products based on data from similar products, with a 10-year exclusive use period for original registrants. Compensation is required for new data used within 15 years. Congress has long been concerned about the large number of registered products. Congress has long been concerned about the large number of registered pesticide products that have not undergone modern safety reviews. FIFRA Section 4 directs EPA to reregister older products to assess their safety based on current scientific standards. Many older pesticide products have had their registrations canceled, with at least 14,000 products no longer in use. Reregistering the remaining older products is a costly and ongoing task for registrants and EPA. EPA groups products with the same active ingredients for reregistration evaluations. EPA evaluates scientific data to determine pesticide eligibility for reregistration under FIFRA and FFDCA safety standards. Registrants must provide necessary data, and EPA issues a \"RED\" document after reviewing it. Failure to provide data can lead to product registration suspension. EPA is authorized to suspend product registrations if needed. Fees collected go into the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund to speed up pesticide application processing. PRIA 1 set deadlines for completing REDs for pesticides. The reregistration process continues after these deadlines. After EPA issues a RED and declares a pesticide eligible for reregistration, individual end-use products containing the active ingredient must also be reregistered. This process, known as \"product reregistration,\" ensures that risk reduction measures from REDs are reflected on product labels. EPA plans to make final product reregistration decisions several years after REDs are signed. Congress amended FIFRA Section 3(g) to mandate periodic reviews of pesticide registrations every 15 years. PRIA 2 allows the use of funds from the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund to offset review costs. PRIA 2 and PRIA 3 authorize the use of funds from the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund to offset costs of registration reviews for pesticide products. The deadline for EPA to complete registration review decisions for all pesticide products registered as of October 1, 2007, is October 1, 2022. Registration reviews assess whether pesticides meet safety standards and replace EPA's reregistration and tolerance reassessment programs. EPA continues to evaluate pesticide safety post-registration as new information becomes available. FIFRA requires prompt reporting of new evidence on adverse effects from pesticide exposure. EPA can initiate special reviews to reevaluate risks and benefits, require new studies, and amend or cancel registrations if unreasonable risks are found. Registrants can also request cancellation or amendment of registrations. If a registration is canceled for certain pesticide uses, it cannot be sold or distributed for those uses in the United States. However, U.S. farmers can use remaining stocks for a period of time, and commerce can continue for treated commodities. Registrants can appeal an EPA decision to cancel a registration, which allows the product to be marketed during the review process. In cases of \"imminent hazard,\" EPA can suspend registration, halting sales and use of the pesticide. FIFRA Section 15 allows for compensation in case of suspension or cancellation of pesticide registration. Registrants are responsible for transportation, disposal, and storage costs. Sections 5, 18, and 24(c) provide for experimental permits, emergency exemptions, and additional state uses of registered products. FIFRA Section 26 gives states primary authority for enforcing pesticide use provisions, with EPA having the authority to rescind this responsibility if not carried out. Section 11 allows EPA to form cooperative agreements with states for training applicators. States can review and approve emergency exemptions and special local needs registrations. EPA and state officials can conduct inspections under Section 9. Section 9 of FIFRA authorizes inspections by EPA and state officials of pesticide products stored for distribution or sale. Section 13 allows EPA to issue orders to stop sales and seize supplies of pesticides. Civil and criminal penalties for violations are in Section 14, with indemnity payments provided in Section 15. Federal district courts can review EPA actions in Section 16, and individuals affected by EPA orders can seek judicial review. FIFRA does not permit citizen suits against violators or regulate domestic production for export of unregistered pesticides. FIFRA requires exporters to comply with labeling provisions and obtain purchaser's acknowledgment for unregistered pesticides. EPA notifies other countries of pesticide registration status changes in the U.S. The CRS reports discuss pesticide use, water quality, registration fees, and compliance with labeling provisions under FIFRA. EPA notifies other countries of pesticide registration status changes in the U.S."
