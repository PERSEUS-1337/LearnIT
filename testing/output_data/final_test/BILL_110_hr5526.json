Residents of Puerto Rico have a strong history of military service, with many receiving prestigious awards for their valor in various wars and conflicts since 1917. Over 18,000 served in World War I, 65,000 in World War II (including 200 women), and 61,000 in the Korean War. Four residents have even received the Medal of Honor for their bravery on the battlefield. In addition to their history of military service in previous wars, residents of Puerto Rico have also served in Vietnam, Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, and the Nation's current war on terrorism. Despite not being able to vote for their commander-in-chief, Puerto Ricans have always proudly answered the call to defend the nation and sacrifice for liberty.
