    "content": "The \"Dry Cask Storage Act of 2014\" is an amendment to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, adding a new section on Emergency Planning Zones and Dry Cask Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel. It includes definitions related to these topics. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to emergency planning zones and spent nuclear fuel storage, including 'emergency planning zone,' 'licensee,' and 'spent nuclear fuel dry cask.' These definitions are crucial for understanding regulations regarding civilian nuclear power reactors. The curr_chunk outlines requirements for nuclear power reactors licensed by the Commission, located at reactor sites, with approved designs including security, seismic, and flooding considerations. \"SEC. 186. PLAN FOR DRY CASK STORAGE OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL.\" Each licensee must submit a plan to the Commission within 180 days for transferring spent nuclear fuel from pools to dry casks. This includes transferring qualified fuel and continuously transferring additional qualified fuel to dry casks. The plan must include transferring spent nuclear fuel from pools to dry casks within 7 years of plan submission. The remaining fuel in the pool should be configured to minimize fire risk in case of water loss. The Commission must approve or disapprove the plan within 90 days. The Commission must approve or disapprove a plan within 90 days. If disapproved, recommendations for revisions must be submitted within 30 days, and the revised plan must be approved or disapproved within 30 days of receipt. Spent nuclear fuel must be stored in pools for at least 7 years to qualify for placement in dry casks, unless there is no approved cask available. The Commission may provide grants to licensees with approved plans. The Commission may provide grants to licensees with approved plans to assist in transferring spent nuclear fuel to dry casks. Preference is given to plans at reactors close to capacity, supported by the local government, or at reactors that have ceased operations. The Commission may provide grants to licensees with approved plans for transferring spent nuclear fuel to dry casks. Grants will not be given to licensees not in compliance with the approved plan, as determined by the Commission through biennial reviews. \"Expansion and applicability of emergency planning zone under SEC. 187.\" The emergency planning zone for civilian nuclear power reactors must be at least 10 miles until all spent fuel is in dry casks. The zone will expand to 50 miles within 18 months, except for reactors with approved compliance plans. The licensee is responsible for all costs associated with expanding the emergency planning zone for civilian nuclear power reactors. The Secretary of the Treasury must transfer at least 10 percent of generated interest to the Commission annually to cover these costs."
