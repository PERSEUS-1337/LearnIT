The purpose of the Act is to establish findings and a purpose for the commission. During World War II, the United States expanded its internment program to include Latin Americans of Japanese descent, detaining approximately 2,300 individuals for the purpose of exchanging them for American citizens held by Axis countries. During World War II, Latin Americans of Japanese descent were detained by the Department of State in internment camps operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1941 through 1948. Individuals were arrested without a warrant, hearing, or indictment by local police and sent to the United States for internment. Passports of these individuals were routinely confiscated before arrival in the United States, and visas were refused by United States consuls in Latin American countries. Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of Japanese descent from Latin America were detained in internment camps in the United States during World War II. They were considered illegal entrants and subject to deportation, with some being deported to Axis countries for prisoner exchanges. The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians studied Federal actions related to detaining and interning civilians of enemy nationality, including those of Japanese descent. The program of interning Latin Americans of Japanese descent was not conducted under Executive Order 9066, but it is important to examine this extraordinary program for a complete account of Federal actions.
