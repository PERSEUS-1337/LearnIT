    "content": "The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1982 suspended previous laws on cost-of-living adjustments for federal civilian and military retirees. Efforts have been made to repeal or extend provisions of this legislation since 1983. Prior to this Act, military retirement COLAs were based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index. The 1982 Act changed the effective dates of COLAs for FY1983, FY1984, and FY1985. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1982 changed the calculation of COLAs for military retirees, with different rates for those under 62 and those over. Efforts to modify this legislation continued through FY2001. The Reagan Administration's budget request for FY1984 proposed canceling the COLA scheduled for May 1, 1984, and limiting COLAs for nondisabled retirees under age 62 to half of the CPI increase starting in FY1986. The First Concurrent Resolution on the FY1984 Budget assumed a delayed effective date for the FY1984 COLA. The proposed changes to military retirement COLAs in 1983, including a delayed effective date for FY1984 COLA and a permanent \"half-COLA\" for nondisabled retirees under 62, were not enacted by Congress. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1982 remained in effect, with the next military retirement COLA scheduled for May 1, 1984. In FY1985, the Reagan Administration proposed repealing COLA provisions for military retirees and shifting the payment date for federal civilian and military retirement COLAs to January 1 of each year starting in 1985. The Reagan Administration proposed repealing COLA provisions for military retirees and changing the payment date for federal civilian and military retirement COLAs to January 1 of each year starting in 1985. This proposal was part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1983 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The Reduction Act of 1984 repealed provisions from the 1982 Act regarding military retirees' forfeit of retired pay COLAs and changed the payment date to the first business day of the next month. This resulted in a one-time savings of $1.6 billion in military retirement outlays for FY1985. The Reagan Administration proposed to eliminate the military retired pay COLA scheduled for January 1, 1986, but it was rejected by the final Concurrent Resolution on the Budget. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 temporarily suspended the payment of the FY1986 COLA. The FY1986 COLA payment was temporarily suspended between January 1, 1986, and March 1, 1986, as per the GRH Act. The President later decided to permanently cancel the FY1986 COLA to help reduce the federal deficit. The Supreme Court deemed the automatic spending provisions of GRH unconstitutional on July 7, 1986, but allowed a 60-day stay for Congress and the President to enact budget cuts through the regular legislative process. The President signed P.L. 99-366 on July 31, 1986, ratifying the FY1986 GRH budget cuts, including the cancellation of the FY1986 COLA. The FY1987 DOD budget proposed eliminating the military retired pay COLA for January 1, 1987, but the final FY1987 Budget assumed full military retirement COLAs would be paid. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 ensured full COLAs for military retirees from 1987 to 1991. The Reagan Administration's FY1988 and FY1989 DOD budgets did not propose changes to military retirement COLA provisions in permanent law, a departure from previous years where proposals were common. Military retirees received a 1.3% COLA on January 1, 1987, based on CPI increases. In FY1984 through 1986, proposals aimed to postpone or eliminate COLAs to save money. Congress did not enact any restrictions on COLAs in 1987 and 1988. The FY1988 and FY1989 budgets assumed full COLA payments in FY1988. Amendments to the GRH deficit reduction process in 1987 excluded military retirement COLAs from automatic sequestrations. Military retirees received a 4.2% COLA on January 1, 1988, and a 4.0% COLA on January 1, 1989, based on the average Consumer Price Index. The FY1990 budget did not propose any changes to the COLA formula. The Bush Administration proposed reducing military retirement COLAs for FY1988 and FY1989. The program included canceling the COLA for January 1, 1990, and adjusting COLAs for all military retirees to be one percentage point below the actual rate of inflation until at least 1994. However, a bipartisan budget agreement in 1989 assumed that COLAs would be paid based on permanent law. The Bush Administration proposed reducing military retirement COLAs for FY1988 and FY1989, including canceling the COLA for January 1, 1990. However, a bipartisan budget agreement in 1989 assumed that COLAs would be paid based on permanent law, with no savings from COLA cancellations included in budgetary calculations. Military retirees received full COLAs in accordance with permanent law, as statutes prevented sequestration from affecting their COLAs. The Bush Administration proposed military retirement COLA reductions for FY1991, including canceling the COLA for January 1, 1991. Additionally, all military retirees would have their COLA calculated one percentage point below the actual rate of inflation from January 1, 1992 onwards. The Administration proposed military retirement COLA reductions for FY1991, including canceling the COLA for January 1, 1991. Negotiations in August-October 1990 considered deeper reductions, such as limiting COLAs for military retirees over 62 to CPI minus one percentage point from FY1992 onwards and providing no COLAs for those under 62. A one-time recomputation of retired pay was suggested for under-62 retirees to restore purchasing power. The final budget agreement in late October 1990 did not include military retirement COLA reductions as proposed by the Administration. Military retirees received a 5.4% COLA on January 1, 1991, based on the permanent statutory COLA computation formula. The original FY1992 and FY1993 budgets proposed no military retirement COLA reductions. In 1991 and 1992, there were no military retirement COLA reductions proposed. The Bush Administration suggested allowing military retirement COLAs to be subject to budget sequestration in FY1993, but Congress did not act on this proposal. Military retirees received a 3.7% COLA on January 1, 1992, based on the CPI increase. In 1993, military retirees received a 3.0% COLA on January 1, and a 2.6% COLA on either April 1, 1994 or January 1, 1994. The Clinton Administration FY1994 budget did not propose reducing military retirement COLAs. The budget resolution included restrictions on COLAs, but these were not binding. The House version of the FY1994 Budget Resolution proposed capping military retirees' COLAs at $400 for FY1994, with different calculations for retirees under age 62 and those 62 or older. The Senate version also had restrictions on COLAs, but they were not binding. The final FY1994 Budget Resolution included COLA restrictions for military retirees under age 62, capping their COLAs at $400 and computing them based on 50% of the actual inflation rate. Upon reaching age 62, retirees would have a one-time recomputation of their annuity to make up for lost purchasing power. This change would have been permanent for under-62 military retirees. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included changes to military retirement COLAs for under-62 retirees, with a cap of $400 and a computation based on 50% of inflation. The legislation also altered the timing of COLAs but not the formulas. Military retirees questioned why their COLAs would be paid later than civil service retiree COLAs in FY1995-1998, which was due to the congressional budget process. The FY1994 congressional budget resolution included retirement spending reductions by limiting civilian and military retirement COLAs to one-half the rate of inflation for retirees under age 62, generating larger estimated savings in military retirement. The budget resolution provides instructions on budget targets to the authorizing committees responsible for military and civil service retirement programs. The Senate Armed Services Committees and the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee are responsible for retirement programs. Savings are enacted in reconciliation legislation, with final programmatic changes made by authorizing committees. Policy assumptions in budget resolutions guide savings amounts, but actual changes are decided by authorizing committees. Despite not adopting policy assumptions, the authorizing committees had to save the same amount proposed for retirees under age 62. The Armed Services Committees decided to delay COLAs for military retirees more than for civilian retirees after FY1994 to achieve greater savings. They protected COLAs for financially vulnerable groups like military disability retirees and survivors. The Penny-Kasich proposal initially aimed to deny COLAs to military retirees under age 62, later modified to exclude under-62 retirees who first entered military service. The Penny-Kasich proposal aimed to deny COLAs to military retirees under age 62 who first entered service after January 1, 1994. A bipartisan Senate proposal in November 1993 also called for cutting the FY1994 COLA in half and denying COLAs to the same group of retirees. The Boren-Danforth Proposal in May 1993 suggested limiting COLAs on military retired pay above $600 monthly to two percentage points below the CPI increase during FY1994-1998. The Boren-Danforth Proposal in May 1993 suggested limiting COLAs on military retired pay above $600 monthly to two percentage points below the CPI increase during FY1994-1998. The FY1995 National Defense Authorization Act and the FY1995 DOD Appropriations Act provided military retirees with a 2.8% COLA on April 1, 1995 for nondisability retirees and January 1, 1995 for disability retirees and survivor benefit recipients. The FY1995 budget of the Clinton Administration did not propose cutting military retirement COLAs. The House Armed Services Committee identified funding for an FY1995 military retirement COLA to align with civil service retirement COLA payment dates. The full House adopted this proposal and aimed to address disparate COLA payment dates for FY1996-1998 through the budget process. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees addressed military retirement COLAs for fiscal years 1996-1998. The House adopted aligning payment dates with civil service retirement COLAs, while the Senate proposed funding earlier military COLAs by authorizing later civil service COLAs. The Senate adopted amendments related to military and civil service retirement COLAs, aligning payment dates starting in FY1999. The conference report criticized the use of discretionary defense funds for retirement COLAs. The conference report criticized the use of discretionary defense funds for retirement COLAs and called for finding an alternative method to address the disparity between military and civil service retirement COLAs for fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998. The authorization bill changed the language regarding the payment dates for COLAs, making it contingent on the appropriation of an additional $376 million. The Senate included appropriations for the FY1995 military retirement COLA despite opposition from key Senators. The conference decision resulted in the COLA being paid on the same date as civil service retirees. The 1995 COLA was set at 2.8% and would have been delayed if not for Senate appropriations. The FY1996-1998 military retirement COLAs were mandated to be paid on the same dates as civil service retirement COLAs. The 1995 military retirement COLAs were contingent on budgetary rules and legislation to offset costs. The COLA reductions in the 1993 OBRA were projected to save $3.146 billion in retirement costs. The Senate Armed Services Committee proposed a plan to save $3.146 billion in military retirement costs during FY1994-1998 by adjusting COLA payments. The plan would have resulted in $221 million in savings over the period FY1995-1999. The Committee's amendment aimed to save $221 million by adjusting retirement outlays, with more savings from decreased civil service retirement outlays offsetting increased military retirement outlays. Civil service retirement outlays are larger than military retirement outlays, with most military retirees participating in the Survivor Benefit Plan. The 1993 OBRA changed permanent law regarding COLAs for military retirees, resulting in an increase in SBP premiums for nondisabled retirees. Despite delaying COLAs until April 1, 1994, SBP costs were still increased for the first three months of the year. This adjustment was necessary as DOD could not reprogram its computers to delay the increase in SBP costs. The 1993 OBRA changed permanent law regarding COLAs for military retirees, resulting in increased SBP premiums for nondisabled retirees. Due to DOD's inability to reprogram its computers, the increased SBP premiums were deducted from retirees' pay in April 1994. The retroactive collection of SBP premiums amounted to less than $15 for most retirees. The 1993 OBRA changed permanent law regarding COLAs for military retirees, resulting in increased SBP premiums for nondisabled retirees. All survivor benefit recipients received their COLAs on January 1, not April 1. SBP budgeting assumes a balance of costs to the government and costs to the individual retiree. There has been controversy about whether SBP deductions from retired pay should start before a fiscal year's COLA is first paid. The Senate version of the FY1995 National Defense Authorization Act included a floor amendment to prevent COLA-driven increases in SBP premium deductions from military retired pay. The Senate version of the FY1995 National Defense Authorization Act included a provision to prevent increases in SBP premium deductions from military retired pay before the actual COLA is granted. However, this provision was not adopted by the authorization conference committee, so the earlier premium deductions will continue unless modified by later legislation. Legislation had previously been introduced to prevent increased SBP deductions from taking effect before the payment of the COLA. The Final Report of the Commission, released on January 27, 1995, proposed options that would affect military retirement. One option included a cap on the combined total of military retired pay and social security, limiting it to 80% of the high-3 years of basic pay for those retiring after January 1, 2000. If the combined benefit exceeded the cap, military retired pay would be reduced by no more than 50%. Only social security benefits from military service would be counted towards the cap, not those from civilian employment. The cap would be adjusted annually to reflect wage growth in the civilian economy until the retiree becomes eligible for social security at age 62. The Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986 changed the calculation of retired pay for military members. Retirees accrue pay at a rate of 2% per year for each year of service through 20 years, and 3.5% per year for each year of service past 20, up to a maximum of 75% of high-3 basic pay. A proposed option would reduce the accrual rate from 3.5% to 2% for years 20-30, resulting in a maximum of 60% of high-3 basic pay for retirees with 30 years or more of service. The Commission staff proposed reducing the maximum retired pay for military retirees with 30 years or more of service from 75% to 60% of high-3 basic pay. They also suggested options such as revising the CPI or suspending COLAs for one year, which would impact various federal programs. The Commission Final Report discussed options for changing military retirement, including limiting COLAs and placing a cap on federal entitlements. The report did not endorse specific program cuts. The Commission report discussed options for changing military retirement, including limiting COLAs and capping federal entitlements. Legislative activity in 1995 resulted in a 2.6% COLA for military retirees in FY1996. The Clinton Administration's FY1996 budget did not propose delays or cuts in military retirement COLAs. In 1995, legislative activity resulted in a 2.6% COLA for military retirees in FY1996. The House and Senate assumed the FY1996 reconciliation bill would determine the COLA payment date for nondisabled military retirees, although the issue had been addressed earlier in the year in their versions of the FY1996 defense authorization bill. The FY1996 reconciliation bill did not address the COLA issue due to procedural concerns in the Senate. $1.8 billion meant for COLAs was used for other programs. The first reconciliation bill was vetoed, leading to a default to previously enacted COLA dates from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 set COLA dates for October 1 of 1996, 1997, and 1998. The FY1996 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that COLAs be paid on specific dates. The FY1996 National Defense Authorization Act mandated specific dates for COLA payments, with military retirement COLAs first paid on January 1 of FY1997 and FY1998, with percentage increases of 2.9% and 2.1% respectively. The Clinton Administration's budgets for FY1997 and FY1998 assumed no changes to military retirement COLAs, with payments on January 1 of each year. The House resolution proposed aligning military retirement COLAs with civil service COLAs, saving $1.067 billion from FY1998 through FY2002. It did not guarantee delaying military COLAs to April 1 each year, but required equivalent savings through COLA delays or other spending cuts. The final congressional budget resolution for FY1997 did not address military retirement COLAs, with no assumptions made in the House or Senate FY1998 budget resolutions. A slight technical change in CPI calculation was assumed, but no changes were made regarding military retirement COLAs in the National Defense Authorization Act. The FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act did not include any changes to military retirement COLAs. In 1996, the Concord Coalition proposed eliminating COLAs for nondisabled retirees under age 62, with a one-time recomputation at age 62 and then COLAs based on the Consumer Price Index minus one percent. In 1996, a group of Senators proposed reducing COLAs and retired pay for military retirees under age 50. The proposal included capping COLAs and reducing retired pay, but it was not adopted. In 1996, a proposal to reduce COLAs and retired pay for military retirees under age 50 was not adopted. In February 1997, the \"Blue Dog\" Democrats released a balanced budget proposal that included reducing the overall COLA by 0.8% for military retirement. This reduction would be applied to the average military retired pay for all retirees, with each retiree's pay then increased by the same amount. The proposal in 1996 to reduce COLAs and retired pay for military retirees under age 50 was not adopted. In February 1997, a balanced budget proposal by the \"Blue Dog\" Democrats included reducing the overall COLA by 0.8% for military retirement. Each retiree's pay would then be increased by a flat $35.20 per month, regardless of their previous retired pay amount. Critics argue that this method penalizes higher-ranking personnel by giving them a smaller percentage raise compared to lower-ranking retirees. There are suggestions to revise the Consumer Price Index (CPI) downward, as it may overstate the rate of inflation. Proponents of the change argue that the current CPI calculation fails to consider consumer behavior changes and quality of goods, leading to an inaccurate inflation rate. Opponents question the validity of proposed changes to the CPI formula and computing methods to reduce inflation rates. Some minor CPI formula adjustments have been made without much controversy. The Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986 faced debate in 1998-1999 over potential repeals of future retired pay cuts. The Redux retirement reductions, also known as the \"Redux\" cuts, were almost completely repealed by the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act. The Redux statute would have significantly reduced retired pay for military personnel who first entered service on or after August 1, 1986. The Redux formula would not have affected a significant number of retirees' pay until mid-2006. Each December, military retired pay receives a COLA based on the CPI increase between successive years. For example, if the CPI rises by 4.0%, retired pay for January would increase by the same percentage. The 1986 Act modified this formula for Redux retirees, holding their COLAs one percentage point below the actual inflation rate. The 1986 Redux legislation would have reduced COLAs for retirees under age 62 by one percentage point. However, at age 62, there would be a one-time recomputation of annuity to make up for lost purchasing power. Future COLAs would still be based on CPI minus one percentage point. Repeal discussions in 1998 focused on changing non-COLA aspects. The Administration proposed a repeal of the Redux COLA formula in 1998, replacing it with the less generous FERS formula for eligible retirees. FERS provides a COLA based on CPI minus one percentage point, with variations based on CPI increases. The Senate Bill S. 4, known as the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, offered military members two retirement choices at the 15-year mark: retire under the pre-Redux formula with full COLA protection or retire under Redux with a $30,000 cash bonus. The bill was passed by the Senate on February 4, 1999, and the legislative focus on military retirement changes shifted to the FY2000 defense authorization bill. The Senate Bill S. 4 offered military members two retirement choices at the 15-year mark: retire under the pre-Redux formula with full COLA protection or retire under Redux with a $30,000 cash bonus. The House version of the FY2000 defense authorization bill provided the same two options but with less generous COLA provisions than the Senate. The final version of the bill (P.L. 106-65, October 5, 1999, Sec. 641) contained the House plan, rejecting the FERS formula for COLA computation. Military retirees covered by the 1986 Act have the option of a Redux or pre-Redux COLA formula, based on whether they choose the $30,000 cash bonus. COLAs for military retirement were paid on January 1 in FY1999-FY2005, with percentage increases ranging from 1.3% to 3.5%. No legislative changes were made to COLAs during this seven-year period. Military retirement COLAs were first authorized in 1963, with no proposed legislative changes to the mechanism since then. From FY1997 to FY2005, there were no changes in the COLA formula, marking the longest period without adjustments since 1963."
