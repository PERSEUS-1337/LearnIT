    "content": "Recent media stories about NSA surveillance focus on unauthorized disclosures of two intelligence collection programs under FISA. These programs collect different types of information and raise distinct policy questions. There is a tension between government access to data and civil liberties safeguards. The first program gathers domestic phone records in bulk, while the second targets electronic communications of non-U.S. persons abroad. The NSA surveillance programs collect information on domestic phone records and electronic communications of non-U.S. persons abroad. The report discusses the legal basis, oversight mechanisms, and arguments for and against the programs. Legislation has been proposed in response to the disclosed information. The information is based on public comments from intelligence officials and Members of Congress. The existence of a domestic phone records collection program by Verizon for U.S. customers was confirmed by intelligence officials and congressional leaders. The program, in operation for seven years, collects metadata under a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The Director of National Intelligence described the program as a vast library but stated that data on Americans can only be accessed under specific circumstances. The phone records collection program by Verizon collects metadata such as dialed numbers, call date, and duration. The data does not include location information and must be destroyed within five years. It does not reveal the content of the call or subscriber identity. Civil liberties advocates argue that a phone number can easily be linked to a person's identity. The Guardian article alleged that NSA collected metadata for Internet-based communications for Americans inside the United States, but the program was discontinued in 2011. NSA does not currently collect in bulk the metadata of these types of communications, but concerns remain about potential future collection. The collection of Internet metadata was based on separate FISA authorities. The Washington Post and The Guardian reported on NSA and FBI tapping into U.S. Internet companies' servers to collect data. The government claims the intelligence collection is more targeted than reported, and tech companies deny giving direct access to servers. The DNI stated the collection was pursuant to Section 702 of FISA. The DNI fact sheet explains that PRISM is a government system for accessing communications under Section 702 of FISA. The program targets foreign individuals overseas, collecting data including email content that flows through U.S. networks. It is more focused on non-U.S. persons but collects a broader range of information compared to Section 215 phone records collection. The NSA monitors a large portion of the world's Internet traffic, but only \"touches\" 1.6% and \"selects for review\" 0.025%. Critics and proponents may not have a complete understanding of NSA collection methods. An October 2011 opinion from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court revealed that NSA collected 250 million Internet records. The NSA collected 250 million Internet communications per year using 702 authorities, with 91% acquired directly from Internet Service Providers. The other 9% were acquired through upstream collection. NSA has two methods for collecting information about a specific target: \"to/from\" communications collection and \"about\" communications collection. The USA PATRIOT ACT broadened government access to private business records, allowing the FBI to collect domestic phone records without the contents of communications. This raised civil liberties concerns due to the potential broader scope of collected communications. The USA PATRIOT ACT expanded FBI access to private business records, including domestic phone records, without content. The provision now requires the FBI to show \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that sought tangible things are relevant to authorized investigations into foreign intelligence, terrorism, or espionage. This standard is similar to \"reasonable suspicion\" and lacks defined parameters. Looking at interpretations of the Stored Communications Act may provide insight. Under the SCA, the collection of stored email has been deemed relevant to criminal investigations, especially in cases involving fraud. Obtaining IP addresses and names associated with accounts has also been justified in cases like child pornography investigations. \"Relevancy\" is not strictly defined by FISA but is generally understood to be less stringent. The Obama Administration released a whitepaper in August 2013 analyzing the bulk collection of telephony metadata under Section 215, focusing on the term \"relevancy.\" The whitepaper discussed how courts have upheld requests for entire repositories of records, even if individual records may not directly relate to the investigation, as searching the entire repository is the only feasible means to locate relevant information. The whitepaper analyzed the bulk collection of telephony metadata under Section 215, focusing on the term \"relevancy.\" The FISC approved the NSA's collection of records, indicating that the relevancy requirement was satisfied. Investigations must be conducted under approved guidelines, with three levels: assessments, preliminary investigations, and full investigations. Section 215 orders may only be used in conjunction with preliminary or full investigations, as they require an articulable factual basis for the investigation. Some have questioned the relevancy of the broad amount of data collected by Verizon in relation to authorized investigations. The Section 215 order requires a relevant amount of data for authorized investigations, but key details like the statement of facts and application specifics have not been disclosed. Title VII allows for acquisition of foreign intelligence information for individuals outside the US. The DNI has authorized the collection of foreign intelligence information from electronic communication service providers under Section 702 of FISA, targeting non-U.S. persons overseas. Prior to Section 702, FISA required a FISC order with probable cause for electronic surveillance. Section 702 allows the AG and DNI to conduct surveillance on foreign powers or their agents. Section 702 of FISA allows the AG and DNI to jointly authorize targeting of non-U.S. persons outside the United States for up to one year, with limitations on intentionally targeting individuals in the U.S. or U.S. persons located abroad. Acquisitions under Section 702 of FISA are focused on electronic communications or stored information, conducted in a manner consistent with the Fourth Amendment. The certification for these acquisitions involves obtaining information from electronic communication service providers, which may include wiretaps, intercepting digital communications, or accessing stored data. Targeting and minimization procedures must be approved by the FISC. Section 702 of FISA requires targeting procedures to be approved by the FISC to ensure acquisitions are limited to persons outside the US. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring warrants in domestic criminal investigations. The extent of the warrant requirement for government's foreign intelligence collection is unclear. The Supreme Court invalidated warrantless electronic surveillance of domestic organizations on Fourth Amendment grounds in a 1972 case. The Obama Administration declassified FISC opinions in 2013 regarding Section 702 collection activities. The government proposed targeting and minimization procedures for upstream collection activities. The FISC found deficiencies in the proposed minimization procedures for upstream collection activities, noting that they focused mainly on information analysts wanted to use, leading to the retention of unrelated and potentially domestic communications for up to five years. This was deemed inconsistent with FISA's mandate to minimize the retention of U.S. person information. The FISC found deficiencies in the proposed minimization procedures for upstream collection activities, noting that they focused mainly on information analysts wanted to use, leading to the retention of unrelated and potentially domestic communications for up to five years. The FISC also held that the proposed minimization procedures did not satisfy the Fourth Amendment. In 2008, the FISCR upheld collection activities under the Protect America Act (PAA) that closely resembled the authority under Section 702, determining that foreign intelligence investigations justified an exception to the warrant requirement and that surveillance under the PAA was reasonable with sufficient targeting and minimization procedures. In October 2011, the FISC found minimization procedures deficient, leading to a balance not favoring the government under the Fourth Amendment. The government revised procedures to comply, approved by the FISC in November 2011, requiring segregation of potentially unrelated or domestic communications. The oversight mechanisms governing two intelligence collection programs involve frequent examination by the FISC and Congress. Critics argue that the FISC acts as a \"rubber stamp\" for the executive branch due to the high approval rate of requests. However, others believe the court's experienced judges and professional staff ensure thorough oversight. The lack of transparency in the court's decisions makes it challenging to assess these claims. The collection of phone records in bulk is conducted under FISA orders, stored at NSA, and accessed with reasonable suspicion. Oversight mechanisms include FISC approval and NSA audits. Less than 300 phone numbers were queried in 2012. Intelligence officials have identified additional oversight measures for this program. Oversight mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of the program include regular reports to the FISC, meetings every 90 days between DOJ, ODNI, and NSA, and semiannual reports to Congress. Collection of electronic communications under Section 702 is subject to less stringent oversight, with information obtained with FISA Court approval and provider knowledge. Procedures to prevent acquisition and dissemination of Americans' communications are subject to court approval, and collection on foreign targets does not require a warrant. The NSA's collection of data on foreign targets under Section 702 does not require a warrant. Oversight is primarily conducted by the DOJ and ODNI, with regular reports to the FISC and Congress on compliance and implementation. The Administration argues that these surveillance activities are crucial for national security and have helped prevent terror plots. The Administration views collection under Section 702 as important for national security, while Section 215 has been useful in terrorism cases. Bulk phone records collection is defended for its breadth to ensure all relevant information is available. Intelligence officials claim the programs have helped prevent over 50 potential terrorist events. NSA Director General Alexander clarified that there were a total of 54 terrorist events, with 42 involving terrorist plots and 12 involving material support to terrorism. Of these events, 53 involved collection under Section 702. Thirteen threats were inside the United States, with 12 cases utilizing phone records held by the NSA. One case targeted the U.S. homeland, while another involved U.S.-based material support for extremist activity outside the country. The NSA intercepted communication between extremists in Pakistan and individuals in the United States, leading to the identification and surveillance of Najibullah Zazi and Adis Medunjanin, who were arrested for planning to bomb the New York City subway. Another case involved Khalid Ouazzani and the use of Section 702 authorities for intercepting communication. Khalid Ouazzani and David Headley were intercepted by the NSA using 702 authorities. Ouazzani provided support to al-Qaeda and was involved in a plot to bomb the New York Stock Exchange. Headley was linked to the 2008 Mumbai attack and a plot to bomb a Danish newspaper. Both individuals admitted to their involvement in these terrorist activities. The NSA used phone records to identify Basaaly Saeed Moalin in San Diego, who was involved in financing extremist activity in Somalia. Moalin was convicted of supporting al-Shabaab. Critics question the value of collecting phone records under Section 215 for cases involving U.S. citizens. Critics suggest that instead of the NSA using phone numbers to query their database, the same numbers could be given to phone companies to search their records, producing similar results. Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall question why agencies investigating terrorism don't obtain this information directly from phone companies using a regular court order. They argue that if the NSA is only reviewing records meeting a \"reasonable suspicion\" standard, they should be able to get court orders for them. The NSA should be able to obtain court orders for records meeting a \"reasonable suspicion\" standard instead of collecting bulk phone records. Convenience alone does not justify the collection of personal information of ordinary Americans if the same information can be obtained using less intrusive methods. Critics acknowledge the value of Section 702 collection for national security concerns. Some critics of Section 702 collection question if it adequately protects civil liberties, especially regarding the NSA's \"upstream collection\" and \"about\" communications. In 2013, the FISC found elements of the program inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. Technical constraints led to NSA collecting groupings of communications instead of specific \"about\" communications. The FISC found that NSA's collection of communications included domestic and unrelated data, violating the Constitution. Despite allowing the \"about\" collection to continue, stricter minimization procedures were required for data containing Americans' communications. Intelligence officials should be questioned about the effectiveness of this collection method compared to \"to/from\" communications. The Zazi case, involving NSA's bulk phone records collection program, provides insight into the utility of Section 702 authorities. Zazi and associates traveled to Pakistan for training from al-Qaeda, with Zazi later requesting an explosives recipe via email intercepted by NSA. This case highlights the potential effectiveness of NSA's collection methods. The FBI opened an investigation on Zazi after intercepting an email using NSA's 702 authorities. Zazi traveled to New York for a potential attack, but returned to Denver after becoming aware of FBI surveillance. He was arrested after FBI linked him to Medunjanin using phone records. The FBI identified travel records showing Zazi and Medunjanin departed for Pakistan together in 2008. The NYPD had previously identified them using informants at a mosque in Queens. Questions about the role of phone records in the investigation include what the FBI knew about Medunjanin's travel and activity before linking him to Zazi, and whether the information was enough to obtain phone records through a court order. The FBI identified travel records showing Zazi and Medunjanin departed for Pakistan together in 2008. Questions arise about the role of phone records in the investigation, specifically regarding the timing of calls made to Medunjanin before or after their trip. Legislative proposals are being considered to limit requests for business records under the USA PATRIOT ACT. These questions could provide insight into the Zazi case and the importance of phone records in disrupting the plot. The Administration is reviewing potential changes to the Section 215 collection program, considering individualized requests to phone companies instead of bulk requests. Concerns revolve around the speed of government access to phone records not held by NSA. NSA Director General Alexander emphasizes the need for quick access in crisis situations. The government is considering individualized requests to phone companies instead of bulk requests for Section 215 collection program. Concerns about slowing down the process for identifying terrorists are raised, with questions on whether the increased time frame would have been detrimental in previous cases. Some Members of Congress are proposing legislation for greater transparency of FISC and FISCR opinions. Opinions of the courts must be provided to relevant committees within 45 days, with redactions allowed for national security reasons. Recent legislative proposals aim to increase transparency by requiring opinions related to national security to be made public or summarized in an unclassified manner. These proposals also seek to limit bulk collection of phone records by the NSA and make changes to the FISA process, such as requiring greater public disclosure of FISA court decisions."
