    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new title called \"TITLE VIII--ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS\" which introduces \"MODELING AND SIMULATION PROGRAMS\" under section 801. The purpose of this section is to promote the study of modeling and simulation at higher education institutions by establishing a task force, providing grants for new degree programs, and enhancing existing programs. The section promotes the study of modeling and simulation at higher education institutions by establishing a task force to support the field's development. This includes defining the study of modeling and simulation, identifying best practices, and supporting the creation of new degree programs. The taskforce under this subsection will identify best practices, core knowledge and skills for modeling and simulation programs, and provide recommendations to the Secretary. Membership will include representatives from institutions with modeling and simulation degree programs and the National Science Foundation. The Secretary can award grants to enhance modeling and simulation at higher education institutions, including those with programs in collaboration with the National Science Foundation, Federal Government agencies, private industries, and national modeling organizations. The Secretary can award grants to eligible institutions to enhance modeling and simulation degree programs. Grants are awarded for a 3-year period and may be extended for up to 2 years. The minimum grant amount is $750,000, and each institution must provide a non-federal share. Each eligible institution receiving a grant must provide 25% of the grant amount from non-Federal sources. The Secretary can waive this requirement based on the institution's financial ability. Eligible institutions must have an established modeling and simulation degree program. To be considered for a grant under this program, eligible institutions must submit an application demonstrating commitment to enhancing their modeling and simulation program. This includes a letter from the institution's President or provost, identification of faculty responsible for the program, and meeting requirements set by the Secretary. The grant funds awarded to eligible institutions must be used to enhance their modeling and simulation programs, which may include establishing new programs, expanding interdisciplinary activities, and improving existing programs. The institution can enhance its modeling and simulation programs by recruiting students, creating new courses, conducting research, and purchasing necessary equipment. Grants are available for institutions of higher education to establish modeling and simulation programs. The government awards grants to higher education institutions to establish modeling and simulation programs, with a minimum grant amount of $750,000 for a 3-year period, extendable for up to 2 years based on success criteria. Higher education institutions can apply for grants under this subsection for amounts less than $750,000. Recipients must provide a 25% non-federal share, which can be waived based on financial need. Applications must be submitted to the Secretary with required information. The application for grants under this subsection requires a letter of commitment from the institution's President or provost, a detailed plan for fund usage, and a description of how the program will complement existing offerings. Grant funds can be used to establish a modeling and simulation program at the institution. The grant program aims to establish modeling and simulation programs at eligible institutions by providing funding for staffing, equipment, and program development. $40,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2009, with additional funding for the following 4 years. The grant program aims to establish modeling and simulation programs at eligible institutions by providing funding for staffing, equipment, and program development. $40,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2009, with additional funding for the following 4 years. $1,000,000 is authorized for the task force activities, with 50% allocated for the grant program under subsection (c) and 50% for the grant program under subsection (d)."
