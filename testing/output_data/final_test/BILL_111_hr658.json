    "content": "The \"Access to Postal Services Act\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Modified procedures are outlined in the Act. The \"Access to Postal Services Act\" requires the Postal Service to investigate the need for closing or consolidating postal facilities and provide notice to affected individuals. Consideration of community impact is also mandated in the decision-making process. The \"Access to Postal Services Act\" mandates the Postal Service to assess the impact of closing or consolidating postal facilities on the community, employees, and government policy. Compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is not a factor in the decision-making process. The Postal Service must provide written findings after investigating a closure or consolidation, including considerations specified in the Act. Notice of the decision must be prominently displayed in affected facilities and mailed to all served individuals at least 90 days before a final determination. The notice must include a proposal to close or consolidate the facility, with a 90-day comment period provided. The Postal Service must make a final written determination on closing or consolidating a facility after considering comments received during a 90-day period. No action can be taken before a 60-day notice is posted in affected facilities and sent to all individuals served, including information on appeal rights. Section 404(d)(5) of title 39, United States Code is amended to require suspension instead of allowing it pending appeal. An exception is made for emergency suspensions or closures due to lease termination by a party other than the Postal Service. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Amends Section 404 of title 39, United States Code to define \"postal facility\" as an office, branch, station, or other facility operated by the Postal Service providing services to postal patrons, residents within the ZIP code served, patrons with post office boxes, and relevant local government officials."
