    "content": "Newspapers and journals report on global privatization efforts by governments at various levels. Privatization has supporters and critics, with the US federal government considering bills to expand or halt the movement of activities to the private sector. President George W. Bush has advocated privatizing military housing and increasing private sector involvement in social services. Additionally, he supported providing vouchers for Hurricane Katrina victims and a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The US federal government has been enacting policies regarding privatization, allowing private groups to apply for grants to provide social services previously offered by government agencies. Congress has approved bills to limit and expand the private sector's access to federal funds for governmental services. Privatization is not a recent phenomenon, as the federal government has been hiring or contracting with private firms since the founding of the Republic. Since the founding of the Republic, the federal government has utilized private firms to provide public goods and services. Privatization has been a topic of interest for Congress, with varying definitions and activities covered. The Congressional Budget Office defines privatization narrowly as involving the sale of assets and termination of federal involvement. Privatization involves the use of the private sector in providing goods or services, including financing, operations, and quality control. It is not an all-or-nothing concept but rather a matter of degrees. This definition is valuable for policymakers looking to improve service provision. Privatization involves degrees of private sector involvement in providing goods or services, including financing, operations, and quality control. It is not an all-or-nothing concept but a matter of degrees, with various ways for private sector participation. Policymakers can use this definition to address fundamental values underlying privatization decisions. The issue of privatization involves determining which components of providing goods and services should be handled by the government or the private sector. Different approaches to privatization can lead to varying levels of controversy. Privatization raises both instrumental and normative questions for policymakers, with its salience stemming from potent rationales, purported benefits, and political attractiveness. The privatization movement is rooted in free market economic theory and public choice theory, criticizing the failures of \"big government.\" Economic freedom is seen as essential for political freedom, with a focus on avoiding the concentration of power in government. The concentration of power in government poses a great danger to freedom. Free market theory argues that markets, not governments, are the most efficient means for producing goods and services. Public choice theory criticizes government bureaucracies as self-interested actors, not public servants. Public choice theory criticizes government bureaucracies as self-interested actors, striving to achieve personal desires, leading to collective organizational pathologies known as \"government failures.\" Administrative heads seek maximum funding for their divisions, resulting in inflated budgets with irrational priorities. Both free market economists and public choice theorists believe the nature of goods or services determines whether the private sector or government should produce them. Public choice theory and free market economists argue that government should only produce public goods that are non-excludable and non-rival, like national defense. For goods that do not meet these criteria, such as computers or housing for low-income individuals, private firms are considered more efficient. This perspective advocates for a minimalist government that uses private firms to produce public goods. Political and philosophical arguments have also supported privatization implicitly and explicitly. Arguments for privatization have been primarily made by conservatives and libertarians who want to reduce the size of the federal government. They argue that government is overstepping its bounds and should not be involved in certain activities, which should be left to the private sector. Some critics also see privatization as a way to decrease government size and the federal deficit by reducing the demand for public services that drive government growth. Privatization is advocated by conservatives and libertarians to reduce government size and involvement in certain activities. A powerful coalition around federal spending programs favors expansion, but privatization can reduce political pressures by involving the private sector. This shift transforms recipients into customers who prefer low-cost services. These arguments for privatization are rhetorically potent and have attracted attention. Privatization is advocated by conservatives and libertarians to reduce government size and involvement in activities. Proponents argue that privatization promotes values like freedom and efficiency, fights bureaucracy, and leads to better government. E.S. Savas claims privatization is key to limited and better government, satisfying society's needs more efficiently and equitably. Privatization is seen as a means to achieve better government and society by promoting competition and efficiency through private firms. Advocates believe that privatization can lead to improved services and economic growth by allowing entrepreneurs to enter new areas of activity. Additionally, privatization is justified as a way to enhance government performance by focusing on areas where the private sector can provide services more effectively. Privatization is advocated to improve government performance by focusing on core activities and addressing political issues such as disillusionment with federal government services. Allegations of waste and abuse have led to a search for private sector solutions. Countries worldwide have faced problems with state-operated industries, leading to corruption and inefficiencies. The search for privatization solutions stems from problems with state-operated industries, including corruption and escalating costs. Foreign experiments with privatization influenced the United States to consider government reform. Budget deficits have also driven the exploration of new revenue sources and cost reduction measures. Private sector firms have a vested interest in privatization for financial gain. Privatization can lead to significant financial benefits through purchasing government assets and winning contracts for goods and services. Examples include Occidental Petroleum's $3.65 billion purchase of Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve and the federal government's $377.5 billion annual spending on private company contracts in 2005. Business executives have advocated for privatization to improve government efficiency, with past presidents like Ronald Reagan supporting privatization efforts. Privatization has been favored by several U.S. presidents, including George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Despite being less enthusiastic than his predecessor, George H.W. Bush issued an executive order to encourage privatization. Bill Clinton and Al Gore promoted government reinvention based on private sector ideas and supported privatization of the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve. Privatization remains a topic of discussion in federal policy networks, with proponents touting it as a tool for improving government performance, while critics raise questions and criticisms. Opponents have criticized privatization as a union-busting strategy to weaken the political left and adversely affect women and minorities who tend to find jobs in the civil service. Government employees are expected to act in accordance with the fiduciary relationship with the people, as outlined in the Constitution and federal law. Privatization of bureaucratic functions may transfer governing discretion to private parties, risking accountability and public interests. The civil service was created to provide stable, committed government employees chosen on a rational basis, with protections and good compensation. Privatization could diminish agencies' expertise by replacing long-term employees with short-term contract workers. Privatization can lead to a loss of agency expertise and promote corrupt relationships between the government and private sector, as seen in the Boeing contracting scandal. The premise of privatization is that competition in the market will benefit the government. The government benefits from competition in the market for products and services, but certain conditions must be met for competitive markets to function properly. If these conditions are not met, the government may be exploited. Hiring private firms for government work can lead to management challenges and potential waste, fraud, and abuse if proper oversight is lacking. Privatization can result in cost overruns and inadequate service, leading to criticism of its effectiveness in providing better government services. For example, when a charter school company in California went out of business, parents had to quickly find new schools for their children. Critics argue that privatization is not always beneficial and can be detrimental to good government practices. Privatization involves various methods such as divestiture, contracting for goods and services, vouchers, third-party financing, grants, prize competitions, and the use of volunteers. An example is the sale of Conrail to the public in 1987. The divestiture of a governmental activity can take various forms, such as creating a private sector entity like US Investigations Service or selling assets to private firms. Examples include the privatization of Alaska Power Administration and U.S. Enrichment Corporation. The government may also give assets away or stop providing a service and allow private providers to meet public demand. The Coast Guard in Miami area stopped assisting stranded boats except in clear danger. Divestiture of government assets shifts them to private sector, governed by Federal Acquisition Regulation for acquisitions with appropriated funds. Government has historically contracted for goods out of necessity. Government agencies, like private firms, face a \"make or buy\" decision due to limited funds. The federal government has a long-standing policy against competing with the private sector for goods. While government contracting for goods is widely accepted, the actual practice has faced criticism, with private firms often accused of failing to deliver. The federal government has faced criticism for outsourcing to private firms, with instances of firms failing to deliver goods as agreed. A recent audit highlighted problems with a private firm's delivery of equipment for medical facilities in Iraq, including damaged crates and missing equipment. Outsourcing, also known as contracting out, involves engaging private firms to perform agency functions. Federal outsourcing policy is governed by the FAR and the FAIR Act of 1998, which requires agencies to produce inventories of commercial activities for competitive sourcing. OMB's Circular A-76 provides directions for outsourcing, which can offer cost-savings and flexibility for agencies. Outsourcing has a long history in the federal government, dating back to 1819 when Congress empowered the Postmaster General to contract for mail transportation services. Outsourcing in the federal government offers cost-savings and flexibility, allowing agencies to handle large demands for services. The use of private contractors, like the GSA for call-center services during emergencies, has increased the number of federal contractors to over seven million. This trend may expand to include services not previously considered for outsourcing, such as prison operations and personnel performance. The federal government outsources services to the private sector for cost-savings and flexibility. In FY2005, federal agencies issued $388 billion in contracts. Vouchers are used to fund services from private or public sources, with objectives including cost containment. Vouchers can be designed as tax credits or grants with limited per capita costs. Vouchers can have a limited per capita cost, contrasting with escalating government production costs. They can increase competition, improve service provider responsiveness, and enhance equity, such as with school vouchers for children from poor families. Vouchers are a flexible option for policymakers at all levels of government. Vouchers, such as the \"GI Bill\" for World War II veterans, have been used by policymakers at all levels of government. Quasi governmental entities, like the American National Red Cross, have a mix of private and governmental attributes. Various types of quasi governmental entities exist, including government-sponsored enterprises and congressionally chartered not-for-profit corporations. Quasi governmental entities, like the American Legion and In-Q-Tel, operate in various policy areas and are seen as a form of privatization. Policymakers are drawn to these entities due to perceived efficiency and budgetary advantages. GOCO facilities, such as Sandia National Laboratories, produce goods for government use, not private consumption. Third-party financing is a form of privatization that removes the federal government from direct financing of a project by involving the private sector. It involves creating a special purpose entity to borrow money from private capital markets for infrastructure projects. Third-party financing is utilized for infrastructure projects like housing on military bases, government buildings, and power facilities. This method allows investment costs to be spread out over the project's lifespan instead of upfront. However, the Congressional Budget Office criticizes this practice, stating it is more costly and understates the government's obligations. Grants have historically been used by the federal government to achieve public purposes, such as providing land to institutions like the Connecticut Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in 1819. The federal government provides grants for various purposes, supporting students, researchers, religious groups, artists, and small businesses. Between 1990 and 2004, an estimated 2.4 to 2.8 million individuals received grant funding annually. Federal agencies have also held prize competitions to encourage private individuals and firms to develop desired technologies. The federal government holds prize competitions to encourage private individuals and firms to develop technologies desired by the government. The most well-known example is DARPA's \"Grand Challenge\" for autonomous vehicles. DARPA offers cash prizes to competitors whose vehicles complete the race course quickly, with the government acquiring rights to the technology. This approach has led to further experimentation with prize competitions, with bills introduced in Congress for hydrogen energy and NASA prize competitions. The federal government relies on volunteers for public services, like the American National Red Cross (ANRC) chartered in 1900. ANRC has 175,000 volunteers who respond to disaster incidents and teach health and safety skills to over 15 million Americans annually. The American National Red Cross relies on volunteers to teach health and safety skills and respond to disasters. Congress has enacted acts to fund public service programs like AmeriCorps. Privatization shifts activities from the government to the private sector. Public Administration highlighted the fundamental differences between the governmental and private sectors, emphasizing the government's sovereignty and enforcement of laws. The movement of activities between sectors has significant implications, with each sector having different incentives and constraints. Government entities are limited to what the law permits, while private entities can act within the bounds of the law. Government agencies are constrained by laws and external entities, unlike private bureaucracies. They cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources based on administrator preferences, or choose their own goals. This results in management driven by external constraints rather than organizational tasks. In contrast, private sector firms prioritize profit maximization above all other goals. The private firm's goals are focused on profit maximization, which can benefit the government through more efficient production and new products. However, there is a risk if the firm reduces quality or quantity to lower costs. Government agencies operate under complex accountability hierarchies with multiple goals and are subject to federal management laws to ensure accountability to Congress, the President, and the public. Government oversight is ensured through federal management laws that hold agencies accountable to Congress, the President, and the public. These laws include the Freedom of Information Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Government in Sunshine Act, which promote public participation and government transparency. The privatization of government activities changes the nature of oversight as goods and services are shifted to the private sector. Privatization reduces federal oversight and shifts government management to contractual relationships. The ambiguity arises when private entities replace government officers in carrying out activities. This challenges the definition of governmental action versus private action as outlined in the Constitution. The legal distinction between federal government officers and other individuals is significant, as officers have different rights and liabilities. This raises questions about liability for actions of private contractors and subcontractors, especially in cases of injury or harm caused by their employees. This ambiguity challenges the definition of governmental versus private action outlined in the Constitution. The potential blurring of the difference between governmental and private actions may have ramifications for personal privacy. For example, an individual in a dispute with the IRS may receive a call from a private debt collection company with their personal information. This raises concerns about privacy and the involvement of private sector intermediaries in government matters. Similarly, individuals applying for federal jobs must provide extensive personal information to the government, which may also raise privacy concerns. The federal government uses private firms to conduct background checks on job applicants, a process known as privatization. Marketization, a management strategy to improve government agencies, is different from privatization and has various interpretations. In some contexts, marketization involves selling state-owned enterprises to private parties. Marketization refers to redesigning a government agency to operate like a private firm, aiming for efficiency by changing incentive structures. For example, the U.S. Post Office historically received government funding and congressional involvement in management and pricing decisions. In the 1960s, critics called for the privatization of the U.S. Post Office due to operational difficulties and corruption. Instead, in 1970, Congress marketized the Post Office, creating the USPS as an independent entity with the mandate to cover its costs. Since then, USPS has shown improved productivity and operations. Marketization refers to reforms that aim to change an agency's incentives to be more like those of private firms. This can include requiring agencies to cover their costs, setting up bonus programs for employees, and implementing approaches like franchising, user fees, government corporations, and competitive sourcing. Franchising in the federal government context means fee-based provision of administrative services by another agency. Franchising in the federal government involves one agency providing administrative services to another agency on a fee basis. It is a form of outsourcing where an agency markets its services to other agencies, aiming to expand in-house production of specific goods or services. For example, the National Finance Center in the Department of Agriculture provides payroll services to various agencies, following Congress's encouragement for federal experimentation with franchising in 1994. In 1994, Congress encouraged federal experimentation with franchising, leading to the Government Management Reform Act authorizing OMB to approve pilot franchise funds. Various departments and agencies have established franchises, with OMB's \"lines of business\" initiative aiming to reduce administrative expenses through common franchising activities. User fees can be charged for services provided by the government. User fees are utilized by federal agencies to raise revenues and cover costs for specific activities. Different agencies charge fees for services such as quarantine inspections, passports, and mail services. Some agencies, like the U.S. Patent and Trade Office, cover all costs through fees. Proponents argue that user fees are fairer as they make those who use government resources pay for them, and they also make agencies more customer-focused. Additionally, user fees may discourage unnecessary use of services. User fees are imposed by federal agencies to raise revenues and cover costs for specific activities. Proponents argue that fees discourage indiscriminate use of services and promote efficient resource allocation. Detractors believe government services should be free and fees may hinder access for lower-income individuals. Government corporations are established by Congress to provide market-oriented public services and generate revenues to cover their expenses. There are 18 government corporations, ranging from well-known entities like the U.S. Postal Service to lesser-known bodies like the Federal Financing Bank. Each corporation has unique exemptions from certain management laws to operate similarly to private firms. For example, the Export-Import Bank is partially exempt from federal employee classification and pay-rate restrictions. The waiver of federal employee classification and pay-rate restrictions allows the bank to offer competitive salaries to attract skilled individuals. Government corporations, unlike private corporations, are agencies of the U.S. government with a mission established by Congress and managed by U.S. officers. Congress has established government corporations for various purposes, with mixed success. Government corporations, established by Congress for various purposes, have had mixed success. The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation is well-regarded, while AMTRAK has faced deficits and criticism. Competitive sourcing involves agencies competing with outside parties, potentially leading to outsourcing and marketization. The Office of Management and Budget has advocated for the expansion of competitive sourcing in federal agencies, sparking controversies among government employees and private firms. Marketization is seen as a more incremental reform than privatization, altering incentives and constraints to make agencies behave more like private sector firms. Marketization aims to make government agencies behave more like private sector firms, but they cannot retain profits or compete. However, it may make oversight easier for government officials. The agency remains within the government sector with some operational flexibility but is subject to government management laws. This approach may prevent some of the issues that plague private firms. The contrast between Ginnie Mae, a government corporation, and Fannie Mae, a private entity with governmental responsibilities, highlights criticisms of Fannie Mae's pursuit of profits leading to undesirable behaviors such as aggressive lobbying and excessive executive compensation. Fannie Mae has faced criticism for its business growth efforts potentially affecting global financial markets and manipulating financial reporting to please investors and reward top executives. The debate over privatization raises questions about the government's role in providing goods and services. The Constitution does not specify whether governmental employees or private persons should carry out tasks like establishing Post Offices and post roads. Federal statutory law, like FAIR, requires \"government personnel\" for \"inherently governmental activities\" closely tied to the public interest. The term \"inherently governmental function\" involves activities that require discretion or value judgments by government personnel, including interpreting and executing laws to bind the United States, advancing national interests, affecting private individuals, and managing officers or employees. The term \"inherently governmental function\" involves activities that require discretion or value judgments by government personnel, including interpreting and executing laws to bind the United States, advancing national interests, affecting private individuals, and managing officers or employees. FAIR defines this term as activities that involve the exercise of sovereign authority, the power to make decisions for the United States, and ultimate control over government property. It excludes certain activities like gathering information or providing advice to government officials, and ministerial functions such as building security or housekeeping. However, there is still ambiguity surrounding this definition. The statutory guidance on \"inherently governmental functions\" is unclear, leading to debates over its application to specific activities. For example, questions arise about whether certain disaster response activities should be carried out by the Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, there is uncertainty about whether the federal government can outsource the housing of federal prisoners under this guidance. This ambiguity limits the utility of the statutory definition. The FAIR statutory guidance provides limited utility in the privatization debate, as it does not address the broader question of which activities the federal government should be involved in. Debates have arisen regarding federal involvement in various sectors such as commuter rail service, energy generation, housing loan market liquidity, long-term health insurance, and security contracting in Iraq. In recent years, debates have centered around the role of government in providing security in Iraq and other sectors. Privatization has emerged as a federal policy agenda, with private and market-style mechanisms increasingly used to fulfill government duties. Religious groups, along with secular nonprofit and for-profit providers, are involved in delivering services traditionally handled by the government. Decision makers in various fields constantly navigate between public and private, religious and secular, profit and nonprofit boundaries. Privatization involves using the private sector to provide goods or services, including financing, operations, and quality control. It differs from marketization and allows for a spectrum of privatization levels. This distinction is crucial as governmental and private entities have different strengths and weaknesses. Privatization and marketization have different strengths and weaknesses. Those uncomfortable with privatization may prefer marketization. Privatization is seen as more efficient than marketization by some. Privatization will likely continue to be a controversial idea. The debate includes the question of which activities should be directly accountable to the government."
