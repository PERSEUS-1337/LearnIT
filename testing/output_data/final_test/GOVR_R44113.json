While some countries still receive assistance for political and security challenges, others no longer receive traditional development aid but still get support for security issues like combating organized crime. Despite progress in the region, foreign aid remains important for advancing U.S. policy goals. Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean plays a crucial role in advancing U.S. policy goals. Congress oversees aid programs and examines budget priorities, with foreign assistance being a potential area for spending cuts. This report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to the region, analyzing historical trends and the Obama Administration's FY2016 request. Legislative developments on foreign aid appropriations for Latin America and the Caribbean are also examined. The United States has been a major contributor of foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, providing over $160 billion between 1946 and 2013. Assistance spiked in the 1960s with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress and increased again in the 1980s after the leftist Sandinistas assumed power in Nicaragua. Throughout the 1980s, the United States supported the Contras in Nicaragua and Central American governments fighting leftist insurgencies. Aid decreased in the mid-1990s but rose again in the late 1990s, with a focus on humanitarian and development assistance. After Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the U.S. provided aid to Central American countries. Initiatives like PEPFAR in 2003 and MCC in 2004 further increased assistance levels. The United States provided significant assistance to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and increased funding for counternarcotics and security programs in the region. Foreign aid was also given to Colombia and its neighbors to support \"Plan Colombia\" to combat drug trafficking and promote development. The M\u00e9rida Initiative in FY2008 further boosted spending on counternarcotics and security assistance. In FY2010, the U.S. announced the M\u00e9rida Initiative for Mexico and Central America, which later split into CARSI for Central America and CBSI for the Caribbean. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from FY2011 to FY2014 due to budget cuts after the global financial crisis. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased between FY2010 and FY2014, with a slight increase in FY2015. Budget constraints from the Budget Control Act of 2011 may continue to impact aid. The region has seen improvements in poverty rates and democratic governance, allowing the U.S. to focus resources in fewer countries and sectors. For example, USAID closed its mission in Panama. The USAID has transitioned out of providing support for family planning and elections administration in Latin America as many governments in the region can now finance and carry out these activities on their own. Some Latin American nations like Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay are now providing foreign aid to other countries. The United States has engaged in \"trilateral cooperation\" initiatives with these nations to jointly plan and fund development and security assistance efforts in third countries. Countries like Bolivia and Ecuador have shown less interest in working with the United States, resulting in significant reductions in U.S. assistance and the closure of USAID missions in those countries. The Obama Administration's FY2016 budget request would increase assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean for a second consecutive year, with nearly $2 billion allocated for the region. This includes over $1 billion in aid to Central America to address the root causes of migration and promote prosperity, security, and good governance. The FY2016 foreign aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on development and humanitarian assistance programs, with over $842 million allocated for these efforts. Development assistance aims to promote economic progress, social stability, democracy, economic reform, education, health, and environmental protection. The funding comes from the Development Assistance and Global Health Programs accounts, receiving $615 million and $214 million, respectively. Additionally, $13 million is requested for immediate food security through the Food for Peace account. The FY2016 foreign aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes $13 million through the Food for Peace account to address immediate food security needs. The request also includes additional funding for development efforts in Central America, with a significant portion allocated through the Economic Support Fund account to promote political and economic stability in the region. The Administration's FY2016 request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes $14 million more in ESF assistance compared to FY2015. The remaining $551 million would support security assistance programs, including counternarcotics efforts, civilian law enforcement, strengthening judicial institutions, and countering global threats like terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, funding is allocated for equipment and personnel training through FMF and IMET accounts. The Administration's FY2016 request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes an increase in ESF assistance and security funding. While INCLE aid for Central America would rise, aid for Colombia and Mexico would decrease. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America aims to promote prosperity, security, and good governance in the region. The Administration's FY2016 aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on Central America, with over $1 billion allocated to the \"northern triangle\" countries. Bilateral aid for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras would see significant increases. Nearly all of the increased aid would be provided through the DA account, with half of the aid for Central America coming from regional programs like CARSI. The FY2016 aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on Central America, with over $1 billion allocated to the \"northern triangle\" countries. Aid for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras would increase, with additional funding from regional programs like CARSI. Colombia remains the largest recipient of U.S. assistance in Latin America, with a slight decrease in funding from FY2015 to FY2016. The FY2016 aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on supporting counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts in Colombia, with a shift towards economic and social development. U.S. assistance would help eradicate coca, expand institutional presence in conflict zones, demobilize ex-combatants, carry out land restitution, implement justice sector reforms, and provide humanitarian aid. Assistance would also support a potential peace agreement to end Colombia's 50-year internal conflict. Haiti is set to receive the second-largest amount of U.S. assistance in the region under the FY2016 request, with a focus on post-earthquake recovery efforts. Meanwhile, U.S. aid to Mexico is expected to decrease significantly due to its status as an upper middle-income economy. The FY2016 request for Mexico includes $142 million in aid to combat transnational crime, reform rule of law institutions, protect human rights, strengthen border security, provide educational opportunities for at-risk youth, and support conservation and clean energy initiatives. Additionally, funding for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) would decrease, with $53.5 million allocated for community-based policing programs and police and justice sector reforms. The FY2016 funding for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) would decrease by about 10% compared to FY2015. Congress uses annual appropriations bills to review U.S. assistance and influence foreign policy. House and Senate Committees reported bills for foreign aid, but they did not receive floor consideration. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 included $32.9 billion for foreign aid, which is 2.8% higher than the Administration's FY2016 request. Funding levels for individual countries and programs are not specified in the legislation. Notably, there are differences in funding for Central America compared to the Administration's request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $750 million for the new U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, with specific amounts for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The legislation also includes $349 million for CARSI, with conditions on the funds requiring improvements in border security, corruption combat, revenue increase, and human rights actions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated funds for various countries, including $12 million more for Colombia, $8 million more for Mexico, and $4 million more for the CBSI than requested. It also sets a limit of $191 million for Haiti and requires conditions for aid to the Haitian government. The omnibus bill provides funding for democracy programs in Venezuela and environmental programs in Brazil. Congress will oversee foreign aid programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, and consider the FY2017 foreign assistance request. Questions to consider include the effectiveness of U.S. assistance programs in the region and the impact of conditions on aid recipients. The U.S. funding and conditions on assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean are key considerations for Congress. Questions include the impact of funding cuts, recipient countries taking on program responsibilities, and the success of trilateral cooperation initiatives. Other forms of engagement may be needed to advance U.S. policy priorities in the region. The U.S. government is exploring alternative forms of engagement in Latin America and the Caribbean to advance its policy priorities as relations with the region shift away from foreign assistance provision."
