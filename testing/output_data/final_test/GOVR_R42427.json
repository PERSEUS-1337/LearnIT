The decline in initial public offerings (IPOs) in the United States, especially for small companies, has raised questions about the reasons behind it and its implications for the economy and job creation. While IPOs have decreased, private stock offerings have increased. This report analyzes the factors contributing to the decline in IPOs and discusses the differences between IPOs and private stock offerings. The Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act (JOBS Act) was enacted on April 5, 2012, to boost capital formation. It describes key elements of the Act and discusses the differences between privately held and publicly held companies. While larger companies like Apple and Google are publicly held, companies like IKEA and Mars remain privately held. The JOBS Act aims to facilitate IPOs for publicly traded firms. Private stock offerings have increased significantly, surpassing public equity issuances. In 2010, private offerings grew by nearly 50% to $1.4 trillion, while public equity issuances fell by 11% to $1.133 trillion. Private stock issuances exceeded debt issuances, indicating a growing trend towards private investments. In 2010, debt issuances totaled about $851 billion, a trend that continued into the first quarter of 2011. Privately held firms conducting an IPO become publicly held, allowing them to raise equity capital for expansion. Publicly held companies must adhere to regulations like having a board of directors and filing financial disclosures with the SEC. In 2010, venture capital-backed IPOs accounted for 46 out of 142 IPOs. Privately held companies can also become publicly held through acquisition by existing publicly held firms. Some small companies opt for limited stock offerings to avoid full SEC registration and compliance costs. The SEC allows restricted stock offerings to certain sophisticated investors to help small companies raise capital while protecting retail investors. Exemptions from registration and disclosure requirements are provided for companies raising less than $5 million or selling shares to a limited number of investors. Regulation A and Regulation D are key regulations that exempt small businesses from some requirements. Regulation A and Regulation D are important for exempting small businesses from registration and disclosure requirements. Regulation A allows the SEC to exempt securities from registration if the issuance does not exceed $5 million (increased to $50 million by the JOBS Act). Regulation D provides exemptions through rules like Rule 504, allowing companies to offer up to $1 million of securities within a 12-month period. Rule 505 of Regulation D allows companies to offer up to $5 million of securities in a 12-month period to accredited investors and a limited number of other investors. Purchasers receive restricted securities that cannot be sold for six months without registration. Rule 506 permits private offerings without general solicitation or advertising, with criteria including accredited investors and knowledgeable other investors. The rise in private stock offerings has increased significantly, with a decline in public listings. From 1991 to 1997, the majority of U.S. IPOs were under $50 million, but by 2010, this number had dropped to only 18%. In 2010, over $900 billion in private securities were sold under Regulation D alone, showing a shift towards private offerings. Since 2009, there have been approximately 37,000 Regulation D offerings reported to the SEC, with a median size per offering of about $1 million. Smaller issuers are favoring private offerings over IPOs, with discounts on private corporate shares ranging from 30% to 75% due to lack of marketability or liquidity. Companies generally prefer issuing publicly traded stock through an IPO for liquidity and a \"liquidity premium.\" It has become more difficult for smaller companies to do IPOs due to various reasons. Institutional investors typically desire a public offering with a market capitalization of $500 million or more. Advantages of remaining privately held or going public through an IPO are discussed, with public companies facing market pressures for short-term results. Public companies face market pressures to prioritize short-term results over long-term growth, lose control when going public, are vulnerable to takeover attempts, and incur high costs for IPOs. They operate under closer scrutiny with extensive financial disclosure requirements, unlike private companies. Decision-making processes for public companies are more formal compared to private companies. After going public, companies tend to select less novel research projects, rely on a narrower set of technologies, and see an exodus of key inventors. Public companies can benefit from raising equity capital through IPOs to fund research, development, capital expenditure, or debt repayment. Debt-to-equity ratio often declines after an IPO, allowing for more favorable loan terms. The stock of public companies benefits from a \"liquidity premium,\" leading to better share pricing compared to privately held firms. Going public allows firms to attract new human capital and acquire external innovations through mergers and acquisitions. The 112th Congress introduced bills to address the decline in IPOs and stimulate markets for public and private stock offerings. These bills formed the basis for the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act; P.L. 112-106) was signed into law on April 5, 2012, relaxing restrictions on IPOs and regulatory obligations for emerging growth companies. It also reduces restrictions on promotional communications for private offerings and establishes higher shareholder number requirements before becoming subject to public company reporting. The JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012, provides regulatory exemptions for emerging growth companies (EGCs) until they meet certain conditions such as reaching $1 billion in annual gross revenues, becoming a large accelerated filer, reaching the fifth anniversary of their IPO, or issuing more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt within the previous three years. These exemptions amend provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The JOBS Act, effective since April 5, 2012, provides exemptions for emerging growth companies (EGCs) from certain regulatory requirements, including Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. EGCs are also exempt from future rules of the PCAOB that may mandate audit firm rotation. Mandatory auditor rotation is debated for its potential impact on auditor independence. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies (EGCs) are exempt from certain regulatory requirements, including Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. EGCs are also not required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are subject to them. Compliance with new accounting standards must be uniform if chosen by an EGC. The JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies (EGCs) from certain Dodd-Frank Act requirements, including \"Say on Pay\" provisions, Executive-Worker Pay Ratio disclosure, and Executive Pay-for-Performance Compensation disclosure. EGCs are also exempt from disclosing the ratio of median employee compensation to CEO compensation and information on executive compensation relationships. The JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies (EGCs) from certain Dodd-Frank Act requirements, including \"Say on Pay\" provisions and disclosure of executive compensation relationships. EGCs can file IPO registration statements confidentially and meet with potential investors before offering, avoiding communication restrictions. Under the JOBS Act, restrictions on broker-dealer research reports as selling tools in registered stock offerings do not apply to EGCs. Concerns have been raised that restrictions on securities analysts interacting with colleagues involved in promoting an IPO have led to reduced coverage of small and medium sized IPOs. The JOBS Act prohibits the SEC or a national securities association from adopting rules that restrict interactions between securities research analysts and potential investors or management of an EGC during an IPO. This aims to address concerns about reduced coverage of small and medium-sized IPOs. As part of the JOBS Act provisions, FINRA is required to rescind rules restricting research analysts from attending meetings with EGCs during IPOs. Decimalization in 2000 mandated smaller stock trading increments, leading to reduced profits for broker-dealers and diminished trading interest in small and medium capitalized companies. The JOBS Act directed the SEC to study the impact of decimalization on small- and medium-capitalized companies' liquidity and consider minimum stock trading increments of up to 10 cents on domestic exchanges. The SEC staff study released in July 2012 found it challenging to quantify how decimalization may have hindered capital formation. The report advised against increasing tick sizes for EGCs but recommended soliciting views of stakeholders. EGCs can communicate with qualified institutional buyers to gauge interest in securities offerings. By June 2012, after the EGC provisions went into effect, media sources reported that most companies opting for EGC status were small biotech, technology, retail, and energy companies. 17 companies were blank-check companies or SPACs, described as \"empty shells\" used for mergers or gaining a listing on a domestic exchange. The JOBS Act requires the SEC to analyze and simplify registration requirements under Regulation S-K for companies going through the IPO process. The JOBS Act directs the agency to review and modernize regulations by October 2, 2012. Rule 506 and Rule 144a relax general solicitation limits for securities offerings. Rule 506 allows offerings to accredited investors without registration. The JOBS Act directs the SEC to amend Rule 506 to allow general solicitation when all purchasers are accredited investors. Issuers must verify purchaser accreditation. This is a significant change as current Rule 506 issuers do not have this requirement. The JOBS Act requires the SEC to revise Rule 144A, allowing for general solicitations and advertising in securities offerings and resales. The SEC proposed a rule on August 29, 2012, to eliminate the prohibition against general solicitation in Rule 506 and Rule 144A offerings. The SEC proposed a rule to allow general solicitation and advertising in securities offerings under Rule 506 and Rule 144A of the Securities Act. Companies would need to take reasonable steps to determine if investors are accredited. The SEC's proposed amendment of Rule 144A recommends changes to securities offerings. The SEC proposed amendments to Rule 144A to allow securities offerings to be solicited to any entities but only sold to qualified institutional buyers. SEC Chair Schapiro highlighted the need to reevaluate communication restrictions in private offerings and reduce regulatory constraints on capital formation while ensuring investor protections. SEC Chair Schapiro expressed concerns about lifting the ban on general solicitation, noting the need for investor protections. The decision to initially propose rules instead of formal rules was supported by Senator Carl Levin. The SEC Chairman expressed concerns about lifting the ban on general solicitation, emphasizing the importance of investor protections. In contrast, Representative Patrick McHenry criticized the SEC's decision to issue proposed rules instead of interim final rules, delaying the finalization of the rule. Chairman McHenry requested documents from SEC Chair Schapiro regarding communications and documents related to the rulemaking. Chair Schapiro expressed her views on the proposed rules, emphasizing the balance between allowing issuers to attract capital and ensuring investor protection. She acknowledged concerns about the potential impact of lifting the ban on general solicitation. Some concerns were raised in letters submitted during the pre-rulemaking JOBS Act comment process regarding Rule 506 offerings and Regulation D reforms. Critics find the accredited investor verification proposal ambiguous, suggesting it complicates the process by requiring different information from investors based on their type, despite the law defining only one type of accredited investor. The new proposed regulation for accredited investor verification under Rule 506 offerings and Regulation D reforms has raised concerns for its ambiguity and lack of investor confidence. Senator Carl Levin criticized the SEC for undermining investor protections and putting investments at risk. The proposed rule would require different information from investors based on their type, creating uncertainty in the markets. The SEC's proposed rule for accredited investor verification and Regulation D reforms has been criticized for undermining investor protections and risking investments. SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar expressed concerns about the rule's failure to address increased investor vulnerability and lack of minimum advertising standards. Crowdfunding involves collective financing through pooled resources on the internet, often for disaster relief, political campaigns, or investments. Current SEC regulations limit advertising for non-registered offerings and cap shareholders at 500, hindering crowdfunding. The JOBS Act restricts companies to raising $1 million annually through crowdfunding, with limits on individual investments. The JOBS Act restricts companies to raising up to $1 million annually through crowdfunding. Individual investment limits are based on income and wealth, with a maximum of $100,000 over a 12-month period for investors making more than $100,000 annually. Crowdfunding investments must be made through registered intermediaries known as funding portals or broker-dealers. The JOBS Act restricts companies to raising up to $1 million annually through crowdfunding, with individual investment limits based on income and wealth. Investors must review education information and be aware of the risks. Corporate issuers need to file a \"mini-prospectus\" with the SEC. The SEC is required to issue rules for crowdfunding provisions by December 31, 2012. Perspectives on crowdfunding vary, with some seeing it as a way to expand small business access to capital and others concerned about potential investor fraud. The JOBS Act aims to enhance access to capital through crowdfunding by reversing securities laws that limited investment opportunities for ordinary people. Small and mid-size startups stand to benefit the most from this new pool of capital. However, the North American Securities Administrators Association raises concerns about investor protection implications. The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) warns that the JOBS Act provisions related to crowdfunding will not be available until 2013. These provisions will not make investments in small businesses less risky, just more prevalent. Fraud is still a common feature of Internet securities activity, and the JOBS Act-triggered activity is likely to increase investigations and enforcement actions. Investors should be cautious as small startups are among the riskiest investment categories. The crowdfunding and Internet investing marketplaces in North America will undergo major changes in the next year. Marketplaces in North America are set to undergo significant changes in the next year, with investors advised to monitor the emerging capital formation community closely. The Regulation A Exemption, a key SEC regulation, allows for exemptions for small businesses from certain registration and disclosure requirements. This exemption permits the SEC to exempt securities from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 if the issuance does not exceed $5 million in a 12-month period. The JOBS Act has increased the offering ceiling under this exemption. The JOBS Act increases the offering ceiling under Regulation A to $50 million annually, with no deadline for SEC rulemaking. Regulation A offerings cleared by the SEC have decreased significantly since the late 1990s. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Spencer Bachus believes amending Regulation A will allow small companies to access capital, leading to economic growth and more jobs. The JOBS Act increases the offering ceiling under Regulation A to $50 million annually, with no deadline for SEC rulemaking. Regulation A offerings cleared by the SEC have decreased significantly since the late 1990s. By reducing the regulatory burden and expense of raising capital from the investing public, Regulation A could become the dominant avenue for small and medium-size businesses to form capital. The financial markets are expected to develop a robust secondary market for these securities. The JOBS Act increases the offering ceiling under Regulation A to $50 million annually, attracting more small businesses to seek exemption. This higher ceiling could appeal to businesses finding the previous $5 million limit too low. It also provides a way for small businesses to enter the securities market without registering with the SEC. The increased ceiling may also boost underwriters' interest in Regulation A for larger offerings. Under the JOBS Act, the $50 million ceiling for Regulation A offerings may attract more small businesses. However, state blue sky laws could still deter small businesses due to costly and time-consuming securities registration requirements. Researching individual state laws and registering with multiple states increases legal and accounting costs for Regulation A offerings, despite the higher ceiling. Transaction costs like attorney fees and accounting costs may also be impacted by the increased ceiling. The JOBS Act raises the threshold for private companies to register securities with the SEC from 500 to either 2,000 or 500 non-accredited investors. This change aims to reduce transaction costs like attorney fees and accounting costs for Regulation A offerings. The \"shareholder trigger\" under Section 12(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been debated recently, with some arguing that raising the threshold would help firms find alternative financing options beyond venture capital. Google mentioned that this requirement accelerated their decision to go public. The JOBS Act raises the threshold for triggering mandatory registration under the Exchange Act for banks and bank holding companies to 2,000 holders of record, allowing firms to find alternative financing options beyond venture capital and avoid premature IPOs. SEC staff is examining the effectiveness of current 12(g) thresholds for implementing securities laws' registration and reporting requirements. The JOBS Act raises the threshold for mandatory registration under the Exchange Act for banks and bank holding companies to 2,000 holders of record, allowing firms to explore alternative financing options and avoid premature IPOs. The SEC is required to implement these changes by April 4, 2013. There has been a decline in IPOs in the US since 2000, prompting legislative reforms to address the perceived erosion of domestic capital markets. The decline in IPOs in the US since 2000 has raised concerns about the erosion of domestic capital markets, especially for small- and medium-sized firms. A study found that from 1980 to 2000, there were 311 IPOs per year on average, but since 2000, only 102 firms per year have gone public. This drop in IPOs is even more significant when considering economic growth. The data from Figure 1 and Figure 2, collected by the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP using SEC data, shows a significant drop in IPOs. Other studies confirm this trend, with companies waiting longer to go public. While most research indicates a decline in U.S. IPOs, there are differing views on the overall state of public stock markets. Research suggests a significant decline in the numbers of IPOs and market share of IPOs for small companies in U.S. public stock markets. Small companies have seen a drop in the average volume of their IPOs from 165 per year before 2000 to 72 per year from 2001 to 2009. This issue is addressed in several capital markets bills in Congress. Since 1998, smaller IPOs in the U.S. have decreased from constituting 80% of yearly IPOs to around 20%. Foreign stock exchanges like the UK's AIM have attracted smaller firms due to lower costs. Firms in countries with weaker governance are less likely to go public in their home country and more likely to list globally. This trend may increase U.S. listings by companies from certain foreign countries, such as former state-owned Chinese firms. Former state-owned Chinese firms have become a significant portion of global and U.S. IPOs in recent years. The market share of U.S. IPOs by foreign companies has increased, with Chinese companies accounting for a notable percentage. Concerns about foreign companies leaving the U.S. are not well-supported, but the domestic IPO market has not kept pace with global economic growth. The 2011 study by Doidge et. al. revealed a decline in the U.S. share of global IPOs from 27% to 12% since 2000, despite the country's GDP share remaining at 30%. This decrease is attributed to lower U.S. IPO activity by domestic firms and the rise of IPOs in other countries, especially in emerging markets. Germany and France also experienced a significant drop in their IPO volumes. The decline in IPO volumes in Germany and France from 2002 to 2007, despite increased average IPO proceeds, suggests a trend of losing smaller IPO deals in developed countries. However, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Australia have seen an increase in IPOs, with slight increases in the United Kingdom and Italy. The decrease in the U.S. share of global IPOs raises questions about its implications for the economy and job creation, as well as the causes of this decline and the effectiveness of legislative measures like the JOBS Act. Finance supporters argue that improving companies' ability to do public and restricted stock offerings will benefit the nation through job creation. A report by the IPO Task Force in 2011 suggested that the slowdown in IPOs may have prevented the creation of 22 million jobs. It has become more difficult and expensive to conduct an IPO in recent years, leading many companies to opt for acquisition instead. Some argue that the decline in IPOs has led to companies choosing acquisition over going public, potentially impacting job creation. IPO researcher Richard Ritter criticized the estimate of 22 million jobs not created as unfounded. A study by the Kauffman Foundation highlighted the importance of new firms in job creation since 1980. The study did not directly address whether the way a young company raised capital affected employment growth. It did not conclude that going public or being acquired led to more job creation. Instead, it suggested that job creation in larger companies may come from their relationship with younger firms. Another study emphasized the significant contribution of startups to job creation but did not explore the impact of financing or growth methods on job creation. The decline in U.S. IPOs is attributed to regulatory factors and market infrastructure developments. Some believe that rolling back regulatory impediments would nurture corporate offerings. Several de-regulatory perspectives are being considered in Congress to stimulate IPOs. After the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, small cap firms were initially exempt from certain regulatory requirements until 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act later impacted these exemptions. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 exempted public companies with less than $75 million in market capitalization from Section 404(b) compliance. Advocates argue that expanding this exemption would benefit medium-sized companies with $75 million or more in market capitalization. However, a 2011 SEC staff study recommended against expanding the exemption to firms with up to $250 million in market capitalization, citing declining costs of compliance with SOX 404(b). The SEC found that costs of SOX 404(b) have decreased, investors see auditor attestation as beneficial, ICFR assessments improve financial reporting reliability, and no evidence links section requirements to listing decisions. The JOBS Act exempts EGCs from auditor attestation. Key laws for public companies are the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Some argue that costly registration and disclosure requirements hinder small and medium-sized businesses from going public. The JOBS Act broadens exemptions for EGCs, allowing them to raise up to $50 million annually without full registration. EGCs can provide audited financial statements for two years instead of three and opt out of new accounting standards. Rule 144A provides an exemption from registration for certain securities offerings. The SEC amended Rule 144 in the late 1990s, reducing the holding period for reselling private offering securities to one year. This change has made private offerings more attractive compared to IPOs, leading to an increase in private placements under Regulation D. The JOBS Act does not alter the Rule 144A holding period. The SEC amended Rule 144 in the late 1990s, reducing the holding period for reselling private offering securities to one year, making private offerings more attractive. The JOBS Act does not change the Rule 144A holding period. Participants at a SEC forum called for federal preemption of state securities filings for small offerings below the Regulation A exemption threshold. The JOBS Act preempts state securities registration laws for small offerings subject to crowdfunding restrictions. The JOBS Act preempts state securities registration laws for small offerings subject to crowdfunding restrictions, allowing federal regulators to oversee such offerings. The Act does not address factors contributing to the decline in U.S. IPOs, such as changes in market infrastructure and costs incurred through underwriting. Direct costs for small companies undertaking an IPO in the United States include fees to underwriters, lawyers, and accountants, totaling around 7% to underwriters and 3% to other advisors. Indirect costs also arise from underpricing shares in IPOs, with average first-day gains of 5.1% on the NYSE and 6.6% on the NASDAQ. Initial shareholders benefit from this underpricing, rather than the company listing the shares. The study compared first day IPO price gains in the UK's markets, with the AIM rising 11.2% and the main market rising 4.4%. Underwriting costs in the US are higher compared to other exchanges, with fees on the NYSE at 6.5% and NASDAQ at 7.0%. Despite US securities laws not mandating the use of underwriters, it has become standard practice for firms to do so, as investors rely on their reputation and due diligence. Some firms are turning to \"direct public offerings\" (DPOs) as an alternative to using established underwriters for IPOs. DPOs involve marketing shares directly to customers, employees, and others, and are generally less expensive than traditional underwritten offerings. Observers suggest regulatory changes to make DPOs more attractive for small firms. A DPO is a method for companies to raise capital by selling stock directly to investors, bypassing traditional underwriters like investment banks. Instead, companies may use \"cyber middlemen\" for services such as preparing registration documents and marketing programs. While DPOs can reduce costs, many offerings do not succeed. This method is considered within SEC rules if the company registers the securities with the SEC. Some argue that the securities market infrastructure has become less favorable for small cap private companies interested in public offerings due to various impediments, including lower trading fees, SEC order-handling rules, and decimalization of traded securities. These developments have reduced securities firms' profits and impacted the viability of their business model. The SEC's order-handling rules have negatively impacted the viability of a business model that provided research and underwriting for small businesses interested in going public. This has led to a decline in securities firms' interest in underwriting small businesses and providing research coverage. The rules require market makers to display customer limit orders to the entire marketplace if the order is better than the current best buy or sell price, affecting small IPOs. The Global Research Settlement in 2003 addressed conflicts of interest between research analysts and investment bankers at major firms like Bear Stearns, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and J.P. Morgan Chase. This regulatory change aimed to reduce underwriting costs and conflicts detrimental to investors. The 2003 Global Research Settlement established firewalls between analysts and investment bankers at major firms. This reform impacted the business models of other securities firms, leading to a decline in underwriting and research coverage for small public companies. Some experts question the effectiveness of the settlement. Some experts at the University of Florida have questioned the impact of the 2003 Global Settlement on small IPO growth. Ritter et al found little change in analyst coverage post-IPOs. Professor Jay Ritter and co-authors argue that the IPO market has shifted due to economic changes, leading to more acquisitions of small firms by larger ones. The decline in U.S. IPOs, especially for smaller firms, has raised concerns about its impact on job creation. Corporate strategies favoring acquisitions by larger firms over going public are seen as a significant factor in this trend. Regulatory reforms may have limited impact on increasing IPO volume to previous levels seen in the 1980s and 1990s. The decline in U.S. IPOs, especially for smaller firms, has raised concerns about its impact on job creation. Studies show that younger firms are crucial for job creation, but the form of growth financing, such as through acquisitions or IPOs, and the rise in private stock offerings under Regulation D, have unclear implications for the economy and job creation. Going public can benefit a company by improving share pricing, capital-raising ease, debt-to-equity ratio, and attracting new human capital. Some research suggests that going public can attract new human capital and facilitate advantageous corporate acquisitions. However, public companies may face pressure to prioritize short-term earnings over long-term growth and tend to choose less innovative research projects. The JOBS Act aimed to streamline public and private share offerings by relaxing IPO and private offering requirements, raising concerns about investor protections voiced by the SEC chair and commissioner. The Securities Act of 1933 requires securities to be registered with the SEC before being offered to the public. Registration includes a prospectus for purchasers and supplemental information for public inspection. Section 7 outlines the information needed in the registration statement. The Securities Act of 1933 outlines the information required in the registration statement and prospectus for securities offerings. The SEC issues regulations detailing the registration process, including exemptions for certain transactions such as private placements and intrastate offerings. Securities exempted from registration include government securities and short-term commercial paper. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires issuers with securities traded on a national exchange or exceeding $1 million in assets to register with the SEC. Registered companies must file periodic reports, including detailed statements upon registration (Section 12) and annual/quarterly reports (Section 13). Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act mandates registered companies to submit annual and quarterly reports to the SEC, containing all material information necessary for investors. The SEC has specific regulations outlining the required information in these reports. Some exemptions exist for certain types of securities. Failure to disclose material information is legally actionable under Section 18(a) of the Act. Section 18(a) of the Securities Exchange Act provides a private right of action for investors harmed by material misstatements or omissions in SEC filings. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 offer a cause of action for injuries resulting from misrepresentations or manipulations of material facts in statements not filed with the SEC."
