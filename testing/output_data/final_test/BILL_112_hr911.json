VOLUNTARY INCENTIVE AUCTION REVENUE SHARING. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include voluntary incentive auction revenue sharing provisions. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include provisions for voluntary incentive auction revenue sharing, allowing licensees to relinquish spectrum usage rights for new licenses or unlicensed use, with proceeds shared through a competitive bidding system determined by the Commission. The Commission will deposit in the Treasury any proceeds not shared with a licensee who voluntarily relinquishes licensed spectrum usage rights. The Commission may treat a deposit as proceeds if a bidder in a competitive bidding system voluntarily relinquishes spectrum usage rights. The Commission's authority to auction such rights is contingent on completing a broadband spectrum inventory. The Federal Communications Commission must establish rules for voluntary incentive auction revenue sharing within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. This is in accordance with the Communications Act of 1934. The Federal Communications Commission is prohibited from reclaiming frequencies of broadcast television licensees or any other licensees on an involuntary basis under certain sections of the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC's auction authority under the Communications Act of 1934 is extended from 2012 to 2020."
