The \"Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2000\" highlights Congress's findings on the backlog in naturalization adjudications and long processing times for immigration benefits. Applicants are facing delays of up to 3 to 4 years in obtaining visas or lawful permanent resident status. In California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Oregon, and Arizona, residents face significant delays in processing adjustment of status applications, ranging from 26 to 69 months. Applicants pay increasing fees for adjudication without a corresponding improvement in processing efficiency. Timely processing is crucial, with each 12-month delay being critical. The delays in processing adjustment of status applications have negative impacts on families, businesses, and employers in the United States. These delays hinder the reunification of spouses and minor children, limit the participation of law-abiding community members, and force employers to send skilled employees out of the country due to petition approval delays. The purpose of this Act is to provide mechanisms to eliminate the backlog in processing immigration benefit applications within 1 year and ensure regular congressional oversight. Congress believes applications should be processed within 180 days. The Act aims to eliminate the backlog in processing immigration applications within 1 year, with applications ideally processed within 180 days. Nonimmigrant visa petitions should be processed within 30 days of filing. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
