    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local School Board Governance and Flexibility Act\". The Congress expresses its sense. The Congress expresses its sense that education responsibility lies with the States and local school boards should have the power to make decisions for neighborhood schools. Local school boards are accountable to represent various interests in the community. The national interest in local self-governance of educational agencies has been weakened by unnecessary Department of Education requirements. The Secretary of Education should only issue regulations, rules, and guidance materials that are necessary to implement Federal legislation and feasible for local educational agencies to implement, in order to support their decision-making function. The Secretary has the authority to issue regulations, rules, and guidance materials necessary for implementing Federal legislation and feasible for local educational agencies to implement. The Secretary cannot issue federal regulations, rules, or requirements that conflict with the authority of local educational agencies regarding school operations, including budget, curriculum, safety, transportation, and other essential functions. The Secretary cannot issue federal regulations that conflict with the authority of local educational agencies to determine community engagement or governance structures. The text chunk discusses the establishment of reporting requirements for State educational agencies or local educational agencies, including the governance and management of schools. It also mentions the need for fiscal impact statements related to costs. The text chunk outlines conditions or requirements on grants to educational agencies that are not directly related to the grant's purpose or supporting legislation. SEC. 4. OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT REGARDING LOCAL IMPACT. During each fiscal year, the Secretary of Education must allow local educational agencies and national education organizations 60 days to provide written comments on the local impact of implementing Federal regulations. The Secretary will then prepare and publish a report based on these comments for relevant congressional committees. The Secretary of Education must submit an annual report to the Senate Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee by July 1 each year, which will also be posted on the Department of Education's website. SEC. 5. EFFICIENCY IN IMPLEMENTING FEDERAL PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Education must review and eliminate reporting duplications within 180 days of this Act. The Secretary is prohibited from issuing any regulations or requirements without first consulting State and local educational agencies. The Department of Education must consult with various education stakeholders on the costs of implementing regulations and ensure that local agencies have the necessary resources and assistance for successful implementation. Federal assistance is available to provide State and local educational agencies with notice before issuing any regulation, rule, or guidance material, ensuring flexibility in implementation. If an organization disagrees with a regulation or requirement, they can submit a statement to the Secretary of Education. The Secretary will review the statement, respond within 60 days, and post the response on the Department of Education's website. The Secretary may take action to correct any identified deficiencies."
