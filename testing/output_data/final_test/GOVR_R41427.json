    "content": "The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act in response to the financial crisis of 2008. The crisis was triggered by the collapse of asset-backed securities, particularly those linked to subprime mortgages, leading to a housing market crash. The Federal Reserve intervened to restore liquidity, but losses persisted, causing financial firms to write down capital and face liquidity issues. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase or insure up to $700 billion in troubled assets owned by financial firms to restore confidence in counterparties. This authority expired on October 3, 2010, aiming to address the loss in liquidity and uncertainty in financial markets caused by the financial crisis. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, known as EESA, granted the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to purchase troubled assets and restore confidence in financial institutions. EESA included oversight mechanisms, reporting requirements, and was later amended to reduce the authorized amount to $475 billion. The Treasury quickly implemented the TARP Capital Purchase Program in response to EESA. After the enactment of EESA, the TARP Capital Purchase Program was announced on October 14, 2008, along with other programs. The programs included Bank Support, Credit Market, Other Investment, and Housing Programs. The Capital Purchase Program (CPP) bought preferred shares in banks to add capital and help them overcome toxic assets. The program is now closed with $1.1 billion outstanding, $4.9 billion written off, and $26.95 billion in income received. The Targeted Investment Program (TIP) and Asset Guarantee Program (AGP) provided exceptional assistance to Citigroup and Bank of America, with $40 billion and $5 billion in disbursed funds respectively. The Community Development Capital Initiative (CDCI) offered lower dividend rates on preferred share purchases for banks targeting underserved communities. The programs are now closed, with $4.4 billion, $3.4 billion, and $0.57 billion in income received from TIP, AGP, and CDCI respectively. CDCI is closed with no additional disbursements possible. Of the $0.57 billion disbursed, $0.47 billion is still outstanding, $0.01 billion has been written off, and $0.04 in income has been received. The Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP) provided funds and guarantees for purchases of mortgage-related securities from bank balance sheets. The program is closed with all $18.6 billion in disbursed funds repaid and $3.85 billion in income received. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) supported the asset-backed security market with $0.1 billion in funds disbursed for expenses. In January 2013, TARP commitment was canceled as earnings from TALF program were deemed sufficient to cover future losses. $0.1 billion disbursement was repaid, with $0.59 billion income received by Treasury. The Section 7(a) Securities Purchase Program supported SBA's loan program, with $0.36 billion repaid out of $0.37 billion disbursed funds. AIG Assistance program supplemented assistance to AIG, with final restructuring completed. The government provided assistance to AIG and the automobile industry. AIG received $67.84 billion in aid, with the government owning 92% of AIG's common equity. The Treasury sold its equity by December 2012, recognizing $13.5 billion in losses and $0.96 billion in income. The automobile industry support program led to government ownership of GM (60.8%), GMAC/Ally Financial (74%), and Chrysler (9.9%). Ownership stakes were sold between December 2010 and December 2012. The ownership stakes in GM, Chrysler, and GMAC/Ally Financial were sold to various entities between December 2010 and December 2013. The current outstanding support to the auto industry is $2.1 billion out of $79.7 billion disbursed, with recognized losses of $15.9 billion and income of $7.0 billion. No new disbursements are possible under the current program. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) remains open with $29.8 billion available for mortgage modifications. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) offers aid to homeowners by modifying mortgages to reduce financial burdens. A total of $29.8 billion is available for disbursements, with $8.8 billion already disbursed. The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) provides assistance to state housing finance agency programs in states with high unemployment rates or steep declines in home prices. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia participate in HHF, with $4.2 billion disbursed out of a possible $7.6 billion. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Short Refinance program promotes refinancing for \"underwater\" properties, with $0.06 billion disbursed out of a possible $1.0 billion. The TARP program had the authority to purchase or insure various financial assets, with legal contracts still in force even though the authority has expired. TARP funds may still be disbursed in the future, especially in housing support programs. The total assets held or insured under TARP were capped at $700 billion, but the actual net cost was never likely to reach that amount. Unlike typical government programs, TARP funds were used in ways that resulted in the government holding assets or generating income. The TARP program resulted in the government holding assets or generating income through various forms of incoming receipts, including funds from asset sales, loan repayments, premium payments, dividends, and proceeds from warrants. Legislation was introduced but not enacted to ensure that these revenues are used to reduce the public debt. EESA requirements were introduced in the 112th Congress but not enacted. Table 3 summarizes outstanding TARP funds, most of which are in assets like common stock. Recipients are not obligated to repay these funds; instead, Treasury is expected to sell the assets to recoup the disbursed funds. Losses occur when asset sales are insufficient or recipients fail to repay. It is important to consider the overall cost to the government of TARP or similar programs. When evaluating the total cost of programs like TARP, it is crucial to consider the time difference between fund allocation and income receipt. Economists use present value calculations with discount rates to compare dollar values over time. The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office adjust their estimates using current market borrowing rates, which can increase the calculated cost of investments. The cost estimates for TARP have significantly decreased over time, with the latest estimate at $21 billion. Bank support programs and credit market support programs have been profitable for the government, while losses primarily come from support for AIG, automakers, and housing. The differences in cost estimates between the CBO and OMB are mainly in the housing support programs. The CBO estimates for TARP are sensitive to financial markets and the economy, with the ultimate cost depending on recouping value from financial assets. Bank support programs have been profitable, but automaker support may not recoup TARP funds. Congress has oversight mechanisms in place. In addition to oversight mechanisms, Congress directly oversees TARP through committee hearings. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform created a subcommittee focused on TARP during the 112th and 113th Congresses. Government ownership of common equity was not a general goal of EESA, but compensation for assistance under TARP has resulted in government holdings of common stock. The government's ownership of common stock in companies as a result of TARP assistance has not led to significant control over these companies. Common equity was accepted to strengthen companies' capital positions, with potential financial gains for taxpayers if firms recover strongly. Outstanding loans converted to common equity no longer need to be repaid directly. For example, Citigroup's conversion of $25 billion in preferred shares to common shares resulted in a positive outcome for the government, with approximately $6.85 billion in capital gains. The government realized significant gains and losses from its ownership of equity in various companies through TARP assistance. While there were capital gains of approximately $6.85 billion from Citigroup's conversion of preferred shares to common shares, there were also substantial losses from Chrysler, GM, and AIG equity holdings. Despite these losses, the government recouped funds through dividends and interest payments. Treasury has realized $1.82 billion in losses from GMAC/Ally Financial equity holdings, with some equity yet to be sold. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently changed U.S. financial regulations, including amendments to EESA. Section 1302 of Dodd-Frank reduced the authorization to purchase from $700 billion to $475 billion, removed the authority to reuse TARP funds, and limited authorities to programs initiated before June 25, 2010. Treasury planned to spend $537 billion on programs as of June 30, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act reduced TARP authorization to $475 billion, leading Treasury to adjust planned program allocations. Treasury had committed $491 billion under contracts, disbursing $385 billion. The Act resulted in a decrease in direct spending of $11 billion in 2010. Treasury's authority to change program allocations was limited to the difference between plans and signed contracts, around $21 billion as of July 31, 2010. Under the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), $125 billion in capital was immediately provided to the nine largest banks, with an additional $125 billion reserved for smaller banks. The capital was in the form of preferred share purchases by TARP, with contracts preventing banks from exiting the program for three years. By the end of 2008, 214 banks participated with $172.5 billion in share purchases outstanding. The Obama Administration and Congress made changes to the CPP, amending EESA and placing additional restrictions on participating banks. The EESA was amended to add restrictions on banks in the CPP program, allowing for early repayment without penalty. Many banks repaid TARP funds due to stricter executive compensation rules. By December 31, 2010, $167.93 billion of $204.9 billion had been repaid. The new Administration conducted stress tests on large banks to assess their capital levels, a requirement for TARP repayment. Large firms had the option to raise additional capital privately or from the government through a new Capital Assistance Program to meet stress test requirements. GMAC received funding through the Automotive Industry Financing Program, while Citigroup converted its TARP preferred shares into common equity. CPP profits come from dividend payments, warrants, and capital gains. The CPP program generates profits from dividend payments, warrants, and capital gains. Treasury uses complex option pricing models to price warrants, allowing institutions to purchase them directly upon repayment of preferred shares. Critics suggest auctioning warrants on the open market for transparency. The CPP program generates profits from dividend payments, warrants, and capital gains. Treasury uses option pricing models to price warrants, allowing institutions to purchase them directly. Open auctions are used when an agreement cannot be reached. CPP earns income from dividends at a rate of 5% for the first five years and 9% thereafter. Realized losses on CPP preferred shares have been relatively small, with $4.9 billion in write-offs and losses reported as of August 15, 2014. The majority of losses were due to the failure of CIT Group. The Community Development Capital Initiative (CDCI) purchased preferred shares from financial institutions serving low-income communities and small businesses. Treasury bought shares up to 5% of risk-weighted assets for banks and thrifts, or 3.5% of total assets for credit unions. The shares pay a 2% initial dividend rate, increasing to 9% after eight years. Unlike the CPP, no warrants were included, and purchases were completed in September 2010 with $210 million new shares bought and $360 million converted from CPP shares. The Targeted Investment Program (TIP) and Asset Guarantee Program (AGP) were used to aid Citigroup and Bank of America, in addition to CPP funds. Citigroup received $20 billion in preferred shares through TIP and a government guarantee for $301 billion in assets through AGP. On January 16, 2009, Citigroup received a government guarantee through the AGP, FDIC, and Federal Reserve. They paid a fee of $4 billion in trust preferred securities and Treasury received warrants. On February 27, 2009, $25 billion of TARP CPP investment was converted into Citigroup common stock, increasing the government's ownership to 33.6%. This conversion improved capital ratios for Citigroup but worsened the government's priority on assets in case of liquidation. In December 2009, Citigroup and Treasury agreed to repay $20 billion in preferred securities and cancel the asset guarantee. Treasury also canceled $1.8 billion of the $4 billion trust preferred securities. Citigroup repurchased the outstanding AGP trust preferred securities in September 2009. No losses were claimed or federal funds paid out during the asset guarantee period. Treasury began selling its common share holdings in April 2010. In April 2010, Treasury started selling its common share holdings in Citigroup, with a total of 4.1 million shares sold by September 2010. The average sales price was $4.14 per share, resulting in a gain of approximately $12.1 billion from the Citigroup intervention. Bank of America received exceptional assistance from the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC in 2009, including $20 billion in preferred shares through the TARP Targeted Investment Program and a joint guarantee on up to $118 billion of assets. Bank of America received $20 billion in preferred shares through the TARP Targeted Investment Program in 2009. The bank negotiated a $425 million termination fee to withdraw from the Asset Guarantee Program, canceling warrants and preferred shares. Treasury announced Bank of America repurchased $45 billion in preferred stock previously purchased under TARP. Warrants issued under the CPP and TIP were sold at auction for $1.6 billion in March 2010. No government assistance remains outstanding for Bank of America. The Public Private Investment Program (PPIP) was announced by the Treasury on March 23, 2009, as part of the Credit Market Programs. It aimed to leverage private funds with government funds to remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets. The program consisted of two asset purchase programs where TARP resources were used as equity to acquire troubled loans and securities, with profits or losses shared between the government and private investors. Private investors had control over asset selection and fund management. The PPIP Legacy Securities Program aimed to manage funds and assets, but only a fraction of the envisioned $1 trillion was committed. Private fund managers raised capital to participate in the program, receiving matching Treasury funds and loans. The Treasury had the discretion to allow matching loans for funds raised, totaling $400 for investment in non-agency MBS. Nine funds were prequalified by Treasury in June 2009, but by March 31, 2013, $18.6 billion of disbursed funds had been returned. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is a Fed program to assist the asset-backed security market, with TARP acting as a backstop in case of any losses. The TALF program was designed to assist the asset-backed security market, with TARP as a backstop for any losses. Initially, $4.0 billion was allocated from TARP, but only $0.1 billion was disbursed. The TARP commitment was reduced to $1.4 billion in June 2012 and canceled in January 2013 due to accrued fees exceeding outstanding TALF loans. The Section 7(a) Securities Purchase Program supported the SBA's loan program by purchasing $368 million in securities guaranteed by the SBA. The TARP program ended in October 2010 after supporting financial firms and nonfinancial firms like U.S. automakers. The Automotive Industry Financing Program provided loans to General Motors and Chrysler through TARP, totaling $13.4 billion and $4 billion respectively. The U.S. Treasury provided loans and capital injections to GM and Chrysler, including a $5 billion injection to GMAC. The Obama Administration continued support for automakers, including warranties and supplier programs. By the end of 2009, GM had received $50.2 billion in loans and support, while Chrysler had received $10.9 billion. As of August 15, 2014, TARP support for the auto industry totaled approximately $79.7 billion disbursed, with $61.7 billion repaid and $7.0 billion in income. Approximately $15.9 billion has been written off or taken as a realized loss and $2.1 billion of assistance is outstanding, in the form of government ownership of 16% of the common equity in Ally Financial. Cost estimates for assistance to the auto industry in November 2013 and March 2014 were both $14 billion. Table A-8 outlines support for automakers, including asset holdings, losses, and conditions of assistance. In 2008, AIG faced losses, leading to downgrades and demands for collateral payments of $14-15 billion. In 2008, AIG faced potential bankruptcy due to mounting financial demands, similar to Lehman Brothers. The Fed provided support with an $85 billion line of credit and warrants for equity purchase. Additional loans were announced in October 2008, totaling $37.8 billion. AIG also applied for assistance from the Fed's Commercial Paper Funding Facility. In early November 2008, AIG's financial support was restructured, including reducing the Fed loan to $60 billion with a longer term and lower interest rate, purchasing $40 billion in preferred shares through TARP, and replacing the $37.8 billion loan with up to $52.5 billion in asset purchases by the Fed. The government maintained a 79.9% equity position in AIG. In September 2010, AIG and the government announced a restructuring of the government's assistance, which closed on January 14, 2011. This included a partial payback of the Fed loan through a swap of debt for equity in two AIG subsidiaries worth approximately $25 billion, reducing the maximum to $35 billion. Additionally, commitments were made for additional future TARP purchases of up to $29.8 billion in preferred shares at AIG's discretion. The Maiden Lane LLCs continued operating under previous terms, with actual loans totaling $43.9 billion out of a possible $52.5 billion at their peak. The government's plan to simplify its interest in AIG involved ending the Fed's involvement through loan repayment, converting preferred shares to common shares, and selling them to the public. Treasury held 92% of AIG's common equity and sold it over time, completing the sales in December 2012. Treasury also held equity interests in AIG's subsidiaries worth approximately $20.3 billion. Treasury completed the sale of AIG equity in December 2012, repaid all Federal Reserve loans, and sold assets held in Maiden Lane LLCs. The last government-held assets related to AIG were TARP warrants sold in January 2013. TARP aimed to assist homeowners facing foreclosure, with various programs created by Treasury. The TARP housing assistance programs, unlike other TARP programs, do not have a mechanism for returning funds to the government. $50 billion of TARP funding was allocated for housing assistance, but the programs have been criticized as ineffective in helping homeowners. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) was introduced in March 2009 to provide financial incentives to mortgage servicers for loan modifications to reduce borrowers' monthly payments. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) provides incentives for mortgage servicers to modify loans, with a maximum monthly payment of 31% of income. Servicers and borrowers can receive \"pay-for-success\" incentives for staying current on modified loans. Investors also receive incentives, with the government covering half the cost of reducing payments. HAMP is available until December 31, 2016, with an estimated cost of $75 billion, funded by TARP and Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac. The Obama Administration announced funding for the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) on February 19, 2010, to assist states with the greatest declines in home prices. States could create foreclosure prevention programs using these funds, as long as they met TARP objectives and were approved by Treasury. Multiple rounds of funding with different criteria have been provided for the HHF. The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) received multiple rounds of funding with different criteria for choosing states, totaling 18 states plus the District of Columbia. The funds, originating from TARP, must be spent by December 31, 2017. $7.6 billion has been allocated to HHF, with $4.2 billion disbursed by August 15, 2014. Additionally, a Federal Housing Administration Short Refinance Program was announced on March 26, 2010, to assist homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth. The FHA Short Refinance Program allows homeowners to refinance into new, FHA-insured mortgages for an amount lower than the home's current value. The program requires homeowners to be current on their mortgages and reduce the first mortgage balance by at least 10%. It is voluntary for lenders and borrowers, with funding from TARP allocated until December 31, 2014. The FHA Short Refinance Program allows homeowners to refinance into new, FHA-insured mortgages for an amount lower than the home's current value. To help pay for the program, there has been a reduction from the original amount of $8.1 billion to $1.03 billion, with $0.06 billion already disbursed."
