The State Administrator shall establish a Problem Resolution Office with officers authorized to investigate taxpayer complaints and halt collection activities if deemed non-compliant with the law. Only the highest official or General Counsel of the relevant taxing authority can reverse such injunctions based on clear evidence. Officers cannot be penalized unless issuing manifestly unreasonable injunctions. The State Administrator can establish a Problem Resolution Office to investigate taxpayer complaints and stop collection activities if found to be non-compliant with the law. The authority of the State Administrators and taxpayers to pursue legal remedies in court is not limited by this section. SEC. 53. JURISDICTION AND INTERSTATE ALLOCATION. The text chunk discusses the allocation of revenue between states based on the destination of taxable property or services. It establishes a Federal Office of Revenue Allocation to resolve disputes among states regarding revenue allocation. The Administrator's determination can be reviewed in federal court under an abuse of discretion standard. The text chunk outlines the destination rules for different types of property and services for revenue allocation between states. It specifies that tangible personal property's destination is where it was first delivered, real property's destination is where it is located, other property's destination is the purchaser's residence, and services' destination is where they are used, consumed, or enjoyed. The destination rules for revenue allocation between states are outlined for different types of property and services. Telecommunications services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence, domestic transportation services are based on the final destination of the trip, and international transportation services are based on the final destination or origin. For international transportation services, 50 percent of the service amount is attributed to the United States destination or origin. Financial intermediation services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence. State Tax Administrators have jurisdiction over gross payments with a destination within their state. Rents and royalties for tangible property are allocated based on the property's location. The destination of rent and lease payments for tangible property is where the property is located. For vehicles, the destination is based on the term of the rental or lease. Royalties for the license of intangible property are allocated based on where the property is used. \"Tax must be stated and charged separately according to Section 54.\" The sales tax must be charged separately from the purchase price by the vendor. A receipt provided to the purchaser should include details such as the price exclusive of tax, amount of tax paid, price inclusive of tax, tax rate, date of sale, vendor's name, and vendor registration number. The vending machine exception exempts sales made through vending machines from the sales tax requirements. Vending machines must dispense taxable items for coins or bills up to twenty dollars, with no single item exceeding ten dollars in price. SEC. 5. PHASE-OUT OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.\n\nAppropriations for expenses of the Internal Revenue Service, including processing income tax returns prior to income tax repeal, are not authorized after fiscal year 2000.\n\nSEC. 6. EXCISE TAX ADMINISTRATION.\n\nThe Secretary will establish an Excise Tax Bureau to collect excise taxes previously managed by the IRS.\n\nSEC. 7. SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION TO COLLECT PAYROLL TAXES.\n\nStarting January 1, 1998, the Social Security Administration will collect self-employment and employment taxes as per the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 8. SELF-EMPLOYMENT TAX. Revised rules for self-employment tax can be found in section 57. For revised withholding tax schedules and family consumption refund rules, refer to section 15. Trust fund accounting and payroll tax revenues rules are outlined in section 6(b) of this act. Subsection 1402(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define 'self-employment income' as gross payments received in a calendar year from the sale of taxable property or services, minus purchases of taxable property or services, wages paid for business purposes, unused transition amounts, and undeducted negative self-employment income from prior periods. Transition amounts for the ten years starting in 1998 are calculated based on the unrecovered basis amount as of December 31, 1997, divided by ten. The unrecovered basis amount is the remaining income tax basis related to prior law section 167 property placed in service before January 1, 1998, and inventory held as of the end of 1997. Conforming amendments repeal subsections 1402(b) and 1402(c), while renumbering subsections 1402(d) et seq. as subsections 1402(b) et seq. SEC. 9 amends section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code by adjusting interest rates. SEC. 10 requires a supermajority vote in Congress to raise federal sales tax rates or reduce federal revenues. Waiver or suspension of this requirement needs a two-thirds majority vote."
