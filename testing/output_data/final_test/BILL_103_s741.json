    "content": "The \"Individual Investment Account Act of 1991\" establishes Individual Investment Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Individual Investment Account Act of 1991 allows individuals to deduct cash contributions to an individual investment account, limited to $2,500 per year. An individual investment account is a trust created for the exclusive benefit of an individual, with specific requirements such as only accepting cash contributions and having a bank trustee. The trustee of the individual investment account must be a bank or another person approved by the Secretary. Trust assets cannot be invested in life insurance contracts or collectibles, and must not be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund. Contributions are deemed made on the last day of the taxable year. Tax treatment of distributions from an individual investment account is generally included in gross income unless it is a non-deductible contribution or a qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution. Qualified 1st-time homebuyer distributions from an individual investment account are treated as made first from non-deductible contributions and then from other amounts. This type of distribution is defined as any payment received by a 1st-time homebuyer from such an account for the purpose of buying a home. Qualified 1st-time homebuyer distributions allow individuals to use up to $15,000 within 60 days for qualified acquisition costs towards a principal residence. The basis of the residence is reduced by the distribution amount. Definitions include qualified acquisition costs. The term 'qualified acquisition costs' refers to the costs of acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a residence, including settlement, financing, or closing costs. A '1st-time homebuyer' is an individual with no ownership interest in a principal residence in the 3-year period before acquisition. The tax treatment of accounts in relation to divorce states that the transfer of an individual's interest in an investment account to their former spouse under a divorce decree is not taxable. The transferred interest is then treated as the spouse's account, and it is maintained for their benefit. The tax treatment of individual investment accounts exempts them from taxation unless a prohibited transaction occurs, leading to loss of exemption. The individual investment account will cease to be treated as such at the beginning of the taxable year, with all assets in the account considered distributed at fair market value. If the account is used as security during the year, specific tax implications may apply. If an individual investment account is used as security for a loan, the portion used is treated as distributed to that individual. Rollover contributions are exempt if the amount is paid into another account within 60 days. Dollar amounts in subsections (b) and (d)(3)(B) are adjusted for inflation after 1992. The dollar amount in subsections is adjusted for inflation by multiplying it with the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. If the amount is not a multiple of $10, it is rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. Custodial accounts are treated as trusts if the assets are held by a bank or another person approved by the Secretary. The trustee of an individual investment account must report account activities to the Secretary and the account holder as required by regulations. The custodian of a custodial account treated as a trust is considered the trustee. The filing requirements for individual investment accounts must be followed as per regulations. Deductions for individual investment account contributions are allowed in arriving at adjusted gross income. Nonrecognition of gain on the sale of a principal residence is possible if the amount equal to the taxable gain is deposited into an individual investment account. Nonrecognition of gain on the sale of a principal residence is possible if the taxable gain is reinvested in an individual investment account. The tax code allows for the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence if the property has been owned and used by the taxpayer for at least 3 years within a 5-year period. The amount of gain excluded cannot exceed the cash paid into an individual investment account within a year of the sale. Rules similar to section 121(d) apply for determining ownership and use. Additionally, there are provisions for taxing prohibited transactions under section 4975 of the tax code. The tax code includes provisions for taxing prohibited transactions under section 4975. An individual investment account is exempt from tax if it ceases to be an individual investment account due to specific circumstances. (e) Failure To Provide Reports on Individual Investment Accounts.-- Section 6693 of the tax code is amended to include penalties for failure to provide reports on individual investment accounts. The penalty for non-compliance is $50 unless reasonable cause is shown. The tax code is amended to include penalties for failure to provide reports on individual investment accounts, with a penalty of $50 for non-compliance unless reasonable cause is shown. Additionally, a new paragraph is added regarding the acquisition of a residence with funds from an individual investment account. The tax code is amended to exclude gain from the sale of a principal residence if reinvested in an individual investment account. Effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 1991."
