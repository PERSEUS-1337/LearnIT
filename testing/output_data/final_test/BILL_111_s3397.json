    "content": "The \"Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010\" addresses the growing issue of nonmedical prescription drug use in the United States, especially among teenagers. The Act highlights the significant increase in deaths and treatment admissions related to controlled prescription drugs, such as opioids, as well as the rise in violent and property crimes associated with their abuse and diversion. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy's 2008 Report, prescription drug abuse, especially among teens, has been on the rise in the United States over the past 5 years. Teens abuse prescription drugs more than any illicit drug except marijuana, and responsible adults can help reduce teen access to these drugs by properly disposing of unused medications through drug disposal programs. Drug disposal programs help remove outdated or unused medications from households to prevent access by children and teens. However, these programs cannot dispose of controlled substances without specific permission from the DEA, leaving individuals with limited options for disposal. Drug take-back programs provide a safe and effective way for individuals to dispose of potentially harmful substances, particularly controlled substances. Long-term care facilities face challenges in disposing of controlled substances due to the volume they handle. The Attorney General has the authority to create regulations for patients to safely deliver unused pharmaceutical controlled substances for proper disposal. The goal of the Act is to prevent diversion of controlled substances by encouraging the Attorney General to set parameters for collection and disposal methods. Ultimate users can deliver controlled substances for disposal without the need for registration. The Attorney General can authorize the delivery of controlled substances for disposal without registration if the recipient is authorized and disposal follows regulations to prevent diversion. Regulations consider public health, safety, program implementation, and participation costs. Long-term care facilities may also be authorized for disposal. The Attorney General can authorize long-term care facilities to dispose of controlled substances on behalf of residents for effective diversion control and public health safety. If a person dies with controlled substances, lawful disposal can be done by another person under the same conditions. Amendments to the Controlled Substances Act allow for these disposal regulations. The United States Sentencing Commission is directed to review and potentially amend sentencing guidelines to increase penalties by up to 2 offense levels for drug offenses involving the delivery of scheduled substances for disposal by an ultimate user or long-term care facility. This directive is in response to amendments allowing for lawful disposal of controlled substances by authorized individuals or facilities. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
