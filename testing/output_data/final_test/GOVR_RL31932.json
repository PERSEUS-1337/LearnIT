    "content": "During the 108th-112th Congresses, Congress played a significant role in U.S. international trade policies, negotiating numerous trade agreements. The 113th Congress may address regional trade agreements and trade promotion authority. The United States is involved in multilateral negotiations in the Doha Development Agenda and pursuing bilateral trade agreements with various countries. The United States has trade agreements with various countries including Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, and more. The Obama Administration has initiated trade agreements with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the EU-U.S. Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Building public consensus on international trade issues can be challenging, especially when certain industries and labor groups are affected by international competition. Members of Congress and the public may have varying views on proposed agreements. Critics and supporters may have varying views on trade agreements, with some opposing certain aspects due to disproportionate adjustment costs. Economic models are used to assess the impact of agreements on the economy and specific sectors. In November 2001, trade ministers from 142 countries met in Doha, Qatar to launch the 4th WTO ministerial. The 4th WTO ministerial was launched in Doha, Qatar, with a focus on starting new multilateral trade negotiations. The United States aimed to improve market access in agriculture by eliminating export subsidies, easing tariffs, and reducing trade-distorting domestic support. Negotiations on trade in services and industrial goods were also on the agenda. A framework agreement was reached in Geneva in 2004, but talks stalled in 2005 without setting a new deadline. The 6th WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong in December 2005 was seen as a crucial opportunity to settle key negotiating issues before the U.S. trade promotion authority expired in 2007. Despite efforts to reach an agreement, negotiations failed in June-July 2006, leading to an indefinite suspension. However, on January 1, 2007, talks resumed in \"full negotiating mode\" under WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy. On January 1, 2007, talks resumed in \"full negotiating mode\" under WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy. Chairs of the agriculture and industrial market access negotiating groups offered draft modalities texts on July 17, 2007, keeping parties engaged despite criticism. In November 2010, G-20 leaders recognized the importance of concluding the Doha round. President Obama and European Council President Van Rompoy initiated negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership in February 2013, aiming to enhance the U.S.-EU trading relationship. The agreement between the United States and the European Union could potentially increase trade and investment by over $270 billion annually. This would be achieved through reductions in non-tariff barriers, such as domestic regulations. Various scenarios suggest that the agreement could improve EU GDP by $7 billion to $155 billion and U.S. GDP by $2 billion to $123 billion, depending on the level of trade liberalization. The report outlines comprehensive agreements aiming to reduce non-tariff barriers by 10% and eliminate 90% of tariffs, with projected estimates showing potential boosts to EU and U.S. GDP. President Obama announced negotiations for a free trade agreement with seven nations, including Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations included Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam, with Canada, Malaysia, and Mexico later joining. Japan is considering joining as well. The TPP countries represent the largest export market for U.S. goods and services, with exports totaling $895 billion in 2011. U.S. exports of agricultural products to the region totaled $98 billion in 2011. The impact of a potential agreement on U.S. trade and the economy is still uncertain. The 17th round of negotiations is scheduled for May 15-24, 2013 in Lima, Peru. The negotiations for a free trade agreement in the Americas stalled in 2005, with efforts in various areas like market access, agriculture, services, investment, and government procurement. Attempts to restart the negotiations with a two-tier framework were blocked by five participants. In 2002, the Bush Administration announced negotiations for a free trade agreement with the Southern African Customs Union. Negotiations for a free trade agreement with the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) stalled in 2004 over differing views on objectives and sectors to include. Talks aimed at reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers in areas like telecommunications, financial services, and market access for goods not covered by the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The United States and SACU are now discussing a Trade, Investment, and Development Cooperation Agreement that could lead to a future FTA. The United States has signed various trade agreements with countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, including Trade and Investment Framework Agreements, Bilateral Investment Treaties, and negotiations with ASEAN under the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative. The United States has signed trade agreements with countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, including FTAs with Singapore, TIFA with ASEAN, and interest in joining the TPP. Two-way trade between the US and ASEAN reached $182 billion in 2008. Negotiations with Andean countries failed, leading Peru to conclude a bilateral agreement with the US. The United States signed trade agreements with countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, including FTAs with Singapore and TIFA with ASEAN. Negotiations with Andean countries failed, leading Peru to conclude a bilateral agreement with the US in December 2005. Separate talks with Colombia concluded successfully in February 2006. The Bush Administration signed an agreement with Central American Common Market nations in 2004, which was later ratified by all countries except Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. The agreement went into effect with the Dominican Republic in 2007 and with Costa Rica in 2009. The Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) is seen as a stepping stone towards completing a Free Trade Area of the Americas. U.S. negotiators aim to reduce tariffs on U.S. merchandise exports and barriers to e-commerce, services, and intellectual property trade. The agreement also seeks to improve commitment to the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and define transparency rules. Central American participants want to strengthen their trade relationship with the U.S. and improve access for their textile and apparel products. The United States and Australia signed a bilateral free trade agreement in 2004. The United States and Australia signed a bilateral free trade agreement in 2004 (P.L. 108-286), which took effect on January 1, 2005. The agreement lowered Australian tariffs on most U.S. exports of manufactured goods and agricultural products, while also providing nondiscriminatory treatment in various areas of bilateral trade. Australia saw lower tariffs on U.S. imports of beef, dairy, cotton, and peanuts, but no change in access to sugar producers. Despite opposition from some U.S. agricultural interests, the agreement aimed to strengthen trade relations between the two countries. The United States and Bahrain signed a free trade agreement in 2006 (P.L. 109-169), aiming for a Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013. The agreement eliminates tariffs on most exports to Bahrain, including 98% of U.S. agricultural products. Textiles and apparel trade will be duty-free with U.S. or Bahrainian yarn. U.S. service providers will have extensive access to Bahrain's service markets in various sectors. The United States and Chile signed a bilateral free trade agreement in 2003, which became effective in 2004. This agreement is significant as it is the first with a South American country, aiming to gain market access and reduce tariff rates for U.S.-made goods. Over time, all goods traded between the two countries will receive duty-free access, with 85% of bilateral trade in consumer and industrial products eligible for duty-free treatment. The United States-Chile free trade agreement allows for duty-free treatment of consumer and industrial products, with tariff rates reduced over time. Most U.S. agricultural exports to Chile will be duty-free within four years, and all duties will be phased out within 12 years. The agreement also addresses environment and labor provisions, government procurement rules, services trade access, and protection of investment and intellectual property. President Bush signed the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement in 2004, strengthening economic ties between the two countries. The United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement aims to strengthen economic ties and support Morocco as a moderate Arab state. Opportunities for U.S. business investment and exports in Morocco's agriculture sector are expected to increase with reductions in tariff rates. U.S. exports of wheat, soybeans, feed grains, beef, poultry, information technology products, construction equipment, and chemicals are likely to benefit. Morocco seeks increased access to the U.S. market for citrus products, textiles, and apparel goods. The Bush Administration began negotiations on a free trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman in 2004. Talks with UAE started in March 2005 and with Oman in March 2005. The agreement with Oman was signed in January 2006, and implementing legislation was passed by the Senate in June 2006 and by the House in July 2006. The legislation became law in September 2006. President Bush also signed a proclamation to implement the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement in 2009, eliminating duties on 80% of U.S. exports to Peru. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement eliminates duties on 80% of U.S. exports to Peru, with an additional 7% receiving duty-free treatment within five years. The agreement is expected to have a small effect on the U.S. economy due to Peru's small share of total U.S. trade. Leading imports from Peru include copper and petroleum, while top U.S. exports to Peru are petroleum oils, wheat, and meslin. The United States signed a first-of-its-kind Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with an Asian country, sparking a debate on bilateral agreements versus regional or multilateral trade liberalization. The FTA with Singapore eliminates tariffs on all goods traded between the two countries, covers trade in services, and protects intellectual property rights. U.S. exports of chewing gum and distilled spirits, as well as imports of textiles and apparel, are the most affected areas. Industry analysts predict minimal direct economic effects on U.S. textile and apparel producers. The agreement with Singapore has sparked a debate on rules of origin in apparel trade. Apparel producers find the rules restrictive, while the AFL-CIO opposes the agreement for not protecting worker rights. In services, U.S. market access is set to improve, with banks and financial services companies looking to expand in Singapore. The agreement also liberalizes controls on express delivery services and professional service providers. Additionally, it eases restrictions on telecommunications, e-commerce, foreign investment, and intellectual property rights. On February 6, 2006, the United States and Colombia announced the conclusion of a free trade agreement, aiming to eliminate tariffs and barriers in goods and services trade between the two countries. The agreement would gradually eliminate duties on U.S. exports to Colombia, with implementing legislation passed by Congress on October 12, 2011. Additionally, negotiations for a free trade agreement with South Korea were initiated by the Bush Administration on February 3, 2006. The negotiators completed the seventh round of talks for a trade agreement with South Korea in February 2007. Key issues included South Korea's agricultural sector, non-tariff barriers in manufacturing, and products from the Kaesong industrial complex. The Obama Administration faced opposition from U.S. automakers and beef producers, delaying approval in Congress. Further concessions on autos were obtained in December 2010, with implementing legislation passed in October 2011. The Bush Administration began negotiations with Panama in April 2004. The Bush Administration began negotiations with Panama in April 2004, seeking reductions in tariffs and barriers for U.S. goods. An agreement was signed in June 2007, addressing trade, investment, and dispute resolution. U.S. labor groups raised concerns about Panama's labor conditions. Panama aimed to secure access to U.S. markets for agricultural goods. Congress approved implementing legislation in October 2011. In October 2010, Malaysia joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. The United States seeks to remove import licensing restrictions on motor vehicles, government procurement restrictions, and increase protection for intellectual property rights. Negotiations with Thailand for a free trade agreement began in 2004 but were suspended in 2006 after a military-led coup. The Bush Administration aimed to liberalize trade with Thailand, focusing on goods, agriculture, services, investment, and intellectual property rights. The agreement was intended to boost U.S. exports, benefit farmers and auto industries, protect U.S. investment, and advance the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative. Talks for a free trade agreement with the UAE and Oman began in 2005, with worker protection issues posing a challenge. The UAE faces worker protection challenges due to heavy reliance on guest workers and restrictions on the right to strike or organize. The Administration aims to build on agreements with other nations in the region to promote open trade and investment in the global economy. International trade involves a complex exchange of goods, services, and financial products, facilitated by liberalized capital flows and floating exchange rates. Nations trade to maximize resources and improve standard of living. Specialization in production leads to trade for goods not produced efficiently. Most economists believe international trade has a positive net effect on the national economy. International trade is a key factor in determining the makeup of jobs, industries, wages, and products in the economy. It does not solely determine economic expansions or contractions, income levels, national output, wage rates, or income distribution. The components of U.S. GDP include personal consumption, business investment, changes in inventories, government spending, and net exports. During economic recessions, personal consumption has remained relatively stable. During the recent economic recession and financial crisis, personal consumption remained stable at around 70% of GDP, while business investment decreased to 11.8% from 16.0% of GDP. Government spending slightly increased from 2009-2011 but declined by the end of 2012. U.S. exports grew to nearly 14% of GDP in 2012, totaling $2.2 trillion, due to trade liberalization efforts. Trade agreements aim to reduce barriers to U.S. exports and foreign goods, promoting competitive and productive industries. However, the shift towards more efficient economic activities can lead to short-term adjustment costs, impacting labor, companies, and communities. Governments must consider these costs when negotiating trade deals, which can sometimes face opposition. Trade agreements aim to reduce barriers to international trade, leading to consumption gains for consumers and improved economic welfare. However, labor groups with limited skills may face challenges in adapting to changes in the economy. Economists believe that reducing trade barriers can result in price changes, increased efficiency in production, and overall benefits for the nation's economy. Consumers benefit from international trade through a wider selection of goods at lower prices, leading to increased well-being and quality. Specialization in production offers a greater variety of prices, allowing consumers to increase their real incomes and consume a broader range of goods and services, ultimately expanding national incomes. Trade not only offers a wider selection of goods and services at lower prices but also contributes to expanding national incomes. Research suggests that trade plays a dynamic role in the economy by stimulating trade and investment, leading to feedback effects that can alter market structures and promote economic growth in the long run. Free trade or trade liberalization can enhance economic growth through various channels such as improved access to specialized capital goods, human capital accumulation, and the introduction of new skills. The introduction of new products and skills, along with capital accumulation and learning-by-doing, can impact economic growth by changing incentives for research and development. Trade policy changes can have dynamic effects on economic growth, with potential large stakes for some groups and countries. Economists analyze the economic effects of trade liberalization and estimate the monetary values of those effects. Estimating the economic impact of trade agreements is challenging due to data limitations and theoretical/practical issues with economic models. Economic effects of trade agreements provide an incomplete picture of the total impact on a dynamic economy like the United States, where industries evolve at different speeds based on technological advancements and efficiency. Sectors that innovate attract more capital and labor, while those that lag behind face challenges. Advances in communications and technology have transformed economic production into global supply chains, impacting sectors differently based on their ability to attract capital and labor. Some sectors may need to relinquish resources for others to grow, avoiding economic stagnation. How firms respond to these challenges will determine their long-term viability in the market. Trade agreements' economic effects go beyond employment gains or losses, influencing the overall economy. Trade agreements have complex economic effects beyond just employment estimates. Estimating employment effects is imprecise and sensitive to assumptions, especially in services and investment sectors. Negotiations to reduce barriers in services could have significant impacts on the economy. Negotiations to reduce barriers in services could have a large positive effect on the U.S. economy, as the country is competitive in many service sectors. Estimates of employment from trade agreements do not capture all the benefits for the economy, such as broader economic benefits for consumers and firms, and long-term productivity gains. Economic trade models depend on various factors, including how price changes are passed on to consumers. Trade models used in analyzing free trade agreements are computable general equilibrium models that incorporate data on trade and domestic economic variables for nearly 100 countries. Tariffs may drop to zero immediately or be reduced over ten years, impacting prices over time. Changes in trade in services are considered exogenous factors in the models. Trade models are computable general equilibrium models that provide insights into how changes in tariffs affect countries. However, these models have limited data and sacrifice precision in estimating abilities. While originally developed for analyzing multi-country trade agreements, they may lack precision when used for bilateral agreements with less trade impact. Exchange rate changes are not explicitly accounted for in these models. Trade agreements lower tariffs, leading to price decreases and consumer demand shifting towards lower-priced goods, known as trade diversion. This effect is based on the assumption that goods from countries in the agreement are interchangeable with similar goods from other countries. Exchange rate movements can also impact trade patterns in bilateral agreements. The impact of trade agreements goes beyond just price changes and consumer demand, involving complex factors like changes in tariffs affecting real incomes and leading to trade creation. These agreements can also result in broader trade effects with countries not involved in the agreement, often overlooked due to their complexity. Quantifying the relationship between international trade and employment composition is challenging, especially in the United States. International trade is not the main source of employment in the US economy. Trade agreements may benefit certain sectors but their overall impact on employment is uncertain. Changes in exchange rates and the business cycle can outweigh the effects of trade agreements. Data gaps, especially in the services sector, make it difficult to model the effects of trade agreements. The services sector accounts for a significant portion of the US economy and increased trade in services could bring large gains. Concerns over the impact of trade agreements on U.S. employment often focus on labor compensation rates between countries. However, competitiveness is not just about labor compensation rates but also productivity levels. U.S. goods can remain competitive globally as long as U.S. workers are more productive. Most estimates of employment effects do not consider productivity measures in their analysis. The general equilibrium model by economists at the University of Michigan is used to analyze the economic effects of trade policy changes. In a recent study, the model was used to estimate the impact of trade negotiations on the US economy, adjusting projections based on assumptions about reducing trade barriers. The data reflects anticipated changes in the economy due to trade negotiations, providing estimates on trade effects, employment, and industrial composition. However, general equilibrium models used for these estimates often overlook adjustment costs from trade liberalization, resulting in a focus on positive effects only. Brown, Stern, and Deardorff developed estimates on the impact of the Doha Development round on the U.S. economy, making key assumptions in their analysis. The negotiations are expected to reduce trade barriers by 33% in agriculture, manufactures, and services, leading to a projected $164 billion increase in economic activity in the U.S. The Michigan model estimates a permanent change in economic activity, not an annual change in economic welfare. Brown, Stern, and Deardorff also projected a $497 billion impact on the U.S. economy if all trade barriers worldwide were removed unilaterally. The estimated monetary gains for the U.S. economy from trade liberalization would be less than 1.5% and 4.5% of GDP. Reductions in agricultural import tariffs, export subsidies, and production subsidies lead to a small decline in U.S. welfare in the agricultural sector. Gains in the manufacturing sector come from reduced foreign tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods exports, increasing domestic manufacturing output and improving production efficiency. The estimated gains for the U.S. economy from trade liberalization are modest, with reductions in agricultural tariffs leading to a small decline in U.S. welfare in that sector. Gains in the manufacturing sector come from reduced foreign tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods exports, increasing domestic manufacturing output and efficiency. Foreign direct investment flows into more productive manufacturing areas, while the services sector shows high U.S. competitiveness and barriers for exporters. Bilateral trade agreements are expected to have modest gains for the U.S. economy. Trade agreements with Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, and South Korea are estimated to result in significant trade benefits for the U.S. economy. A free trade agreement with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is projected to offer economic benefits of $244 billion for the United States. Agreements with ASEAN, FTAA, and the Southern African Customs union are also expected to yield economic benefits for the U.S. economy. An agreement with the Southern African Customs union is projected to bring $12.6 billion in trade benefits to the United States. The Michigan model uses an input-output approach to estimate employment effects across different industrial sectors, showing potential job gains and losses. The model assumes that job losses will be offset by job gains, providing an estimate of the relative magnitude of employment effects. The model estimates employment effects in various industries due to trade liberalization. Global free trade would add jobs in agriculture but reduce jobs in textiles, apparel, retail trade, and services. The Uruguay round would result in gains in agriculture but losses in textiles and apparel. The Doha Round would generate gains in agriculture but losses in textiles, apparel, retail trade, and services. The model simulation shows that bilateral trade agreements by the United States have a small impact on the economy. General equilibrium models still lack complexity compared to the real economy and do not capture all potential economic effects of trade agreements. The impact of trade liberalization includes increased foreign capital inflows and outflows, leading to improved productivity and profitability in U.S. industries. However, the models used do not account for changes in the dollar's exchange rate, which could either enhance or diminish the positive effects of trade liberalization policies. The Michigan model and other general equilibrium models suggest that the largest gains from trade liberalization would come from liberalizing trade in services, reflecting the significant role of services in the U.S. economy. Estimates of the benefits of liberalizing trade in services are based on average gross operating margins of firms in 18 countries as a proxy for estimating barriers to services trade. Hoekman's analysis suggests that market restrictions drive a wedge between market price and marginal cost, leading to higher profits in protected markets. U.S. service sectors, except construction, have above-average profit margins, indicating high barriers to entry for foreign firms. However, this conclusion contradicts most studies on market openness, such as the OECD's findings. The OECD found that the U.S. services sector is among the least restrictive. Hoekman cautioned that various factors affect firms' ability to generate high profits, including market size, competition policy, and fixed costs. Without better data on trade barriers in the services sector, it is challenging to estimate the costs of these barriers. Hoekman emphasized the difficulty in estimating the costs of trade barriers in the services sector. Despite limited data, analysts can still quantify potential gains from market liberalization. The research suggests significant benefits from increasing competition in services markets. Policymakers may need to rely on general guidelines for negotiating priorities due to data limitations. Brown, Deardorff, and Stern predict a 33% reduction in trade barriers to services through the Doha Round negotiations. The Doha Round negotiations aim to reduce trade barriers by 33% in services, agriculture, and manufactured goods. However, predicting the impact of this reduction in the services sector is challenging due to its diverse nature and unique barriers. The services sector encompasses a wide range of economic activities, making it difficult for nations to anticipate the effects of liberalizing trade in this area. The effects of liberalizing trade in the services sector are challenging for most nations due to uncertainties about the barriers their exports face. This is further complicated by the distinction between market access barriers and regulatory activities in areas like public health, safety, and the environment. The United States is currently negotiating various trade agreements with different partners. The United States is negotiating trade agreements with various partners, ranging from bilateral agreements to regional and multinational agreements that could impact certain U.S. workers and industries. Congress may need to consider implementing these agreements, weighing different objectives and viewpoints on their economic effects. Econometric modeling can help analyze the impact of trade liberalization, especially in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing with quantifiable trade barriers like tariffs. Barriers to trade in the services sector are challenging to identify and quantify in econometric models. Progress is being made, but realistic estimates of trade liberalization effects in this sector may take time. Econometric models provide insights into the economic effects across sectors, helping to identify sectors with the highest adjustment costs. However, these models are sensitive to assumptions and limited by a lack of comprehensive data in the services sector. The lack of comprehensive data in the services sector poses challenges for econometric models analyzing trade agreements. These models may underestimate the adjustment costs of trade liberalization and the long-term positive effects. Despite potential benefits, trade liberalization's impact on the U.S. economy could be greater than current estimates suggest. Optimistic estimates suggest that unilateral reductions in trade barriers across all countries may have a modest impact on the U.S. economy. However, liberalizing trade regionally through proposed agreements could bring significant gains. Congress faces the choice of maintaining the status quo or unilaterally removing trade barriers, which could lead to backlash and weaken bargaining power in negotiations. The public backlash against trade liberalization is a concern for policymakers, as the short-term adjustment costs are hard to compare with long-term benefits. Policymakers must weigh the benefits of greater trade liberalization against potential dislocations for workers and industries when deciding on trade agreements. Trade adjustment assistance for workers and firms displaced by trade agreements is often seen as a way to spread out adjustment costs and ensure fairness. As trade agreements expand to include more trading partners, these adjustment costs are likely to increase. Policymakers use this assistance to help industries and groups that may need training or other support to adapt to trade-induced changes."
