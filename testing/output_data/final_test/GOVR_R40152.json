    "content": "The U.S. farm sector is vast and varied, encompassing production activities related to field crops, livestock, poultry, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Farm income and rural economic conditions vary across the country. This report focuses on national net farm income and the farm debt-to-asset ratio reported by the USDA's Economic Research Service. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service reports on annual U.S. net farm income, a key indicator of farm sector well-being. In 2017, net farm income is forecasted at $63.4 billion, up 3% from the previous year. This follows three years of decline from the record high in 2013. The forecasted income is below the 10-year average of $86.4 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars. In 2017, net farm income is projected to be $63.4 billion, up 3% from the previous year. This is below the 10-year average of $86.4 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars. Net cash income is also expected to increase by 12.5% to $100.4 billion, driven by sales from previous years' inventory. Farm income has fallen by 49% since 2013, primarily due to declining commodity prices. Despite three years of decline, both net cash income and net farm income are forecasted to rise in 2017. In 2017, cotton and soybean prices showed resilience, while poultry, hog, and milk prices are projected to be higher but below market highs of 2014/15. Cattle prices are expected to be slightly down. Government payments are projected to decrease slightly to $13.0 billion, with lower marketing-assistance loan benefits offsetting higher PLC and ARC program payments. Total production expenses are projected to increase by 1.3% in 2017. In 2017, U.S. farm expenses are projected to increase by 1.3% to $355.1 billion, driven by replacement animal, labor, and interest costs. Farm asset values are expected to rise to $3,075 billion (+4%), supported by global demand for U.S. agricultural exports reaching $139.8 billion (+8%). However, farm debt is also projected to increase to $390 billion (+4.4%), resulting in the highest debt-to-asset ratio since 2011. Severe drought in Montana, the Dakotas, and other regions impacted small-grain crops, leading to substantially lower yield forecasts by USDA. The north-central drought in Iowa has led to lower yield and output for spring-grown barley and wheat crops. Overall, 2017 U.S. wheat production is estimated to be down nearly 25% from last year. This has resulted in an 18% increase in the U.S. wheat farm price to $4.60 per bushel. Reduced rainfall has also affected sorghum, oat, and forage-crop prospects in the region, but the impact on corn and soybean crops appears minimal. Corn and soybeans are the two largest U.S. commercial crops and play a crucial role in various sectors. The United States is a major exporter of corn and soybeans, with record harvests in recent years leading to lower prices in domestic and international markets. Planted acres for feed grains and wheat decreased in 2017, while soybean-planted acres reached a record high. In 2017, record soybean-planted acres at 89.5 million bushels are expected to yield the second-highest soybean yield and third-highest corn yield on record. This will result in a record large soybean harvest of 4.4 billion bushels. Soybean prices are projected to decrease by 3.2% to $9.20 per bushel, while corn prices are expected to drop by 4.5% to $3.20/bu. The California drought has national implications for retail food prices. The California drought has national implications for retail food prices due to its impact on U.S. agriculture, particularly in the production of vegetables, fruit, nuts, milk, and wine. While the northern portion of the state has seen relief from drought conditions, the lower third continues to be affected. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have caused extensive crop damage in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama, affecting crops such as cotton, rice, citrus, sugar, peanuts, and soybeans. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service will collect harvested acreage information for crops in affected states to assess the impact for the October Crop Production report. Livestock sector conditions can be tracked by the ratios of livestock output prices to feed costs, with higher ratios indicating greater profitability. The hog sector remains profitable despite some fluctuations, but strong production growth for red meat and poultry may make prices vulnerable to demand changes. Milk prices and the milk-to-feed ratio have increased in 2017, suggesting improved profitability. The milk-to-feed ratio increased in 2017, indicating better profitability, but small producers still face financial challenges. Milk prices may decline in the second half of 2017 due to continued growth in U.S. and global milk production. The federal milk margin protection program is expected to maintain payments above the $8.00 per hundredweight threshold. Expansion is projected for U.S. hog and cattle herds, as well as poultry flocks into 2018. The U.S. cattle sector has been expanding since 2014 due to high feed prices and drought, leading to a slow rebuilding phase in the cattle cycle. Despite lower market prices in 2017, projections show expanding demand in meat categories will help stem the decline in prices and profitability in 2018. The U.S. hog sector faced challenges in 2014 with the outbreak of PEDv, leading to concerns about pork production. However, the incidence of PEDv has since declined, but the surge in hog prices prompted increased pork supplies through 2016, impacting market prices. The poultry industry also faced a severe outbreak of avian influenza in spring 2015, resulting in the euthanization of millions of poultry to control the disease. In 2015, 48 million poultry were euthanized due to avian influenza, impacting turkey and egg-laying hen farms in Minnesota and Iowa. Egg prices rose by 28% that year, but prices for broilers and eggs fell in 2016. Production of beef, pork, broilers, and eggs is projected to expand in 2017, with meat and egg supplies expected to continue growing in 2018. Domestic and export demand is forecasted to support red meat, poultry, and egg prices and profit margins in 2017. Total farm sector gross cash income for 2017 is projected to increase by 4% to $409.4 billion, driven by higher livestock returns and farm-related income. Crop revenues are slightly up at $190.1 billion, while livestock cash receipts are expected to rise to $176.5 billion. Farm-sector revenue sources include crop revenues (46%), livestock receipts (43%), government payments (3%), and other farm-related income (7%). Total crop sales peaked in 2012 at a record $231.6 billion due to a nationwide drought. In 2017, crop sales are projected at $190.1 billion, with record yields offsetting lower prices for corn, soybeans, and cotton. The crop sector includes projections for feed crops, oil crops, food grains, fruits and nuts, vegetables, cotton, and other crops. The livestock sector includes cattle, hogs, sheep, poultry, eggs, dairy, and other minor activities. The livestock sector, which includes cattle, hogs, sheep, poultry, eggs, dairy, and other minor activities, experienced growth in cash receipts until 2014, reaching a record $212.8 billion. However, there were declines in 2015 and 2016 due to price decreases. In 2017, there is projected recovery with a growth of 8.4% to $176.5 billion. Projections for 2017 include cattle and calf sales of $67.6 billion, hog sales of $21.6 billion, poultry and egg sales of $41.9 billion, and dairy sales of $38.4 billion. Government payments are expected to decrease slightly to $13.0 billion in 2017. Government payments are expected to decrease slightly to $13.0 billion in 2017, with declines in marketing-assistance loan benefits and the end of the cotton ginning cost-share program. The ARC and PLC programs, established by the 2014 farm bill, are projected to trigger payments of $8.4 billion in 2017. The PLC program replaced the Counter-Cyclical Price program with higher support levels for most crops, while ARC uses a five-year moving average price trigger for payment calculation. Government payments are expected to decrease slightly to $13 billion in 2017, representing a small share of projected gross cash income. The ARC and PLC programs are projected to trigger payments of $8.4 billion in 2017, with higher support levels for most crops under the PLC program. Payments under the price-contingent marketing loan benefit are forecasted to decrease in 2017. Farm fixed direct payments were eliminated by the 2014 farm bill. The Margin Protection Program for dairy is expected to save $5 million in 2017 as producer premiums exceed federal payments. Conservation programs are forecasted to have payments of $4.0 billion in 2017, up 6% from 2016. Disaster assistance payments are expected to decline to $559 million in 2017. Total production expenses for the U.S. agricultural sector in 2017 are projected to be $355 billion, up 1.3% from the previous year. Production expenses are relatively rare, with changes in input prices lagging commodity price changes. Commodity prices declined from 2014 to 2016 before rebounding in 2017. Farm input prices followed a similar pattern, putting pressure on producer margins. Livestock farms will see a decrease in feed costs in 2017, while crop expenses are forecasted to be down by about 3%. Livestock expenses are projected to decrease by 1.2% to $77.1 billion, while crop expenses are expected to be $91.8 billion. Total farm production expenses are forecasted to be down by about 3% to $91.8 billion. Miscellaneous operating expenses, including crop insurance premiums, impact crop production. Renting or leasing land allows young farmers to enter agriculture without debt and helps existing operations adjust production quickly. Rented farmland varies by region and production activity, constituting an important component of farm expenses. In 2017, total net rent to non-operator landlords is projected to increase by 1.4% to $15.1 billion. Average cash rental rates for the year still reflect high crop prices and large net returns from previous years. The national rental rate for crop land peaked at $144 per acre in 2015. The national rental rate for crop land peaked at $144 per acre in 2015 and has been at $136 per acre for the past two years. U.S. agricultural exports have been a major contributor to farm income, with a sharp downturn in exports following 2014's peak. USDA projects U.S. agricultural exports at $139.8 billion in 2017, up 8% from 2016, with an agricultural trade surplus of $23.6 billion. Agricultural exports are projected to account for 33.4% of gross cash earnings in 2017. In 2017, U.S. agricultural exports are projected to reach $139.8 billion, with China, Canada, and Mexico as the top markets. Higher-priced grain and feed shipments, record oilseed exports to China, and growing animal product exports to East Asia have contributed to the increase in exports since 2010. The European Union and Japan are the fourth- and fifth-largest export markets, while the \"Rest of World\" component, including the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, has shown strong import growth. In recent years, U.S. agricultural exports to Asia have shown strong growth, with high-value products experiencing steady increases. Bulk commodity shipments are forecasted to have a 35% share in 2017, compared to over 60% in the 1970s and 1980s. On the other hand, high-valued export products are expected to have a 66.4% share, totaling $90.5 billion. This suggests a relatively stable financial position for the agriculture sector heading into 2017. Farm asset values are projected to increase by 4% in 2017 to $3,075 billion, driven by a 4.6% rise in real estate values. This growth offsets a decline in non-real estate values. The agriculture sector faces uncertainty due to downward price outlooks and market conditions, with a growing reliance on international markets to absorb domestic surpluses. Farm asset values are projected to increase by 4% in 2017 to $3,075 billion, driven by a 4.6% rise in real estate values. The leveling off of crop land values in 2017 reflects mixed forecasts for commodity prices. Total farm debt is forecast to rise to $390 billion in 2017, with farm equity projected to be up 2.8% at $2,621 billion. The farm debt-to-asset ratio is forecast to be higher in 2017 at 12.7%. Average farm household income in 2017 is projected at $119,598, with $24,262 coming from the farm and $95,336 earned off the farm. Farm income from off-farm sources peaked at about 95% in 2000 but has since decreased. In 2015, the average farm household income was 51% higher than the average U.S. household income. The average farm household income in 2017 was $119,880, 51% higher than the average U.S. household income.
