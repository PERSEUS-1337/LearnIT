Exemption from income tax for state-created organizations providing property and casualty insurance for properties where coverage is unavailable before January 1, 1999. The assets of the organization can only be used for specific purposes such as satisfying liabilities, investing, paying administration expenses, and making remittances. The organization's assets can be used to make remittances according to State law for claims on policies, reinsurance, or support for programs related to natural catastrophic events. The State law allows the association to levy assessments on insurance companies or policyholders to fund deficits. The association's plan of operation must be approved by the State, and its assets revert to the State upon dissolution. Any entity receiving remittances is considered part of the association. An entity or fund created before January 1, 1999, pursuant to State law, is organized to receive, hold, and invest remittances from an association exempt from tax. It also makes disbursements to pay claims on insurance contracts and support governmental programs for natural catastrophic events.
