    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Secret Service Protective Privilege Act of 1999\". Congress finds that the safety of the Nation's top elected officials, including the President and visiting foreign heads of state, is of utmost importance due to the unique and mortal jeopardy they face, which could have severe consequences for national security and foreign relations. Congress has mandated the Secret Service to protect the President, officials in line of the Presidency, and visiting foreign heads of state. The Secret Service's protective strategy relies on maintaining close physical proximity to the protectee, allowing personnel to overhear confidential conversations and sensitive matters. The Secret Service's protective strategy relies on maintaining trust and proximity with the protectee. If confidentiality is compromised, the protectee may push away protection, risking effectiveness. Testifying against protectees could deter foreign nations from accepting Secret Service protection, hindering the agency's mission to safeguard foreign dignitaries. The privilege protecting information acquired by Secret Service personnel while in proximity to a protectee aims to maintain the security of the protectee by reducing the incentive to distance the personnel in risky situations. This privilege applies to the President, those in the direct line of the Presidency, and visiting foreign dignitaries, outweighing the need for probative evidence. However, the privilege is subject to a crime/treason exception due to the personnel's law enforcement responsibilities. The purpose of the Act is to facilitate trust between Secret Service personnel and protected officials to prevent assassination risks. It also ensures that personnel can testify in criminal investigations involving unlawful activities they witnessed. Establishment of protective function privilege.
