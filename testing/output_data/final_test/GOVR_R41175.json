    "content": "Formal international negotiations began in December 1990, leading to the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992. The UNFCCC, which entered into force on March 21, 1994, divides countries into \"Annex I countries\" and \"non-Annex I parties.\" The Kyoto Protocol was negotiated as a step towards implementing the UNFCCC, setting emission reduction targets for high-income countries. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by the United States in 1998 but not ratified by the Senate, sets emission reduction targets for high-income countries and establishes market-based mechanisms for achieving them. Despite concerns about economic harm, the Protocol entered into force for most countries in 2005. The Kyoto Protocol was not ratified by the U.S. Senate. The 2007 UN Climate Change Conference in Bali established two negotiation tracks for post-2012 climate regime: one for Kyoto Protocol parties and another for all UNFCCC parties. The Bali Action Plan aimed to reach GHG mitigation targets for all parties by December 2009 in Copenhagen, creating uncertainty over the goal of a single agreement. The Copenhagen Conference faced uncertainty and disagreement over whether to reach a single agreement or two agreements under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. Despite high expectations, a legally binding agreement was unlikely, leading to the Copenhagen Accord negotiated by a smaller group of countries. This Accord set a goal for capping global temperature rise and allowed each Annex I party to define its own GHG emissions target level. The Copenhagen Accord allows each Annex I party to set their own GHG emissions target level, with requirements for measurement, reporting, and verification. Non-Annex I parties must commit to \"nationally appropriate\" GHG mitigation actions. Adoption of the Accord was blocked by Bolivia, Cuba, Sudan, and Venezuela, but countries can still associate with it by submitting a letter of intent. Countries can submit a letter or note verbale to the UNFCCC Secretariat for the Accord. The United States submitted its note verbale with a 17% GHG emissions reduction target by 2020. Many countries, including China and India, have also submitted targets or NAPAs. Despite missing the deadline, more countries are expected to follow suit. Various terms are used in international agreements, but they do not determine the agreement's legal status. Some writers suggest that treaty names are assigned randomly or at the discretion of drafters. Studies show recurring titles in international agreements, indicating titles do not determine legal effect but provide historical context. \"Convention\" typically denotes agreements expanding on non-fundamental international relations, with narrow scope addressing specific objects. In international agreements, \"conventions\" are major multi-state agreements coordinated by organizations like the United Nations. Framework conventions, such as the UNFCCC, set guidelines for addressing issues, with implementation details developed in subsequent agreements. Protocols supplement, clarify, interpret, or modify provisions of primary instruments like conventions. The term \"accord\" is used less frequently in agreement titles and does not suggest commonalities with previous agreements. The term \"accord\" in international agreements indicates a reciprocal, restricted, and less formal agreement. A binding agreement is one that conveys the intention to create legally binding relationships under international law and has gone into force. Language and clauses related to ratification and entry into force signify binding agreements, while statements indicating non-binding or political obligations suggest otherwise. The Department of State determines an agreement to be legally binding if it involves states, state agencies, or intergovernmental organizations intending their commitment to be governed by international law, constitutes a significant arrangement, includes enforceability criteria, and involves multiple parties. The emphasis on parties' intent in international agreements is akin to contract law principles. The United States must complete necessary steps to become bound by an international agreement, such as signing the treaty and submitting it to the U.S. Senate for approval. Non-legally binding agreements offer advantages like quicker negotiation and adoption, allowing states to test approaches to international problems. The United States must sign and submit international agreements to the U.S. Senate for approval. Treaties require two-thirds Senate approval, while other agreements may become U.S. law without Senate advice. Instruments of ratification are exchanged for agreements to enter into force. Executive agreements can become U.S. law without Senate approval, while non-self-executing agreements require implementing legislation by Congress. The domestic legal effect of these agreements depends on whether they are self-executing, with implementing legislation needed for non-self-executing agreements. This legislation provides U.S. agencies with the legal authority to fulfill obligations and enforce agreements in U.S. courts. Self-executing provisions in agreements can be enforced in U.S. court without additional legislation, carrying the same legal weight as federal statutes. Non-self-executing provisions require implementing legislation by Congress for domestic legal status. The UNFCCC, ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1992, entered into force in 1994. It serves as a framework for international cooperation on climate change, emphasizing information sharing, national strategies for emissions reduction, and cooperation in preparing for impacts. The UNFCCC, ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1992, entered into force in 1994. It is a legally binding international agreement that does not set binding targets for GHG emissions. The terms of the UNFCCC have been binding on the United States under both international and domestic law since its implementation without new legislation. The UNFCCC, ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1992, is a legally binding international agreement. However, it does not provide the Executive with the authority to impose quantitative emissions restrictions on industry. The Senate and Executive do not view the UNFCCC as a legal basis for new regulations on GHG emissions by U.S. industries. The UNFCCC does not require new legislation or regulatory programs for parties to adopt national policies to mitigate climate change by limiting GHG emissions. Any amendment or future agreement under the UNFCCC to adopt emissions reduction targets would need Senate approval before the US could ratify it. The UNFCCC does not require new legislation for parties to adopt national policies to mitigate climate change by limiting GHG emissions. Any amendment or future agreement under the UNFCCC to adopt emissions reduction targets would need Senate approval before the US could ratify it. Targets and timetables for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to the United States would alter the \"shared understanding\" of the Convention between the Senate and the executive branch and would therefore require the Senate's advice and consent. The George H.W. Bush Administration's commitment to submit any agreed upon timetables or GHG targets to the Senate was later cited during the Senate debate on advice and consent to ratification as an important element of the Senate's consent. If an executive agency claims that the UNFCCC authorizes it to adopt and implement quantitative emissions restrictions and faces a legal challenge from an affected industry for the imposition of those restrictions, the court hearing the case would likely deem the Executive's action an unconstitutional usurpation of congressional power due to the UNFCCC's ratification history. Articles 15, 16, and 17 of the UNFCCC govern the adoption of amendments, annexes, and protocols. These must be communicated to parties at least six months before adoption. Consensus is sought, but if not reached, a three-fourths majority vote is required for adoption. Failure to reach this majority renders the amendment or annex non-legally binding. Some criticize these consensus procedures for hindering progress under the UNFCCC. The UNFCCC does not have a rule for adopting protocols, leading to challenges in reaching agreements. Amendments and annexes require consensus or a three-fourths majority vote for adoption. Once adopted, amendments enter into force for accepting parties, while annexes apply to all parties unless they opt out. Protocols establish their own entry into force procedures. The Kyoto Protocol, negotiated as a step towards implementing the UNFCCC, sets emission reduction targets for high-income countries in its Annex B. Parties may need to adjust domestic laws to enforce the agreement's obligations. The Protocol aims to reduce emissions by at least 5% below 1990 levels by 2012 and was concluded on December 11, 1997, with the United States signing a year later. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by the United States in 1998, entered into force in 2005 after the adoption of the \"Marrakesh Accords.\" It includes emission reduction targets and market-based mechanisms like emissions trading. Parties must report GHG emissions data for international review, with penalties for non-compliance. The United States did not comply with the Kyoto Protocol due to concerns about its impact on the economy and lack of commitments from all large emitting countries. President George W. Bush announced the country's non-participation in 2001. The US signed the Protocol in 1998 but has not ratified it, so it is not legally bound by the agreement. The United States is not legally bound by the Kyoto Protocol as it has not ratified it. However, signing the agreement creates new obligations, including authenticating the agreement text, a \"moral obligation\" to seek Senate approval, and refraining from actions that undermine the agreement's purpose. A State must refrain from actions that undermine a treaty it has signed or expressed consent to be bound by until it clearly states its intention not to ratify the treaty. International law does not provide a way to remove a signature from a treaty, but a signatory state can avoid legal consequences by notifying the treaty depositary, such as the United Nations. The Secretary of State can notify the treaty depositary to avoid legal obligations from a signed treaty. The George W. Bush Administration sent a letter in 2002 to disavow the \"Rome Statute,\" but did not formally disavow the Kyoto Protocol. The different procedures suggest a distinction in the Administration's approach to each treaty. In the absence of an institutional mechanism to enforce treaty obligations, the United States determines its status as a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol under customary international law. Amendments to treaties create binding obligations, with all contracting states having a say in negotiations and becoming parties to the amended agreement. Amendments only affect countries that ratify them under international law. Under U.S. law, amendments to international agreements are subject to the same requirements as treaties. Executive agreements, which may or may not be authorized by Congress, are binding agreements entered into by the executive branch without Senate approval. These agreements can avoid constitutional treaty requirements if authorized by Congress, a ratified treaty, or the President's independent authority. The use of executive agreements has been validated by historical practice and judicial decision, although the full scope of the President's authority to conclude them remains a subject of debate. The Senate expressed concern that the UNFCCC might be interpreted as authorizing subsequent protocols and amendments as executive agreements. The George H.W. Bush Administration stated that amendments to the convention would be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent, while amendments to the convention's annexes would not. Protocols would depend on their subject matter, but any protocol would likely be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. The Administration confirmed that a protocol with emissions reduction targets and timetables would also be submitted. The Administration confirmed that any protocol with emissions reduction targets and timetables would be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations stated that any future agreement with legally binding targets and timetables would need to be treated as a new treaty and submitted to the Senate. These statements carry legal and political significance. The Kyoto Protocol's adoption as an executive agreement without Senate approval is unlikely due to the historical U.S. approach to environmental agreements and the Senate's stance on ratification. The failure to reach post-2012 emissions targets at Copenhagen may further diminish the Protocol's future significance. The Kyoto Protocol cannot serve as legal authority for imposing emissions restrictions on U.S. industry without completing the necessary legal prerequisites. While treaties have been provisionally applied in rare cases, the Protocol lacks the legal basis for provisional application as it was not negotiated with that expectation. The President needs constitutional authority or approval from the legislative branch to enter into a binding executive agreement for provisional application of a treaty. The Senate resolution in 1997 expressed opposition to agreements committing developed nations to reduce emissions. The Copenhagen Accord aims to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. The Copenhagen Accord aims to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. It establishes a process for each Annex I party to set their own GHG emissions target. Non-Annex I parties must commit to \"nationally appropriate\" GHG mitigation actions. The Accord also includes provisions for international consultations, analysis, and verification of mitigation actions. Additionally, it calls for $30 billion in funding between 2010-2012 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change impacts. The Copenhagen Accord, aiming to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, established GHG emissions targets for Annex I parties and \"nationally appropriate\" actions for non-Annex I parties. It includes provisions for international consultations, analysis, and verification of mitigation actions. The Accord also called for $30 billion in funding between 2010-2012 to assist poorer countries in adapting to climate change impacts. However, it failed to be adopted under the UNFCCC due to lack of support, with countries only \"taking note\" of the text. The United States declared intent to associate with the Accord and set a voluntary GHG emissions reduction target of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. Many countries, including China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa, have submitted GHG emissions targets or NAPAs to the UNFCCC, with more expected to follow suit. The United States is not legally bound by the Copenhagen Accord, which is seen as a political agreement rather than a legally binding one. Countries may \"associate with\" the Accord by submitting a note verbale to the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC. The United States has submitted a letter to do so. The United States has indicated its intention to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord, but because the agreement is not legally binding, U.S. adherence to its provisions is not required. The Accord lacks legal standing under the UNFCCC as it was not formally adopted by the Conference of the Parties. The COP only agreed to \"take note of\" the Accord due to objections from a small group of countries, meaning the provisions do not have legal standing within the UNFCCC process. The Constitution does not require the President to submit the Copenhagen Accord to the Senate for advice and consent as it is a voluntary agreement with no legal obligations. The Accord is not considered a treaty under international law and the constitutional implications of such voluntary commitments have not been thoroughly examined. The Copenhagen Accord, as a voluntary agreement, does not require Senate approval according to constitutional language. However, some argue that voluntary agreements have evolved to be similar to treaties and may need Senate approval. The Senate can still influence the Accord's domestic impact through appropriations, oversight, and legislation. Achieving the US's voluntary commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may be challenging. The United States aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 without congressional support. The Copenhagen Accord cannot be used as a basis for regulations imposing emissions restrictions on industry. The Executive branch may rely on the Clean Air Act to implement some GHG emission reducing measures. The Clean Air Act can be used to implement GHG emission reducing measures without Senate approval of international climate change agreements. Congress has the power to support provisions of the Copenhagen Accord under its enumerated powers in the Constitution."
