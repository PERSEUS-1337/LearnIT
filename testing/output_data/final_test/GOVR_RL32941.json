    "content": "The three most important homeland security public laws enacted after the 9/11 attacks are the USA PATRIOT Act, Homeland Security Act of 2002, and Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. These laws focused on enhancing domestic security through anti-terrorism measures, establishing the Department of Homeland Security, and restructuring the U.S. intelligence community for terrorism preparedness and response. Other recent laws address various homeland security issues such as transportation security, border security, bioterrorism, maritime security, and terrorism insurance. The 109th Congress may address important state and local homeland security policy issues, including unmet emergency responder needs, proposed reduction in federal homeland security assistance, state and local risk assessment factors, absence of emergency responder equipment standards, development of homeland security strategies, and limited state and local officials with security clearances. These issues highlight critical homeland security needs and policy questions post-September 2001. The primary state and local homeland security issue is the unfair distribution of federal homeland security assistance. This report does not address this issue but refers to a separate report for information on FY2006 grant allocations and distribution formulas. The FY2006 Homeland Security Grant Program guidelines cover various programs and authorized equipment, training courses, and exercises. The Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) provides a list of authorized equipment, training courses, exercises, and planning activities for states and localities. However, it does not address the hiring and retention of emergency responder personnel or interoperable communications, which are considered crucial needs. Hiring and retention funding for law enforcement, fire departments, and emergency managers is available through separate federal programs such as the DOJ's Community-Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG), as well as the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant Program (SAFER). The hiring and retention of personnel is a key homeland security need, as highlighted by state and local officials and emergency responders. Federal funding is necessary to expand the number of firefighters and police officers for terrorism preparedness and response. In 2005, 50 House Members requested a significant increase in funding for emergency responder agencies to address the lack of resources for hiring new personnel. Members sent a bipartisan letter to the President requesting a budget increase for hiring first responders. Despite opposition from DHS Secretary Tom Ridge, Congress should consider allowing federal funding for hiring and retaining emergency responders to enhance homeland security efforts. In February 2005, the Administration proposed reducing funding for COPS and eliminating JAG, which was met with displeasure from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. This could impact state and local homeland security capabilities by reducing federal funding for hiring and retaining emergency responders. Bills in the 109th Congress aimed to provide funding for overtime expenses related to homeland security. The bills in the 109th Congress aim to provide funding for overtime expenses related to homeland security activities, but do not authorize federal funding for hiring and retaining emergency responders. The National Governors Association survey shows that only 22% of states have developed statewide interoperability communications, with 73% still in the process. The Interoperable communications equipment is a priority for emergency responder entities, and the FY2006 HSGP guidelines allow states and localities to purchase such equipment. The National Governors Association (NGA) emphasizes the need for statewide interoperability for emergency responders, citing challenges in funding and time. States are urged to upgrade equipment or install software for communication compatibility. NGA suggests that additional grant funding would help acquire new technology for interoperability. Despite this, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not allocated specific grant funding for communications equipment, raising concerns about recognition of the need for interoperable communications at the state and local levels. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction in federal homeland security assistance funding, including a $350 million cut for SHSGP. This reduction could impact states' ability to fund interoperable communications, a critical national priority. States and localities are facing challenges in funding their homeland security needs. In FY2005, Congress appropriated $3.61 billion for state and local homeland security assistance. The FY2006 budget proposes a reduction to $3.36 billion, with no line item funding for LETPP. States and localities are required to allocate 20% of SHSGP and UASI funding for LETTP activities, potentially reducing funding for equipment, training, and planning. The Administration's budget proposal for FY2006 includes a reduction in funding for state and local homeland security activities, with a cut of 30% for FIRE grants. Priority would be given to applications enhancing counter-terrorism capabilities, with funding available for training, vehicle acquisition, firefighting equipment, and personal protective equipment. Activities such as wellness/fitness and fire station modification would not be funded under the proposal. The House Appropriations Committee recommends $600 million for firefighter assistance, including $550 million for fire grants and $50 million for SAFER Act grants, disagreeing with the Administration's proposal to prioritize terrorism. The committee also recommends a total of $3.19 billion for federal homeland security assistance, a reduction of $420 million from FY2005 funding. Some argue for maintaining state and local homeland security programs despite funding reductions. States need more funding for interoperable communications systems to meet national preparedness goals. Reducing funding may hinder efforts to implement national priorities like NIMS and NRP, enhance regional collaboration, and strengthen CBRNE detection and response capabilities. The President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-8 (HSPD-8) on December 17, 2003, directing the establishment of first responder equipment standards to support national preparedness. Currently, DHS has only issued standards for personal protective gear and radiation/nuclear detection equipment, lacking standards for other types of equipment. The Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute and the Department of Justice recommend establishing first responder equipment standards for terrorist attack preparedness. The National Task Force on Interoperability suggests standards for communications equipment to address interoperability issues. The FY2006 HSGP guidance provides a list of authorized equipment but lacks equipment selection standards. H.R. 1544 and S. 21 may require standards implementation. The lack of equipment standards in H.R. 1544 and S. 21 may lead to states and localities purchasing incompatible equipment for homeland security needs. Access to classified information may be necessary for officials to effectively plan and respond to terrorism threats. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides security clearances to state and local government officials to help them plan and execute homeland security activities. Currently, 325 officials have DHS-sponsored clearances, with 250 more in the process of receiving them. DHS processes clearance requests submitted through states' Office of Homeland Security. One mayor from New York State and four mayors from Hawaii have requested clearances. Governors are granted clearances after signing a non-disclosure agreement. Other federal departments also provide security clearances to state and local officials. The FBI and Department of Defense provide security clearances to state and local officials, but the exact number is unknown. This lack of clarity may hinder the ability of federal agencies to share classified information with states and localities, impacting their preparedness for terrorist attacks. Coordination between government entities could also be affected. Security clearances are a hindrance for state and local officials, as well as port security officials, in sharing homeland security information. Delays in obtaining security clearances have been reported by the Government Accountability Office, attributed to a lack of coordination within the U.S. Coast Guard."
