SEC. 1045 allows for the rollover of gains on small business investments under certain conditions. The section allows for nonrecognition of gain on the sale of eligible small business investments if the taxpayer elects. Gain is only recognized if the amount realized exceeds the cost of other eligible investments purchased within 6 months, with certain definitions and rules applying. The term 'eligible small business investment' refers to stock or partnership interest in a domestic entity issued after December 31, 1996, meeting specific criteria. This includes being a qualified small business entity at the time of issuance and acquired by the taxpayer directly or through an underwriter in exchange for money, property, or as compensation for services. The taxpayer must hold stock or partnership interest for at least 6 months before selling it. The entity must meet active business requirements for the investment to be considered eligible. The term 'qualified small business entity' refers to a domestic corporation or partnership with aggregate gross assets of less than $25,000,000 before and after the issuance of interest. The active business requirement for a qualified small business entity under subsection (b)(3) mandates that the entity must be actively engaged in a trade or business, with at least 80% of its assets used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business. This requirement is not met if the entity falls under certain categories outlined in section 1202(e)(4). For certain activities related to startup, research, or in-house research expenses, an entity will be considered engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. This determination is made without regard to specific sections outlined in the law. Rules similar to those in section 1202(e) apply for determining eligibility without considering current gross income. Other rules from section 1202 also apply, with a 6-month holding period instead of 5 years. Any unrecognized gain from a sale will reduce the basis of eligible small business investments acquired within 6 months. The statute of limitations for assessing deficiencies on gains from eligible small business investments is extended to 3 years if the taxpayer notifies the Secretary about their purchase of other investments resulting in nonrecognition of gain.
