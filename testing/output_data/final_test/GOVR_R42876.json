    "content": "The passenger airline industry in the United States has undergone significant changes since deregulation in 1978, allowing airlines more freedom in operations. Competitive forces, higher fuel prices, and changing travel patterns have led to financial pressure, resulting in mergers and bankruptcies. To stay competitive, airlines have formed alliances and outsourced aircraft maintenance. This practice is not limited to U.S. airlines, as many foreign carriers also outsource maintenance work. Many U.S. passenger airlines outsource maintenance work, including to foreign countries like China and El Salvador, raising concerns among Members of Congress. This report analyzes trends in outsourcing, safety implications, employment effects, and regulatory issues. MRO activities include airframe heavy maintenance and engine repair and overhaul. Engine maintenance involves off-wing repair and replacement of parts to restore the engine to operational condition. Component MRO focuses on repairing components essential for air flight. Line maintenance includes regular checks to ensure aircraft readiness for flight. Aircraft maintenance accounts for nearly 10% of U.S. passenger airlines' operating costs. The 10 major U.S. passenger airlines reported collective maintenance expenses of $10.2 billion in 2008 and $10.1 billion in 2009. The percentage of work outsourced has increased from approximately 20% in 1990 to over 44% in 2011. Major carriers sent 71% of their airframe heavy maintenance to outside repair stations in 2007, up from 34% in 2003. The share of airframe heavy maintenance outsourced to foreign repair stations increased from 21% in 2003 to 27% in 2007, indicating a rise from 7% to 19% of all airframe heavy maintenance being done at foreign facilities during that period. Data on MRO outsourcing is limited, but research suggests that North American MRO outsourcing trends mirror global patterns, with a significant amount of heavy maintenance work being done by outside providers. The majority of aircraft engine work stays in North America or Western Europe, while heavy maintenance is often outsourced to Asian and Pacific countries like China. North America had a $2.4 billion trade surplus in aircraft MRO services in 2008, with positive balances in engine overhaul and component maintenance. All airlines outsource some of their aircraft maintenance, with newer carriers outsourcing a large portion. Some newer carriers outsource a large part of their maintenance, especially labor-intensive airframe heavy maintenance. American Airlines is outsourcing some heavy maintenance work, leading to the elimination of 2,000 jobs. The impact of offshoring MRO on U.S. employment is uncertain, with maintenance jobs at passenger carriers decreasing from 72,211 in 2000 to 50,580 in 2011. The reduction in maintenance jobs at U.S. airlines from 72,211 in 2000 to 50,580 in 2011 reflects the overall trend of decreasing employment in the passenger airline industry. This reduction is in line with the decrease in total airline employee count, which could be attributed to carriers reducing fleet size and replacing older aircraft with more advanced ones due to economic uncertainty and rising fuel prices. The mainline carrier fleet decreased by 16.7% to 3,739 aircraft, while regional carriers also reduced their fleet to 2,567 units in 2011. The regional carrier fleet decreased by 46 units to 2,567 units, its lowest level since 2003. From 1990 to 2011, airline maintenance workers accounted for about 10% of the total workforce in the passenger airline industry. During the recession in 2009, total airline workforce and airlines' MRO employment dropped significantly. Outsourcing has likely led to new jobs at maintenance companies not affiliated with airlines. Data on employment at third-party maintenance providers for passenger airlines is not compiled by BTS or BLS. The category \"Other Air Transportation Support Activities\" had over 96,500 employees in 2011, slightly increasing since 2009. The employee count in the \"Other Air Transportation Support Activities\" group was over 96,500 in 2011, slightly increasing since 2009. Airlines use foreign maintenance providers for cost savings, with labor costs in countries like China and El Salvador being less than 50% of those in the U.S. This has led many airlines to shift their heavy maintenance visits overseas. Carriers have shifted heavy maintenance visits overseas for cost savings, with Aeroman in El Salvador offering lower labor costs compared to the U.S. Hiring out MRO services helps airlines avoid capital investment in facilities and equipment. Aeroman's facilities include four hangars with 11 production lines for narrow-body aircraft. The Chinese MRO sector has benefited from significant state investment in airport construction and expansion. The aerospace industry has contributed to the growth of global aviation networks by designing more efficient aircraft. The real cost of air travel has been reduced by over 60% in recent decades. The cost of air travel has decreased by over 60% from 1970 to 2010 due to deregulation and the rise of low-cost carriers, making it more affordable for global populations. The global passenger air travel network in 2010 included 1,500 airlines, 24,000 aircraft, and 4,000 airports. International air travel in and out of the United States doubled between 1990 and 2011, with U.S. airlines operating 830,600 international flights carrying 92.5 million travelers. This expansion of route networks simplified and reduced costs for aircraft maintenance in foreign countries. Global aircraft MRO is a $50 billion market in 2012, with engine MRO being the largest segment. North America and Europe are the largest MRO markets, while the Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing segment. OEMs hold approximately 42% of the MRO market share. The leading aircraft manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) and primary aircraft engine OEMs (GE Aircraft Engines, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce PLC) dominate the market. They provide engine overhaul, repair, and fleet management services, with a strong presence in fast-growing aviation markets like China. Major airlines and their MRO subsidiaries control 49% of the market, while third-party providers hold 9%. The commercial airline fleet in China doubled between 2000 and 2010, with Chinese airlines expected to purchase more aircraft between 2010 and 2028. Chinese airlines are expected to purchase 3,770 new airplanes between 2010 and 2028, with a market value of $400 billion. The MRO sector in China has grown with government investment and incentives from the CAAC. By the end of 2010, there were 389 aircraft MRO companies in China, with over 30 certified by the FAA or EASA. Additionally, 331 foreign repair providers were certified by China to work on airplanes operated by Chinese air carriers. The Chinese MRO sector had $2.3 billion in revenue in 2010, with Chinese companies lacking technological sophistication for high-value MRO projects. Chinese airlines send 70% of engine overhaul work to foreign-owned companies due to a shortage of MRO professionals. China's civil aviation sector needs at least 24,000 more technicians by 2015. There is a significant knowledge and experience gap in existing MRO employees in China, with a shortage of inspectors overseeing their work. Major foreign OEM and MRO companies like Boeing and Airbus provide training to maintenance technicians in the country. Boeing Shanghai Aviation Services Co. Ltd. is a joint venture performing various maintenance services for airplanes. Boeing has provided professional training to Chinese aviation professionals since 1993, improving skill levels of maintenance workers. Boeing Shanghai Aviation Services expanded training capacity for the 787 Dreamliner. AMECO Beijing, a joint venture between Air China and Lufthansa, offers MRO services and training in China. Taikoo is another major MRO provider in China. Taikoo Aircraft Engineering Company (TAECO) is a major MRO provider based in Xiamen, China, with a 58.55% stake controlled by Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co. (HAECO). Customers include American Airlines, Delta Airlines, FedEx, Air Canada, Korean Air, and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, British Airways, and Air France/KLM. Safety concerns were raised in November 2011 when screws were found missing from an Air France Airbus A340 after routine maintenance in China. Another incident in 2010 involved a Boeing 747 grounded due to flammable paint applied during maintenance in China. On December 1, 2011, Air France halted aircraft maintenance at TAECO in China due to safety concerns related to flammable paint. El Salvador is a key player in aircraft maintenance for U.S. airlines, with three FAA-certified repair stations and significant growth in servicing narrow-body jets. Aeroman, TACA International Airlines, and AvioTechnology are some of the major facilities in the country. Aeroman is a major aircraft maintenance facility in El Salvador, specializing in installing remanufactured brakes and wheels. It is 80% owned by Aveos Fleet Performance Inc. and provides MRO services for U.S. airlines like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue. Aeroman has been certified by the FAA since 1992 and has faced scrutiny for alleged deficiencies in maintenance practices. Incidents involving improper installation of door components and seals and wiring errors were discovered at Aeroman, a major aircraft maintenance facility in El Salvador. The errors led to FAA-issued violations against US Airways and Aeroman. Wiring errors on two aircraft caused engine monitoring gauge cross-wiring, potentially leading to pilot confusion. Despite these incidents, no additional Aeroman maintenance issues have been reported in the media. Newly hired mechanics at Aeroman reportedly earn about $2 per hour, while experienced mechanics earn around $5 per hour, considered high-paying in San Salvador. Employees at Aeroman in San Salvador, a high-paying aircraft maintenance facility, face challenges such as time pressures, poor training, and language barriers. Despite concerns raised by workers and experts, Aeroman CEO Ernesto Ruiz emphasizes the company's commitment to quality service. Safety issues at foreign repair stations have been a longstanding concern, with a U.S. passenger plane crash in 1995 attributed to faulty repair work done abroad. The crash of a U.S. passenger plane was linked to faulty repair work done abroad, raising concerns about quality control, regulatory oversight, mechanic skills, training, and supervision. Airlines aim for high-quality outsourced maintenance to prevent delays and cancellations. The industry believes that the emphasis on safety is enough to ensure top performance at foreign repair stations. Airlines for America referenced NTSB data to support this. Airlines for America cited NTSB data showing that maintenance-related accidents have declined despite increased outsourcing to global providers. The industry's safety record remains strong, with no evidence of offshore MRO services being unsafe. Comprehensive research found no link between maintenance outsourcing rates and aircraft accident rates from 1996 to 2008. Some safety experts caution against assuming outsourced maintenance is always safe. Some safety experts caution that the absence of a link between outsourced maintenance and safety is not conclusive evidence that offshoring maintenance work does not have safety implications. FAA does not track in detail where airline aircraft are maintained and exercises limited oversight of foreign repair stations. Former NTSB board member John Goglia expressed concern about critical maintenance work being performed with little FAA review, especially at foreign repair facilities. Statistical analysis of the relationship between airline service reliability and maintenance outsourcing is inconclusive. Consumer Reports magazine reported a steady increase in outsourced maintenance and airline flight cancellations from 2002 through 2004. The report highlighted a correlation between outsourced maintenance and airline-caused delays among major U.S. carriers in 2005. However, it is unclear if maintenance outsourcing directly caused cancellations and delays, as other cost-cutting measures may have contributed. Airlines using Boeing jets showed improved mechanical dispatch reliability from 98.1% in 1991 to 98.9-99.0% in 2008-2009. The data show consistent improvement in airline maintenance reliability over the past three decades, but the exact relationship between outsourcing practices and maintenance dispatch reliability is unclear due to cyclical fluctuations. Newer aircraft reliability may be the primary factor influencing dispatch reliability, masking trends related to outsourcing practices. FAA regulates maintenance of U.S. air carrier aircraft at foreign and domestic locations through Part 145 repair stations. To be certified under Part 145, a repair station must develop FAA-approved documentation and processes, including quality control procedures and training programs. FAA may approve foreign repair stations based on a foreign certification from a country with a bilateral aviation safety agreement. FAA reviews and recertifies foreign repair stations annually or every two years, while domestic repair stations can retain certification indefinitely unless safety concerns prompt FAA to suspend or revoke it. Oversight for foreign repair stations is mainly conducted by foreign regulatory entities under bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement with the European Union. Key differences in FAA regulatory requirements for domestic and foreign repair stations are outlined in Table 1. Regulatory requirements for foreign repair stations are more stringent than those for domestic repair stations. FAA's resources for inspecting foreign repair stations are limited, with only 10 international field offices overseeing almost 700 foreign repair stations. Only 2 of these offices are located outside the United States. In 2008, the DOT OIG found that FAA's system for targeting inspections of foreign repair stations was inadequate, relying too heavily on incomplete voluntary reporting and varying quality of air carrier audits. FAA inspectors overseeing air carrier maintenance are responsible for ensuring compliance with regulations and approved procedures. The DOT OIG raised concerns about delays in inspecting approved maintenance providers for air carriers, especially in foreign repair stations. They highlighted logistical challenges, procedural barriers, and the imbalance in FAA inspector staffing. The process of obtaining visas for inspections gives foreign facilities advance notice, making surprise inspections impossible. The DOT OIG raised concerns about FAA inspector staffing imbalance, especially with airlines outsourcing maintenance overseas. Despite efforts to revamp staffing, issues persist in targeting repair station surveillance effectively. Surveillance at foreign facilities lacks rigor, hindering identification of deficiencies and verification of corrective actions. The DOT OIG found persistent issues in mechanic training, tool calibration, and work documentation at both foreign and domestic repair stations. Foreign regulatory agencies play a crucial role in overseeing maintenance on U.S. air carrier aircraft overseas through bilateral aviation safety agreements. The U.S. has agreements with about 28 countries and a comprehensive multilateral agreement with the EU. The EU and the United States have detailed agreements for maintenance oversight, while countries like El Salvador and China lack formal aviation safety agreements. The FAA relies on its own oversight for monitoring safety compliance in these countries. The DOT OIG found that inspection documentation by foreign authorities often lacked completeness and focused only on European regulations, missing FAA requirements. Inspections were sometimes not conducted in English, and FAA inspectors fluent in the foreign language were not assigned to review the documents. This raised concerns about FAA's ability to verify that facilities met its standards. The report did not address whether these issues have been resolved in the past decade. Provisions in the 2012 FAA reauthorization act address concerns over bilateral aviation safety agreements, requiring FAA to ensure foreign repair stations are subject to appropriate inspections consistent with U.S. requirements. The act also mandates annual inspections at all foreign repair stations. Airlines conduct thorough reviews and inspections of contract repair shops before awarding contracts. The FAA requires rigorous oversight of contract repair shops to maintain safety standards. Airline oversight includes preliminary investigations, on-site visits, inspections, and audits. However, in 2008, two major air carriers did not document spot inspections or track repair station errors effectively. On-site personnel presence during repair operations varied from 35% to 70% of the time. The DOT OIG audit found that on-site personnel presence during repair operations varied from 35% to 70% of the time, with the number of personnel ranging from 3 to 22 at different repair stations. Manufacturers have a regulatory responsibility to disseminate maintenance information for airworthy operations, and some have established global MRO networks, such as Airbus with 18 repair stations worldwide. Boeing is involved in joint ventures with various MRO service providers globally, including Aeroman in El Salvador, HAECO in Hong Kong, TIMCO Aviation Services in the US, Lufthansa Technik AG, and Mexicana MRO Services. They are also developing partnerships with Air India in Nagpur, India. Engine manufacturers like Lufthansa Technik and GE Aviation have also established long-term service agreements. GE Aviation has a strong MRO network in Asia and Europe. The MRO industry is seeing a shift towards larger specialty centers and greater standardization of global services, potentially leading to increased offshoring. Manufacturers' involvement in maintenance operations is causing concerns for independent MROs regarding access to technical data and parts. These changes will have significant implications for U.S. air carrier maintenance practices. The MRO industry is undergoing global changes that may impact regulators. The FAA is now focusing on airlines' maintenance activities alongside their air carrier certificates. Concerns have been raised about pay rates for foreign repair station workers, with reports of low annual salaries but higher hourly rates for skilled mechanics in Central America. In Central America, wages for aircraft maintenance workers are lower compared to the United States, with hourly rates averaging $36, but the per capita GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity is significantly lower at around $7,500. In Singapore, wages for aircraft engine mechanics are higher at roughly $31,600 annually, but the per capita GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity is considerably higher at $57,900. This wage imbalance poses challenges for U.S. workers competing in the global marketplace for skilled work as airline mechanics. Foreign repair stations offer high-paying jobs for airline mechanics, attracting competition in Latin American countries. However, in high-growth Asian countries like Singapore, advanced technical skills are in demand in other fields offering higher wages. Concerns arise regarding the skill and experience of maintenance workers at foreign MROs. Some countries support MRO employment growth through technical training programs, like the one offered by Universidad Don Bosco in El Salvador. In 2005, Aeroman workers raised concerns about young, unqualified workers and politically connected hires. They believe they could do a better job if certified. Advanced technical skills, especially in engine maintenance, are crucial in aircraft maintenance. The United States has an advantage in advanced maintenance capabilities compared to other countries outsourcing routine maintenance. However, this advantage could diminish if offshore maintenance centers in Asia and Central America invest more in technical training. Offshore maintenance centers in Asia and Central America are increasing investment in advanced technical training. FAA-certificated mechanics are essential for overseeing and certifying work on U.S. civil aircraft. Larger foreign repair stations rely on FAA-certified mechanics for front-line supervision, while smaller facilities may not have certificated mechanics. Labor unions in the United States have concerns about the ratio of certificated to non-certificated mechanics at foreign repair stations. The Transportation Workers Union of America reported a concerning ratio of FAA-certified to non-certified mechanics at larger foreign repair stations. Data from selected FAA-certified Part 145 repair stations confirm these ratios. However, it is important to consider that workers at foreign locations may be certified by different regulators and may work on aircraft from various countries. Foreign repair stations may have a small number of FAA-certificated mechanics, which could be due to working on aircraft from multiple countries. Concerns have been raised about the lack of English language proficiency among repair station workers, especially in developing countries like El Salvador. FAA requires demonstrated English proficiency for maintenance workers. FAA requires demonstrated English proficiency for certificated mechanics and repairmen. Applicants must demonstrate reading, speaking, writing, and comprehension skills in English as part of certification testing. These requirements apply to mechanics and repairmen at foreign and domestic repair stations. Repair stations must ensure supervisors and inspection personnel understand English, but there is no formal requirement for specific English-language skills for other workers. FAA does not have regulations on the number of certificated personnel at foreign repair stations. The FAA requires English proficiency for certificated mechanics and repairmen, including reading, speaking, writing, and comprehension skills. Lack of English proficiency may hinder foreign repair station workers from obtaining FAA certification, especially in developing countries like El Salvador. English is crucial in aviation, including air traffic control communications and aircraft maintenance manuals. Increasingly, maintenance documents are published only in English, and computerized aircraft systems have English-only interfaces. Technological advancement drives the need for English proficiency in aircraft maintenance, especially for advanced avionics. However, less technical tasks like interior refurbishing may not require English skills. Foreign repair stations offer cost savings for these tasks, but the language proficiency of skilled workers is not systematically studied. Repair stations are not obligated to report English proficiency except for FAA-certificated mechanics. Foreign repair stations are not required to report English language proficiency, except for FAA-certificated mechanics with inspection authority. While regulations in the past did not mandate drug and alcohol testing programs for workers in safety-sensitive positions at foreign repair stations, many countries have implemented their own programs. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines inclusion of safety-related positions in drug and alcohol testing programs and is working towards global harmonization in this area. ICAO has provided guidance for countries to develop policies to prevent substance abuse in the aviation workplace. Differences in drug and alcohol testing programs between the United States and countries with foreign repair stations may be influenced by privacy laws and other factors. Congress has been interested in overseeing foreign repair stations for over a decade, with the Vision 100\u2014Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act directing the FAA to strengthen oversight to ensure equivalent safety standards for domestic and foreign repair stations. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 included provisions for oversight of foreign repair stations, requiring the establishment of a safety assessment system by February 2013. This system would ensure that foreign repair stations are subject to appropriate inspections consistent with U.S. requirements. Additionally, agreements with foreign aviation authorities would allow for independent inspections of foreign repair stations when necessary. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 included provisions for oversight of foreign repair stations, requiring independent inspections when safety concerns arise. The FAA is mandated to notify congressional oversight committees within 30 days of initiating negotiations with foreign governments on maintenance safety agreements. Additionally, the FAA must issue an annual report on improvements in identifying and tracking air carrier maintenance locations, establish a staffing model for inspectors, and request drug and alcohol testing programs for safety-sensitive maintenance workers. The FAA is required to publish a proposed rule by February 14, 2013, for drug and alcohol testing programs at all Part 145 repair stations servicing Part 121 aircraft. Annual inspections at foreign repair stations are also mandated. U.S. airlines are sending aircraft overseas for repairs, but skilled maintenance workers in the U.S. working on foreign aircraft help maintain a positive trade balance. However, increasing competition and technical training opportunities overseas may impact this advantage. Maintenance offshoring may be offset by rising labor costs in developing countries. Improved data reporting by FAA and BTS would aid in analyzing MRO outsourcing trends. Policymakers consider safety measures to prevent job loss to offshoring, but this could impact maintenance work on foreign aircraft in the U.S. Many U.S. companies have repair stations abroad, while international companies also operate MRO facilities in the U.S. The globalization of the MRO industry has made it challenging to protect U.S. jobs through trade actions. Safety concerns about foreign repair stations maintaining U.S. aircraft have not been supported by solid evidence. Despite potential policy implications for jobs and safety, the U.S. has maintained a positive balance of trade in aircraft MRO due to its technological skills and training. The United States benefits from its leadership in high-skill maintenance and repair, but faces competition from countries investing in advanced training. FAA relies on foreign regulators for oversight of repair stations abroad, prompting a need for realignment of inspector resources. Increased oversight of repair stations in foreign countries is necessary due to the growing use of these facilities by U.S. air carriers. FAA may need to assign inspectors proficient in foreign languages and familiar with different cultures. Further action is needed to realign the FAA inspector workforce to adapt to changes in airline maintenance practices, especially regarding the lack of English-language proficiency among foreign repair station workers. Regulatory standards may be set for foreign repair stations to address the lack of FAA-certified mechanics. Considerations include the total numbers and ratios of certified mechanics to uncertified workers, focusing on stations working on U.S. airline aircraft. This analysis could help identify where additional English language skills are needed among personnel. Extensive work on U.S. air carrier aircraft is performed, requiring more reporting for better FAA assessment of mechanic numbers and oversight activities."
