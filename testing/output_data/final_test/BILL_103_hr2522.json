    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hypersonic Research Airplane Authorization Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that the development of a single-stage-to-orbit, air-breathing aerospace plane in the United States could reduce space payload delivery costs and boost the aerospace industry's competitiveness. Access to a hypersonic aerospace plane offers strategic advantages. The National Aerospace Plane Program has deviated from its original goal of developing a hypersonic research airplane with an air-breathing engine. The National Aerospace Plane Program aims to develop a hypersonic research airplane with an air-breathing engine to push the limits of flight envelope using existing technology. This will decrease technical uncertainty, size, and cost for building a single-stage-to-orbit airplane in the future.

The National Aerospace Plane Program aims to develop a hypersonic research airplane with air-breathing propulsion technology to collect data beyond Mach 8 speeds. The National Aerospace Plane is a single-stage-to-orbit airplane that uses air-breathing propulsion, reduces delivery costs to orbit, and can take off and land on a runway. The National Aerospace Plane Program aims to develop a hypersonic research airplane with air-breathing propulsion technology to collect data beyond Mach 8 speeds. The program extends flight envelope boundaries by flying at speeds that push the limits of technology. The term \"single-stage-to-orbit\" refers to technology enabling an aircraft to fly into orbit from a runway without expendable booster rockets. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Defense, and the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The term \"development\" encompasses design, construction, and initial testing. The National Aerospace Plane Program aims to develop a hypersonic research airplane with air-breathing propulsion technology to collect data beyond Mach 8 speeds. The program extends flight envelope boundaries by flying at speeds that push the limits of technology. Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Secretary and the Administrator must submit a plan to Congress for the National Aerospace Plane Program. The plan includes developing a hypersonic research airplane costing no more than $5 billion, with the first flight within 5 years. The objective is to achieve single-stage-to-orbit capability with this airplane or a follow-on research aircraft. The Administrator can collaborate with various entities for the hypersonic research airplane and National Aerospace Plane projects. $5 billion is authorized for fiscal years 1995-2000. No funds can be used until 60 days after the plan submission."
