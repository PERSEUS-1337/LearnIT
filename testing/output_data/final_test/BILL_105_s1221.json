    "content": "The \"American Fisheries Act\" includes provisions on the standard of ownership, anti-reflagging act exceptions, and the phase-out of certain vessels. The Act is divided into different titles, each addressing specific aspects related to fisheries management and enforcement. The Congress finds that non-United States citizens own and control many US flag fishing vessels, harvesting fishery resources that could be caught by US citizens. Norwegian and Japanese entities dominate the Bering Sea pollock fishery through ownership of US-flag vessels, which goes against the intent of the Commercial Fisheries Industry. The Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987 was misinterpreted, leading to an increase in foreign-rebuilt vessels in Alaskan fisheries. Coastal states have sovereign rights to manage marine resources in their waters, including the right for citizens to harvest the allowable catch. The United States prioritizes its citizens in harvesting the allowable catch within its exclusive economic zone. Foreign vessels can fish in US waters if US vessels lack capacity. Fishing vessels over 165 feet in length, with more than 750 gross registered tons or powerful engines, are less likely to avoid bycatch, have contributed to overfishing, and are often owned by profit-driven investors. The Act aims to establish ownership and control standards for US flag vessels in fisheries, phase out large fishing vessels, and prevent the issuance of new fishery endorsements that do not meet the ownership standard. The Act aims to establish ownership and control standards for US flag vessels in fisheries, phase out large fishing vessels, and prevent the issuance of new fishery endorsements that do not meet the ownership standard. It also prohibits Federal loan guarantees for the construction of new fishing vessels exceeding certain size and horsepower limits. SEC. 102 establishes ownership standards for US flag vessels in fisheries and prohibits Federal loan guarantees for new fishing vessels exceeding size and horsepower limits. The amendment clarifies documentation standards for vessels and sets ownership requirements for fishery endorsements, ensuring at least 75% of the controlling interest in an entity is owned by US citizens. The Secretary will use the Shipping Act to determine ownership. The amendment sets ownership requirements for fishery endorsements, stating that vessels owned by entities meeting the controlling interest requirements prior to the amendments do not need to comply with certain sections until eighteen months after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 103. ENFORCEMENT OF STANDARD. To comply with section 12102(c) of title 46, US vessels over 100 gross tons must submit an annual affidavit of US citizenship to the Maritime Administration. Ownership transfers are closely monitored, especially leases, charters, and mortgages. Regulations align with existing citizenship affidavit standards. The Administrator provides the Coast Guard with information on vessels meeting ownership requirements. The Secretary of Transportation establishes compliance rules for vessels under 100 gross tons and can revoke fishery endorsements. The Secretary of Transportation can revoke fishery endorsements for vessels based on compliance with ownership requirements. Regulations for implementation must be issued within 6 months, and appropriations are authorized for enforcement. Penalty provisions are also amended under title 46, United States Code. The Shipping Act, 1916 is amended to include a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for each day a documented vessel with a fishery endorsement engages in fishing within US waters if false information was provided during the endorsement application process. Additionally, the review process for vessel transfers under the Act is revised. Amendment to (46 U.S.C. 808(c)(1)) removes restriction on vessel operation as fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessel. SEC. 201. RESTRICTIONS ON BUILD AND REBUILD SAVINGS CLAUSE. SEC. 201. RESTRICTIONS ON BUILD AND REBUILD SAVINGS CLAUSE. Repeal of the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987 prohibits a certificate of documentation from being endorsed with a fishery endorsement for a vessel that does not meet specific requirements unless it had a fishery endorsement effective on September 25, 1997. Any fishing vessel with a fishery endorsement in effect on September 25, 1997 is subject to restrictions. Vessels eligible for a fishery endorsement must meet specific criteria: be over 165 feet in length, have over 750 gross registered tons, or have engines with over 3,000 shaft horsepower. Additionally, the vessel must have been built in the United States, purchased before July 29, 1987, rebuilt in a foreign shipyard before June 12, 1988, and issued a fishery endorsement before July 29, 1990. Ownership must also not be controlled by the same entity during these events. Entities seeking a fishery endorsement under section 12108 of title 46, United States Code, will be ineligible if there is a significant change in ownership after September 25, 1997. However, this restriction can be avoided if a fishery endorsement for another vessel with similar specifications and fishing activity is permanently surrendered. SEC. 202 of the Commercial Fishing Industry Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987 is repealed, with an effective date set for eighteen months after the enactment of the Act. The Commercial Fishing Industry Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987 is repealed, with restrictions on fishery endorsements for vessels over 165 feet in length, 750 gross registered tons, or with engines over 3,000 shaft horsepower. The Secretary of Commerce cannot allow fishing vessels over 165 feet in length, 750 gross registered tons, or with engines over 3,000 shaft horsepower to fish for Atlantic mackerel or Atlantic herring without specific approval in fishery management plans. Any permits issued before this restriction must be revoked within 5 days. The Secretary of Commerce restricts fishing vessels over 165 feet in length, 750 gross registered tons, or with engines over 3,000 shaft horsepower from fishing for Atlantic mackerel or Atlantic herring without specific approval. Owners of vessels meeting certain criteria can obtain a fishery endorsement for a replacement vessel in case of total loss after September 25, 1997, under specific conditions. The replacement vessel for a fishing vessel lost after September 25, 1997, must meet certain criteria: actively harvested fishery resources in the US exclusive economic zone, be of the same or lesser size as the lost vessel, have a fishery endorsement issued within 18 months, and qualify under US laws for a fishery endorsement. Fishing vessels exclusively targeting highly migratory species outside US waters are exempt from certain restrictions. SEC. 302 of the Fisheries Financing Act restricts the Federal Government from guaranteeing loans for fishing vessels over certain size and power limits."
