    "content": "Nuclear weapons will continue to be crucial for U.S. security policy, but maintaining current Cold War-era weapons is becoming challenging. Congress is considering three options: extending the service lives of current warheads, developing a new generation without testing, or resuming nuclear testing. This report focuses on the first two options. The report compares options for maintaining U.S. nuclear weapons: extending current warheads' service lives or developing a new generation without testing. Resuming nuclear testing is also discussed but not considered a separate option. The report discusses options for maintaining U.S. nuclear weapons, including extending current warheads' service lives and developing a new generation without testing. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) was established in 1993 to ensure the preservation of U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities without testing. NNSA requests $6,511.3 million for SSP in FY2008. The Reliable Replacement Warhead Program (LEP) aims to maintain warheads by replacing components with newly-fabricated ones while maintaining high confidence in current warheads for the long term. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program was initiated by Congress to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons and their components. NNSA executes the RRW program in cooperation with DOD. The Nuclear Weapons Council, in cooperation with DOD, oversees and coordinates nuclear weapon activities. A warhead Project Officers Group develops military characteristics for new warheads or modifications. Safety is the top priority, followed by security/use control. Other priorities include certifiability, cost, longevity, manufacturability, reliability, survivability, and yield. NNSA must also meet policy goals in designing or maintaining warheads. NNSA must meet policy goals in designing or maintaining warheads, including reducing the need for nuclear testing, improving safety and use control, designing for manufacturing and maintenance, fulfilling current mission requirements, upgrading the nuclear weapons complex, and reducing costs. A competition between New Mexico and California design teams was initiated by the Nuclear Weapons Council to create preliminary warhead designs. The Nuclear Weapons Council selected the California design for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program in March 2007. This warhead, now called \"WR1,\" aims to sustain U.S. nuclear weapons without testing. The development of nuclear weapons follows defined phases, with NNSA requesting funds for design definition and cost study in FY2008. The Navy-led RRW Program Office Group is conducting a design study with Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia National Laboratories refining the California design and estimating costs. The choice between LEP, RRW, or a combination will shape U.S. nuclear weapons for years. Congress decides on funding annually, including the move of RRW to Phase 3. Congress is unlikely to decide on Phase 3 in FY2008, with bills recommending holding RRW in Phase 2A. House passed bill provided no funds for RRW. The House appropriations bill (H.R. 2641) did not allocate funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW). Key issues surrounding RRW include cost uncertainties, technical challenges in design implementation, and uncertainties regarding the future Complex and stockpile requirements. Claims about the superiority of RRW over Life Extension Programs (LEP) lack substantiated data. Proponents of different approaches regarding nuclear warheads are urging for further studies on strategic policy and the need for a revised U.S. nuclear weapons strategy before committing to new programs. Congress is considering the establishment of a commission to assess U.S. strategic posture and set clear policy objectives. The commission's report on a revised nuclear posture review is due by December 1, 2008. Congress may delay RRW program decisions until after a new President reviews U.S. nuclear policy. Phase 3 work on RRW could potentially start in October 2010. The Review Act of 2007 requires the President to submit nuclear policy and posture reviews to Congress by specific dates. Funding for RRW is restricted until these reports are submitted. Some experts advocate for continuing research and development on RRW designs. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger supports RRW research, while George Shultz and Sidney Drell emphasize the importance of research for future construction decisions. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act sets a target date for the RRW first production unit (FPU) in 2012, but there is uncertainty about meeting this deadline. The Nuclear Weapons Council's planning target for the FPU is 2014 plus or minus two years. Barry Hannah believes a 2012 FPU is overly optimistic. Any delay in moving RRW to Phase 3 could slow down progress. The Nuclear Weapons Council's planning target for the RRW first production unit (FPU) is 2014 plus or minus two years. Delaying RRW Phase 3 could impact the FPU date. Goals for RRW include increased reliability, performance margins, and cost reduction. Designing an RRW with greater resistance to unauthorized use and using environmentally friendly materials can enhance safety and reduce costs in the long term. Designing warheads with materials that require less equipment, permit work outside high-cost buildings, and reduce waste streams can increase productivity. Ease of manufacture, assembly, and maintenance can save money by reducing process steps and equipment. Less rigid tolerances and wider design margins can lower costs by reducing rejected components and increasing throughput. Making warheads more resistant to terrorist attacks could slow the growth of security costs. Congress has not set a clear goal on whether RRW is to be a \"new\" nuclear weapon. The ambiguity surrounding the RRW program's goal is due to semantic differences between \"warhead\" and \"weapon.\" Congress has not clearly defined whether the RRW is considered a \"new\" nuclear weapon, with goals focused on improving existing weapons and infrastructure. The term \"weapon\" in the RRW program is ambiguous, as it could refer to a warhead or its delivery system. The goal of the program is to improve existing warheads, but NNSA could not achieve this by modifying current warheads due to design considerations from the Cold War era. Some warheads used a nuclear explosive package designed close to its failure point to maximize yield within weight constraints. NNSA is concerned about minor changes impacting NEP components in the Life Extension Program. Tight designs cannot accommodate drastic modifications for goals like increased safety and lower cost. Supporters of LEP are critics of RRW, with finer divisions of opinion existing. Raymond Jeanloz, a Professor at UC Berkeley, advises the U.S. government on technical aspects. Raymond Jeanloz, a long-time adviser to the U.S. government on security, supports some objectives of RRW but is concerned about its implementation. RRW supporters question aspects of its designs, but they are not necessarily critics of LEP. Los Alamos has found compelling RRW designs that provide added margin, surety, and manufacturability. They will follow the course of action decided by the Administration, Congress, and the DoD. The RRW program, supported by the Administration, Congress, and the DoD, aims to provide reliable replacement warheads. However, the term \"Reliable Replacement Warhead\" may no longer be appropriate as it implies current warheads are not reliable, which has been denied by Ambassador Linton Brooks. The program aims to replace existing warheads while maintaining reliability and compatibility with existing aeroshells and missiles. Multiple external reviews of the program are forthcoming. The House Appropriations Committee directed the JASONs to conduct an independent peer review of the competing RRW designs. The review should evaluate the recommended design against congressional requirements and DoD's military characteristics. It should also assess the feasibility of designing a new nuclear warhead without underground nuclear testing. The report was due on March 31, 2007. The JASONs, NNSA, and House Appropriations Committee set a schedule for a nuclear explosion test report. The preliminary report was submitted in late January, the executive summary in September, and the final report in October 2007. The American Association for the Advancement of Science studied the RRW's potential risks and infrastructure development. Another report on RRW's feasibility and implementation was mandated by the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act. The report mandated by P.L. 109-163, Section 3111, discusses the feasibility and implementation of the Reliable Replacement Warhead program within the Stockpile Stewardship Program. It analyzes how competing designs and Life Extension Programs aim to meet congressional goals. The report is currently in interagency coordination and has not been transmitted to Congress yet. The United States has maintained its nuclear weapons stockpile without testing through the Stockpile Stewardship Program, using various methods like nonnuclear experiments and computer simulations to ensure warhead safety and reliability. However, concerns have been raised that repeated Life Extension Programs may decrease confidence in the warheads, potentially necessitating a return to nuclear testing. The RRW program aims to increase confidence in warheads without the need for nuclear testing. Critics argue that existing warheads can remain reliable with careful attention and scientific advancements. Some believe that the lack of nuclear test validation for SSP tools could lead to false conclusions about the effectiveness of RRWs or LEP. The NNSA will not know if SSP, RRW, or LEP work without nuclear tests. Former LANL Director Hecker suggested one to two tests per year with yields of 10 kt or 1 kt. Sandia defines warhead reliability as achieving specified yield across various conditions. The sequence of environments for warhead service life includes temperature extremes, radiation, and acceleration. Designers aim for high reliability by maximizing margins and incorporating diagnostic systems to detect deterioration early. This approach is seen as more effective than relying on technologies and design choices made decades ago. Sandia and RRW advocates project increasing difficulty in maintaining the reliability of existing warheads as they age. LEP supporters argue that current warheads are reliable, evidenced by 12 stockpile assessments. Solutions emerge for problems, and SSP has been keeping pace. NNSA officials are gaining a better understanding of the complex processes underlying nuclear stockpile performance. LEP supporters challenge the idea that current warhead reliability must decline. LEP supporters question the belief that current warhead reliability will decline over time. They doubt if RRW will enhance reliability, citing potential birth defects and reliability issues. The JASON RRW report raised concerns about certifying WR1. The RRW report of September 2007 raised questions about certifying WR1, stating that certification is not assured and needs further development. NNSA Administrator Thomas D'Agostino mentioned that certification without new underground testing is a reasonable expectation, pending intensive peer review. Representatives Visclosky and Hobson emphasized the need to address serious questions before proceeding with the certification process. Some doubt the reliability of both LEP and RRW without testing due to concerns about how new warheads will function and the introduction of small changes that may undermine confidence. Margins, uncertainty, and confidence are crucial in assessing the risks of implementing RRW or LEP without nuclear testing. The design of a warhead includes margin, which is the excess performance built into the design to ensure reliability and avoid failure. Uncertainty arises from imprecise knowledge of design parameters, and confidence is the ratio of margin to uncertainty. LANL and LLNL have developed the Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties framework to formalize the relationship between margins, uncertainties, and confidence. The Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU) framework developed by LANL and LLNL is used to assess confidence in weapon performance without testing. The nuclear weapons program relies on building margins into warhead designs to identify performance risks. Current missile warheads prioritize explosive yield while minimizing weight, resulting in thin margins. For the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), DOD traded off yield for improved margin, safety, and control. Confidence without testing is gained using statistical metrics derived from nuclear testing. The labs used statistical metrics from nuclear testing data to ensure primary performance without testing. Designers adjusted CCRDs to increase margins for added confidence in the designs. This approach allows for increased margin to compensate for uncertainties, unlike LEP designs limited by the validated design envelope from nuclear testing. Critics of RRW argue that pushing the warhead beyond validated design limits could lead to increased uncertainty and potential \"birth defects\" in new designs. They suggest that maintaining margins through careful remanufacture of components and revising boost gas handling could be more effective than pursuing RRWs. Sandia study of stockpile surveillance found most problems in the first three years after FPU, fewer in years 4-11, and very few after year 12. RRW supporters argue LEP can also cause birth defects. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act required NNSA to collaborate with NAS for a study on Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties for nuclear stockpile assessment. The NAS is expected to deliver an interim report in March 2008 and a final report in August 2008 on the application of quantification of margins and uncertainty for nuclear weapons stockpile assessments. This information can be used for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program to reduce the need for underground testing of nuclear weapons. The key issues for nuclear weapons are ensuring the primary boost provides enough energy and that energy transfers successfully to the secondary. Improved margins and confidence in designs were previously based on nuclear testing data. The NM team rejected certain design concepts that fell outside validated parameters from past nuclear testing. The RRW/CA design has been nuclear tested and draws on over 100 other tests to ensure proper performance. Certification tools were developed to boost confidence in the RRW design. The RRW design draws on tested designs and incorporates additional margin to avoid potential issues with untested modifications. Concerns have been raised about moving beyond tested designs and the ability to accurately predict performance deviations. Advocates argue that RRW, based on a tested design with added margin, avoids \"excursions\" compared to LEPs which involve inevitable changes leading to deviations. Certification plans outline the process to certify warhead designs to DOD, with past methods involving computation, experiments, and nuclear testing. LEPs and RRW designs undergo certification before production, with RRW teams incorporating lessons from LEP certifications to focus on potential failure modes from the start. The CA team and LANL focused on designing the NM warhead with added margin and attention to potential failure modes to increase confidence in certification. Extensive evaluation of nuclear test data guided design choices to improve performance parameters and ensure robustness against failure modes. The high margin-to-uncertainty ratios facilitated certification through the QMU approach, supported by SSP tools like hydrodynamic facilities for testing warhead resilience to accidents and threats. LANL conducted hydrodynamic testing to certify the warheads' ability to withstand accidents and threats. RRW supporters argue that LEP certification is challenging due to the need to replicate original manufacturing processes closely. In contrast, RRW starts with a new design. The RRW design aims to create a warhead that can be certified without testing, using modern manufacturing processes selected for ease of certification. Some experts question if it can maintain the same performance confidence as current warheads. The challenge lies in determining how much can be interpolated from current design parameters. The RRW design aims to create a warhead that can be certified without testing, using modern manufacturing processes selected for ease of certification. Experts question if it can maintain the same performance confidence as current warheads. Critics argue that RRW and LEP diverge from reality, questioning the willingness of DoD to replace tested devices with untested ones. Livermore and Los Alamos are designing devices that can't be yield-tested. Supporters of LEP and RRW argue that nuclear tests are necessary to maintain confidence in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, while critics believe that these designs diverge from reality. The design teams are incorporating safety features and controls into their designs to address various accident and attack scenarios. LLNL and LANL are responsible for the nuclear explosive package design, focusing on inherent safety. Sandia National Laboratories has principal responsibility for the design of nonnuclear components, use control, safety, integration into warhead, and interfaces with missile or bomber. Stockpile weapons meet safety requirements, but nuclear detonation safety is not assured in abnormal conditions. Warheads without design features for \"Trinity condition\" may produce nuclear yield. The \"Trinity condition\" requires warheads to survive without nuclear yield, with a \"Trinity exception\" for those that don't. RRW designs aim to avoid this exception. The NM design uses optical isolation to meet the Trinity condition. Critics argue that current warheads are safe enough, and scenarios like Trinity are farfetched. Spending on new weapons to address unlikely scenarios is questioned, as no U.S. warhead has ever detonated accidentally. Current weapon systems have use control features designed to meet Cold War threats, such as the permissive action link. The 9/11 attacks changed use control requirements dramatically, adding a post-9/11 terrorist threat to the existing security concerns. The post-9/11 terrorist threat has increased security costs for nuclear weapons sites, shifting focus from containment to denial of access to warheads. New technologies and approaches are being considered to reduce physical security costs, with designs incorporating maximum safety and use control features. The CA design offers an unprecedented level of use control. The CA design provides an \"unprecedented level of use control\" and is considered \"revolutionary\" by LANL. New safety and use control features add cost and complexity, potentially reducing reliability slightly. Enhanced use control is crucial for the Air Force, especially for ICBM warheads outside silos, but would not replace physical security measures. The Air Force would maintain physical security even with RRWs, using a large security force. Enhanced use control features offer more security options but may slightly reduce reliability. Testing these features can build confidence in their value. The overall design of RRW may make field operations easier. It is too early for the Air Force to decide on dropping any safety and use control features. The Air Force is unsure about recommending dropping safety and use control features for warheads. Critics question the need for more use control as there has never been an unauthorized detonation of a U.S. warhead. Upgrading physical security or reducing weapon storage sites can improve use control. Some suggest using funds to secure Russian warheads instead. Others believe safety and use control should be increased, even willing to resume nuclear tests. Advocates for Resuming Nuclear Tests argue that advancements in safety and use control for nuclear weapons may be hindered without the ability to test. They believe that certain safety improvements will be limited without nuclear explosive testing, despite claims of revolutionary advances in safety and use control in new designs. The designs of new nuclear weapons prioritize safety and use control advancements, excluding some innovative designs that require testing. The use of insensitive high explosive (IHE) reduces the risk of accidental detonation, enhancing safety for production workers and military personnel. The first Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), WR1, aims to maintain military capabilities while incorporating IHE for increased safety. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) offers improved safety with insensitive high explosive (IHE) but requires more IHE than conventional high explosive (CHE) for nuclear explosion initiation. The W76 LEP currently uses CHE and switching to IHE would necessitate a move to RRW. Despite the safety benefits of IHE, supporters of the W76 LEP argue that the current warhead has a strong safety record since deployment in 1978. The drawbacks of transitioning to RRW are seen as outweighing the safety advantages of IHE. The labs prioritized \"physics first\" in designing warheads, focusing on minimizing weight by using hazardous materials and hard-to-manufacture components. Collaboration with plants increased in the 1990s, with a focus on ease of manufacture, cost reduction, and safety features. Designs now consider all aspects of a warhead's life cycle, including features that lower risks. The labs prioritize \"physics first\" in designing warheads, focusing on minimizing weight by avoiding hazardous materials and hard-to-manufacture components. Collaboration with plants in the 1990s emphasized ease of manufacture, cost reduction, and safety features. Current designs consider all aspects of a warhead's life cycle, aiming to reduce waste streams, harm to the environment, and improve worker safety. The goal is not just environmental sustainability but also contributes to easier manufacturing and cost reduction. New RRW manufacturing processes aim to reduce radioactive waste and hazardous material usage, while NEP components in LEPs must replicate original specifications, including the use of hazardous materials. Critics argue that LEP might achieve this goal differently than RRW. Both LEPs and RRWs aim to reduce waste and improve worker safety. LEPs may retain existing pits, while RRWs may require new pits. Nonnuclear components can use safer materials. NNSA could enhance waste reduction efforts for LEPs. Both designs aim to simplify processes, reducing worker radiation exposure and waste. Safety requirements have increased at Pantex, potentially limiting throughput. Safety concerns have been addressed in the design of both CCRDs. The design of Competing Candidate RRW Designs (CCRDs) at Pantex addresses safety concerns and aims to optimize production. The use of Insensitive High Explosives (IHE) in CCRDs improves safety, allowing for operations in both bays and cells. Pantex has 39 assembly bays and 7 cells for nuclear explosive operations, with cells used for more dangerous operations. RRW advocates claim that RRWs eliminate the need for hazardous materials and complex processes, while LLNL's new process for fabricating RRW pits reduces radiation waste. LLNL's new process for fabricating RRW pits reduces radiation waste and worker exposure. The CA design replaces hazardous materials with non-hazardous ones. Safety concerns at Pantex include electrostatic discharge risks. The NM design includes \"optical isolation\" to improve manufacturing safety. The NM design for RRW includes \"optical isolation\" to prevent electrostatic discharge risks and improve manufacturing safety. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board sees the RRW program as a potential substantial improvement in safety, although certain design attributes could introduce new hazards. The RRW design proposals aim to increase safety in nuclear weapon manufacturing by eliminating hazardous materials, simplifying processing steps, and reducing waste streams. Design attributes also address potential abnormal conditions like fire and mechanical impact to prevent explosive reactions or nuclear detonation. Critics argue that LEPs may enhance safety by manufacturing and replacing fewer components. Critics argue that LEPs may enhance safety by manufacturing and replacing fewer components. Safety of manufacture is improving through better building maintenance, worker training, and other means. Pantex has improved safety practices for handling high explosives, reducing manual lifting of explosive components and changing solvents. This focus on safety culture has led to very good and improving safety records, with no ESD events causing death or serious injury at Pantex. Pantex has a good safety record with no ESD events causing death or serious injury since 1977. Design priorities for CCRDs include minimizing assembly steps and relaxing tolerances to simplify manufacturing, increase throughput, and lower costs. Los Alamos provided examples of how CCRDs could facilitate manufacturing processes. The new process for manufacturing RRW pits at Pantex utilizes a direct casting process that reduces manufacturing time, cost, and floor space. The design minimizes the use of adhesives, reduces part count, and simplifies assembly and disassembly. This new process is expected to increase throughput and lower costs. LLNL's new process for fabricating RRW pits at Pantex aims to increase manufacturing efficiency by reducing assembly steps and workstations by 25%. The use of less hazardous materials simplifies manufacturing operations, such as establishing a Documented Safety Analysis for explosives work. Critics argue that LEP may offer manufacturing efficiencies, as discussed in a November 2006 study. The estimate of minimum pit life has been increased to 85-100 years or more, deferring the need for pit production for LEPs. Manufacturing improvements for warhead components can benefit both LEPs and RRWs. The ease of manufacture for RRWs compared to LEPs depends on various factors. For current warheads, 11 units of each type are removed per year for disassembly at Pantex. The current practice of removing 11 units of each warhead type per year for disassembly at Pantex imposes a burden on the Complex, Air Force, and Navy. In contrast, proposed designs aim for two surveillance removals per year through improved surveillance, non-destructive evaluations, and calibrated shelf life units. These units are identical to deployed warheads but are retained at the plants for comprehensive documentation and monitoring. Both teams are also considering embedding sensors inside the warheads. Laboratory sources suggest embedding sensors inside warheads to gather data on environmental conditions and weapon status, potentially reducing the need for disassembly. Competing designs also focus on ease of disassembly with modular design and minimal adhesives. No decision has been made on using these sensors yet. Critics argue that techniques for ease of maintenance in Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) could be applied to current warheads by replacing limited-life components with extended-life components. They express concerns about the accuracy of data from onboard sensors for diagnosing warhead problems, citing past incidents of material vulnerabilities. Robert Peurifoy from Sandia National Laboratories questions if embedded sensors would have detected these vulnerabilities. President of Technical Support at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, believes that accelerated aging tests are the best way to search for material incompatibilities. Critics are concerned that reducing the number of warheads examined each year in the RRW surveillance plan could lower confidence in reliability estimates. RRW may increase longevity by using materials with longer expected life and making surveillance and disassembly easier for problem detection and repair. However, long service life is not a primary focus of the program compared to LEP. NNSA's vision for the Complex of 2030 includes a continuous design/deployment cycle. NNSA's vision for the Complex of 2030 includes a continuous design/deployment cycle for warheads, with a focus on extending their lifespan through the Life Extension Program (LEP). RRW may offer some improvements in longevity, especially for hard-to-manufacture components, but it is not a major feature of the program. The goal of the LEP Program is to extend the stockpile lifetime of warheads or components by at least 20 years, with a target of 30 years. The B61 LEP and W76 LEP will each extend the life of their respective warheads by an additional 20 years. The W76 Life Extension Program (LEP) will extend the life of the warhead for an additional 30 years. Experts have high confidence in the LEP's ability to maintain current warheads. Supporters of LEP believe that as the Surveillance and Sustainment Program (SSP) improves, the ability to predict and resolve problems will also improve. The debate between RRW and LEP supporters revolves around the potential for unexpected degradations in warheads. RRW advocates argue that SSP may not be able to anticipate all issues, while LEP supporters believe that advancements in SSP will reduce the likelihood of LEP failure. The WR1 warhead, designed to replace the W76, aims to maintain current mission capabilities without introducing new nuclear effects or principles. It is not a low-yield weapon or bunker buster, focusing on matching the yield of the W76. The design prioritizes ruggedness for existing aeroshells and missiles, rather than tailored for new missions. The W76 warhead, first deployed in 1978, is the most numerous in the stockpile. Retaining existing warheads through Life Extension Programs (LEPs) would avoid the need for new ones and ensure the U.S. deterrent force remains strong. The ability to modify existing warheads or develop new ones for future missions is seen as essential for responding to potential threats. Resumed nuclear testing is suggested as a way to meet this need. The RRW designs aim to replace W76 LEP production to reduce competition. The designs maintain W88 characteristics for use in Mk5, avoiding the need for new aeroshells or missiles. Supporters of LEP argue for W88's reliability and extended lifespan. The W76 LEP production is seen as cost-effective and necessary for the stockpile. Supporters believe RRWs would complement LEPs well, as current warheads were designed with extensive nuclear testing and have been certified without further testing. The RRWs could potentially replace current warheads without nuclear testing, meeting post-Cold War requirements and congressional goals. The decision to replace warheads would depend on the success of the RRW program, perceived need for nuclear weapons, and support from Congress and the Administration. The Air Force questions the effectiveness of LEPs, stating they are complicated and not designed for current needs. The Air Force questions the effectiveness of LEPs, stating they are complicated and not designed for current needs. LEP components are made with archaic processes and hazardous materials, making disassembly difficult. Warheads deteriorate over time, with margins in some current warheads thin by design, raising concerns about reliability in the future. The Department of Defense (DOD) questions the ability of the Complex to execute Life Extension Programs (LEPs) as a long-term sustainment strategy. Critics argue that the cost of bringing back out-of-date processes and hazardous materials for LEPs must be weighed against the cost of designing, producing, and deploying thousands of Replacement Warhead (RRWs). The President annually approves the number of U.S. warheads in the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum, with the deployed warheads dependent on perceived military and political needs. DOD also retains nondeployed warheads to hedge against technical and geopolitical risks. The Replacement Warhead (RRW) is seen as a solution to hedge against technical and geopolitical risks in the nuclear weapons complex. Supporters believe that RRWs would be more reliable, easier to maintain, and quicker to manufacture in response to threats, leading to a reduction in nondeployed warheads. This approach also reduces the need for multiple warhead types as backups. The Replacement Warhead (RRW) is designed to be versatile, able to fit into different delivery systems with slight modifications. This flexibility allows RRWs to back up various types of warheads, reducing the need for multiple warhead types as backups. Supporters of RRWs argue that surveillance and life-extension programs have improved the ability to find and fix technical problems, reducing the necessity for many nondeployed warheads. Supporters of the Replacement Warhead (RRW) believe that too few RRWs would be built to arm both intended and alternate delivery vehicles, as building enough to arm both would contradict the goal of fewer nondeployed warheads. They argue that retaining nondeployed warheads is necessary to hedge against unforeseen geopolitical risks. Concerns have been raised about the consequences of reducing the nondeployed stockpile sharply and having fewer warhead types. Congress has long been concerned about the size, efficiency, and cost of the Complex, and how RRW and Life Extension Programs (LEP) will impact upgrading the Complex and maintaining its skill base. Analysts have noted the poor condition of production plants for decades. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and General James Cartwright emphasize the need to upgrade the aging nuclear infrastructure to ensure safety, security, and reliability of nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Posture Review of 2001 called for a responsive infrastructure as part of its New Triad. Thomas D'Agostino, NNSA Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, highlights the importance of the proposed upgrade for reducing the current stockpile of nuclear warheads. D'Agostino, NNSA Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, aims for responsiveness in addressing stockpile issues and emerging threats within 12 months. Proposed plans by the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board and NNSA suggest consolidating facilities and elements of the current Complex by 2030. The Complex would need to support current warheads and RRWs simultaneously, even if the United States proceeds with RRW. Supporters of RRW argue that it would allow for a more efficient Complex by simplifying production processes, reducing rejected parts, increasing throughput at Pantex, and enabling more manufacturing to be done away from costly floor space. They believe that RRW eliminates hazardous materials production units, leading to fewer and smaller waste treatment facilities. In contrast, they claim that LEP locks the Complex into existing designs, materials, and processes. Former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and former Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch emphasized the importance of infrastructure in deciding on RRW. NNSA has been upgrading the Complex to support LEP, receiving funds for the Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program. While RRW could enhance efficiency, LEP may require less new capability and capacity, with supporters questioning the need to dismantle warheads while building facilities for RRWs. Some argue that maintaining existing warheads may be more responsive than manufacturing new RRWs in large numbers. They question the need to modernize the Complex around RRW, fearing it may reduce diversity and increase the risk of failure in the nuclear stockpile. DOE, NNSA, and Complex staff emphasize the importance of utilizing the full range of skills in the Complex. The staff at the Complex believe it is crucial to utilize a complete set of skills to maintain readiness, which the RRW program offers but LEP does not. This comprehensive skill set is necessary to protect against technological surprises and design weapons with new military features. The RRW design program focuses on overall weapon design, including safety and security features, unlike LEP which only extends the life of existing designs. Sandia emphasizes that regularly exercising all skills in designing, testing, and producing complete systems ensures readiness to address urgent issues. The RRW program emphasizes the need for a complete set of skills to address unforeseen problems in the nuclear weapons complex. Livermore and Los Alamos agree that practicing all aspects of weapon design is crucial for readiness. RRWs are designed to be easier to manufacture, certify, and maintain, enabling a more responsive complex. The RRW program aims to enhance the responsiveness of the nuclear weapons complex by prioritizing easier manufacturing, certification, and maintenance of warheads. This approach allows for quicker replacement of problem warheads with more reliable ones, reducing the need for a large inventory of reserves to mitigate risks. The emphasis is on continuous design and deployment cycles to maintain a workforce capable of meeting current needs and not perpetuating outdated designs. LANL argues that the RRW approach, focusing on new design and production methods, would benefit the Complex workforce by improving recruitment, retention, and capability development. RRW challenges designers to balance various factors simultaneously, while LEP limits choices due to replication requirements. Advocates of LEP argue that it also exercises design and production skills to ensure minor changes do not cause issues elsewhere in the warhead. The need for production and certification expertise in making replacement components for life-extended warheads is highlighted. A report by the AAAS emphasizes that life extension employs similar tools and processes as new design. Retaining inactive warheads is seen as a more timely hedge compared to relying on a Complex in transition to produce enough RRWs. While RRW supporters argue for easier long-term maintenance, there are concerns about the inconsistency in their arguments regarding the service life and replacement of RRWs. RRW supporters argue for ongoing replacement of warheads to maintain design and production capabilities. LEP proponents suggest designing new warheads in small quantities to avoid reliability risks and production costs. They debate the cost-effectiveness of small builds versus large builds, with concerns about the total cost of the RRW program. RRW supporters argue for ongoing replacement of warheads to maintain design and production capabilities. The RRW program's total cost is uncertain due to various factors, but supporters believe that design features will reduce costs. The plan is to streamline stockpile designs for easier surveillance and maintenance, potentially lowering overall costs. Enhanced use-control features in RRWs could reduce security costs by modifying physical security practices. Design margins in RRWs make them more tolerant of flaws, reducing maintenance costs. RRWs are easier to disassemble and have fewer hazardous materials, lowering dismantlement costs. RRWs are more predictable in cost compared to LEPs due to new components. RRWs also result in fewer units undergoing maintenance or LEPs. Advocates of Life Extension Programs (LEPs) argue that maintaining existing warheads with considerable experience reduces costs, training, and equipment expenses. LEPs consume a small fraction of the total budget, for example $238.7 million (requested) for FY2008. Supporters doubt that Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) could significantly reduce costs due to existing experience. Advocates of Life Extension Programs (LEPs) question the cost-effectiveness of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) compared to maintaining current warheads. They are concerned that any potential savings from RRWs may not offset the high initial investment costs. Additionally, they argue that the savings from reducing nondeployed warheads could be jeopardized if more RRWs need to be built in response to unforeseen threats. Furthermore, they suggest that subsequent LEPs of the same warhead may cost less due to shared certification procedures, manufacturing processes, and materials. Advocates of Life Extension Programs (LEPs) question the cost-effectiveness of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) compared to maintaining current warheads. They argue that RRW maintenance costs would be significant if RRW had birth defects. Additionally, reducing the number of nondeployed warheads may not result in substantial savings for the Department of Defense (DOD). The Air Force stated that most of its costs for maintaining non-deployed warheads are fixed and not directly proportional to the quantity of weapons on hand. Cost will be a critical factor in the decision on LEP or RRW. There are serious questions about the validity of any 30-year life-cycle projection for RRW, including uncertainties about engineering details, Complex support for mixed forces, and the reconfigured Complex. Cost studies, even if preliminary, can provide value by highlighting relative costs and uncertainties that need resolution for a firmer cost estimate. The cost section of the RRW report mandated by Congress in the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act will require close attention as it aims to produce a firmer cost estimate. Various issues affecting the U.S. nuclear weapons enterprise, such as reliability, longevity, safety, security, and ease of manufacture, need to be considered. Goals like incorporating safety and use control features into RRWs can increase costs and complexity, potentially impacting reliability. Some goals may also impose design constraints that make it challenging to achieve other objectives. In some cases, the benefits of CCRDs may be questioned, and Congress may need to consider the weight given to this scenario. Past performance of CCRDs in avoiding accidental nuclear detonations does not guarantee future results. Benefits could be achieved through means other than warhead design, such as external features and systems. Congress may need to review key design tradeoffs and assess if current warheads are sufficient. DOD's support for RRW appears divided, with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review providing a mild endorsement. Congress, along with NNSA, Air Force, Navy, and others, must decide on safety and use control levels and tradeoffs for obtaining them. The Department is working with the Department of Energy to assess the feasibility and cost of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) system, which could lead to reductions in older warheads and help in the evolution to smaller nuclear weapons infrastructure. US Strategic Command strongly supports RRW as a key to transforming the aging nuclear weapons stockpile. General James Cartwright testified in 2006 in favor of RRW. The Department is assessing the feasibility and cost of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) system to sustain the nuclear weapons enterprise. Concerns raised include potential changes to handling procedures and links between missile and warhead. Advocates argue that RRWs will provide high confidence and reduce long-term burden compared to Life Extension Programs (LEPs). Congress may need to determine DOD leadership's support for RRW. Advocates of Life Extension Programs (LEPs) argue that they can extend the life of current warheads by 20 to 30 years based on improved understanding of weapons science. However, some believe that neither LEPs nor the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) can provide confidence in the stockpile without nuclear testing. A mixed RRW-LEP force may be necessary if the US moves to an all-RRW stockpile. The United States may face force issues if transitioning to an all-RRW stockpile due to the need for two types of warheads designed decades apart. Congress should consider methods for maintaining a reliable stockpile, challenges of deploying a mixed LEP/RRW force, and the implications of maintaining a test moratorium or resuming testing. Current warhead designs are preliminary, with potential manufacturing difficulties and design defects. Congress should inquire about gaps between current designs and actual warheads. The pit of a modern thermonuclear weapon is a hollow plutonium shell surrounded by chemical explosives. Rocky Flats Plant was the main site for pit production until 1989. Currently, PF-4 at LANL is producing W88 pits at a low rate, with plans to increase capacity to 10 pits per year by FY2007. NNSA aims to have 50 certified pits per year by FY2012. Plutonium decay affects pit life and influences the choice between RRW and LEP warheads. The pit life extension study by the JASON scientific advisory group found that there is no degradation in performance of warhead primaries due to plutonium aging, with most having credible minimum lifetimes exceeding 100 years. This extension may benefit Life Extension Programs (LEP) as current warhead pits are costly to build and involve hazardous materials. The JASON scientific advisory group found no degradation in warhead performance due to plutonium aging, with most having credible minimum lifetimes exceeding 100 years. Remanufacturing current warheads is costly and involves hazardous materials, requiring elaborate safety precautions. RRW supporters argue that RRW offers advantages over LEP in safety, use control, and cost efficiency. The need for increased pit production capacity is highlighted despite findings on pit life. NNSA's preferred plan, \"Complex 2030,\" includes a Consolidated Plutonium Center with a capacity of 125 pits per year to address stockpile aging and introduce RRW warheads by 2030. The need for increased pit production capacity is emphasized for introducing RRW warheads by 2030. LEP supporters challenge the idea of large pit replacements and slow RRW deployment due to new pit designs. LEP supporters believe that the introduction of RRWs justifies a new pit facility, allowing for a slower pace of deployment. They argue that retaining existing warheads with LEP and Stockpile Systems programs can delay the need for RRWs and a new pit facility, reducing costs and risks associated with technical and geopolitical threats. RRW supporters, on the other hand, advocate for a new pit facility for different reasons. RRW supporters argue for a new pit facility to increase capacity for producing multiple pit types simultaneously, addressing problems and threats more effectively than the current facility. They believe it may be more cost-effective to build a new facility rather than upgrade the existing one, doubting its ability to meet safety and security standards. Production capacity is seen as crucial for RRW regardless of pit aging. RRW supporters argue that using certified pits from retired warheads in RRWs would allow for faster deployment, regardless of the facility used. LANL considered pit reuse for RRWs to be beneficial in theory, as it would address production capacity issues and save money. However, pit reuse was ruled out for missile warheads due to design limitations and certification challenges. Reusing pits may be feasible for RRW bombs, as they offer more design flexibility and margin for safety and control improvements. Thomas D'Agostino, Acting Administrator of NNSA, discussed the potential reuse of pits from dismantled warheads for future reliable replacement warhead concepts. This approach would optimize limited pit production capacity and reduce costs, especially for bomb designs. However, challenges exist for missile warheads due to design constraints and certification issues. Some opponents argue that PF-4's capacity could be increased beyond 50 pits per year by reconfiguring production equipment. Significant Finding Investigations (SFIs) reveal defects in warheads that need to be addressed, similar to recalls in cars and laptops. SFIs are launched if serious defects are discovered during surveillance. Significant Finding Investigations (SFIs) are launched to address defects discovered during warhead surveillance. A review in the mid-1990s showed that significant defects were found one to two decades after a warhead entered the stockpile, with two conflicting interpretations: aging-related defects or the gradual discovery of flaws over time. Congress may inquire about these interpretations in relation to the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) deployment and its potential impact on warhead reliability. The curr_chunk discusses concerns about the reliability of warheads, potential risks introduced by new design approaches like RRW, and the need for updated reviews on warhead aging and defects. It also provides background information on nuclear weapons design and production. The primary stage of most tactical nuclear weapons is a two-stage design, with the primary being an atomic bomb triggering the secondary stage. The primary contains a pit with fissile material, surrounded by explosive to create implosion. Neutrons are injected to drive a chain reaction in the plutonium, leading to a brief nuclear explosion. The nuclear explosive package consists of the primary, radiation case, and secondary stages. Boost gas is injected to increase the fraction of plutonium fissioned, boosting the yield of the primary. Fusion reaction generates energy and boosts the fission chain reaction. The secondary stage releases most of the energy of a nuclear explosion. Thousands of \"nonnuclear\" components are also involved. The nuclear explosive package includes primary, radiation case, and secondary stages. Nonnuclear components are also necessary for weapon usability. The nuclear weapons complex consists of government-owned contractor-operated sites for design, testing, and manufacturing. The National Nuclear Security Administration manages the nuclear weapons complex and program, including sites like Pantex Plant and the Nevada Test Site. The Stockpile Stewardship Program aims to preserve US nuclear weapons expertise through advanced capabilities and experiments. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) involves work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring their condition, refurbishment, R&D, and dismantlement. It has three main elements: Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities. SSP aims to preserve US nuclear weapons expertise through advanced capabilities and experiments. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing nuclear weapons. Congress has set goals for the program, with funding allocated in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The program does not rule out the need for nuclear testing in certain circumstances, but the US has maintained its nuclear stockpile without testing since 1992. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program, established by P.L. 109-163, aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile. It also aims to prevent underground nuclear weapons testing and maintain design parameters without the need for testing. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear weapons testing. Goals include producing safer, more cost-effective warheads, reducing the stockpile size, and developing reliable replacement components. The committee sets forth additional goals for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, including utilizing modern design techniques and materials to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear arsenal. They recommend focusing on replacement warheads for Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles and aim to reduce the likelihood of nuclear testing by improving warhead design and manufacturability. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of preserving human capital in the nuclear complex. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to maintain expertise in designing and producing nuclear weapons to ensure the stockpile's reliability, safety, and security. The program's goals include increasing security and reliability, developing replacement components with more easily manufactured materials, and introducing replacements with high confidence in their safety and reliability. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to increase safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile by developing replacements with more easily manufactured materials and high confidence in their effectiveness. The program also aims to reduce infrastructure costs and increase responsiveness while supporting the goal of achieving the smallest stockpile consistent with national security. Most House Armed Services Committee Democrats outlined their criteria for supporting the RRW program in the committee's FY2006 report. They emphasized the need for the program to eliminate the need for nuclear testing, reduce the nuclear arsenal, avoid introducing new weapons for tactical purposes, decrease reliance on nuclear weapons, lower maintenance costs, enhance nuclear security, and promote the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The House Appropriations Committee supports an accelerated approach to implement a new nuclear weapons paradigm with the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program. This program aims to maintain a moratorium on nuclear testing, reduce the nuclear weapons stockpile, and transition to a more efficient weapons complex. The RRW weapon will be designed for ease of manufacturing, maintenance, dismantlement, and certification without nuclear testing, leading to long-term savings by phasing out outdated warhead designs. The Committee's qualified endorsement of the RRW initiative is based on the assumption that a replacement weapon will be designed only as a re-engineered and remanufactured warhead for an existing weapon system in the stockpile. The Committee does not endorse the RRW concept as the beginning of a new production program intended to produce new warhead designs or produce new weapons for any military mission beyond the current deterrent requirements. The Committee's support of the RRW concept is contingent on the intent of the program being solely to meet the current military characteristics and requirements of the existing stockpile. The RRW initiative aims to design replacement components for existing stockpile weapons with more readily available materials, ensuring safety and reliability without nuclear testing. This effort does not question the current stockpile's safety but acknowledges challenges in long-term sustainability. Implementation of RRW should reduce life-cycle costs for supporting the stockpile. The NNSA must adhere to military requirements and past nuclear test parameters for new weapon designs to support reducing the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The FY2007 committee reports did not add requirements for RRW design."
