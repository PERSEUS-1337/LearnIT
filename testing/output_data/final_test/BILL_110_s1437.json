    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act\". Congress acknowledges key events in the civil rights movement, including Rosa Parks' defiance on a segregated bus in 1955, college students initiating lunch counter sit-ins in 1960, and Freedom Rides challenging segregation in interstate transportation in 1961. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a prominent civil rights advocate who led the movement in the 1950s and 1960s for full civil rights for African Americans. He delivered his famous \"I Have A Dream\" speech during the March on Washington in 1963. His wife, Coretta Scott King, also played a significant role in the civil rights movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, influenced by Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., expanded civil rights protections, outlawed racial discrimination, and encouraged desegregation in public places and schools. It has served as a model for subsequent anti-discrimination laws. Equality in education was a cornerstone of the civil rights movement, with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. emphasizing the importance of education for shaping the future. The United Negro College Fund has supported over 300,000 young African Americans in earning college degrees, including successful individuals like Dr. King. The year 2014 will mark the semicentennial of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with leaders in various fields making major contributions to the civil rights movement. Congress has an obligation to lead America's fight against discrimination and ensure equal rights for all. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $1 coins with specific specifications, including weight, diameter, and composition. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The coins minted under this Act will symbolize the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They will feature inscriptions of the coin's value, the year 2014, and words like \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS.\n\nCoins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities.
