Different types of retail postal facilities include main post offices, post office branches, and post office stations, each with specific responsibilities in collection, delivery, and retail operations. The USPS provides postal services through various retail postal facilities, including main post offices, branches, and stations. Additionally, privately operated facilities like contract postal units and community post offices offer postal services in specific areas. The USPS provides postal services through various retail postal facilities, including main post offices, branches, and stations. The term \"USPS retail postal facilities\" encompasses post offices, post office branches, post office stations, community post offices, and contract postal units. The USPS's annual reports tabulate the number of these facilities at the end of each fiscal year. Data from FY1971 to FY2012 shows changes in terminology and categorization of facilities. The data is compiled into three categories: post offices (POs), post office branches and stations (POBs and POSs), and community post offices and contract postal units (CPOs and CPUs). The total number of USPS retail postal facilities has steadily declined from 42,287 in FY1971 to 34,784 in FY2012, a 17.7% decrease. The number of post offices (POs) dropped by 16.3%, while community post offices and contract postal units (CPUs and CPOs) declined by 45.4%. However, post office branches and stations (POBs and POSs) increased by 15.6%. The USPS has not specified how many facilities it plans to close in the future, with past announcements indicating potential closures of up to 3,105 and 3,652 retail facilities. The USPS planned to close approximately 10.2% of its retail facilities, including post offices, branches, and annexes earning low revenue. Closing these facilities could save over $200 million annually. Some facilities could be replaced by village post offices, similar to contract postal units, located within private retail outlets. The USPS planned to close retail facilities to save money. Village post offices within private retail outlets could replace some facilities. These post offices offer limited services like mail collection and stamp sales. The USPS has over 64,000 third-party postal retail locations. In response to a request from U.S. Senators, post office closures were suspended until May 15, 2012. The USPS aimed to preserve small rural post offices by reducing hours and postmaster positions. The USPS's \"Post Office Structure Plan\" (POStPlan) aims to review and possibly reduce the hours of service at 13,000 post offices by shrinking the cohort of postmasters. The plan has received approval from the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) and is set to be fully implemented by September 2014. The American Postal Workers Union has criticized the plan for potentially violating their collective bargaining agreement with the USPS, leading to arbitration between the two parties. The USPS has not clarified whether previous retail closure initiatives from 2009 and 2011 have been discontinued or which postal facilities have been or may be shut down. The USPS underwent restructuring in 1971 with the Postal Reorganization Act, replacing the US Post Office Department with the U.S. Postal Service. The number of retail postal facilities decreased by 1,281 between FY2008 and FY2012. The USPS is now considered a marketized government agency. The USPS, established by the Postal Reorganization Act in 1971, operates as a marketized government agency with greater operational freedom. It is mandated by Congress to maintain an efficient mail system nationwide and has specific powers to handle, transport, and deliver mail. The USPS is self-supporting but also required to serve the nation as a whole. The USPS, established in 1971, is mandated by Congress to operate as a self-supporting entity while also serving the public as a whole. This public service obligation requires the USPS to provide efficient postal services nationwide to bind the nation together through various forms of correspondence. The USPS is mandated by Congress to provide effective postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns. Small post offices cannot be closed solely for operating at a deficit. Congress also assigned the USPS general duties to receive, transmit, and deliver mail nationwide. The USPS is required by Congress to provide essential postal services to less densely populated areas and small towns. Federal postal law outlines the procedures for closing a post office, including providing adequate notice and considering the impact on the community served. The USPS must consider the impact of closing or consolidating a post office on the community, employees, government policy, economic savings, and other necessary factors. If a closure is decided, the USPS must notify affected persons, wait 60 days, and provide the findings used to make the decision. The USPS may close a post office after a 60-day notice period, and the closure can be appealed to the PRC within 120 days. The PRC can challenge the closure if it deems it arbitrary, without proper procedure, or lacking substantial evidence. The USPS has the final authority to close a post office, and it can use an emergency suspension process to cease service immediately. The USPS may close a post office immediately due to various reasons like lease cancellation, natural disasters, or mail security issues. Public can appeal closures to the PRC, but USPS only participates in appeals for post offices, not branches or stations. The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) can challenge USPS's decision to close a post office if it is deemed arbitrary, without proper procedure, or lacks substantial evidence. USPS has the final authority to close a post office, but PRC can require reconsideration. PRC also plays a role when USPS proposes changes affecting nationwide postal services. The USPS submitted post office closure proposals to the PRC for advisory opinions. The USPS may begin executing a proposal 90 days after submission. Job security varies for postal employees, with most protected from layoffs through collective bargaining agreements. The USPS's rural post office preservation effort announcement in May 2012 did not provide an estimate of possible job eliminations. Approximately 21,000 postmasters may be offered retirement. Approximately 21,000 postmasters may be offered retirement incentives. Three bills related to post office closures have been introduced in the 113th Congress\u2014 H.R. 630, H.R. 1016, and S. 316. H.R. 630, introduced by Representative Peter A. DeFazio, aims to reduce USPS's authority to close retail postal facilities and expand public notification requirements. H.R. 1016, the Community Post Office Relocation Act, introduced by Representative Scott H. Peters, aims to amend USPS's authority to sell post offices, extend public comment period, require explanation for closures, empower PRC to review closures, and restrict expedited closure processes. H.R. 1016, the Community Post Office Relocation Act, would allow eligible not-for-profit organizations to bid on post office buildings at fair market value if USPS wishes to relocate operations. The bill also includes provisions for negotiations, right of first refusal for USPS, and follows the closure process set by 39 U.S.C. 404(d). H.R. 1016 allows not-for-profit organizations to bid on post office buildings at fair market value for relocation. The impact of H.R. 1016 on USPS decision-making during post office closures is unclear. Senator Bernard Sanders introduced S. 316, the Postal Service Protection Act of 2013, which is similar to H.R. 630. Various bills in the 112th Congress addressed post office closures, with different approaches like H.R. 2309, H.R. 2692, S. 1668, and S. 1789, but none became law. Representative Darrell Issa introduced H.R. 2309, the Postal Reform Act of 2011, which included provisions to establish a Commission on Postal Reorganization (CPR) to recommend closures of USPS post offices and facilities to save $2 billion. Congress could prevent closure recommendations with a joint resolution of disapproval. The bill also capped the closure of small rural post offices at 10%. H.R. 2309 would cap the closure of small rural post offices at 10% and increase USPS's authority to close post offices. It aims to ensure effective postal services in rural areas and disallows public appeal for post office closures if a contract post office is nearby. Representative Albio Sires introduced H.R. 2692, the Access to Postal Services Act, to amend postal service closure procedures, including notification requirements and prohibiting emergency closures to avoid the prescribed process. Senator Jeff Merkley introduced S. 1668, the Protecting Rural Post Offices Act of 2011, to amend postal service closure procedures and prevent closures resulting in more than 10 miles distance between post offices. Senator Joseph Lieberman introduced S. 1789, the 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2012, which aimed to amend postal service closure procedures by considering additional factors and options, such as the impact on the community served, operating for reduced hours, and appointing a citizens service protection advocate. S. 1789 aimed to prevent USPS post office closures by establishing retail service standards, prohibiting closures that would negatively impact communities, and delaying closures in certain states and rural areas."
