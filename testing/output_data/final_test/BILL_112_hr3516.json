Long-Term Care Hospital Payment Adjustments: Amendments are made to the Social Security Act regarding high episode efficient case and episode outlier case payment adjustments for long-term care hospitals. Payment adjustments will be made for cases meeting or exceeding the fixed high episode efficient case threshold. The Secretary will adopt rules to identify the predicted probability of Medicare beneficiaries admitted to long-term care hospitals from a subsection (d) hospital for whom the payment for services received during an episode of hospital care is determined. The Secretary will establish rules to determine characteristics of individuals admitted to long-term care hospitals from subsection (d) hospitals, including length of stay, diagnoses, procedures, and care in specialized units. These characteristics will help predict Medicare payment for hospital care episodes. The Secretary will establish fixed high episode efficient case thresholds for Medicare beneficiaries discharged from long-term care hospitals with the highest 10 percent probability of being episode efficient cases. Payment adjustments will be made for cases meeting or exceeding these thresholds. The Secretary will establish fixed high episode efficient case thresholds for Medicare beneficiaries discharged from long-term care hospitals with the highest 10 percent probability of being episode efficient cases. Payment adjustments will be made for cases meeting or exceeding these thresholds, including per discharge incentive payments and episode outlier case thresholds. The Secretary will establish fixed high episode efficient case thresholds for Medicare beneficiaries discharged from long-term care hospitals with the highest 10 percent probability of being episode efficient cases. In every subsequent year, the Secretary will maintain the episode outlier case threshold, with a provision to reduce it if necessary to ensure that no more than 10 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are subject to the episode outlier case payment adjustment. The payment adjustment for episode outlier cases in long-term care hospitals is capped at 80% of reasonable costs for Medicare patient discharges. The hospital cannot exceed the adjustment for more than 15% of discharged Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary will adjust prospective payment adjustments for high episode efficient cases to ensure budget neutrality. Separate thresholds will be established for certain geographic areas for long-term care hospitals. Separate high episode efficient case and episode outlier case thresholds will be established for long-term care hospitals in urban areas with a high Medicare beneficiary discharge rate. Episode outlier thresholds will be set at a level no higher than the lowest 5 percent probability. The term 'episode of hospital care' is defined as the combined inpatient stay of a Medicare beneficiary discharged from a subsection (d) hospital and subsequently admitted to a long-term care hospital within a specified time period determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may also consider other geographic factors in establishing thresholds for efficient cases in long-term care hospitals. The Medicare beneficiaries' classification for fixed high episode efficient case threshold and episode outlier case threshold is determined using specific data. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will not apply certain regulations to long-term care hospitals for discharges starting on or after July 1, 2012. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will not make payment adjustments to long-term care hospitals or apply certain outlier payment provisions. Additionally, there is a two-year moratorium on establishing new long-term care hospitals or increasing beds in existing facilities. There is a 2-year moratorium on establishing new long-term care hospitals or satellite facilities and increasing beds in existing facilities, with an exception for hospitals that submitted plans to rebuild before January 1, 2009. A hospital can expand its bed capacity by up to 10 beds if it submits plans to rebuild to comply with seismic code requirements by January 1, 2009, and gets approval from the State."
