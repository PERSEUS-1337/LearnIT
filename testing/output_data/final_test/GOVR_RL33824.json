    "content": "In the 110th Congress, proposals were made to grant the Delegate of the District of Columbia voting rights in the House. H.Res. 78 was introduced by Representative Hoyer, allowing the delegate to vote in the Committee of the Whole. H.R. 1905, introduced by Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, aimed to grant the District a voting representative in the full House, but a similar bill in the Senate failed to pass cloture. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to give the Delegate of the District of Columbia a vote in the Full House. S. 160 was approved by the Senate, expanding the House by two Members to a total of 437 Members, with one position allocated for a voting Member representing the District of Columbia. Questions have been raised about achieving this through statute rather than constitutional amendment. The proposal aims to limit the District of Columbia to one member in the House of Representatives, with a non-severability clause in case of unconstitutionality. In contrast, H.Res. 78 grants the District of Columbia delegate a vote in the Committee of the Whole House. H.Res. 78 grants the District of Columbia delegate voting power in the House, but limits its effect when decisive. Amendments to House Rule XVIII were made to address this issue. Residents of the District have historically had limited representation in Congress, with ongoing efforts to amend the Constitution for greater representation. Efforts have been made over the years to amend the Constitution to grant the District of Columbia representation in Congress. In 1978, a proposed constitutional amendment aimed to treat the District as a state for voting purposes, but it expired in 1985 after being ratified by 16 states. Various other proposals have since been suggested to provide the District with representation in the full House without amending the Constitution. Efforts to grant the District of Columbia representation in Congress have been made through proposals that would avoid amending the Constitution. Bills have been introduced to grant statehood to the non-federal portion of the District, retrocede it to Maryland, or allow District residents to vote in Maryland for representatives. However, these efforts have been unsuccessful due to constitutional and policy concerns. H.R. 157 proposes granting the District a voting member in the House by statute, while H.J.Res. 554 aimed to treat the District as a state for representation in the House and Senate through a constitutional amendment. Efforts to grant the District of Columbia representation in Congress have been made through various proposals, including granting statehood, retroceding to Maryland, or allowing residents to vote in Maryland. H.R. 157 aims to provide representation in the House, while H.J.Res. 554 seeks representation in both the House and Senate through a constitutional amendment. The constitutionality of granting representation without an amendment has been questioned, with past resolutions facing legal challenges but being upheld due to specific provisions. Efforts to grant the District of Columbia representation in Congress have been made through various proposals, including granting statehood, retroceding to Maryland, or allowing residents to vote in Maryland. H.R. 157 aims to provide representation in the House, while H.J.Res. 554 seeks representation in both the House and Senate through a constitutional amendment. The constitutionality of such legislation has not been before the courts, but the issue of whether the District of Columbia should be considered a state for representation purposes was examined in the case of Adams v. Clinton. The court discussed extensively whether the Constitution allows for congressional representation for the District of Columbia. The court in Adams v. Clinton discussed the limited right to representation in Congress for states, not for all the people of the United States. The plaintiffs argued that even if the District of Columbia is not a state under Article I, \u00a7 2, citizens could still have representation in Congress. In Adams v. Clinton, arguments were made that the District of Columbia should be treated as a state for voting purposes or that its citizens should be allowed to vote in Maryland. This was based on historical voting rights in Maryland before the District was established. The court in Adams v. Clinton examined whether the District of Columbia could be considered a \"state\" for congressional representation. It determined that including the District as a state would create inconsistencies in the Constitution, such as voter qualifications for House elections. The court in Adams v. Clinton analyzed the issue of whether the District of Columbia could be deemed a \"state\" for congressional representation. It found that including the District as a state would lead to inconsistencies in the Constitution, particularly regarding voter qualifications for House elections. The court also examined historical debates of the Founding Fathers, indicating an understanding that the District would not have a vote in Congress. The court in Adams v. Clinton analyzed whether District residents have the right to vote for Members of Congress. The court considered voting rights through Maryland but rejected the argument based on historical precedent. The court rejected the argument that former residents of Maryland retained their state citizenship and voting rights after the District of Columbia was separated from Maryland. This decision was based on the history of land transfer to the federal government in 1790 and the Organic Act of 1801, which extinguished Maryland citizenship for inhabitants of the ceded lands. The Adams case dealt with voting rights in the District of Columbia, arguing that Congress has the power to grant representation. The courts have not directly addressed this issue under the District Clause, but the possibility of granting representation under a different congressional power was considered by the United States Court of Appeals. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia addressed a different congressional power in the case of Michel v. Anderson, questioning whether the Delegate for the District of Columbia could have a vote in the Committee of the Whole of the House of Representatives. The court agreed that Delegates cannot exercise legislative power as it is constitutionally limited to Members chosen by the People of the several States. The Court of Appeals agreed that Delegates cannot have the characteristics of membership in the House unless chosen by the People of the several States. The decision in Michel v. Anderson may not apply to granting the Delegate a vote in the House as it concerned a House Rule, not a statute. The court did not address whether Congress as a whole could provide representation for the District of Columbia under the District Clause. The power of Congress over the District of Columbia represents a broader power than the House's power to set its own rules. The House's power to determine its proceedings is broad, with the Supreme Court ruling that House Rules may not be subject to judicial review in some cases. The power of Congress over the District of Columbia is described as \"plenary\" and blends national and local legislative powers. Constitutional restrictions that apply to national legislation may not bind Congress in local matters, such as creating local courts. Congress can delegate its local political authority over the District to residents without the same limitations as delegating national legislative authorities. The power of Congress over the District of Columbia is described as \"plenary\" and blends national and local legislative powers. H.R. 157 proposes giving District residents more authority, but it raises questions about Congress's power under the District Clause. Allowing a non-voting Delegate for the District is within Congress's authority, but giving them a vote could impact national issues. The Supreme Court has addressed the limits of legislating under the District Clause. The District Clause allows Congress to legislate in the District of Columbia. In National Mutual Insurance Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., the Court considered extending rights to District residents under federal diversity jurisdiction. Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in Hepburn v. Ellzey in 1805 also addressed federal diversity jurisdiction. The Court in Tidewater Transfer Co. upheld a statute extending federal diversity jurisdiction to include parties from the District of Columbia, despite a previous ruling that excluded them. The decision, with a three-judge plurality, allowed Congress to expand federal jurisdiction under the District Clause. However, the case's lack of a majority opinion raises concerns about its support for the constitutionality of the proposal. The Court in Tidewater Transfer Co. upheld a statute extending federal diversity jurisdiction to include parties from the District of Columbia. Justice Rutledge's opinion argued that the Diversity Clause permits such lawsuits without congressional authorization. Justices Vinson and Frankfurter dissented, questioning the basis for jurisdiction. The lack of a majority opinion raises concerns about the constitutionality of the proposal. A majority of the Justices may have disagreed on the extent of Congress's power, with potential distinctions between the current proposal and the legislation in Tidewater Transfer Co. The analysis should focus on whether the District of Columbia qualifies as a \"state\" for diversity jurisdiction and voting representation, and if Congress can grant such jurisdiction and provide for a voting Delegate under the District Clause. The Court has held since the 1805 case of Hepburn v. Ellzey that federal diversity jurisdiction under Article III does not include suits where one of the parties was from the District of Columbia. The Chief Justice noted that the term \"state\" in the Constitution did not include the District of Columbia, as evidenced by representation in the Senate, the House, and the number of Presidential Electors. The Court found no reason for the term to have a different meaning for diversity purposes. In the Tidewater Transfer Co. case, the Rutledge concurrence disagreed with Hepburn. In the Tidewater Transfer Co. case, Justice Rutledge disagreed with the Hepburn decision regarding the interpretation of the term \"state\" in the Constitution. Rutledge argued that the term should be considered more expansively in the context of civil rights, pointing out that the Sixth Amendment had been held to apply to citizens of the District of Columbia. The Rutledge concurrence argued for the inclusion of the District of Columbia in diversity jurisdiction, stating that the exclusion served no historical purpose and was a discriminatory oversight by the Framers. This opinion was not supported by the other Justices. The Jackson plurality opinion rejected the interpretation that the Founding Fathers considered the District of Columbia in diversity jurisdiction. The District was not established when the Constitution was ratified. The Vinson dissent disagreed with overruling the Hepburn v. Ellzey decision. The Frankfurter dissent argued against the use of the term \"state\" in the clause. The dissent vehemently argued that the term \"state\" in the clause was clear and not open to interpretation. Justice Frankfurter, influenced by the Founding Fathers' distrust of the federal judiciary, was not swayed by arguments suggesting a broader interpretation. Case law, including Hepburn v. Ellzey, Adams v. Clinton, and Michel v. Anderson, supports a narrow interpretation of the term \"state\" for representation purposes. The Supreme Court and lower courts generally presume that the term \"state\" for House representation does not include the District of Columbia. Justices in Tidewater Transfer Co. and Hepburn case support a narrow interpretation of \"state\" for diversity jurisdiction. The Rutledge concurrence would likely reject considering the District of Columbia as a state for House representation. The Jackson plurality opinion considered whether Congress could use its power under the District Clause to bypass the limitations of Article III on diversity jurisdiction, despite the Court's ruling in Hepburn. Justice Rutledge's opinion in Hepburn emphasized the need to interpret the term \"state\" differently in the context of power distribution among political structures and civil rights of citizens. There is no indication that Justice Rutledge would dispute the use of the term \"state\" in the context of District representation in Congress. The Jackson plurality opinion explored Congress's power under the District Clause to potentially bypass Article III limitations on diversity jurisdiction. The Court considered the possibility of creating a federal court in the District of Columbia for diversity jurisdiction but raised concerns about the statute operating outside the District's geographical boundaries and involving Article III courts. The Jackson plurality opinion discussed Congress's power under the District Clause to establish a federal court in the District of Columbia for diversity jurisdiction. It raised concerns about the statute extending beyond the District's boundaries and involving Article III courts. The Court considered whether a separate power beyond the District Clause was necessary for this purpose. The Supreme Court held that Congress's decision to authorize diversity cases in federal courts outside of the District of Columbia was permissible under the District Clause. The Court emphasized that this extension did not significantly impact the administration of justice or fundamental rights, and therefore, deferred to Congress's judgment on the matter. The Supreme Court's decision on Congress's authority to authorize diversity cases in federal courts outside of the District of Columbia did not disturb the balance between the Union and its states. The Rutledge concurrence disagreed with the plurality, stating that Congress lacked the power to grant this authority to District of Columbia citizens. The Vinson and Frankfurter dissents also rejected the plurality's reasoning, citing Article III limitations and separation of powers. The Vinson and Frankfurter dissents rejected the Supreme Court's decision on Congress's authority to authorize diversity cases in federal courts, citing Article III limitations and separation of powers. Six Justices rejected the plurality's interpretation of the District Clause, which could also impact the granting of House representation to District citizens. Six Justices rejected the extension of diversity jurisdiction using Congress's power under the District Clause, indicating potential implications for House representation for District of Columbia residents. The limitation of House representation to states was seen as uncontroversial, with the term \"state\" in the Constitution's organization being unquestioned. Only three Justices in the Tidewater Transfer Co. case might have supported extending House representation to District citizens, but even this conclusion is uncertain. The plurality opinion in the Tidewater Transfer Co. case limited its decision to legislation that did not involve an extension or denial of fundamental rights or disturb the balance between the Union and its states. Granting the Delegate a vote in the House could be seen as an extension of a fundamental right and a substantial disturbance to federalism. Justices in the Jackson plurality might distinguish this proposal from their holding in Tidewater Transfer Co. The Justices in the Tidewater Transfer Co. case might have concerns about extending House representation to other political entities, such as territories like Hawaii and Alaska. Subsequent lower court decisions have supported the extension of diversity jurisdiction to territories under the \"Territory Clause.\" The approval of the instant proposal could potentially validate such extensions. Extending House representation to territories like American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands could be a significant change to the national political structure, considering the small number of voters in some of these territories. Congress has plenary power over these territories under the Territory Clause, and granting voting Delegates to them might be controversial. Extending House representation to territories like American Samoa, with a population of about 58,000, could significantly change the House makeup. Treating the District as a state for representation purposes could also lead to granting it Senators, Presidential Electors, and ratification power for Amendments. The question arises if this reasoning should apply to the Committee of the Whole, which is not provided for in the Constitution. The Committee of the Whole, established in 1789, has evolved into a forum for debate and discussion with flexible procedures. It is essentially the Full House in another form, where every legislator has the authority to debate and vote on all issues. By resolving into the Committee of the Whole, the House can speed up floor action using various procedural devices. The Committee of the Whole, established in 1789, allows for a quorum of 100 members and five-minute rule for amendments. Delegates may vote in the Committee of the Whole, subject to a revote if decisive. The Constitution does not provide a basis for delegates like the Delegate for the District of Columbia to vote in the Committee of the Whole, as they are not considered Members under Article \u00a7 2. The Constitution does not specify if all legislative activities are restricted to Members, leaving open the possibility for delegates to engage in some legislative activities. Delegates historically have participated in legislative activities such as introducing legislation, serving on committees, voting, and debating. The distinction between activities limited to Members and those not is not well defined. The question of the advisory nature of a vote in the Committee of the Whole was addressed in the case of Michel v. Anderson. In Michel v. Anderson, the United States Court of Appeals addressed the advisory nature of a vote in the Committee of the Whole. Despite arguments that the procedures were constitutionally distinct, the court found operational similarities significant enough to raise constitutional issues. The court ultimately held that the revote provision made the vote largely symbolic and did not have constitutional significance. The question arises regarding who can challenge a statute granting a representative of the District of Columbia a vote in the Committee of the Whole or the full House. The Constitution requires federal courts to only consider lawsuits involving \"cases or controversies\" enforced through the doctrine of standing. The Supreme Court has a four-part test for standing: injury in fact, interest within protected zone, illegal conduct, and redressable by court decision. Plaintiffs must meet these criteria to have standing in federal court. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia addressed the issue of standing for voters in a state to challenge the provision of District of Columbia voting representation in the House in the case of Michel v. Anderson. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia considered whether state voters had standing to challenge a House Rule allowing District of Columbia and territorial delegate votes in the House. The court used a four-part test to determine if there was a \"case or controversy,\" evaluating the injury to state voters in relation to their Representatives' voting power. The key question was whether the alleged injury was too generalized or speculative to establish standing. The court found that the loss of a vote or deprivation of a particular opportunity to vote was a sufficiently particularized injury to warrant judicial scrutiny. In Michel, the district court determined that the alleged dilution of representational voting power under the Apportionment Clause satisfied the requirement of injury-in-fact. The harm fell within the zone of interest protected by Article I of the Constitution, and the injury could be traced back to the actions of the defendants. The court found that the loss of a vote or deprivation of a particular opportunity to vote was a sufficiently particularized injury to warrant judicial scrutiny. The alleged injury was traced back to the actions of the House majority in passing a rule, and the court held that it was capable of redress. Meeting all four prongs of the standing test, the state-voter plaintiffs were allowed to proceed with their case. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia emphasized that widespread injury does not bar a suit as long as each person suffered a distinct harm. In the Michel case, the court found that the loss of a vote was a particularized injury warranting judicial scrutiny. State voters and Members of the House were allowed to proceed with their case, establishing standing based on alleged vote dilution. The court also considered whether separation of powers and prudential concerns would preclude such suits. The question of congressional standing involves constitutional requirements and prudential considerations, with the Supreme Court case Raines v. Byrd being relevant. Standing is a mix of constitutional and prudential aspects, and Congress can eliminate some prudential barriers but not constitutional requirements. S. 1257 does not currently grant House Members the explicit right to challenge the law. In Raines v. Byrd, Members of Congress challenged the Line Item Veto Act, alleging it increased the President's power unconstitutionally. The Court ruled that congressional plaintiffs must show a personal, concrete injury to have standing in a suit against the executive branch. In Raines v. Byrd, congressional plaintiffs must demonstrate a personal or institutional injury to have standing in a suit against the executive branch. The Raines Court considered an institutional injury as sufficient if it nullified a specific vote, but not if legislative redress was available. Based on Raines v. Byrd, a court might consider a District of Columbia representative's deciding vote as vote \"nullification,\" allowing for a lawsuit if it constitutes institutional injury. Without a specific injury, it is unclear if House Representatives can challenge a vote by a District representative. In summary, a District of Columbia representative's deciding vote could potentially be challenged in court if it has a specific effect on plaintiffs. Congress's ability to repeal the rule granting such a vote may require legislators to seek redress from Congress. If a DC representative casts the deciding vote on legislation, affected individuals could bring a case demonstrating injury and seeking judicial relief. The specific injury could be met by applying the statute to a plaintiff, with redress through a finding of unconstitutionality and an injunction. It is challenging to find constitutional support for Congress granting the power to vote in the House to the District of Columbia Delegate. Existing case law suggests that the District of Columbia is not considered a \"state\" for representation purposes, and congressional power over the District does not include granting congressional representation. Justices in a relevant Supreme Court case rejected the idea that Congress's power under the District Clause could make structural changes to the federal government. The Supreme Court Justices limited their opinion on granting diversity jurisdiction to District of Columbia citizens, suggesting that Congress may not have the authority to grant voting representation in the House of Representatives to the District of Columbia as proposed in H.R. 157. However, allowing Delegates a vote in the Committee of the Whole through H.Res. 78 would be largely symbolic. The amendments to the House Rules are likely to pass constitutional muster, as the Committee of the Whole's decision would be largely symbolic."
