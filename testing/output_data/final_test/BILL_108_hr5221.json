    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Native American Housing Enhancement Act of 2004\". Native Americans face severe housing conditions, with overcrowding, lack of solid waste management, unsafe water supply, and high rates of homelessness. The poverty rate among Native Americans is double that of the general population in the United States. The Native American population growth in the latter part of the 20th century increased the need for Federal housing services. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 gives preference to members of Indian tribes for housing programs, allowing tribes to leverage funds with other Federal and private funds. The Department of Agriculture has been a significant funding source for housing for Indian tribes. To address the severe housing needs of Indian tribes, the Housing Act of 1949 should be amended to grant exemptions from certain civil rights acts for tribes complying with the Indian Civil Rights Act or the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act. Additionally, the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act should be amended to include Indian tribes and related entities as eligible for assistance. YouthBuild grants are available to other agencies serving Indians as eligible applicants. SEC. 3. Amends the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act regarding program income. SEC. 4. Adds a section on civil rights compliance for Indian tribes to the Housing Act of 1949. SEC. 544 states that federally recognized Indian Tribes must comply with the Indian Civil Rights Act when receiving assistance under this title. Title VI and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 do not apply to tribes covered by the Indian Civil Rights Act or tribes acting under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act. SEC. 5 amends eligibility for Indian tribes for YouthBuild grants, including tribal housing entities and agencies serving Indians. SEC. 6 discusses federal guarantees for financing tribal housing activities. SEC. 6 amends the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act to guarantee repayment of 95 percent of the unpaid principal and interest on tribal housing financing."
