The Congress finds that the changing workforce in the US requires skills upgrading, leading to earning advantages and increased productivity. Business executives face challenges in modernizing equipment due to worker skill deficiencies and lack of funds. The Congress acknowledges the need for workforce skills upgrading to enhance productivity and competitiveness. Limited federal resources make it challenging to address this issue alone, emphasizing the importance of industry-based investment in human resource development. States, employers, and employees should collaborate to provide skills upgrading for workers. The Congress aims to enhance productivity and product quality through skills upgrading programs. Grants may be provided to States to offer loans for eligible individuals, ensuring job security and avoiding duplication of existing programs. Grants are provided to States to offer loans to eligible entities for skills upgrading of non-managerial employees. Eligible entities include employers, employee representatives, business associations, trade organizations, and consortia. The Secretary may provide grants to States for loan guarantee programs, with priority given to States able to quickly establish such programs. The maximum grant amount for any fiscal year is $2,000,000. The total grant amount to a State under subsection (b) shall not exceed $5,000,000. States must use grant funds to establish a loan guarantee program for skills upgrading of non-managerial employees. This includes establishing a reserve fund for loan guarantees. The State will establish criteria for loan guarantees to eligible entities for skills upgrading of mid- and lower-level employees. Eligible entities must pay a 1% insurance premium to the State's reserve fund when receiving the loan. The State will establish criteria for loan guarantees to eligible entities for skills upgrading of mid- and lower-level employees, including training in total quality management, statistical process control, production techniques, office automation, and materials resource planning. Priority will be given to non-managerial employees directly involved in production or services, or at risk of termination due to modernization. The State will establish criteria for loan guarantees to eligible entities for skills upgrading of mid- and lower-level employees, including training in total quality management, statistical process control, production techniques, office automation, and materials resource planning. Priority will be given to non-managerial employees directly involved in production or services, or at risk of termination due to modernization. Amounts from a loan shall not be used to pay the wages or other benefits of any employee receiving assistance under the program. Payments by the state to financial institutions in cases of default will be made according to criteria developed by the Secretary. The loan guarantee programs under this section aim to reimburse institutions for unpaid principal and interest due to default. Loans provided by financial institutions are not guaranteed by the United States. State's authority to extend loan guarantees is limited to 1,000 percent of the reserve fund. Interest earned from the reserve fund is credited back to the fund. The Governor of a State can use up to 5 percent of the reserved amount to establish a loan guarantee program. The Federal share cannot exceed 50 percent of the total program cost, while the State share must come from non-Federal sources. The State share may include amounts reserved in accordance with subsection (g). Conforming amendments are made to the Job Training Partnership Act, including establishing and carrying out the loan guarantee program under section 327(f). SEC. 2. Information on skills upgrading activities for capacity building and dissemination network. Section 453(b)(2) of the Job Training Partnership Act is amended to collect and disseminate information on successful programs to upgrade worker skills, research and evaluation, and assistance for designing programs. The amendment aims to enhance skills upgrading methods and promote communication among states and entities involved in such programs.
