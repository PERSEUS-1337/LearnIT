    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that Title 38 authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide medical services to eligible veterans, but funding challenges have hindered proper healthcare planning for veterans. Unpredictable health care funding jeopardizes specialized resources for sick and disabled veterans. Insufficient appropriations have led to rationing of services, requiring supplemental funding. Adequate and timely funding is crucial to ensure veterans receive quality care and access to services. Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding to the veterans health care system would eliminate uncertainty on funding levels, allowing the Department of Veterans Affairs to adequately plan and meet the needs of enrolled veterans. SEC. 2. TWO-FISCAL YEAR BUDGET AUTHORITY FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL CARE ACCOUNTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. The new section \"Sec. 113A\" introduces a two-fiscal year budget authority for specific medical care accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs starting from fiscal year 2010. This allows for new discretionary budget authority to be available for the current fiscal year and the subsequent fiscal year for medical care accounts within the Veterans Health Administration. The new section \"Sec. 113A\" introduces budget authority for medical services, administration, and facilities within the Department of Veterans Affairs.
