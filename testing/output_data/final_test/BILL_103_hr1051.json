    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Turbo Enterprise Zone Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that it is the Federal Government's responsibility to create conditions for enterprise to flourish in inner cities and create jobs. Enterprise zones will reduce taxes and regulations in economically depressed areas, with a more aggressive reform called the \"turbo enterprise zone\" for urgent areas lacking tax revenue. The turbo enterprise zone offers extraordinary incentives for businesses to locate in the most depressed areas, with a zero tax rate regime for 5 years. To qualify, 90% of employees and managers must live within the designated area, aiming to stimulate economic activity in inner cities. The Act aims to boost economic activity in blighted inner-city areas without significant new taxes or borrowing, expecting a strong tax-generating infrastructure within 5 years. The Act establishes Turbo Enterprise Zones where no federal taxes will be imposed for 5 years to stimulate economic growth in blighted inner-city areas. No federal taxes will be imposed on income, employment, self-employment, and excise taxes in Turbo Enterprise Zones for 5 years to boost economic growth in blighted inner-city areas. The term \"turbo enterprise zone\" refers to designated areas in the United States afflicted with high unemployment, severe economic blight, and low tax revenues, approved by the State and local governments. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development approves designated \"turbo enterprise zones\" if they meet specific criteria and have a 5-year tax waiver from the State and local governments. For tax benefits in turbo enterprise zones, qualified residents and businesses are exempt from certain taxes and fees. A qualified resident is someone living in the zone for at least 6 months, while a qualified business operates within the zone and employs a majority of residents. The section applies to turbo enterprise zones for a 5-year period after approval by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. An extension may be granted if the zone's per capita income growth is twice that of the surrounding area. If the governmental units extend the waiver for an additional 2 years and the per capita income in the zone doubles that of the surrounding area, the section will remain in effect for another 2 years. Additional extensions are permitted if the per capita income growth in the zone is at least twice that of the surrounding area. If the per capita income in the designated zone is at least double the average increase in the surrounding area, and the waiver is extended for an additional 2 years by the governmental units, then the section will remain in effect for another 2 years. Extensions are limited to a maximum of 6 years. It is recommended that State and local governments in areas heavily impacted by unemployment, gang violence, riots, and looting should take immediate action. To address issues of unemployment, gang violence, riots, and looting, State and local governments are advised to eliminate all taxes on qualified residents and businesses for a 5-year period. During this time, taxpayers with no tax liability will have their taxable income treated as zero for deduction, credit, or capital loss carryover purposes. SEC. 4 introduces hiring incentives for businesses in Turbo Enterprise Zones engaged in manufacturing or providing services outside the zone. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on Turbo Enterprise Zone Employment Credit. The Turbo Enterprise Zone Employment Credit provides a tax credit for qualified businesses in turbo enterprise zones that engage in manufacturing or provide services outside the zone. The credit is based on a percentage of qualified first-year wages paid to employees, with a maximum limit of $1,000 per employee. The Turbo Enterprise Zone Employment Credit defines terms like \"applicable percentage,\" \"qualified first-year wages,\" and \"qualified business; qualified resident\" for businesses in turbo enterprise zones. It outlines criteria for tax credits based on gross receipts and wages paid to qualified residents. The Turbo Enterprise Zone Employment Credit defines terms and criteria for tax credits for businesses in turbo enterprise zones. It applies to qualified residents hired during a specific period with no tax imposed on the employer. The credit is part of the general business credit under the tax code. The Turbo Enterprise Zone Employment Credit defines terms and criteria for tax credits in turbo enterprise zones, including a credit for qualified residents hired during a specific period with no tax imposed on the employer. Additionally, a new paragraph is added regarding the credit for qualified productive businesses. The Turbo Enterprise Zone Employment Credit, including tax credits for qualified residents hired in turbo enterprise zones, will apply to taxable years after the enactment of this Act."
