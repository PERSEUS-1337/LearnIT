    "content": "In FY2017, the federal government obligated around $500 billion for procurement of goods and services. Federal procurement statutes and regulations, such as the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, establish policies for acquisitions by executive branch agencies to ensure best value products/services while promoting competition. Federal law allows contractors to protest contract awards/solicitations that do not comply with regulations to enhance transparency, fairness, and integrity in the procurement system. In recent years, Congress has focused on balancing contractors' ability to protest procurement decisions with the potential delays in agency acquisitions. The FY2017 NDAA required a study on bid protests' impact on acquisitions. Bid protests can be authorized in three forums: the procuring agency, GAO, or COFC. This report analyzes the legal procedures for bid protests under each forum, relevant for potential reforms. The report provides an overview of bid protests, legal procedures, and recent legislative developments relevant to Congress. Bid protests can be filed with the procuring agency, GAO, or COFC, each sharing common features. The three forums for bid protests - procuring agency, GAO, and COFC - share common features such as the definition of \"interested party.\" However, legal procedures and remedies vary significantly. Contractors can request debriefings to gather information before deciding where to file a protest. The GAO receives more bid protests annually than the COFC. Parties can appeal bid protest outcomes to the COFC, but not vice versa. The FAR mandates quick and simple resolution of protests by procuring agencies. The FAR mandates quick and simple resolution of protests by procuring agencies, but there is a lack of publicly available data on protests and agency decisions. The term \"interested party\" is defined as an actual or prospective bidder affected by the contract award. The FAR mandates quick resolution of protests by procuring agencies. Interested parties filing a protest do not have a legal right to compel discovery. Agencies must resolve a protest within 35 days and provide a well-reasoned explanation of their decision. An \"automatic stay\" halts the award or implementation of a contract until the protest is resolved, unless there are urgent reasons to proceed. The procuring agencies must provide a well-reasoned explanation of their protest decision, which may include canceling or reissuing a contract. Parties unsatisfied with the agency's resolution can file a protest with GAO, COFC, or specialized agencies under certain circumstances. GAO is the only agency authorized to hear protests from across the federal government, allowing \"interested parties\" to file protests regarding federal procurement contracts. Federal law allows parties involved in a federal agency's procurement contract to challenge the agency's decisions regarding contract eligibility, solicitation definitions, and contract awards. The term \"interested party\" is defined as an actual or prospective bidder with a direct economic interest in the procurement action. GAO may limit post-award protests to parties who bid on the contract and were next in line to win, unless a successful claim could change this. Federal law requires protests before GAO to be timely and efficient, with time limits for filings and rulings. GAO protests must be filed within 10 days of the violation being known, and untimely protests are dismissed. GAO must notify the agency of a protest within one day, triggering a 30-day response window for the agency. Subcontractors are generally not considered interested parties for protests. Upon receiving notice from GAO, the procuring agency must implement an automatic stay, halting the contract award or performance until GAO issues a recommendation. The agency can only lift the stay for limited reasons, such as if contract performance is in the best interests of the United States or due to urgent circumstances. GAO typically has 100 days to issue a recommendation, but may expedite the process for cases that can be resolved within 65 days. The COFC can review an agency's decision to override an automatic stay, potentially reversing it through a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. GAO may issue a decision denying or sustaining a protest, recommending further action by the agency. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) may recommend actions such as reissuing a solicitation, rebidding a contract, or canceling a contract if it finds that an agency failed to comply with procurement laws. GAO's recommendations are non-legally binding but must be promptly reported to Congress if not followed. GAO may also recommend that the agency cover the challenging party's attorneys' fees and other protest-related costs. The Court of Federal Claims (COFC) is the only judicial forum authorized by Congress to hear bid protests. Parties must comply with the court's rules of practice and demonstrate that they qualify as an \"interested party.\" The COFC gives weight to GAO recommendations when assessing bid protest challenges. The Court of Federal Claims (COFC) reviews final agency procurement actions for compliance with the law and may award relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief. COFC-issued remedies are legally binding and enforceable through contempt of court. Bid protest lawsuits can be filed with the COFC before or after procurement actions. Parties can file bid protest lawsuits with the COFC, but do not receive an automatic stay. They can request a stay from the procuring agency or seek a preliminary injunction from the court. These remedies are granted in limited circumstances, requiring a showing of irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the claims. The COFC generally reviews protests based on solicitations in the same time frame as that applicable to GAO. Post-award protests at the COFC are not subject to specific initial filing deadlines other than the general six-year statute of limitations. The COFC can bar claims on equitable grounds when a protester's delay in filing was unreasonable and prejudicial. COFC bid protest opinions do not have to be issued within a specific time frame like those before the procuring agency. The COFC does not have specific time frames for issuing rulings on protests, unlike the procuring agency and GAO. COFC rulings are legally enforceable and can be appealed to the Federal Circuit. Each bid protest forum has unique processes and remedies, contributing to Congress's goal of maintaining a balanced procurement system. Protests before the procuring agency and GAO are typically resolved faster and at a lower cost compared to challenges before the COFC. Protests before the procuring agency and GAO are resolved faster and less expensively than challenges before the COFC due to specific resolution timetables and less formal procedures. Parties filing a protest with the procuring agency or GAO benefit from an automatic stay, while COFC protests are more time-consuming and expensive without triggering an automatic stay. COFC rulings are legally binding and can be appealed to the Federal Circuit, unlike procuring agency and GAO decisions. Interested parties can bring claims before the COFC if they disagree with GAO or procuring agency decisions, but the reverse route is generally not permitted. The Court of Federal Claims (COFC) allows for a broader scope of discovery compared to protests before the Government Accountability Office (GAO). COFC may award any relief it deems proper, except for certain monetary relief, while GAO and procuring agencies are limited to statutorily authorized remedies. Congress intended to enable contractors to challenge federal procurement solicitations and awards to ensure compliance with federal law. Protests in federal procurement can ensure compliance with the law, promote fairness, transparency, and competition, leading to better quality and reduced costs. However, they may also cause delays in acquiring goods and services. The absence of a protest system could result in wasteful spending and undermine public confidence in contract award decisions. Some commentators are concerned that contractors file baseless protests to harm competitors or extend contracts, causing agencies to spend time and money defending actions and delaying procurement. This could drive up administrative costs and hinder agencies from acquiring goods and services needed for operations. Some in Congress have expressed a need for procurement reform, specifically bid protest procedural reform, to address concerns with the bid protest process and improve procurement outcomes for the federal government. Congress has passed provisions focused on enhancing the efficiency of the procurement process and discouraging unwarranted protests. Recently enacted procurement protest reform provisions have focused on defense acquisition, with provisions such as an expedited bid protest process for contracts under $100,000 and a pilot program to assess contractors reimbursing DOD for protest costs. Additionally, debriefing rights for DOD contractors have been enhanced. Enhanced debriefing rights for prospective DOD contractors now allow them to submit questions and receive written responses from the procuring agency. Contractors can also file bid protests with GAO within five days of receiving DOD's responses. GAO includes common protest grounds in its annual reports to Congress, which could inform legislative reforms to the bid protest system. The RAND report suggests implementing recommendations or making changes to the pilot program requiring contractors to reimburse the government for protest adjudication costs."
