    "content": "The \"Small Business Contract Equity Act of 2001\" may be cited as the Act. Procedures for bundling contracts are outlined in the Act. Procedures for Bundling of Contracts under the \"Small Business Contract Equity Act of 2001\" require submission of draft solicitation to the Small Business Administration for determination if it would result in a bundled contract. The Administrator must determine if a draft solicitation would result in a bundled contract within 10 days of receiving it. If a bundled contract is identified, the agency head must conduct market research before publishing the solicitation. Additionally, the agency head must submit a study within 45 days of the Administrator's determination. The head of the department or agency must submit a study to the Administrator to support a proposed bundled contract, demonstrating measurable savings and equal quality of goods or services. The Administrator will review the study within 10 days to ensure it meets the standards set forth in the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. The Administrator will review any deficiencies in a study for a proposed bundled contract and propose changes to comply with regulations. The head of the agency can appeal the determination to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, whose decision is final. The Director may delegate duties to a subordinate official appointed by the President. The Administrator reviews study deficiencies for bundled contracts. The agency head can appeal to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget for final decision. If study meets standards, solicitation can be published; if not, it must be revised. The head of the department can revise the solicitation and conduct a new study. The requirements can be waived in case of an unusual exigency, with the possibility of appeal to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Definitions are provided in this section. The Administrator of the Senate will establish regulations for bundled contracts that displace small-business concerns. Proposed rules must be published within 30 days of enactment, with a 45-day comment period before final rules are issued in consultation with department heads. If no final rule is published within 120 days of the effective date of the Act, the proposed regulations will automatically become final. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS RELATED TO BUNDLING OF CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS. Section 3(o) of the Small Business Act is amended to include provisions regarding the consolidation of contracts, regardless of terminology used by the contracting agency. This includes the solicitation of offers for a single contract or multiple contracts, or the creation of any new procurement requirement that permits such consolidation. SEC. 4 prohibits agencies from bundling contract requirements if they do not meet small business procurement goals. Prohibition on bundling contract requirements if small business procurement goals are not met. The amendment requires agencies to meet specific goals related to small businesses, including those owned by disadvantaged individuals and women. This applies to solicitations issued on or after October 1, 2001, and contracts awarded based on those solicitations. The Small Business Act amendment sets deadlines for agencies to report on goal attainment for contracts awarded to small businesses. The Administrator of General Services must provide a preliminary report by September 15 and a final report by October 15 each year. The General Services must submit a final report to the Administration with data from the previous year."
