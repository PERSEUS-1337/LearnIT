    "content": "Moldova's strategic location between NATO and EU member Romania and Ukraine has drawn interest from U.S. policy makers. Concerns have been raised about Russian efforts to exert influence through troop presence, manipulation of relationships with breakaway regions, and criminal activities like trafficking. The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) led the country in the 2000s under Vladimir Voronin. After the 2009 parliamentary elections, the Alliance for European Integration took power in Moldova, focusing on European integration. Nicolae Timofti, a former judge, was elected president in 2012. The governing parties mainly serve as platforms for political leaders and businessmen. A scandal involving high-ranking judiciary officials led to the government's collapse in March 2013. The coalition government in Moldova collapsed in March 2013 due to a scandal among party leaders but was reconstituted in May 2013 with the support of the European Union to maintain European integration prospects. The coalition, consisting of the Liberal Democrats, the Democratic Party, and the Liberal Reformist Party, controls 53 out of 101 parliamentary seats. The largest opposition party, the PCRM, holds 34 seats. Conflict with the breakaway \"Dniestr Republic\" erupted in March 1992, resulting in hundreds of deaths before a cease-fire was declared in July 1992. New parliamentary elections are expected in November 2014. In March 1992, a cease-fire was declared in the conflict between the \"Dniestr Republic\" and Moldova, with Russian peacekeepers patrolling a security zone. The peacekeeping contingents are overseen by a Joint Control Commission. The conflict's causes are complex, involving issues of national identity and power struggles among elite groups. The region's population is made up of ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Moldovans. The leaders of the \"Dniestr Republic\" and associates in Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine are believed to obstruct a settlement due to personal interests and control of the region's economy. Negotiations over autonomy for Transnistria within Moldova have been stalled for years. The region's leaders profit from illegal activities like smuggling and human trafficking. The State Department criticized the poor human rights record of the \"Dniestr Republic.\" Talks on Transnistria's status involve Russia, Ukraine, and OSCE, with the US and EU as observers in the \"5+2\" format. Formal talks were halted from 2006 to 2011 due to Transnistrian leaders' anger at Moldova's cooperation with the EU and Ukraine. The Moldovan leadership seeks autonomy for Transnistria within a united Moldova, aiming to remove Russian troops and replace peacekeepers with EU-led civilian observers. Moldova is open to reaffirming military neutrality and guaranteeing Russian property rights in Transnistria to secure Russian support for a resolution. The Transnistrian leadership rejects autonomy and held a referendum on independence in 2006, demanding recognition from Russia, which was rejected. Yevgeni Shevchuk was elected president in 2011, replacing longtime leader Igor Smirnov. Yevgeni Shevchuk won the election in Transnistria, replacing Igor Smirnov. Shevchuk aims to improve relations with Moldova by focusing on practical issues like trade and communication. He supports Transnistria's independence and rejects discussing its status at talks with Moldova. Yevgeni Shevchuk, the new leader of Transnistria, supports the region's independence and opposes replacing Russian peacekeeping forces. He advocates for closer economic ties with Russia and eventual membership in the Russian-led Customs Union and Eurasian Union. Gagauzia, a small region in southern Moldova, has tensions with the central government but saw improvements in 1994. In 1994, Gagauzia was established as an autonomous unit within Moldova with the right to secede if Moldova unites with Romania. Moldova is the poorest country in Europe with a significant portion of the population living in poverty. Agriculture, particularly fruit, wine, and tobacco, is a key sector in Moldova's economy. Moldova's economy heavily relies on agriculture, with the industry concentrated in the Transnistria region. The global financial crisis negatively impacted Moldova, leading to a drop in remittances and foreign direct investment. Despite fluctuations, Moldova's GDP showed growth in 2010 and 2011 but contracted in 2012 due to the Eurozone slowdown. In 2013, Moldova's GDP experienced a rapid 8.9% growth. In 2013, Moldova's GDP grew by 8.9% driven by consumer spending and a good harvest. The weakening currency boosted exports. Growth in 2014 may be affected by the situation in Ukraine and Russia. Despite a ban on wine imports, Russia remains a significant export market. The government unveiled the \"Rethink Moldova\" plan in 2010 to improve the business climate, increase exports, and upgrade infrastructure. International donors pledged $2.6 billion for 2010-2013. The European Union, United States, and a bank pledged $2.6 billion for Moldova's development plan from 2010-2013. Despite challenges with corruption, Moldova improved its ranking for ease of doing business. Russia aims to prevent Moldova from moving towards Euro-Atlantic integration, although Moldova remains neutral and is not seeking NATO membership. Moldova faces pressure from Russia to not unite with Romania, with Moscow imposing economic sanctions such as banning imports of Moldovan wine and spirits. In response, the EU lifted quotas on Moldovan wine exports. Russia has exerted pressure on Moldova through economic sanctions, including banning wine and pork exports. Moldova's energy dependency on Russia has also been used as leverage, with Gazprom cutting off gas supplies in the past due to pricing disputes. Moldova agreed to give Gazprom a higher equity stake in Moldovagaz in exchange for restored gas supplies. Gazprom continues to pressure Moldova, seeking to complete the purchase of Transnistria's stake in Moldovagaz. Moldova faces pressure from Gazprom due to Energy Community Treaty obligations and gas debts, with Gazprom objecting to EU's Third Energy Package. Russia targets Moldovan labor migrants and offers lower gas prices in exchange for exemption from the package. Moldovans working abroad, mainly in Russia, contribute significantly to Moldova's GDP. Russia's involvement in Moldova includes undermining the government and maintaining troops in Transnistria, with commitments to withdraw unfulfilled. Financial support from Russia to Transnistria includes grants, loans, and energy supplies. Russian firms control key economic institutions in Transnistria, receiving grants, loans, and energy supplies. Leaders in Gagauzia, Transnistria, and the Moldovan Communist Party fear loss of sovereignty through the EU Association Agreement, advocating for joining the Russia-led Customs Union. Gagauz government held a referendum supporting Customs Union membership and possible secession from Moldova if it joins Romania. The Moldovan government announced that over 98% of participants supported secession from Moldova to join Romania. Transnistrian officials objected to Moldova's Association Agreement. Moldovan officials invited Transnistria to participate but they refused. Transnistria has until the end of 2015 to implement the accord or face exclusion from the EU trade agreement. The Transnistrian regime faces a dilemma regarding the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) in the Association Agreement. Accepting the DCFTA could lead to the loss of energy subsidies from Russia, while rejecting it may result in substantial losses. Additionally, Moldova's visa-free travel agreement with the Schengen zone countries poses a challenge, prompting many in Transnistria to seek Moldovan passports. The Moldovan government is concerned about the situation, especially with a large population of Russian citizens in Transnistria that could be used as a pretext for Russian intervention. Russian leaders have used the presence of Russian citizens and Russian-speaking \"compatriots\" in Ukraine as a pretext for potential military intervention. Concerns have been raised about armed men from Transnistria attempting to cross the border into Ukraine for \"demonstrations\" against the government. There are fears that Russian forces could link up with Transnistria, although it is uncertain if Russia would take military action against Moldova. Russia has refused to recognize Transnistria's independence. Many believe Russia will use indirect tactics to influence Moldova away from a pro-Western orientation, such as trade sanctions and support for separatist regions. Moldova aims to sign an Association Agreement with the EU and participates in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Russia's stance on recognizing Transnistria's independence remains uncertain. Moldova aims to sign an Association Agreement with the EU to enhance cooperation, including a free trade zone. In addition, Moldova received 273.14 million Euro in aid from the EU from 2011 to 2013 to support reform efforts in governance, rule of law, social protections, healthcare, education, energy diversification, and efficiency. The EU has granted Moldova trade preferences to sell more wine and agricultural goods, reducing dependence on the Russian market. EU aid totals for Moldova for 2014-2020 are pending announcement. The EU is Moldova's largest trading partner, accounting for 54% of its trade, while Russia accounts for 12%. Moldova hopes to become an EU member, but some member states are hesitant due to Moldova's poverty and internal EU challenges. Some EU countries are concerned about a Moldovan candidacy setting a precedent for other former Soviet states like Ukraine. Moldova's ties with Romania are sensitive, with many Romanians supporting eventual unification. The issue of the \"Moldovan language\" being Romanian is controversial in Moldova due to Soviet promotion of a separate Moldovan language. Supporters of \"Moldovan\" tend to favor ties with Russia, while supporters of \"Romanian\" support union with Romania. In a 1994 referendum, over 90% of Moldovans rejected union with Romania. Recent polls show less than 10% support for union. The Liberal Party, the main pro-Romanian party, won 10% of the vote in the last election but downplayed pro-union views. Over 400,000 Moldovans had dual Romanian-Moldovan citizenship in 2012. Relations with Romania have improved, with agreements to liberalize border traffic and remove Soviet-era barriers. Romania provided 100 million Euro in aid to Moldova and they are planning to build a gas pipeline to reduce energy dependence on Russia. The United States supports Moldova's sovereignty and territorial integrity, with Secretary of State John Kerry visiting in 2013 to congratulate Moldova on its Association Agreement with the EU. Kerry also mentioned sponsoring a trip for Moldovan winemakers to the U.S. market and partnering with Sweden on energy efficiency. The United States supports Moldova's path towards European integration, providing foreign aid for anti-corruption efforts, border security, boosting exports, and energy security. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland confirmed this support during her visit to Moldova, announcing an additional $10 million in aid for border security. In FY2013, the U.S. provided $21.855 million in foreign aid to Moldova, with an estimated $20.66 million for FY2014. The United States provides foreign aid to Moldova to fight corruption, transnational crime, and improve the business climate. Assistance also includes support for independent media, non-governmental organizations, and rule of law programs. Moldova receives modest security assistance for peacekeeping capacity and interoperability with NATO. The United States provides foreign aid to Moldova to improve infrastructure and boost agricultural exports. Assistant Secretary Nuland emphasized the need for Moldova to educate the public on the benefits of EU association, expand communications in Russian, and continue fighting corruption. Some are concerned that Moldovan leaders may believe the US and EU would overlook corruption for geopolitical reasons. The United States supports Moldova in various areas, including promoting Euro-Atlantic integration and urging Russia to withdraw troops from Transnistria. The US also refused to ratify the CFE treaty until Russian troops were withdrawn from Moldova. Russia suspended its observance of the CFE Treaty in 2007. In 2007, Russia suspended the CFE Treaty due to the failure of the US and other countries to ratify the adapted treaty. The US imposed missile proliferation sanctions on Moldovan firms in 2003. Moldova is a source of trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labor, classified as a \"Tier 2\" country. US aid has helped interdict sales of highly-enriched uranium in Moldova. In June 2011, Moldovan police conducted a sting operation against persons offering highly-enriched uranium (HEU) for sale, possibly from Russia. Moldova sought permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) from the US by terminating the Jackson-Vanik amendment. The US approved PNTR for Russia and Moldova in November 2012. The crisis in Ukraine led to calls for US efforts to support Moldova's sovereignty against Russian threats. Legislation was passed in 2014 to bolster Moldova's territorial integrity. The bill signed by the President on April 3 requires Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to counter Russia's broadcasts in Ukraine and Moldova. Representative Ted Poe introduced H.R. 4155, the Fight Russian Energy Exploitation Act, to make Moldova eligible to import U.S. natural gas. Senator Inhofe introduced S.Res. 411 criticizing Russia's actions in Ukraine and Moldova. The bill signed by the President requires Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to counter Russia's broadcasts in Ukraine and Moldova. It calls on Russia to remove its military forces from Moldova and urges increased security cooperation with Moldova."
