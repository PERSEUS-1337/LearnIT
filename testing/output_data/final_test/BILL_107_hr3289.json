    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Nuclear Waste Terrorist Threat Assessment and Protection Act\". It includes findings related to the protection of nuclear waste. The September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania were the deadliest and costliest in U.S. history, resulting in over 5,000 deaths. The economic costs are estimated at $100 billion in New York City alone, causing significant disruption to the economy. The attacks also led to a sharp drop in stock market indices, showcasing terrorists' ability to inflict massive damage. Terrorists pose a significant threat to the United States and the world, willing to use any method to destroy human life and property. They have demonstrated their willingness to target innocent civilians and continue to improve their destructive capabilities. To counter this threat, the US should take every reasonable step to restrict terrorists' ability to inflict damage. The Yucca Mountain Project proposes to transport 77,000 tons of high-level radioactive nuclear waste across the United States, posing a significant risk of terrorist attacks and potential economic and civilian casualties. The Nevada State Nuclear Projects Agency found that a train accident in a Baltimore tunnel could breach a nuclear waste cask, causing contamination over 33 square miles, costing $13 billion to clean up, and potentially leading to 31,824 cancer-related deaths. The Yucca Mountain Project faces high vulnerability to terrorist attacks at various stages, including transportation and storage of radioactive waste. The United States Government has not adequately addressed the threat of terrorist attacks on the Yucca Mountain Project, including vulnerabilities to sabotage, intrusions, vandalism, and bomb-related incidents. The Department of Energy's risk assessment methodology underestimates the risks associated with terrorism against radioactive shipments and storage facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not updated its rules on nuclear waste transportation since the 1970s, leaving them outdated and inadequate to address modern threats and terrorism risks. SEC. 3. YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT VULNERABILITY AND DEFENSE PLAN. The Office of Homeland Security will coordinate an interagency plan to prepare for and defend against Federal crimes of terrorism targeting the Yucca Mountain Project. The plan will include a safety analysis and address attacks on shipments of nuclear waste, facilities, personnel, and infrastructure. The Office of Homeland Security will coordinate a plan to defend against terrorism targeting the Yucca Mountain Project, focusing on nuclear waste shipments, facilities, personnel, and infrastructure. Special emphasis will be given to addressing the use of nuclear waste as a radiological weapon, high-energy explosives, and sabotage or theft of high-level nuclear waste. The plan to defend the Yucca Mountain Project against terrorism includes strategies for air and ground assaults, truck bombs, armor-piercing technologies, and worst-case attack scenarios. It also considers weather conditions, no-fly zones, and policy enforcement. The development of policy for a no-fly zone over key areas involved in the Yucca Mountain Project, background checks for personnel transporting nuclear waste, a federal standard for deadly force protection, and rules of engagement for potential airborne attacks are key considerations. The plan includes an analysis of economic, public health, and environmental costs of implementing it. SEC. 4. YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT TERRORISM CONSEQUENCE ASSESSMENT AND RESPONSE PLAN. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will coordinate a comprehensive interagency plan to respond to Federal crimes of terrorism at the Yucca Mountain Project, including pre-response preparations, evacuation plans, and procedures for notifying emergency response units about nuclear waste transportation. The comprehensive interagency plan for responding to Federal crimes of terrorism at the Yucca Mountain Project includes analyzing the immediate and long-term public health effects, environmental impacts, socioeconomic impacts, and conducting a cost-benefit analysis of implementing the plan, including repercussions and costs from various types of terrorism. The technical review is outlined in Section 5 of the plan for responding to Federal crimes of terrorism at the Yucca Mountain Project. The Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and FEMA will collaborate with the National Research Council for technical reviews of plans related to analyzing and preparing for potential terrorist threats at the Yucca Mountain Project. The reviews will focus on strengths, weaknesses, physical testing needs, container vulnerability, and the adequacy of computer models for assessing environmental dispersion and health effects of released radionuclides. The National Research Council will review plans for potential terrorist threats at the Yucca Mountain Project, focusing on analyzing health effects of released radionuclides. SEC. 6. GOVERNMENT LIABILITY OF YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT CONTRACTING. The Assistant to the President for Homeland Security will report to Congress on liability costs and damages from Federal terrorism against the Yucca Mountain Project before the Secretary of Energy can recommend to the President. SEC. 7. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RECOMMENDATION. SEC. 7. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RECOMMENDATION. The Secretary of Energy must not recommend Yucca Mountain repository to the President unless interagency plans are completed, public hearings are held, and the project is certified to be free from terrorism vulnerabilities. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\nFor this Act:\n(1) \"Federal crime of terrorism\" is defined in section 2332b(g)(5) of title 18, United States Code.\n(2) \"Yucca Mountain Project\" includes all aspects of the high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, including transportation plans, storage facilities, and repositories."
