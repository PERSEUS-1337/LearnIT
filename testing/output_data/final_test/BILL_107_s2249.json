    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting Healthy Eating Behaviors in Youth Act\". Anorexia Nervosa is a common eating disorder characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss, with serious health consequences including heart failure, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and death. It has the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric disorders, with young women being 12 times more likely to die than others their age. Bulimia Nervosa, on the other hand, involves excessive food consumption followed by compensatory behaviors like self-induced vomiting. Bulimia Nervosa involves compensatory behaviors like vomiting, laxative misuse, fasting, and excessive exercise. It affects 1.1 to 4.2 percent of American women and is linked to cardiac, gastrointestinal, and dental issues. The disorder typically emerges in adolescence, with 7.5 percent of high school girls using laxatives or vomiting for weight control. Binge Eating Disorder is characterized by uncontrolled overeating and affects 2 to 5 percent of Americans in a 6-month period. Eating disorders like binge eating are prevalent among Americans and are linked to various health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. These disorders also have significant psychological implications, including depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Additionally, poor eating habits have contributed to the high rates of obesity in the United States, especially among children and adolescents. Inadequate calcium intake among youth poses a serious risk for osteoporosis and other bone diseases. The Nation's youth face a calcium crisis due to insufficient intake. Eating disorders, more common in women, can lead to obesity and osteoporosis. Urging overweight youth to be thin has not reduced obesity rates and may cause other issues like body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem. Interventions for promoting healthy eating behaviors should focus on a healthy lifestyle, not unhealthy weight management techniques. The purposes of this Act are to increase preventive health activities promoting healthy eating habits in youth, support research on educational programs for the same, and disseminate effective intervention programs. SEC. 4 of the Act introduces amendments to address and prevent eating disorders, obesity, and osteoporosis through promoting healthy eating and exercise habits in youth. It includes a grant program for these issues. The Secretary will award grants to universities, colleges, or nonprofit organizations to promote healthy eating behaviors in youth, focusing on at-risk populations like adolescent girls. The grants will last up to 4 years and must be used to develop educational curricula and intervention programs for healthy eating habits in youth. The grants awarded under this section focus on promoting healthy eating behaviors in youth, with science-based interventions including nutritional content, understanding hunger and satiety, positive body image and self-esteem development, and life skills like stress management and communication. Grants are awarded in addition to any other grants received, and the Director will review the effectiveness of the programs. The section focuses on identifying effective programs promoting healthy eating habits in youth, defined as regular eating for nourishment and energy, acknowledging appetite signals, and promoting social relationships. The provisions are effective for 5 years with an authorization of $5,000,000 for fiscal year. The section authorizes funding of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, $5,500,000 for 2004, $6,000,000 for 2005, $6,500,000 for 2006, and $1,000,000 for 2007."
