The Israeli-Palestinian Peace Enhancement Act of 2003 emphasizes the importance of the security of Israel as a national interest of the United States and the need for a peaceful Middle East free of violence and terrorism. It acknowledges the Palestinian people's suffering due to leaders resorting to violence, and expresses support for a two-state solution with Israel and Palestine living in peace and security. President George W. Bush's vision for the region is also referenced. President George W. Bush outlined a vision for peace in the Middle East region after a change in Palestinian leadership. The Palestinian state must be reformed, peaceful, and democratic, renouncing the use of terror.

The purposes of this title are to express Congress's support for recognizing a Palestinian state and to show willingness to provide economic and humanitarian aid after Palestinians achieve reforms and peace with Israel. Congress acknowledges the need for Palestinian government reforms outlined by President Bush, economic assistance post-reforms, praises the appointment of Mahmoud Abbas as prime minister, and urges security measures for peace with Israel.

It is crucial for national security to achieve a just resolution based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. SEC. 5. RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE. The sense of Congress is that the US should not recognize a Palestinian state until a new leadership not involved in terrorism is elected, and the entity shows commitment to peaceful coexistence with Israel, ends anti-Israel incitement, and takes measures against terrorism and terrorist financing. The Palestinian entity must cooperate with Israeli security, govern effectively, promote peace with Israel in education, and prevent anti-Israel incitement. SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO A PALESTINIAN STATE. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to include a new section limiting assistance to a Palestinian state.

AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE TO A PALESTINIAN STATE. Authorization of assistance to a Palestinian state is added to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The President is authorized to provide assistance to a Palestinian state to improve the economy and living conditions by supporting activities such as economic development, promoting democracy, developing water resources, assisting in security cooperation, and helping with the compensation of Palestinian refugees. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these purposes. The Secretary of State will coordinate international assistance for Palestinians through donors conferences to ensure timely commitments from other countries, institutions, and organizations.
