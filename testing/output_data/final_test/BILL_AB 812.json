    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 4 is added to the Education Code, defining pupils of limited academic English proficiency as those lacking necessary English language skills for instruction at an equivalent level to English-speaking peers of the same age or grade. Academic English is the language proficiency required for effective learning in school and academic programs, including formal-language skills like vocabulary, grammar, and discipline-specific terminology. It is contrasted with conversational or social language and helps pupils acquire knowledge and academic skills while navigating school policies and cultural norms. The Superintendent, in consultation with the department and local educational agencies, must develop a process by September 1, 2016, to identify pupils who may meet specific criteria related to academic performance. This process includes special consideration for pupils with low scores on assessments, failing grades in English language arts, or identified by teachers as needing support. The department, in consultation with local educational agencies, must develop a study on best practices for providing instruction to pupils of limited academic English proficiency by January 1, 2017. The study will include information on existing programs, effective teaching methods, and teacher training needs. It will be submitted to the Legislature in compliance with the Government Code. The department must develop an assessment tool by September 1, 2017, to determine the proficiency level of pupils with limited academic English proficiency. Procedures will be established for conducting the assessment and designating pupils as academically English proficient. From the 2018-19 school year, an assessment will be conducted upon initial enrollment or soon after to determine if a student is academically English proficient. Annual assessments will continue until the student is designated as proficient. School districts can designate a pupil as academic English proficient if they score 3 or higher on assessments. If a pupil remains limited in English proficiency after grade 8 assessments, targeted resources will be provided to improve their scores by grade 11. The assessments must comply with federal statutes and regulations. The Superintendent will develop a procedure to designate limited English proficiency students as proficient in academic English, using multiple criteria including assessment, teacher evaluation, and parental input. The Education Code allows for parental opinion and consultation in determining a pupil's proficiency in academic English. Schools can test limited English proficiency students multiple times in a school year if desired. Section 314 of the Education Code mandates an evaluation of the Los Angeles Unified School District's Academic English Mastery Program in collaboration with UCLA Center X. The evaluation will focus on data collection, policy questions, and curriculum for pupils with limited academic English proficiency. The evaluation must be completed by a specified date and submitted to legislative committees. This section will be repealed on January 1, 20___.
