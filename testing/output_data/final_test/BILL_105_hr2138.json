    "content": "The Act titled \"Municipal Biological Monitoring Use Act\" requires biological monitoring at various municipal facilities, including treatment works, storm sewer systems, and combined sewer overflows. The Act requires biological monitoring at municipal facilities, excluding the use of water quality standards or effluent limitations leading to violations in toxicity or biological tests. The Act mandates biological monitoring at municipal facilities using indigenous aquatic species to assess effluent toxicity accurately in specific receiving waters. The permitting authority may require further analysis or reduction of effluent toxicity from certain municipal facilities if it contributes to exceeding toxicity criteria in water bodies. This applies to publicly owned treatment works, storm sewer systems, and wet weather control facilities, with conditions needing to be technically feasible and accurately representing toxicity levels. The amendment to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires the use of biological monitoring or whole effluent toxicity testing at certain municipal facilities to assess and reduce toxicity levels in water bodies. This includes publicly owned treatment works, storm sewer systems, and wet weather control facilities. The amendment to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act mandates biological monitoring, whole effluent toxicity testing, or assessment methods for certain municipal facilities to reduce toxicity levels in water bodies.
