    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Windstorm Hazard Reduction Research and Technology Transfer Act\". The Congress acknowledges the vulnerability of Coastal States, island States, and territories to windstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. Hurricanes have caused significant loss of life and property damage, with an average of 14 deaths and $4,970,000,000 in property losses annually from 1990 to 1999. Improved windstorm hazard reduction measures are necessary. Improved windstorm hazard reduction measures, such as cost-effective design, informed land use decisions, impact prediction methodologies, and public education programs, have the potential to reduce losses over the next 10 years. Wind engineering research should focus on improving new structures and retrofitting existing ones. The Federal Government has a role in collecting, preparing, and disseminating windstorm hazard reduction information to protect communities. An effective Federal program in windstorm hazard reduction requires interagency coordination, input from experts, and improved mechanisms for knowledge transfer to stakeholders. Tax credits can help homeowners implement mitigation measures for windstorms, which are a global issue requiring international cooperation for mutual learning and mitigation. The definitions in this Act include the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the States of the United States and its territories, and the definition of a windstorm as a storm with damaging winds. The Act also establishes a National Windstorm Hazard Reduction Program. The Director will establish an Interagency Group within 30 days of the Act's enactment, cochaired with the Director of FEMA. The group will include representatives from various federal agencies to develop a coordinated windstorm hazard reduction research program. Lead agencies may be designated, and existing programs preserved. The windstorm hazard reduction program aims to achieve measurable reductions in losses to life and property from windstorms within 10 years. This involves cooperation among governments and the private sector, including research on locality-specific weather, understanding impediments to hazard reduction, and coordination with other agencies. The wind hazard reduction program aims to reduce losses from windstorms by inventorying buildings, disseminating cost-effective mitigation measures, improving prediction technology, increasing public awareness, and prioritizing critical lifelines. Research and development elements may include various initiatives to enhance hazard reduction efforts. Development elements of the wind hazard reduction program may involve basic wind characterization, research on track and magnitude prediction of windstorms, peer-reviewed research on wind-resistant systems and materials, and mechanisms for collecting information on building performance in windstorms. Development elements of the wind hazard reduction program include research on wind-resistant systems and materials, cost-effective planning and construction methods for critical structures, and techniques for mitigating windstorm damage. Development elements of the wind hazard reduction program include research on mapping windstorm hazard risks in finer detail, predicting damaging windstorm impact, improving emergency services after a windstorm, assessing socioeconomic effects of windstorms, and exploring mitigation techniques to reduce vulnerability. The technology transfer elements of the wind hazard reduction program involve collecting, classifying, and disseminating research results and information on windstorm phenomena to various stakeholders. This includes identifying vulnerable locations, ways to reduce windstorm damage, and collaborating with the private sector and academia. The Interagency Group established under subsection (a) will work on curriculum development, training programs, and public awareness efforts related to windstorm hazard mitigation. They will refine objectives, develop measurements, and create a 10-year implementation plan in collaboration with State and local governments and private sector organizations. The Interagency Group will submit an implementation plan to Congress within 210 days of the Act's enactment. The plan includes research goals, improved forecasting techniques for windstorms, building damage inventory, and technology transfer to government and private sectors. The implementation plan includes provisions for dissemination of information and technology to reduce vulnerability to windstorm hazards, incorporation of research results into Federal disaster relief programs, establishment of goals and priorities, and assignment of responsibilities for program elements. The implementation plan for the program includes cooperation with governmental entities in all states, staffing plans, and avoiding duplication of responsibilities among Federal agencies. Additionally, any measures developed under the Act should not be required for manufactured homes certified under existing standards. Manufactured homes certified under existing standards are exempt from measures developed under the Act (U.S.C. 5415) without going through the consensus development process and rulemaking procedures. The National Advisory Committee for Windstorm Hazard Reduction is established. The National Advisory Committee for Windstorm Hazard Reduction is established with 21 members appointed by the President to review progress, advise on improvements, and report to Congress on actions taken to reduce windstorm hazards. Members represent various interests such as research, technology, architecture, engineering, finance, materials suppliers, government entities, construction sectors, and the insurance industry. The National Advisory Committee for Windstorm Hazard Reduction consists of 21 members appointed by the President from various sectors like research, technology, architecture, engineering, finance, materials suppliers, government entities, construction industry, and insurance industry. The Advisory Committee coordinates with existing advisory committees, provides an annual report to Congress, and is exempt from certain regulations under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The National Advisory Committee for Windstorm Hazard Reduction provides an annual report to Congress. The Interagency Group established under section 4(a) must submit an annual report to Congress on the windstorm hazard reduction program's progress and any recommended legislative actions. Additionally, the group is encouraged to organize an annual conference to share research findings and mitigation efforts. The annual conference will include representatives from various sectors impacted by windstorm hazards, such as research, technology, engineering, construction, and insurance industries. Authorization of appropriations for activities under this Act: $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2003."
