The Congress finds that NATO has been crucial for the security, freedom, and prosperity of the US and its allies since 1949. The Alliance is defensive and poses no threat to any nation. Enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe will enhance stability and security in Europe without threatening any nation. America's security is tied to Europe's security. NATO's commitment to mutual defense has enabled the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. The United States values the independence and integrity of emerging democracies in the region. NATO has expanded its membership multiple times since 1949. Congress aims to support further enlargement efforts. The Partnership for Peace, established in 1994, promotes cooperation between NATO and Central and Eastern European countries, offering a path to future NATO membership. New NATO members share the costs of maintaining stability in Europe. Europe will be shared more widely with greater responsibility and capabilities by European NATO members. The enlargement process will require political will and resources from current NATO members, including the United States. New members will have full rights and obligations under the Washington Treaty to assist emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. The United States should support emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe interested in joining NATO to develop force structures for territorial defense. Regional peacekeeping initiatives like the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion can contribute to European peace. NATO is crucial for European peace and security, conducting military operations effectively, and defusing tensions between member states since its inception in 1949. Enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe is important and should receive support from the United States. Enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe is crucial for European peace and security. Progress towards admission will depend on meeting criteria related to human rights and fundamental freedoms. Several Central and Eastern European countries are interested in NATO membership and have shown commitment through participation in Partnership for Peace activities. Democratic civilian control of defense forces is crucial for states preparing for NATO membership. The security and economic stability of the Caucasus region are important to the United States, and promoting economic, fiscal, and political reforms in the region is encouraged. The process of NATO enlargement involves consensus agreement among all NATO members for new member accession dates to vary. Additional NATO transition assistance aims to support emerging democracies ready for closer ties with NATO and help other eligible countries move towards eventual membership for lasting security and stability in Europe. The Congress of the United States finds that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made significant progress towards meeting criteria for NATO membership. Future evaluation for NATO membership in Central and Eastern Europe should be based on nations' progress in enhancing NATO's security and gaining approval from all NATO members. SEC. 3.

The Congress supports NATO enlargement for economic stability and security in several countries, including Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. It is recognized that these countries have valid historical security concerns that should be considered by the United States. They should not be disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO due to their forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union. The NATO Participation Act of 1994 designates Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as eligible for assistance. The President can also designate other Central and Eastern European countries for assistance under the program.
