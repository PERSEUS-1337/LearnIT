    "content": "The \"State Energy Race to the Top Initiative Act of 2013\" aims to support energy policy innovation in states to double electric and thermal energy productivity by 2030. It defines terms like \"covered entity\" and \"State\" and outlines the initial allocation of grants to states in Phase 1. The Secretary will invite States to participate in an energy productivity challenge within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Grants of $1,000,000 to $3,500,000 will be provided to up to 25 States. States must submit plans within 90 days to be eligible for the grant. The Secretary will make a final decision on grant allocation based on State energy conservation plans within 90 days. The decision will consider improvement in energy productivity and other relevant factors, including geographic diversity. Plans will be ranked from greatest to least likely contribution. The revised State energy conservation plan must describe how energy savings will be monitored, establish a baseline for energy use, promote energy savings goals, and leverage investments in energy efficiency from both public and private sectors. The State energy conservation plan must ensure efficiency through banks, credit unions, and institutional investors without causing cost-shifting or negative impacts on low-income populations. It should also involve cooperation between the State energy office, public service commission, local governments, and ensure grants supplement existing programs. The State energy conservation plan can use grants to promote industrial energy efficiency, expand energy efficiency retrofits for buildings, and incentivize demand response and energy efficiency in the electric utility sector. The State energy conservation plan can use grants to promote industrial energy efficiency, expand energy efficiency retrofits for buildings, incentivize demand response, and energy efficiency in the electric utility sector. Additionally, the plan aims to promote cost-effective heat and power incentives, financing of energy efficiency programs, data use incentives, district heating, regular energy audits, and leadership by example in State activities to promote energy efficiency. Federal grants provided under this Act can help expand these efforts. Phase 2 involves the subsequent allocation of grants to states. States that received grants under section 4 must submit a report on program performance and how additional funds would be used. The Secretary will then provide grants to up to 6 states, not exceeding $30,000,000 each, for carrying out specified programs and activities. The Secretary will base grant decisions on state performance, program potential, project diversity, and leveraging non-Federal funds effectively, with grants not exceeding $30,000,000 each. SEC. 6. ALLOCATION OF GRANTS TO COVERED ENTITIES. The Secretary will invite covered entities to submit plans for an energy productivity challenge within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Covered entities must submit plans to increase energy productivity within 90 days to be eligible for grants. The Secretary will decide on grant allocations within 90 days based on submitted plans. The Secretary will consider plans for improvement in energy productivity, continuation of improvements after receiving grants, and other relevant factors such as geographic diversity and equitable treatment of sectors. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary will consult with the National Research Council to evaluate program performance and effectiveness under the Act. Grants to States will supplement State energy conservation programs under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The Act requires a minimum grant of $50,000,000 under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act for a State to receive funding. Participation in challenges established under the Act is voluntary. Authorization of Appropriations: $200,000,000 allocated for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. Funds divided for grants to States, public power utilities, electric cooperatives, Indian tribes, and administrative costs. Offset provision included. SEC. 9. OFFSET. Amends Section 422(f) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to set the offset at $0 for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2017."
