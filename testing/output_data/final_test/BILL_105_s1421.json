    "content": "The Act titled \"Clinical Research Enhancement Act of 1997\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that clinical research is crucial for scientific advancement, with significant progress in biology providing new insights into human health. Translational research plays a vital role in developing new methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. The United States will allocate over $1 trillion for healthcare in 1997, highlighting the importance of federal funding for health research. In 1997, the Federal budget for health research at the National Institutes of Health was $12.7 billion, only 1 percent of the total healthcare budget. Studies by various institutions have addressed current problems in clinical research. The Director of the National Institutes of Health has acknowledged these issues and initiated evaluations through an advisory committee. Training and support for health professionals in clinical research are fragmented, undervalued, and potentially underfunded. Young investigators are seen as crucial for future positions and a source of energy and ideas. The future of life-science research is at risk due to a decline in young investigators applying for grants and federally funded research grants awarded to individuals under 36. Newly independent life-scientists are expected to raise funds for their research programs and a portion of their salaries. This decline in active clinical researchers is attributed to various reasons. Choosing a career in medical research comes with challenges such as high debt from medical school, lengthy clinical training, lack of mentors, funding instability, and inadequate research training in the curriculum. Academic Medical Centers also struggle to maintain a conducive environment for research. In a highly competitive health care marketplace, maintaining a proper research environment is challenging due to decreased third-party payer coverage for research costs. General clinical research centers were established in 1960 under the National Institutes of Health, with an initial appropriation of $3,000,000. By fiscal year 1997, appropriations for these centers reached $153,000,000, with 74 centers in operation providing access to modern clinical research facilities. The purpose of this Act is to provide additional support for and expand clinical research programs, with an average annual allocation of $1,900,000 for each general clinical research center, representing 75 percent of the amounts approved by the Advisory Council of the National Center for Research Resources. Increasing the involvement of the National Institutes of Health in clinical research. The Director of NIH is mandated to support and expand NIH's involvement in clinical research by implementing pilot projects, establishing fellowship and training programs, and increasing resources available for clinical research. The Director of NIH will establish peer review mechanisms for various clinical research awards and fellowships to support and expand resources for the clinical research community. SEC. 4. GENERAL CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTERS. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is further amended by adding a new section for General Clinical Research Centers. The Director of the National Center for Research Resources awards grants for general clinical research centers to support clinical studies and career development. These centers provide infrastructure for clinical research and utilize telecommunications and telemedicine initiatives. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Enhancement awards are also available. The Director of the National Center for Research Resources provides grants for clinical research career enhancement at institutions with appropriate resources. Applications must be submitted by individual scientists, and collaboration with other Institute Directors is encouraged. The Director of the National Center for Research Resources offers grants for clinical research projects at general clinical research centers. Grants are limited to $125,000 per year for 5 years, with a maximum of 20 grants in the first fiscal year and 40 grants in the second fiscal year. $3,000,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 1998, with additional funding for subsequent years. The National Center for Research Resources offers grants for clinical research projects at institutions with appropriate infrastructure. Grants are limited to $175,000 per year per grant, with a total authorization of $52,500,000 for fiscal year 1998. The National Center for Research Resources offers grants for clinical research projects, with a total authorization of $52,500,000 for fiscal year 1998. The Director may make grants for graduate training in clinical investigation, with a maximum amount of $75,000 per year per grant. Grants provide stipend, tuition, and institutional support for individuals pursuing master's or doctoral degrees in clinical investigation. The National Center for Research Resources offers grants for graduate training in clinical investigation, providing stipend, tuition, and institutional support for advanced degree programs in clinical investigation. These programs award master's or Ph.D. degrees after 2 or more years of training in various areas such as analytical methods, clinical pharmacology, epidemiology, data management, ethics, and biomedical writing. Authorization of appropriations is provided for making grants under this subsection. Authorization of appropriations is provided for making grants under this subsection, totaling $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and necessary sums for subsequent years. \"Authorization of appropriations for grants totaling $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and subsequent years.\" The Public Health Service Act is amended to increase the number of National Research Service Awards from 50 to 100. Additionally, changes are made to the Loan Repayment Program, including removing references to disadvantaged backgrounds and specifying clinical research training positions. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program is amended to ensure that at least 50 percent of contracts involve health professionals from disadvantaged backgrounds. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program is amended to require that 50 percent of contracts involve health professionals from disadvantaged backgrounds. This includes defining a clinical research training position and authorizing appropriations for each fiscal year. SEC. 6. DEFINITION. Amends Section 409 of the Public Health Service Act to define clinical research as patient-oriented research with human subjects or research on disease causes and consequences in human populations."
