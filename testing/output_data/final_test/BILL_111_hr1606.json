    "content": "The Act is titled the \"New Automobile Voucher Act of 2009\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the automotive sector is a significant contributor to the US economy, with 13 million jobs related to automobiles. This includes jobs in manufacturing, parts suppliers, dealerships, and retail sales. Despite a decrease in new automobile sales from 2005 to 2008, the industry remains a crucial part of the economy. The decline in new automobile sales in the United States resulted in a loss of $105 billion directly from the economy. The economic multiplier effects indicate a total loss of $315 billion to $735 billion. To revive the automobile industry and manufacturing base, the goal is to sell 15 million new automobiles in 2009. The government aims to implement a new automobile voucher program to boost sales and revive the industry, following a significant decline in new automobile sales in the United States. The government is establishing the \"New Automobile Voucher Program\" in the Department of the Treasury to issue vouchers to dealers for eligible new automobile purchases by individuals or fleet operators. Dealers must agree to apply the voucher towards the purchase and comply with program requirements. The Act and regulations by the Secretary will establish a Web-based system for voucher processing at the point of sale, certify program operation, and make payments to dealers. The Program specifies that only one voucher per person can be issued, unless they are an eligible fleet operator. Additionally, only one voucher can be applied to each eligible new automobile, with dealers required to credit the voucher amount towards the purchase. The voucher issued for the purchase of an eligible new automobile cannot be used in combination with other rebates or discounts. The value of the voucher will not be limited by any other tax incentives or vouchers. Vouchers will be issued electronically through a web-based system. During the initial period, a voucher issued under the Program can offset the purchase price of an eligible new automobile by $5,000, while during the secondary period, it can offset the price by $2,500. The Secretary must fulfill redemption requests within 10 days, or sooner if feasible, and rulemaking must be completed within 30 days. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within 30 days to enforce penalties for the Program. Congress or the Secretary can terminate or limit the Program or voucher issuance. SEC. 4.
