    "content": "The \"Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2007\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The \"Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2007\" cites United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) and highlights the lack of punishment for Saudi donors to terrorist groups. Stewart Levey testified in 2005 about the need to prevent terrorist financing. The Department of the Treasury reported that Saudi donors are still a significant source of terrorist financing, including for the insurgency in Iraq. American officials say that nearly half of foreign fighters entering Iraq are from Saudi Arabia. About 45% of foreign militants targeting U.S. troops in Iraq are also from Saudi Arabia. Iraqi civilians and security forces are from Saudi Arabia, with nearly half of the 135 foreigners in U.S. detention facilities in Iraq being Saudis. Fighters from Saudi Arabia are responsible for a significant number of suicide bombings in Iraq. The Center for Religious Freedom reported that despite claims of educational reform by the Saudi Foreign Minister, their religious textbooks still promote intolerance. Saudi Arabia promotes Wahhabism as the official state doctrine, advocating the destruction of non-Wahhabi Muslims. The country's textbooks are used to educate about 5,000,000 children annually in Islamic studies. The Saudi government has been criticized for not effectively reviewing and revising educational materials that promote extremist ideology. Saudi Arabia's petroleum industry has enabled wealthy Saudis to sponsor charities and foundations linked to religious intolerance and support of terrorist activities. The Saudi National Commission for Relief and Charity Work Abroad was created to oversee these efforts. The Saudi National Commission for Relief and Charity Work Abroad was established to oversee private overseas aid operations and charitable donations from Saudi Arabia to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. Former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte mentioned in a 2006 hearing that some private Saudi citizens still donate to terrorists. Service reported that 5 beneficiaries of the Saudi Committee for the Support of the Al Quds Intifada were suspected suicide bombers. Terrorism expert Steve Emerson highlighted Saudi Arabia's lack of follow-through on reform and anti-terrorism efforts during a Senate testimony. The Saudi government established the Saudi Committee for the Support of the Al Quds Intifada, which provided aid to Palestinian terrorist groups. A spreadsheet revealed $545,000 allocated to 102 families of martyrs, including 8 suicide bombers. A report indicated that over 60 beneficiaries matched known Palestinian militants. The Saudi government supported Palestinian terrorist groups, with funding coming from private donors in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Saudi Arabia was found to be promoting hatred and violence in the United States through material distributed by its embassy. Wahhabism was identified as a dangerous ideological enemy by former CIA Director R. James Woolsey. Former CIA Director R. James Woolsey highlighted the common Salafist ideology shared by al Qaeda and the Wahhabis, which has been spread through Saudi funding to madrassas, textbooks, and mosques worldwide. Saudi religious textbooks continue to promote hatred and jihad against non-Wahhabi Muslims, perpetuating an ideology of hate towards unbelievers. The text highlights Saudi Arabia's promotion of hatred and jihad against non-Wahhabi Muslims, emphasizing the religious obligation to battle infidels to spread the faith. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has discussed increasing boycott efforts against Israel despite their WTO obligations. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the Government of Saudi Arabia must immediately close all Saudi-based terror organizations and cease funding for such activities worldwide. The Government of Saudi Arabia must close all Saudi-based terror organizations, block funding to offshore terror organizations, and cooperate fully with the United States in investigating terrorism financing. The President should certify if Saudi Arabia has effectively combated terrorism since the 2003 bombing in Riyadh, and if any individuals have supported or committed acts of terror against US citizens worldwide. The President must certify Saudi Arabia's cooperation in investigating and preventing terrorist attacks, closing Wahhabist organizations funding extremism, blocking funding to terrorist movements, and halting support for radical Wahhabi ideology. The Secretary of State must provide a status report every 6 months on Saudi Arabia's progress towards meeting specified conditions. The report will be unclassified but may include a classified annex. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs."
