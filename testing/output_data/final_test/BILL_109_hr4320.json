    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Flood Insurance Program Commitment to Policyholders and Reform Act of 2005\". The Congress acknowledges that flood insurance claims from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita will surpass previous claims in the national flood insurance program, necessitating an increase in borrowing authority. Policyholders expect fair compensation for covered losses, and updated flood maps are needed to assess potential damage nationwide. The national flood insurance program requires updates to reflect inflation and housing costs. Reforms from the 2004 Flood Insurance Reform Act have not been fully implemented. The Act aims to protect policyholders and ensure continued access to flood insurance. The national flood insurance program aims to protect policyholders by increasing incentives for participation, raising awareness of flood risks, and mitigating future damage through protective measures and property buyouts. SEC. 3. Study on mandatory purchase requirement for 500-year floodplain and reports on flood map modernization. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on extending mandatory flood insurance coverage to all properties in the 500-year floodplain, assessing impacts on homeownership costs, the national flood insurance program, FEMA, and local communities. The study will assess the effectiveness and feasibility of extending mandatory flood insurance requirements to properties in the 500-year floodplain, considering impacts on homeowners, the national flood insurance program, local communities, and stakeholders like insurance companies and management agencies. It will also examine liability issues for lenders and burdens on building officials. The Comptroller General will report to Congress on the impacts of extending mandatory flood insurance requirements to properties in the 500-year floodplain, including burdens on building officials, FEMA, existing policyholders, and homeowners' ability to make renovations. The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide annual reports to Congress on the progress of updating and modernizing floodplain areas and flood-risk zones until completion. Upon finishing the updates, a certification report will be submitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register. The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will submit annual reports to Congress by June 30 each year on the progress of updating floodplain areas and flood-risk zones. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. Amendment to increase the amount from $350 to $2,000 and remove the last sentence in section 102(f) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. SEC. 5. FEMA responsibilities reiterated under the 2004 Reform Act. The Director of FEMA is directed to establish an appeals process for flood insurance policy holders to appeal decisions. Additionally, minimum training and education requirements for insurance agents selling flood insurance policies must be enforced. The Director of FEMA must issue regulations to implement amendments to the Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 within 30 days. A report on the implementation of the Act must be submitted to Congress within 6 months. SEC. 6 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to increase maximum coverage limits: $250,000 to $335,500, $100,000 to $135,000, and $500,000 to $670,700. SEC. 7 introduces coverage for additional living expenses and business interruption. In section 1306 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, amendments include increasing coverage limits and introducing coverage for living expenses due to flood damage. New paragraphs specify minimum liability for living expenses and chargeable rates for coverage. Optional coverage for business interruption due to flood damage is available for commercial properties, while additional living expenses coverage is mandated for residential properties with increased limits set by the Director. Optional coverage for business interruption due to flood damage is available for commercial properties, with losses determined based on previous financial records and coverage offered at chargeable rates not less than estimated premium rates. SEC. 8. INCREASE IN BORROWING AUTHORITY. The borrowing authority under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is increased from $3.5 billion to $22 billion. FEMA must submit a plan for repaying borrowed amounts within 6 months of this Act's enactment. SEC. 9. CLARIFICATION OF REPLACEMENT COST PROVISIONS, FORMS, AND POLICY LANGUAGE. The Director of FEMA must issue regulations clarifying replacement cost coverage under the national flood insurance program, revise materials to describe coverage more clearly to policyholders, and update language in standard flood insurance policies regarding rating and coverage. The national flood insurance program requires regulations to clarify replacement cost coverage and update language in policies regarding rating and coverage descriptions. This includes classification of buildings, basements, crawl spaces, detached garages, enclosures below elevated buildings, and replacement costs. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to require FEMA to submit semiannual reports to Congress on the financial status of the national flood insurance program, detailing the National Flood Insurance Fund's financial status, claims, premium receipts, expenses, and borrowing levels. SEC. 11 amends RESPA to require inclusion of a statement on flood insurance availability in good faith estimates. SEC. 12 addresses eligibility for property demolition and rebuilding in mitigation assistance programs. The National Flood Insurance Act is amended to allow for the demolition and rebuilding of structures to at least Base Flood Elevation. Additionally, FEMA is authorized to hire additional staff as needed to fulfill the Director's responsibilities under the Act."
