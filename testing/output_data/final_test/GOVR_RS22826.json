    "content": "In 2006, older households spent nearly 10% of their total expenditures on energy-related goods and services. The main components of energy expenditures are utilities, fuel for homes, gasoline, and motor oil. Electricity accounts for 62.8% of spending on utilities and fuel, followed by natural gas at 27.6%. The use of different fuels varies by region, with natural gas being most common in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, while electricity is most common in the South. Heating oil is also significant in the Northeast. Household energy expenditures have increased due to rising crude oil prices, with petroleum-based products like fuel oil, propane, and gasoline making up about 50% of costs. Energy prices to consumers have risen significantly, driving overall energy spending growth. In 2007, overall energy prices rose 17.4% compared to a 4.1% rise in overall prices. The increase in energy prices in December 2007 accounted for about one-third of the overall CPI increase that month. Rising energy prices have direct and indirect effects on consumer prices, as all goods and services rely on energy for production. Higher energy prices may be passed on to consumers, leading to increased inflation rates. The consumer price index, excluding energy, has been rising in recent years, indicating that higher energy prices are impacting other areas of consumption. Older households account for 20% of the nation's energy consumption but are disproportionately affected by higher energy costs. In 2006, they spent 9.5% of their income on energy-related services compared to 7.4% for younger households. Lower-income elderly spend significantly more on energy-related services as a share of income compared to higher-income elderly. In 2006, elderly households with incomes over $15,000 spent 13% of their income on utilities and fuel, compared to 4.7% for older households with similar income levels. About 22% of older Americans had family incomes below 150% of the poverty thresholds in 2006. Energy expenditures have increased faster than income for older households over time, but energy-related spending for low-income elderly is not increasing as rapidly. Average annual energy-related spending for low-income households has only increased by 5.9% since 2000, compared to a 20% increase for higher-income households. This disparity may be due to lower-income households adjusting their behavior in response to rising energy costs, such as reducing savings and other expenses. Other responses include investing in energy-efficient upgrades like heating and cooling systems, windows, and fuel-efficient cars. These alternatives may lead to long-term cost savings for low-income households. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) was established in 1981 as a key public program providing energy assistance to low-income households. It is a block grant program that allocates funds to states, territories, and tribes to help with home energy costs. LIHEAP eligibility is limited to households with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty guidelines. States may set lower income limits, but no household with income below 110% of the poverty guidelines can qualify. In FY2004, 40% of low-income households eligible for LIHEAP had a member aged 60 or older. Energy costs have increased as a share of income, while LIHEAP funding has declined. Utility and fuel expenditures rose 34.6% from 2000 to 2005, with LIHEAP benefits increasing by 12.6% during the same period. In FY2008, Congress allocated $1.98 billion in LIHEAP funds and $590 million in contingency funds. Two bills in the 110th Congress proposed an additional $1 billion in LIHEAP contingency funds. Several bills have been introduced to provide additional funds for LIHEAP, including H.R. 4275 and S. 2405, known as the \"Keeping Americans Warm Act.\" S. 1238, the \"Energy Security and Corporate Accountability Act of 2007,\" would allow low-income households eligible for LIHEAP to receive state funds for transportation expenses related to gasoline, motor oil, and public transportation."
