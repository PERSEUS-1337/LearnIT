    "content": "The House Natural Resources Committee reported H.R. 1837, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act on February 16, 2012. The bill addresses water shortages for California water contractors due to various environmental laws and makes changes to water management laws at federal and state levels. The bill, known as H.R. 1837, aims to make significant changes to water management laws in California, specifically regarding the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California State Water Project (SWP). It replaces existing laws with operational principles outlined in the Bay-Delta Accord. Stakeholders in California water policy are facing tensions due to low snowpack conditions and projected water allocations. Water users are projected to receive 30% of their contracted supplies, while others, including municipalities and senior water rights holders, are expected to get 75%. In past drought years, south-of-Delta contractors received as little as 10% to 35% of their contracted amounts. Fish populations in California's Central Valley have declined due to water diversions, leading to fishing community losses. A fishery disaster declaration in 2008-2010 allocated $170 million to compensate affected communities. Congress is grappling with how to address these issues. Congress is facing challenges in addressing chronic water shortages in the Central Valley Project (CVP) system without disrupting senior water rights and environmental laws. Tradeoffs include preemption of state laws for increased water deliveries to some users, potentially impacting fishing industries and water management flexibility. The bill's provisions aim to benefit irrigation contractors and municipalities, but the long-term effects on water use and transfer provisions remain uncertain. H.R. 1837 proposes changes to California water policy, including broadening the purposes of water use, altering definitions of fish covered by the act, and reducing revenues into the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund. The bill aims to benefit irrigation contractors and municipalities, but the long-term effects on water use and transfer provisions are uncertain. Title II of H.R. 1837 directs the Secretary to cease implementation of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Agreement, removes the salmon restoration requirement, and makes changes to the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. Title III allows for the conversion of water service contracts to repayment contracts and accelerated repayment of outstanding obligations. Title IV outlines water rights protections. Title IV of H.R. 1837 addresses water rights protections for those with senior water rights to the Central Valley Project (CVP) and includes shortage policy for certain CVP water service contracts. It declares federal supremacy to protect existing water rights and specifies that these provisions should not set a precedent in other states. The bill makes changes to the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), aligning fish and wildlife protection with other priorities. The CVPIA set protection, restoration, and enhancement of fish and wildlife on par with other project purposes, dedicated water for these purposes, established restoration goals and a fund for projects. It also made contracting and operational changes, sparking controversy among junior water users due to limited water allocations. Other factors like state water quality control, hydrological limitations, water rights priorities, and endangered species laws also impact water deliveries. Title I of H.R. 1837 would narrow the scope of fish stocks protected under the CVPIA, limit coverage to those found in 1992, and eliminate protection for non-native species. It also introduces a new definition for \"reasonable flows\" and makes various amendments to the CVPIA related to water allocation, restoration, and mitigation activities. The proposed changes in H.R. 1837 include broadening the definition of \"reasonable flows\" and allowing new contracts without a prohibition. It also extends the maximum contract term to 40 years and directs perpetual contract renewals without clarity on negotiation or review processes. Additionally, it aims to facilitate water transfers, eliminate tiered pricing requirements, and remove revenue streams for fish and wildlife enhancement. The proposed changes in H.R. 1837 broaden the definition of \"reasonable flows\" for fish protection and allow new contracts without a prohibition. It also extends contract terms to 40 years, directs perpetual renewals, facilitates water transfers, eliminates tiered pricing, and removes revenue streams for fish and wildlife enhancement. Additionally, the bill mandates a 25% reduction of water from Section 3406(b)(2) for Delta Division. The bill mandates a 25% reduction of water from Section 3406(b)(2) for Delta Division and prohibits donations or payments to the CVPRF for environmental restoration or mitigation fees related to non-CVP water storage or conveyance. Fish, wildlife, and habitat mitigation and restoration actions must be completed by 2020, reducing water and power contractor payments into the CVPRF. The bill mandates a 25% reduction of water from Section 3406(b)(2) for Delta Division and prohibits donations or payments to the CVPRF for environmental restoration or mitigation fees related to non-CVP water storage or conveyance. An advisory board is established to review and recommend CVPRF expenditures, primarily made up of water and power contractors. The bill also facilitates the transfer and wheeling of non-project water using CVP facilities and requires a least-cost plan by the end of FY2013 to increase CVP water supplies. The bill mandates a 25% reduction of water from Section 3406(b)(2) for Delta Division and prohibits donations or payments to the CVPRF for environmental restoration or mitigation fees related to non-CVP water storage or conveyance. An advisory board is established to review and recommend CVPRF expenditures, primarily made up of water and power contractors. The bill also facilitates the transfer and wheeling of non-project water using CVP facilities and requires a least-cost plan by the end of FY2013 to increase CVP water supplies. Requires implementation of the increased water plan (including any construction of new water storage facilities that might be included in the plan), beginning on October 1, 2013, in coordination with the state of California. If the plan fails to increase the water supply by 800,000 acre feet, implementation of any non-mandatory action under Section 3406(b)(2) shall be suspended until the 800,000 acre feet is replaced. Authorizes the Secretary to partner with local joint power authorities and others in pursuing storage projects (e.g., Sites Reservoir, Upper San Joaquin Storage, Shasta Dam and Los Vaqueros Dam raises) authorized for study under CALFED ( P.L. 108-361 ), but would prohibit federal funds to be used for this. The bill prohibits federal funds for financing and constructing projects authorized for study under CALFED (P.L. 108-361). It directs the operation of the CVP and SWP per principles outlined in the Bay-Delta Accord, without regard to the ESA or any other law. It prohibits restrictions on valid water rights to protect species affected by the projects. State law on catch limits for nonnative fish in the Bay-Delta is preempted. Hatchery fish must be considered in ESA determinations for anadromous fish covered by the bill. The bill H.R. 1837 makes determinations on anadromous fish under the ESA and expands the CVP service area to include Kettleman City. It allows compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act to suffice for NEPA. The changes have tradeoffs, such as limiting fish stock protection and funding for fish and wildlife restoration. Some provisions benefit stakeholders but are opposed by others, like perpetual contract renewals which may streamline the regulatory process but also contribute to the decline of fish populations. The bill H.R. 1837 aims to streamline water supplies and regulatory processes, potentially benefiting some water users but harming others. The diversion of water for agricultural use has led to the drying up of the San Joaquin River, impacting Chinook salmon populations. Legal actions have been taken to advocate for river restoration to support salmon recovery. A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Friant Dam's operation violated state law by harming downstream fisheries. Parties settled instead of going to trial, leading to legislation in 2010 for new water releases from the dam to restore salmon populations in the San Joaquin River. The settlement agreement for increased water flows to restore fisheries at Friant Dam has been controversial due to potential reductions in water diversions for off-stream purposes. The agreement would not release water for restoration in the driest years, and in some years, late winter and early spring flows could help replenish Millerton Lake storage, minimizing delivery reductions later in the year. The Settlement Agreement for increased water flows at Friant Dam may result in reduced deliveries to water contractors depending on various factors. Despite opposition, the majority of stakeholders support the Agreement and its implementing legislation, while others continue to oppose it. Title II of H.R. 1837 aims to address the ongoing controversy. Title II of H.R. 1837 aims to address the controversy surrounding the SJRRS by declaring that it satisfies all obligations related to fish below Friant Dam, including those under state and federal laws. The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to cease implementing the stipulated Settlement Agreement on San Joaquin River Restoration. The San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act's purpose is to restore the San Joaquin River, focusing on a warm water fishery upstream of Mendota Pool. Title II of H.R. 1837 replaces references to the settlement with \"this part\" and directs the Secretary to develop a plan to manage restoration flows. The San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act aims to restore the river, focusing on a warm water fishery upstream of Mendota Pool. Title II of H.R. 1837 directs the Secretary to manage restoration flows and preempts state laws that impose more restrictive requirements on authorized activities. It also includes provisions for environmental compliance and alters funding for the activities. The curr_chunk discusses the alteration of funding for activities covered by H.R. 1837, declaring it satisfies certain provisions and repealing Section 10011 of the SJRRS. It also explains the historical basis of reclamation law and repayment contracts for project beneficiaries. The CVP uses water service contracts for M&I investments, where contractors pay for water actually delivered. These contracts were reduced to 25 years in 1992 by the CVPIA. Repayment contracts are more common outside of California. The Reclamation Reform Act (RRA, P.L. 97-293) raised the original acreage limitation of 160 acres to 960 acres in 1982. This limit has been a point of contention for irrigators in the Central Valley and a rallying point for taxpayer groups and environmentalists. Title III of the Reclamation Reform Act (RRA) authorizes the conversion of water service contracts to repayment contracts, eliminating full-cost pricing and acreage limitations for contractors. The Reclamation Reform Act allows contractors to prepay or accelerate their payments for Central Valley Project contracts. Current outstanding repayment obligations total approximately $1.15 billion for irrigation contracts and $147 million for M&I contracts. Districts interested in prepaying would need to secure funding through a loan or bond issuance. Title IV of H.R. 1837 aims to protect senior water rights and \"area-of-origin\" priorities in state law, providing specific language for this purpose. The added permanency of water contracts under Title I may make prepayment attractive, but the financial and administrative costs of new financing must be considered. Title IV of H.R. 1837 aims to protect Sacramento River Settlement contracts from potential reductions due to ESA implementation, while also safeguarding northern and other senior water rights holders. However, it may not provide new water to junior contractors or address water supply shortages until new water supplies are obtained. The bill aims to end water supply shortages by developing new water supplies or increasing yield. Key provisions include honoring senior water rights, placing limits on water supply reductions for Sacramento Valley agricultural water contractors, and ensuring a minimum guarantee of water deliveries in dry years. The section provides protections for water contractors, ensuring no adverse impacts on water supply or fiscal issues within the Sacramento River watershed or the State Water Project. It references ongoing efforts to improve water supply and address environmental needs in the Bay Delta. The alignment of Title IV with preemption language in Section 108 and Title V is unclear. Title IV of H.R. 1837 raises questions about its alignment with preemption language in Section 108 and Title V, particularly regarding water availability for junior contractors. Title V asserts federal supremacy in water allocation for the CVP and SWP in California, stating that the Act should not set a precedent for other states. The primary aim of H.R. 1837 is to address reduced water deliveries to CVP contractors in California. The bill, aimed at increasing water deliveries to California's CVP contractors, would preempt federal and state laws to achieve this goal. It also includes protections for senior water right holders in specific regions. The impact on other water users in the state remains uncertain. H.R. 1837 aims to change federal reclamation law, contracting provisions, restoration efforts, and state-federal relationships related to water supply in California. It could potentially alter how the state implements its own laws regarding the Central Valley Project and State Water Project, with a focus on relieving water supply shortages, especially during droughts. The extent to which H.R. 1837 would relieve water supply shortages in California, particularly in drought years, is uncertain. Factors such as pumping restrictions, state water quality control plans, and water rights allocations play a significant role in water deliveries. In 2009, during a drought year, approximately 25% of water supply reductions south of the Delta were due to federal restrictions. In 2011, pumping restrictions for endangered species and CVPIA purposes totaled 90,000 acre feet, approximately 1.4% of the total 6.9 million acre feet exported from the Delta that year. It is unclear how much of pumping restrictions are due to state water quality control requirements and to what extent H.R. 1837 would impact water quality purposes. Reducing restrictions can be crucial for long-term water storage and usage in dry years. H.R. 1837 aims to protect existing water rights and limit reductions in water supplies beyond those allowed in the Bay-Delta Accord. Some argue it may hinder efforts to achieve co-equal goals of water supply reliability and ecosystem protection. Section 401 of Title IV emphasizes honoring senior water rights, but conflicts arise with the broad preemption language in Section 108. The legislation H.R. 1837 aims to protect existing water rights and limit reductions in water supplies, but conflicts arise with the broad preemption language in Section 108. The implementation of such legislation and its compatibility with federal supremacy in Title V are key considerations."
