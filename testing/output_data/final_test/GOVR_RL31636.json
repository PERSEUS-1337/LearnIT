    "content": "Wireless communications devices like mobile phones, PDAs, and pagers are widely used for location-based services, raising concerns about privacy. Users worry about who has access to their location data, how long it's kept, and if it's used for marketing or other purposes without their consent. There are also concerns about receiving unwanted advertising on their devices. The implementation of Enhanced 911 (E911) capabilities allows wireless carriers to provide Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) with the location of wireless callers who dial 911 within a certain range. This raises concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of location information, similar to the debate over Internet privacy and spam. The debate over wireless privacy, similar to Internet privacy and spam, raises concerns about legislation and self-regulation. Laws like the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act, CAN-SPAM Act, and US SAFE WEB Act address some issues, but concerns about identifying wireless customer locations persist. The ability to identify a wireless customer's location raises concerns about erosion of privacy and potential misuse of data for marketing purposes. Wireless carriers may sell customer data to offset costs, impacting users of various wireless devices. There is a fear that if location information is available to commercial entities, customers may be bombarded with unsolicited advertisements. Supporters of unsolicited advertising argue that directed advertisements benefit consumers by offering products of interest and are protected by the First Amendment. Concerns include companies building consumer profiles with collected data and the retention of location information. Some suggest setting limits on how long location data can be kept, such as deleting it after a 911 call or receiving desired information. Wireless spam was addressed by Congress in the CAN-SPAM Act, but not specifically focusing on location aspects. The wireless privacy debate includes concerns about a potential wireless 411 directory that could generate significant revenue for the industry. Some companies delayed offering the service due to regulatory uncertainties, including a new California law requiring separate authorization from subscribers. T-Mobile was the only major carrier still planning to offer directory services on an opt-in basis by April 2005, amidst evolving regulatory climate. Subscribers must pay for incoming calls on wireless phones, leading to concerns about unwanted calls for both nuisance and cost reasons. Consumers can list their cell phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry, but worries persist about unwanted calls from telemarketers. Questions have arisen regarding whether subscribers should be able to decline having their cell phone numbers published in a directory without a fee. Proponents argue for consent to be required, while opponents point out that many subscribers unknowingly give consent through their service provider contracts. Verizon Wireless chose not to participate in the directory, with concerns about privacy and the cost of calls for wireless subscribers. The Consumers Union argues against an \"opt-in\" directory, stating that it lacks control for customers over their information. They established a website to support wireless directory legislation, with hearings held in 2004 by Senate and House committees. CTIA testified that legislation is premature as the directory does not yet exist. The wireless industry has a proven track record in protecting consumer privacy, and subscribers would not be forced to participate in the directory nor charged a fee for opting-out. Mr. Strigl from Verizon Wireless opposes the directory but agrees that legislation is not necessary. Some opponents point to Verizon Wireless's decision not to participate as a market-based solution. Advocates argue that the industry's track record is not perfect. Representative Pitts sponsored a bill in the 108th Congress for a wireless directory. Representative Markey and Senator Boxer expressed concerns about the wireless directory, highlighting issues such as opt-in requirements, privacy implications, and the need for parental control over children's numbers. Witnesses from EPIC and the AARP supported legislation to address these concerns. Legislation has been reintroduced in the 109th Congress to address concerns about the public availability of cell phone records, including detailed call information. Data brokers may sell this information online, raising questions about how they obtain it and whether telecom companies are protecting Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) as required by law. The Communications and Public Safety Act (the \"911 Act\") raises questions about the need for new legislation to criminalize fraudulent acquisition and sale of cell phone records. Privacy rights groups advocate for additional laws, while telecommunications associations have differing views on the matter. The FCC supports potential legislative actions to protect consumers' phone records. The FCC supports potential legislative actions to protect consumers' phone records, including overturning a 1999 court ruling and strengthening enforcement tools. The FTC recommends a multi-faceted approach involving coordinated law enforcement, consumer education, and improved security measures. EPIC filed a complaint with the FTC regarding the sale of cell phone records by Intelligent e-Commerce, Inc. (IEI), alleging violations of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. EPIC filed a complaint with the FTC against Intelligent e-Commerce, Inc. for violating the 1996 Telecommunications Act by obtaining phone records through unfair practices. EPIC later expanded its request to the FTC for an industry-wide investigation. Representative Markey urged the FCC and FTC to stop the sale of cell phone subscribers' records. In response to concerns about the sale of cell phone subscribers' records, FTC Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras and FCC Chairman Kevin Martin acknowledged ongoing investigations into pretexters obtaining consumer data. FCC commissioners Adelstein and Copps supported the investigation, leading to Notices of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture issued to AT&T Wireless and Alltel for failing to protect CPNI. The FCC issued subpoenas to data brokers for details on obtaining telephone records and fined AT&T Wireless and Alltel $100,000 each for failing to protect CPNI. FCC Chairman Martin testified to Congress about inadequate responses from data brokers and referred the matter to the Justice Department for enforcement. Undercover purchases of phone records were made to assist in the investigation. IEI president Noah Webster defended his company's practices regarding cell phone records. Noah Webster defended his company's practices regarding cell phone records, stating that privacy groups are raising concerns now due to their own agendas. He suggested subscribers ask their phone company to remove call details from bills for protection. In January 2006, 40 websites were selling cell phone numbers and calling records, claiming legality as long as financial data wasn't involved. Following an FTC sweep of websites selling cell phone records, about 20 sites discontinued the service. Major wireless providers took legal action against companies fraudulently obtaining or selling customer records. Two telecom associations testified in 2006, with CTIA supporting legislation to criminalize fraud, while USTelecom seeks better enforcement of existing laws. Multiple bills have been introduced in Congress to address the issue. The FCC and FTC are working together on the issue of CPNI protection. FCC Chairman Martin pledged to take strong action against non-compliant companies. EPIC's petition will be addressed by the FCC by February 10, 2006. Congress could potentially make the commercial availability of consumer phone records illegal. The FTC is taking action against pretexters who obtain financial data through pretexting and data brokers who do not safeguard data. A recent settlement with ChoicePoint resulted in $10 million in civil penalties and $5 million in consumer redress. The FTC may bring law enforcement action against pretexters who obtain telephone records. Mr. Leibowitz addressed the issue of obtaining phone records fraudulently, with witnesses supporting legislation to criminalize such actions. Mr. Rotenberg highlighted efforts to raise awareness through filings with the FCC and FTC, emphasizing the need for enhanced security measures by telephone carriers. At a Senate hearing, witnesses advocated for lawsuits against pretexters instead of just enforcement to combat fraudulent phone record access. The Attorney General of Illinois and a U.S. Telecom Association representative also shared their views on existing laws and security measures. Ms. Cindy Southworth from the National Network to End Domestic Violence discussed the dangers of stolen cell phone records. The witness testified about the impact of stolen cell phone records on victims of domestic violence. Concerns include government access to location information and privacy implications. Privacy advocates warn of potential misuse of data, such as tracking individuals without consent. Privacy concerns surrounding stolen cell phone records and government access to location information have raised questions about the need for better privacy safeguards in the wireless industry. The debate over wireless privacy mirrors that of Internet privacy and spam, with discussions on whether wireless carriers should adhere to \"fair information practices\" in handling call location information. The FTC has outlined four key practices for commercial websites to follow in providing notice to users about data collection and use. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of \"fair information practices\" for operators of commercial websites, including providing notice to users, allowing choice in data usage, access to collected data, and ensuring data security. The debate extends to wireless carriers and location-based services, with questions on whether legislation or industry self-regulation is the best approach. \"Choice\" is a key aspect, with options for opt-in or opt-out consent. The wireless privacy debate involves various industry segments such as telecommunications carriers, location-based service providers, and websites accessible on wireless devices. The business potential of wireless devices is highlighted by terms like M-Commerce and L-Commerce. Industry associations like the Mobile Marketing Association have developed codes of conduct, including opt-in and opt-out approaches, to address privacy concerns. TRUSTe, a company offering privacy seals, also plays a role in promoting privacy guidelines for websites. The Mobile Marketing Association released the \"first wireless privacy standards\" in 2004, requiring wireless service providers to notify customers before collecting personally identifiable information, disclose information to third parties only with customer consent, and only use location information with customer consent. The code of conduct aligns with TRUSTe principles. The MMA's code of conduct aligns with TRUSTe principles. Participants in an FTC workshop on wireless Web privacy issues acknowledged that companies collecting data for wireless applications may gather more than necessary, emphasizing the importance of early privacy requirements for future services. CTIA requested FCC rulemaking on wireless location implementation. CTIA requested FCC rulemaking on wireless location implementation, urging adoption of privacy principles for mobile services users to be informed of location information collection and use practices before disclosure. The FCC was asked to adopt technology neutral rules requiring notice, choice, and security measures to protect location information from unauthorized use and disclosure. The FCC declined to commence a rulemaking proceeding on wireless location privacy practices, citing existing legal obligations and consumer protections. They stated they did not want to restrict the market for location-based services and would only consider rulemaking if a clear need was demonstrated. Wireless privacy concerns now include the unauthorized sale of cell phone records, leading to legal actions by major service providers. CTIA supports legislation to address fraudulent acquisition and sale of cell phone records, but existing laws like TCPA, \"911 Act,\" and CAN-SPAM Act partially cover wireless privacy issues. The FTC Act and 1996 Telecommunications Act also have relevant provisions. Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile back Senator Schumer's bill. The 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) prohibits the use of autodialers or prerecorded voice messages to call cellular phones without prior consent. In 2003, the FCC ruled that TCPA applies to any call using an automatic dialing system or recorded message to a wireless phone number, including text messages. FCC has also issued orders since 1996 to ensure users can reach emergency services by dialing 911, known as \"Enhanced 911\" or E911. The FCC rules, known as \"Enhanced 911\" or E911, apply to all cellular and Personal Communications Services (PCS) licensees, and certain Specialized Mobile Radio licensees. This report focuses on the privacy implications of call location information for wireless E911. Concerns include the potential for user location data to be sold to advertising companies. Congress passed the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act in 1999 to address these issues. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act (P.L. 106-81), also known as the 911 Act, amended the Communications Act of 1934 to include \"location\" in the definition of customer proprietary network information (CPNI) held by telecommunications carriers. This Act made 911 the universal emergency assistance number in the United States. The 911 Act amended the Communications Act of 1934 to include \"location\" in the definition of CPNI held by telecommunications carriers. The FCC established rules on how carriers treat CPNI, requiring \"opt-in\" in some cases and allowing \"opt-out\" in others. The 911 Act also amended section 222(d)(4) on authorized uses of CPNI, specifying when wireless carriers need prior consent to use location information. Consent is not needed to provide location information to emergency services. The 911 Act amended the Communications Act of 1934 to include \"location\" in the definition of CPNI held by telecommunications carriers. The Act allows disclosure of location information to emergency services without prior consent. However, express prior authorization is required for any other use or disclosure of call location information or automatic crash notification information. The term \"express prior authorization\" is not clearly defined in the law. H.R. 83 would set requirements for telecommunications carriers to obtain location information, not clearly defined in the law. In 2003, the CAN-SPAM Act was passed, addressing spam but not on wireless devices initially. The bill was amended by the Senate to include provisions on wireless spam before being signed into law by President Bush in December 2003. The CAN-SPAM Act was signed into law by President Bush in December 2003, requiring the FCC to create rules to protect consumers from unwanted mobile service commercial messages. The FCC proposed rules in March 2004, with wireless carriers and the CTIA seeking exemptions from prior authorization for sending commercial messages to customers. The FCC adopted new rules on August 4, 2004, regarding the CAN-SPAM Act, prohibiting sending wireless commercial e-mail messages without prior authorization from the recipient. Most rules went into effect on October 18, 2004. Prior authorization (\"opt-in\") can be given orally or in writing, including electronically. Requests for authorization cannot be sent to a wireless subscriber's device due to potential costs. Authorization does not allow senders to send messages on behalf of third parties. Authorization must include information about potential charges to the recipient and the ability to revoke authorization. The rules do not apply to messages forwarded by a subscriber to their own device. The FCC announced the creation of a publicly available wireless domain names list for mobile service messaging. Commercial messages are prohibited to addresses on the list for at least 30 days. All autodialed calls, including SMS, are covered by the TCPA. Wireless service providers must provide the FCC with the names of all Internet domains offering mobile service messaging services. The FCC interpreted the definition of wireless commercial e-mail messages to include any commercial message sent to an e-mail address provided by a wireless service provider. The FCC did not grant an exemption for wireless service providers to communicate with their own subscribers without prior authorization. The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for determining the criteria for \"commercial\" and \"transactional or relationship\" messages. The CAN-SPAM Act covers transactional and relationship messages between providers and subscribers, aiming to protect consumers from unwanted commercial messages. The U.S. SAFE WEB Act focuses on traditional and wireless spam, allowing the FTC and foreign agencies to share information on unfair practices involving foreign commerce. The 110th Congress may consider additional legislation like the Wireless Privacy Protection Act. The Wireless Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 83) requires customer consent for sharing wireless call location and crash information. S. 2130 (Schumer) expands the definition of \"contents\" and \"tracking device\" in wire communications. H.R. 1139 (Pitts) is the Wireless 411 Privacy Act. The Wireless 411 Privacy Act (H.R. 1139) allows wireless subscribers to keep their numbers unlisted in a directory assistance database for free. Mobile service providers must obtain explicit consent from current subscribers to include their numbers in the database. New subscribers must be informed of their right not to be listed and provided with a way to opt out. The Wireless 411 Privacy Act (H.R. 1139) allows wireless subscribers to keep their numbers unlisted in a directory assistance database for free. Call forwarding from a directory assistance operator to a subscriber would be permitted only with subscriber consent, and their phone number may not be disclosed to the calling party. Commercial mobile service providers are prohibited from publishing wireless directory assistance database contents. No fees may be charged for keeping phone numbers private. S. 1350, similar to H.R. 1139, requires opt-in consent from all subscribers and allows publication of wireless 411 directory with consent. It also mandates mobile service providers to remove numbers from 411 directory at no cost to subscribers. S. 1350 would preempt state and local laws inconsistent with its requirements, prohibit including wireless numbers in directories without consent, and require cost-free delisting for subscribers. S. 2177 (Durbin) and S. 2178 (Schumer) are bills aimed at protecting phone records from sale or fraudulent use. They cover various telecommunications services and impose criminal penalties for unauthorized access to confidential phone records. Exceptions are made for law enforcement agencies. The bill prohibits unauthorized access to phone records and imposes penalties for selling them without customer authorization. Violators could face fines, imprisonment, or both, with exceptions for law enforcement agencies. The bill S. 2264 (Pryor), known as the Consumer Phone Record Security Act, aims to prevent unauthorized access to phone records. It prohibits obtaining or selling CPNI without authorization, with penalties including fines and imprisonment for up to 10 years. Enforcement of the bill's requirements would be assigned accordingly. The bill S. 2389, Protecting Consumer Phone Records Act, aims to protect CPNI by making it unlawful to acquire, use, or sell CPNI without consent. Enforcement would be handled by the FTC, FCC, and states, with individuals able to seek civil relief against violators. Telecommunications carriers would be required to implement measures to safeguard CPNI. The bill S. 2389, Protecting Consumer Phone Records Act, aims to protect CPNI by making it unlawful to acquire, use, or sell CPNI without consent. The bill provides exceptions and enforces civil and criminal penalties for violations. It requires enforcement by the FTC, FCC, and states, preempts contrary state law, and mandates a public awareness campaign about protecting CPNI. H.R. 4657, the Secure Telephone Operations Act, criminalizes the sale of CPNI with fines or imprisonment for violators. H.R. 4662 (Blackburn) is a bill referred to the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security. It aims to make it unlawful to obtain CPNI through false statements or providing forged information to a telecommunications carrier. It also prohibits requesting or selling CPNI obtained through fraudulent means. Exceptions are provided. H.R. 4678 (Schakowsky) and H.R. 4709 (L. Smith) are bills related to telecommunications privacy. H.R. 4678 does not set criminal penalties and would be enforced by the FTC, while H.R. 4709 focuses on law enforcement and phone privacy protection. Both bills were referred to different House committees for further consideration. H.R. 4709 (L. Smith) aims to protect phone privacy by criminalizing the unauthorized access of confidential phone records information from telecommunications carriers without customer authorization. The bill defines covered entities as telecommunications carriers and providers of IP-enabled services. The Phone Records Protection Act, H.R. 4714, identical to S. 2177, was presented to the President on December 22, 2006. It aims to protect phone privacy by criminalizing unauthorized access to confidential phone records from telecommunications carriers."
