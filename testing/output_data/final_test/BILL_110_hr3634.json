    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Strategic Technology/Engineering Program Act of 2007\" or the \"STEP Act\". Congress finds that the number of engineering degrees awarded annually has been declining since 1985, with a peak of 77,572 bachelor's degrees in 1985 decreasing to approximately 60,000 in 2002. Additionally, the unemployment rate for science and engineering jobs has consistently been at least 2 percent lower than the national average for all fields of employment. In 2004, there were 1,400,000 engineering jobs in the United States, and it is projected that 611,000 new engineering jobs will open up from 2004 to 2014. The United States is facing a shortage of engineers due to a decline in engineering graduates, many engineers nearing retirement, and new graduates opting for other fields. To address this, the US should recruit top high school graduates for engineering degrees and develop education standards that meet engineering needs. Providing scholarships and loan forgiveness for engineering graduates can help alleviate the financial burden of the years of study required for engineering jobs. This will make it easier for graduates to enter and stay in the engineering profession, which is crucial for the United States. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new part called the Strategic Technology and Engineering Program (STEP), which aims to support engineering graduates through scholarships and loan forgiveness to ease the financial burden of their studies. This program is crucial for ensuring a strong engineering workforce in the United States. The Secretary is authorized to establish a STEP scholarship program for individuals pursuing degrees in engineering, technology, applied sciences, mathematics, or similar fields. Recipients are known as 'STEP Scholars' and can receive up to $9,000 per academic year for undergraduates and $36,000 in total, and varying amounts for graduate students. The STEP scholarship program offers up to $15,000 per academic year for graduate students, with a maximum aggregate amount of $45,000. The total scholarship awarded cannot exceed the individual's total cost of attendance. If funds are insufficient, scholarships will be reduced proportionately. The STEP scholarships are awarded for one academic year and can be renewed for subsequent years during undergraduate and graduate studies. These scholarships are not considered for Federal grant assistance under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Eligibility for a STEP scholarship requires meeting certain criteria. To be eligible for a STEP scholarship, an individual must be a U.S. citizen, national, or permanent resident, meet certain student criteria, and be enrolled in a program leading to a bachelor's or graduate degree in engineering, technology, applied sciences, mathematics, or similar fields at an institution of higher education. They must also be enrolled in at least 15 credit hours per semester. To be eligible for a STEP scholarship, an individual must have a grade point average of at least 2.5 and be enrolled in a program leading to a degree in engineering, technology, applied sciences, mathematics, or similar fields. To be eligible for a STEP scholarship, individuals must have a GPA of 2.5 or higher and be enrolled in a program in engineering, technology, applied sciences, mathematics, or related fields. Applicants must submit an application to the Secretary for consideration, with scholarships awarded on a first-come, first-served basis depending on availability of funds. Priority is given to eligible individuals who have previously received a STEP scholarship. Eligible individuals who received a STEP scholarship must obtain a degree in specified fields within a prescribed period. Failure to do so will result in the scholarship amount being converted into a Direct Loan under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Higher Education Act of 1965 specifies repayment terms for scholarship awards, with forgiveness available in cases of death, permanent disability, or if repayment would be inequitable. The Secretary is authorized to create necessary regulations for implementation. The section defines pursuing or obtaining a degree in engineering, technology, applied sciences, mathematics, or similar fields, including specific engineering designations. The section outlines the requirements for obtaining a degree in engineering, technology, applied sciences, mathematics, or similar fields from an accredited institution of higher education. The terms \"institution of higher education\" and \"Secretary\" are also defined within the context. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Education. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal year 2008 and each succeeding fiscal year. SEC. 4. STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR ENGINEERS. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section for loan forgiveness specifically for engineers. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section for loan forgiveness for engineers who meet specific criteria, such as being employed as an engineer and not being in default on their loans. The Secretary is authorized to forgive student loan debt for eligible borrowers. The Secretary can forgive up to $150,000 of a borrower's loan obligation in increments over 8 years of engineering employment. Loan forgiveness is also available for obtaining licensure as a professional engineer. The borrower can receive loan forgiveness of up to $150,000 over 8 years for engineering employment. To qualify, they must enter a written agreement to work as an engineer for at least 8 years, obtain professional engineering licensure within 8 years of degree completion, and repay the Secretary. The borrower must repay a proportionate amount of benefits received if they fail to complete 8 years of engineering employment due to misconduct or voluntary separation, or fail to obtain professional engineering licensure. The borrower must repay the Secretary if they fail to repay, with recovery by the Government. The Secretary may waive recovery if against equity or public interest. Loan forgiveness is provided subject to appropriations. Repayment is required for violation of the agreement. The borrower must repay the Secretary if they fail to repay, with recovery by the Government. Loan forgiveness is provided on a first-come, first-served basis subject to appropriations and priority is given to borrowers who received forgiveness benefits in the previous fiscal year. Repaid amounts are credited back to the original appropriation account for the same purposes and limitations. The Secretary can issue regulations for loan forgiveness benefits under this section. The term 'engineer' is defined as an individual qualified in various engineering designations. Authorization of appropriations for engineers including mining, geological, nuclear, and petroleum engineers for fiscal year 2008 and beyond."
