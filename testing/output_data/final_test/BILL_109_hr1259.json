Black military pilots, known as the Tuskegee Airmen, were trained separately due to racial segregation during World War II. The Tuskegee Airmen, Black military pilots trained separately during World War II, overcame prejudice and discrimination to excel in combat. Around 992 Black pilots graduated from the Tuskegee Army Air Field training program, with 450 serving in combat by June 1946. The first class of cadets at Tuskegee in July 1941 included 13 airmen with college degrees, some with Ph.D.s, and pilot's licenses. Captain Benjamin O. Davis Jr. was a graduate, and 4 cadets became second lieutenants while 5 received pilot wings. The success of the program is shown by the promotion of 3 pioneers to flag rank, including General Benjamin O. Davis Jr., General Daniel \"Chappie\" James, and Major General Lucius Theus. During World War II, 450 Black fighter pilots led by Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. flew numerous missions in North Africa, Sicily, and Europe. Colonel Davis later became the first Black flag officer in the US Air Force and was honored with a 4th star in retirement by President Clinton. The Tuskegee Airmen were respected by German pilots and American bomber crews, who called them the \"Schwartze Vogelmenschen\" and the \"Black Redtail Angels\" respectively. The 99th Fighter Squadron, along with 3 other Black squadrons, formed the 332nd Fighter Group and became the largest fighter unit in the 15th Air Force during World War II. They conducted successful missions in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, destroying enemy targets on the ground and in the air. Despite their achievements, 66 pilots were killed in combat and 32 were captured as prisoners of war. The Black airmen of the 332nd Fighter Group, including pilots, navigators, bombardiers, and crewmen, received numerous awards for their wartime achievements. Their demands for equal treatment and recognition as skilled military professionals led to a review of racial policies within the Department of War. In September 1947, the United States Air Force reactivated the 332nd Fighter Group as a separate service. The 332d Fighter Group, known as the \"Top Guns,\" excelled in the Air Force Gunnery Meet in 1949. Black pilots were supported by civilian and military personnel, leading to integration efforts in the Armed Forces. After World War II, many Tuskegee Airmen achieved success in various fields. The Tuskegee Airmen gained recognition in 1972 with the establishment of Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., based in Detroit, Michigan, is a non-military and nonprofit organization that aims to inspire young Americans to participate in society and preserve their legacy. They have memorials such as a National Scholarship Fund, a museum in Detroit, a Memorial Park in Ohio, and a statue at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado and a National Historic Site at Moton Field, where primary flight training was conducted under contract with the Tuskegee Institute.
