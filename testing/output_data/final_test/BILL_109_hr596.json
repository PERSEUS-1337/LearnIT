    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2005\". The findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that cord blood, obtained from the placenta and umbilical cord, can be used for clinical applications such as bone marrow reconstitution for certain diseases. This cord blood is typically discarded after childbirth but can be collected as donor tissue without risk. Cord blood stem cells can be collected without risk to the donor, preserved for many years, and used for transplantation in various diseases. Advantages include reduced transplant complications, immediate availability, and the opportunity for all patients, regardless of ethnic background, to receive a transplant. An ethnically diverse inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units can provide matches for 80 to 90 percent of patients needing transplants. Sickle cell anemia, more common in African-Americans, poses severe health risks from infancy, with a median lifespan of 42 years. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has successfully cured patients with sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, especially beneficial for African-American and other ethnic minority patients. Early transplants yield better outcomes, and an ethnically diverse national cord blood stem cell network of 150,000 units could provide matches for 80 to 90 percent of patients needing transplants. Cord blood is an alternative to bone marrow for stem cell transplantation, with unique collection and storage requirements. Frozen cord blood units can be a vital resource for treating bone marrow failure caused by radiation exposure. Survivors of radiation exposure may face an increased risk of leukemia or lymphoma. Recent scientific developments suggest that research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, potentially improving therapies and finding cures. These diseases contribute significantly to chronic disabilities and healthcare costs in the United States. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include definitions related to cord blood units, donors, donor banks, and human cord blood stem cells. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, consisting of qualified cord blood stem cell banks with at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells. The purpose of the donor banks is to acquire, tissue-type, test, and cryopreserve cord blood stem cells. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network aims to acquire, store, and distribute donated units of human cord blood for stem cell transplantation and research purposes. Donor banks must comply with regulations, make units available for transplantation, and allocate a portion for research each year. Eligible banks must have necessary licenses and registrations. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network requires banks to have necessary licenses, registrations, and authorizations from the FDA. They must implement donor screening and collection practices to protect donors and recipients. Strict confidentiality measures must be in place to protect patient and donor identities in accordance with federal and state laws. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network requires banks to have necessary licenses, registrations, and authorizations from the FDA. They must implement donor screening and collection practices to protect donors and recipients. Strict confidentiality measures must be in place to protect patient and donor identities in accordance with federal and state laws. Additionally, banks must establish systems for encouraging donation by a diverse group of donors, communicate effectively with other cord blood stem cell banks and healthcare providers, and educate the public about cord blood donation. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is administered by a Board of Directors appointed by the Secretary, who establish a national cord blood stem cell registry and coordinate donor banks within the Network. The Board of Directors appointed by the Secretary for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes representatives from various stakeholders such as transplant centers, birthing hospitals, research community, transplant recipients, family members, social sciences experts, and the general public. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes representatives from various stakeholders, including transplant centers, birthing hospitals, research community, transplant recipients, family members, social sciences experts, and the general public. Members may serve up to 2 consecutive 3-year terms, with exceptions for nonvoting members from the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and network donor banks. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is appointed so that approximately 1/3 of the members' terms expire each year. Members can continue to serve after their term until a successor is appointed. The Secretary will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry as part of the Network to identify, acquire, and distribute donated cord blood units matched to patients. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network will provide a website for transplant physicians to search for donor matches and request cord blood units. They will also maintain a database to track the collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation outcomes while adhering to standards of consent and confidentiality. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network will report to the Secretary on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of activities. The Board of Directors will ensure donor banks meet requirements continuously. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network and birthing hospital collection sites should be distributed throughout the United States. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, and additional funds for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 or until 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
