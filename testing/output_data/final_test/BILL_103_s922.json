    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act.\" It includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that there is a growing number of child support cases annually involving disputes between parents residing in different states, due to non-uniform laws determining jurisdiction for child support orders. This results in noncustodial parents relocating to avoid certain state courts, increasing interstate travel and communication burdens on custodial parents. The current child support system creates financial burdens for custodial parents, leads to low payment levels in interstate cases, encourages noncompliance with court orders, allows noncustodial parents to avoid payments, and results in extensive litigation and conflicting court orders. The establishment of conflicting orders by courts in different jurisdictions leads to confusion, waste of resources, disrespect for the courts, and a decrease in public confidence in the rule of law. This results in failure to give full faith and credit to judicial proceedings of other states, deprivation of rights without due process, burdens on interstate commerce, and harm to children and their parents. National standards are needed for state courts to address these issues. The Act aims to streamline the enforcement of child support orders across states, reduce interstate disputes, and prevent jurisdictional conflicts among state courts. SEC. 3. Full faith and credit for child support orders. Amends Chapter 115 of title 28, United States Code by adding a new section, Sec. 1738B, to ensure enforcement of child support orders across states and prevent jurisdictional conflicts among state courts.
