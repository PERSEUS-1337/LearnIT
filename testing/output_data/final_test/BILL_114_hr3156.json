The Board includes representatives from various agencies and makes recommendations to the Chief Judge for consideration. In making its recommendation, the Review Board considers all evidence and testimony presented in the petition, does not consider arrests or prosecutions without convictions, and balances public safety and the petitioner's interest in having the petition granted. The Court considers petitions for expungement based on the Review Board's recommendation, giving significant weight to it. The Court will grant the petition unless the Government can show that its interests outweigh the petitioner's. A youth can only file one petition for expungement, and the decision of the district court is final and not appealable. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will provide online and paper forms for petitions, including a waiver process for indigent petitioners.

Failure to acknowledge the record or respond to inquiries will not result in prosecution for perjury or making false statements. If an individual with an expunged record brings a civil action, there is a presumption that the defendant has a complete defense. The plaintiff can rebut this by showing the record would not prevent liability. The court may require the plaintiff to testify about the record's existence and whether it was expunged or sealed. The defendant can prove the existence of a record if the plaintiff denies it in a legal action. The Attorney General must maintain a nonpublic database of expunged or sealed records and can only disclose them for specific purposes like defense in a civil suit or background checks. Sec. 3633.
