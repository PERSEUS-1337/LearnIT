    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dignity for Military Funerals Act of 2006\". Congress acknowledges its constitutional power to provide for the common defense, raise armies, and maintain a navy. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad authority in this regard. It recognizes the importance of supporting soldiers, sailors, and marines, as well as their families, even after their passing, due to the sacrifices they make to protect the nation's freedom. The text acknowledges the sacrifices made by members of the armed forces to protect the nation's freedom. It emphasizes the tragic loss of every soldier and the gratitude Americans have for their courage. The importance of allowing families to privately mourn deceased relatives without disruption is also recognized. Picketing at funerals causes emotional distress to grieving families. Freedom of speech is allowed at other times, not within 1 hour before or after a military funeral. The text chunk discusses the definitions related to a specific topic. The Act defines terms related to ceremonies for members of the armed forces, including \"armed forces,\" \"funeral of a member or former member of the armed forces,\" \"picketing,\" and \"protest activities.\" The Act prohibits the display of placards, banners, posters, flags, or similar devices, as well as the distribution of any written material that is not part of the funeral or ceremony. Prohibition on picketing at funerals of military personnel. No State or local government can permit picketing at military funerals. Picketing at the funeral of a member or former member of the armed forces is prohibited by law, with violators facing fines, imprisonment, or both. The term 'funeral of a member or former member of the armed forces' refers to any ceremony, procession, or memorial service related to the burial or cremation of a military member. Picketing is defined as protest activities within 300 feet of a cemetery, mortuary, or church during the period surrounding a military funeral. Protest activities during a funeral include speeches or displays of signs not part of the official ceremony. The amendment prohibits the display of non-related placards, banners, posters, flags, or similar devices, as well as the distribution of any handbill, pamphlet, leaflet, or written material that is not part of the funeral or ceremony. The amendment prohibits picketing at military funerals. It does not preempt state or local laws providing greater protection to funeral attendees. If any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
