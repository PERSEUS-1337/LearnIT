    "content": "The Act titled \"Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act of 2009\" provides eligibility criteria for relief. Section 109 of title 11, United States Code, is amended to exclude certain debts secured by the debtor's principal residence or real property surrendered in foreclosure from the computation of debts. This amendment does not apply to debtors in chapter 13 bankruptcy who meet specific requirements. Chapter 13 debtors can avoid including certain debts secured by their principal residence in their total debts if they provide certification of foreclosure notice. Section 502(b) of title 11, United States Code is amended to prohibit claims arising from violations of the Truth in Lending Act. This includes allowing a remedy for rescission under the Truth in Lending Act for a loan secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence, even after a foreclosure judgment. Additionally, there is authority granted to modify certain mortgages. Section 1322 of title 11, United States Code is amended to allow modification of rights for claims secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence, even after a foreclosure notice has been issued. The amendment to Section 1322 of title 11, United States Code allows for modification of rights for claims secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence, including adjusting interest rates and extending repayment periods up to 40 years. The amendment to Section 1322 of title 11, United States Code allows for modification of rights for claims secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence, including adjusting interest rates and extending repayment periods up to 40 years. This includes providing for the payment of interest accruing after the date of the order for relief under this chapter at a fixed annual rate equal to the currently applicable average prime offer rate as of the date of the order for relief under this chapter. The amendment to Section 1322 of title 11, United States Code allows for modification of rights for claims secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence. This includes adjusting interest rates, extending repayment periods, and providing for direct payments to the claim holder. If the debtor sells the residence before receiving a discharge, they agree to pay 80 percent of the difference between the sales price and the claim amount. If the debtor sells their residence within the 2nd or 3rd year after the plan's effective date, they must pay a percentage of the difference between the sales price and the claim amount, not exceeding the allowed secured claim. The plan may not modify a claim under subsection (b)(11) in a case filed after a 15-day period from the effective date, unless the debtor certifies attempts made at least 15 days prior. The debtor must attempt to contact the holder of a claim regarding loan modification before filing a plan under section 1321 in a case pending under this chapter. If a foreclosure sale is scheduled within 30 days of the case commencement, the debtor must also attempt to contact the claim holder. The debtor must contact the claim holder before filing a plan under section 1321. If a foreclosure sale is imminent, contact must be made within 30 days of the case commencement. The modification under subsection (b)(11) can be included in a plan under section 1323 or 1329. SEC. 5. COMBATING EXCESSIVE FEES. Section 1322(c) of title 11, United States Code, is amended to state that the debtor, their property, and property of the estate are not liable for fees or charges incurred during the case related to a debt secured by the debtor's principal residence, unless the claim holder files notice with the court. The debtor, their property, and property of the estate are not liable for fees or charges related to a debt secured by the debtor's principal residence unless the claim holder files notice with the court. Failure to give notice waives any claim for fees, costs, or charges. A plan may waive prepayment penalty on a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence. SEC. 6. CONFIRMATION OF PLAN. Section 1325(a) of title 11, United States Code is amended to include provisions regarding the modification of claims in a bankruptcy plan, ensuring that the holder of the claim retains the lien until the payment of the secured claim or discharge under section 1328. The court must find that the modification is in good faith and that the debtor did not obtain additional credit. The amendment to Section 1325(a) of title 11, United States Code allows for the modification of claims in a bankruptcy plan if the debtor obtained credit through misrepresentation, false pretenses, or fraud. SEC. 7. DISCHARGE. Amendment to Section 1328 of title 11, United States Code regarding payments to holders of modified claims under section 1322(b)(11) and unpaid secured claims. SEC. 8. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 8. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act and its amendments do not change obligations of certain agencies under loan contracts for principal residences.
