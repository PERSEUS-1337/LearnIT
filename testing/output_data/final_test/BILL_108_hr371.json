The Congress finds that in the United States, 25 million people are affected by liver diseases, costing over $5.5 billion annually for medical care. There are 4 million people with hepatitis C, with limited effective treatments and no vaccine available. Hepatitis C causes 8,000 to 10,000 deaths yearly, projected to increase to 30,000 without interventions. Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C is linked to an increased risk of primary liver cancer in the United States. There are 1,250,000 people in the US with hepatitis B, and up to 15% of Asian and Pacific-Islander Americans are chronically infected. Primary biliary cirrhosis affects 15 out of every 100,000 people, with 95% being women. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease may impact 1 in 4 adults over 18. There are 15,000 children hospitalized in the US each year due to liver disease, with over 17,500 people on the waiting list for a liver transplant. Approximately 5,100 transplants are performed annually, but 1,300 people die waiting for a transplant. Establishing a National Center on Liver Disease Research is needed to address this public health threat. To ensure funding for scientific opportunities identified in a research action plan. The National Center on Liver Disease Research is established under the Public Health Service Act to focus on research related to liver diseases. The National Center on Liver Disease Research, established under the Public Health Service Act, is headed by a Director appointed based on scientific credentials. The Director's duties include assisting in developing a Liver Disease Research Action Plan and coordinating its implementation. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board, established by the Director of NIH, advises on liver disease research matters and assists in developing the Liver Disease Research Action Plan. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board, established by the Director of NIH, consists of 18 voting members appointed by the Director, including 12 eminent scientists and 6 lay persons. The Chair is selected by the Director. Ex officio members include directors of national research institutes funding liver disease research, as well as representatives from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board, established by the Director of NIH, consists of 18 voting members appointed by the Director, including scientists and lay persons. Ex officio members include directors of national research institutes funding liver disease research, as well as representatives from other government agencies. The Advisory Board is tasked with developing a Liver Disease Research Action Plan within 15 months to guide liver disease research efforts. The Liver Disease Research Action Plan outlines scientific priorities for liver disease research to enhance understanding, prevention, and treatment protocols. The Advisory Board revises the plan every 3 years and meets annually to review progress and make amendments based on new discoveries. Funding for liver disease research is allocated by NIH institutes through peer-reviewed methods, contingent on available appropriations. The Liver Disease Research Action Plan outlines scientific priorities for research to enhance understanding, prevention, and treatment protocols, with funding allocated by NIH institutes through peer-reviewed methods."
