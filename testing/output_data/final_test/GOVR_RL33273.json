    "content": "In the 109th Congress, concerns about identity theft led to assessments of data security practices and work on legislation requiring companies to protect personal data and notify consumers of breaches. The Federal Trade Commission reported identity theft as the top consumer complaint nationwide, with victims experiencing credit card misuse and fraudulent account openings. The 110th Congress faced uncertainty with conflicting data security bills pending. The 110th Congress is grappling with establishing a legal framework to prevent and respond to data breaches, with conflicting bills pending and little consensus. Key themes in the legislation include coverage scope, information security safeguards, breach notification requirements, customer access to records, restrictions on social security numbers, and identity theft penalties. Congress continues to work on notifying the public about security breaches. The 110th Congress is working on establishing a legal framework for data breaches, with conflicting bills pending. High-tech companies formed the Consumer Privacy Legislative Forum to promote a comprehensive data privacy bill. California was the first to enact a data breach notification law in 2002, leading to federal and state bills imposing notification requirements on entities collecting sensitive personal information. California's Security Breach Notification Act (S.B. 1386) mandates disclosure of security breaches involving personal information to affected residents. Personal information includes names with Social Security Numbers, driver's license numbers, credit card details, or financial account numbers with sensitive data. California's Security Breach Notification Act requires disclosure of breaches involving personal information like financial account numbers. Exemptions exist for encrypted data and certain breaches. Notification must be prompt, either in writing or by email. If costs exceed $250,000 or more than 500,000 people are affected, media notification is allowed. Many states enacted similar laws due to the absence of a federal data breach notification law. Many states have enacted laws requiring consumer notice of security breaches of personal data, with a focus on notification and redress for affected individuals. These laws also often require the implementation of information security programs to protect data integrity. Many state laws require notifying individuals and government agencies of data breaches, with obligations on third-party service providers. These laws typically focus on electronic data, detailing triggering events, harm levels, recipients, timing, methods, and content of notifications. Some laws exempt entities regulated under federal privacy laws and may include expanded definitions of personal information, notice requirements to consumer reporting agencies, and civil penalties for delayed notifications. The 110th Congress proposed various legislative approaches to address security breaches, including civil penalties for failure to notify customers promptly, requirements for information security programs, private right of action for damages, credit freeze rights, restrictions on social security numbers, and enhanced penalties for identity fraud. The focus is on data privacy, security safeguards, breach notification requirements, social security number restrictions, and credit freezes. Several bills in the 110th Congress addressed security breaches, focusing on social security numbers, credit freezes, identity theft penalties, causes of action, and preemption of state laws. Proposed amendments included notifying customers of breaches, prescribing data security standards, and prohibiting unauthorized computer access and identity theft. Amendments to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act were also recommended. Some federal bills in the 110th Congress addressed security breaches and identity theft issues, recommending amendments to sentencing guidelines and regulations for data brokers selling personal information. These bills varied in scope, covering entities that own electronic personal data and organizations using sensitive personal information. Some federal bills in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate the sharing of personal information among agencies, businesses, and organizations. The bills defined protected information and imposed limitations on the sale or transfer of sensitive personal information. Covered entities were required to protect against security breaches and unauthorized access to personal information. Some federal bills in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate the sharing of sensitive personal information, including data security safeguards, regulations for information brokers, mandatory security requirements, technical safeguards, and development of security policies. Regulations also included requirements for financial institutions to dispose of sensitive personal financial information and the creation of an Online Information Security Working Group. Fair information practices were also a theme in some bills. Some bills in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate the sharing of personal information, including fair information practices similar to the Privacy Act and HIPAA. These practices include notice of information practices, informed consent, access to personal information, security protection, and enforcement mechanisms. The federal bills in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate the collection of consumer information and establish enforcement mechanisms for compliance. They incorporated fair information practices, breach notification requirements, and specified triggers for consumer notice. Provisions included individual access to information, disclosure accounting, and notification timeliness. Exceptions to notification requirements were sometimes permitted. Some bills in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate consumer information collection and enforcement mechanisms. Exceptions to notification requirements were allowed for national security and law enforcement purposes, with notice to Congress. Law enforcement exceptions were for gathering additional information during investigations. Some bills required notice to individuals for identity theft risks or consumer harm. Amendments to Gramm-Leach-Bliley mandated financial institutions to notify consumers, reporting agencies, FTC, and law enforcement of breaches. Personal information holders for financial institutions had to notify them of breaches. Some proposals in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate consumer information collection and enforcement mechanisms. Covered entities were required to report breaches to the FTC or other regulators and notify consumer reporting agencies if sensitive personal information of 1,000 or more individuals was affected. Congress also considered limiting the use of social security numbers, including proposals to remove them from Medicare cards and restrict their use in the private sector. Thirty-eight states have credit freeze laws, allowing consumers to place freezes on their credit. Some bills in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate consumer information collection and enforcement mechanisms. They included provisions for placing credit or security freezes on credit reports in response to security breaches. Security freeze laws give consumers control over access to their credit information, but critics argue they may cause delays when providing access to credit histories. Some bills in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate consumer information collection and enforcement mechanisms, including providing access to credit histories for third-party institutions. The bills also established an Office of Identity Theft in the FTC for civil enforcement actions related to unauthorized acquisition or use of personal information. Enforcement could be carried out by state attorneys general, treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts. Some bills in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate consumer information collection and enforcement mechanisms. State attorneys general could bring civil actions for violations deemed unfair or deceptive under the FTC Act. The legislation also included provisions for private right of action, safe harbor for compliant financial institutions, joint regulation promulgation, and studies on securing personal information and evaluating contractor programs. In bills from the 110th Congress, regulations were proposed for data brokers with contract awards over $500,000. The Secret Service would report security breaches to Congress. Federal legislation addressed the relationship between federal and state data security laws, with varying approaches. Some bills would not preempt laws like the Fair Credit Reporting Act or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, while others would make amendments to prevent state laws on consumer information protection. Some bills in the 110th Congress proposed regulations for data brokers with contract awards over $500,000 and required the Secret Service to report security breaches to Congress. Federal legislation addressed the relationship between federal and state data security laws, with varying approaches such as preempting state laws on notification of data breaches, information security programs, individual access to electronic records, and compliance with safeguards. Some bills in the 110th Congress proposed regulations for data brokers with contract awards over $500,000 and required the Secret Service to report security breaches to Congress. Federal legislation addressed the relationship between federal and state data security laws, with varying approaches such as preempting state laws on notification of data breaches, information security programs, individual access to electronic records, and compliance with safeguards. Compliance concerns have been raised with the prospect that multiple laws requiring potentially different notification requirements will make compliance an overly complex and expensive task. Business groups and privacy advocates differ in their views of whether a federal data security law should allow stronger state laws. Industry groups and affected companies advocate a narrow notification standard that would preempt differing state laws. Privacy advocates seek a uniform national notification standard without preempting stronger state laws. The question of over-notification has been raised by industry participants. Business groups in the 110th Congress raised concerns about over-notification under the California breach notification law. They debated whether breach notification should be limited to significant breaches and supported a federal floor for notification requirements. The majority of state attorneys general favored a federal floor approach, but business interests preferred clear federal preemption of state laws to avoid compliance complexities. During the First Session of the 110th Congress, several bills were introduced to combat identity theft and protect personal information. Three data security bills were reported favorably out of Senate committees, including bills to require disclosure of data breaches, prevent identity theft, and strengthen data protection measures.
