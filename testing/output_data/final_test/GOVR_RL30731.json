Over 1 million AIDS cases have been reported in the US since 1981. In 2006, 448,871 people were living with AIDS, and 233,079 were HIV-infected. Federal government AIDS spending was $23.3 billion in FY2008. In FY2008, federal government spending on HIV/AIDS was $23.3 billion, with the Bush Administration requesting $24.1 billion for FY2009. Majority of the funding (63%) is allocated to treatment programs, while research receives 13%. Prevention programs receive 14% of the total funding, and income support for persons with AIDS receives 10%. HHS accounts for 66% of the total spending on AIDS, with entitlement funding supporting treatment through Medicaid and Medicare. Discretionary funding supports research, prevention, and treatment programs. Funding for HIV/AIDS programs within HHS has increased significantly over the past 15 years, with most of the rise attributed to increased spending on Medicaid, Medicare, and treatment programs. However, the increase in HIV/AIDS research and prevention programs has been less pronounced, with their portion of the total amount spent declining over the years. In FY1992, research and prevention programs accounted for 51% of total spending, but by FY2008, they only made up about 27%. In FY2008, HHS allocated 90% of discretionary funding for HIV/AIDS to NIH, CDC, and HRSA. NIH focuses on research, CDC on prevention programs, and HRSA on the Ryan White program for treatment. Total federal spending on HIV/AIDS has shifted towards treatment services under Medicaid and Medicare. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the main federal agency responsible for biomedical and behavioral research. NIH conducts research at its own institutes and centers, supporting over 200,000 scientists at 3,100 U.S. institutions. Funding for AIDS research in FY2008 was $2.913 billion, with the Administration's request for FY2009 being the same amount. Funding is distributed among NIH institutes based on scientific priorities outlined in the annual comprehensive plan for AIDS research. The Office of AIDS Research (OAR) was established in 1993 with enhanced authority and responsibility, receiving appropriations from Congress in FY1995. The Office of AIDS Research (OAR) was established in 1993 with funding from Congress in FY1995. However, since FY1996, direct appropriations for OAR have not been provided by Congress. Funding for AIDS research at NIH in FY2008 is included within the appropriation for each Institute/Center/Division, with decisions on specific projects and funding levels left to the Directors of NIH and OAR. CDC collaborates with various public health agencies to prevent HIV infection and reduce AIDS-related morbidity and mortality through education programs, research, surveillance, and epidemiology studies. CDC distributes HIV funds to state and local agencies through cooperative agreements, grants, and contracts. CDC funding for HIV/AIDS activities in FY2008 was $872 million, with a request of $871 million for FY2009. The Ryan White program, administered by HRSA, serves 531,000 people annually with a funding of $2.170 billion in FY2008 and a request of $2.171 billion for FY2009. Medicaid is a federal-state program providing medical assistance for low-income individuals. It covers prescription drugs for persons with HIV/AIDS. Each state administers its own Medicaid program with variations in coverage and benefits. Medicaid funding for AIDS treatment varies among states, with federal share ranging from 50% to 80%. In FY2008, federal spending on AIDS treatment is estimated at $4.1 billion, increasing to $4.4 billion in FY2009. Analysts have adjusted estimates due to factors like Medicare Part D coverage and lower healthcare costs. In FY2008, federal spending on AIDS treatment was estimated at $4.1 billion, increasing to $4.4 billion in FY2009. A study found that Medicare drug benefit shifted prescription drug spending from Medicaid to Medicare, but spending on antiretroviral medications for HIV/AIDS patients decreased by a smaller percentage. People with HIV/AIDS still heavily rely on Medicaid for healthcare as most do not qualify for Medicare. To qualify for Medicare coverage, a person must be age 65 or older, disabled, or have end-stage renal disease (ESRD). About 80% of beneficiaries with HIV/AIDS qualify due to a disability, while the rest qualify based on age or ESRD. Elderly individuals qualify at 65, those with ESRD within three months of diagnosis, and disabled individuals, including those with AIDS, must wait 29 months after being determined disabled. Improved drug therapies have increased the life expectancy of individuals with HIV, allowing more to qualify for Medicare. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 provided for the implementation of Medicare Part D, effective January 1, 2006. CMS analysts adjusted their estimate of Medicare spending on AIDS treatment based on factors like Medicare Part D coverage and lowered healthcare costs. Funding for HIV/AIDS care under Medicare is estimated at $4.5 billion for FY2008 and $4.8 billion for FY2009. In 1998, the White House announced initiatives targeting funds for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in minority communities. The Congressional Black Caucus collaborated with the Clinton administration on these efforts. In 1998, initiatives were announced to target funds for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in minority communities. The Congressional Black Caucus collaborated with the Clinton administration on this approach. Funding for these activities totaled $403 million for FY2008 and a requested $387 million for FY2009. President Bush also announced a five-year $15 billion program in 2003, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), targeting countries with high HIV prevalence. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria was established in 2002 to provide treatment and care for HIV-infected individuals and AIDS orphans. The US government supports the fund through USAID and HHS, with federal spending on international HIV/AIDS programs totaling $5.8 billion in FY2008. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) prepared a table showing HHS discretionary funding for HIV/AIDS by agency in FY2009 based on the Administration's budget request. The table includes funding for FDA, HRSA, IHS, CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, AHRQ, OS, and Global AIDS. The Global AIDS Trust Fund is budgeted in NIH, but HHS contributions are not reflected in NIH HIV/AIDS spending figures. CDC adjusted funding for HIV/AIDS expenditures downward to exclude administrative and management costs. Total Federal Government Spending on HIV/AIDS is detailed in a table prepared by CRS based on analysis from HHS Budget Office. Federal Government Spending on HIV/AIDS: FY1982-FY2009 ($ in millions) Source: Congressional Research Service (CRS) based on analysis from HHS Budget Office. FY2009 based on Administration's budget request. HHS, CMS, SS, DI, SSI, VA, AID, DOJ-Prisons, HUD, OPM-FEHB included in spending. Total FY2000 includes $75 million for HRSA Ricky Ray. Employees Health Benefits. FY2000 total includes $75 million for the HRSA Ricky Ray Hemophilia program, and FY2001 total includes $580 million for the HRSA Ricky Ray Hemophilia program. Medicaid and Medicare amounts revised due to Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage and lowered per capita healthcare costs. HHS Spending on HIV/AIDS Programs and Federal Government Spending on International HIV/AIDS Programs are detailed in the text."
