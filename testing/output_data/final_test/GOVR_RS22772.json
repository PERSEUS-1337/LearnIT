Bush signed the U.S.-Australia Treaty on Defense Trade Cooperation in Sydney on September 5, 2007, aiming to strengthen defense trade between the two countries. The treaty would streamline defense trade by reducing restrictions associated with arms and defense technology export controls, allowing for easier collaboration on counterterror operations and research and development programs. The U.S.-Australia Treaty on Defense Trade Cooperation aims to enhance defense trade between the two countries by streamlining export controls for research and development programs. Approval from both U.S. and Australian governments is required for exports outside approved entities. The treaty is expected to improve interoperability between military forces and support defense industries. Details on its operation are still being finalized. The U.S.-Australia Treaty on Defense Trade Cooperation, negotiated under the former Liberal Government, aims to streamline U.S. defense trade access for Australia. It would simplify export controls, provide operational benefits, improve military capability development, save costs and time, and enhance access for Australian companies bidding on U.S. defense requirements. The U.S.-Australia Treaty on Defense Trade Cooperation aims to streamline defense trade access for Australia, requiring enabling legislation in Australia with support from the newly elected government of Kevin Rudd. Key legislation that may need amendment includes the Customs Act of 1901, Customs Regulations 1958, and Weapons of Mass Destruction(Prevention of Proliferation) Act of 1995. Rudd's Labor Party's victory in the 2007 election has given him a strong mandate to enhance the Australia-U.S. alliance. The defense trade treaty is expected to be supported by the new Prime Minister due to bipartisan support for the ANZUS alliance in Australia. Prime Minister Rudd supports the Australia-New Zealand-United States (ANZUS) alliance, emphasizing its importance for Australia's security. He plans to withdraw troops from Iraq while considering increasing troops in Afghanistan. Rudd highlights the bipartisan history of the alliance, initiated in World War II, and stresses the benefits of intelligence sharing and military cooperation with the U.S. for Australia's national security. Rudd values the strong American presence in the region for regional stability and Australia's security. The treaty would deepen Australia's alliance with the U.S., a trusted ally in past conflicts. Secretary of State Rice emphasized the enduring ideals and shared history of the alliance. Admiral Keating highlighted Australia's consistent support in wars alongside the U.S. The Australians have been long-standing allies of the United States, but recent polls show a decline in U.S. popularity in Australia. Factors contributing to this include Bush Administration policies and the perception of the U.S. as a world watchdog. The treaty could improve the U.S. image in Australia and demonstrate the benefits of the alliance. Despite dissatisfaction with U.S. policies and the war in Iraq, a recent poll showed that 67% of Australians have an unfavorable opinion of President Bush. However, 92% believe the U.S. will remain a close security partner, and 79% still view the ANZUS alliance as important for Australia's security. Despite the decline in U.S. popularity since 2001, 74% of Australians still support the alliance. Despite the decreasing popularity of U.S. foreign policy since 2001, 74% of Australians trust that the United States would assist Australia if threatened. Concerns have been raised about potential reduced congressional oversight with the proposed treaty, not due to fears of military technology transfer but because of possible undermining of existing oversight mechanisms. The lack of supporting implementing arrangements for the treaty is also a concern. The Embassy stated that implementing agreements for the treaty will be worked out in the coming months to define how it will operate in Australia and the United States. The Administration's use of the treaty to redefine defense trade cooperation with Australia has raised concerns about potential reduced congressional oversight and the need for supporting implementing arrangements. The treaty between the United States and Australia allows for vetting of third party transfers to prevent re-export of U.S. technology to potential enemies. The treaty has been welcomed by the U.S. defense industry due to Australia's reliance on American-made weapons systems. Australia's defense budget has seen significant growth over the past 11 years."
