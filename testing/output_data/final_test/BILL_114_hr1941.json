    "content": "The \"Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act\" may be cited as the short title. It amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 to address the timeliness of examination reports. The \"Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act\" requires Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies to provide a final examination report to a financial institution within 60 days of the exit interview or provision of additional information. If a financial institution is not part of a resident examiner program, the exit interview must occur within 9 months of the examination, with possible extensions granted by the regulatory agency. The institution and the Independent Examination Review Director must provide specific reasons for needing more time to complete the examination. Upon request, the Federal financial institutions regulatory agency must include all examination materials relied upon for a material supervisory determination in the final report. SEC. 3. EXAMINATION STANDARDS. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 is amended to include new examination standards under SEC. 1013. In the examination of a financial institution, a commercial loan shall not be placed in non-accrual status solely due to collateral value deterioration. A modified loan can be removed from non-accrual status if the borrower shows ability to perform over 6 months. A new appraisal on a performing commercial loan is not needed unless new funds are advanced. The classified amount for a loan with collateral value decline is the deficiency portion. The Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies must use consistent definitions and reporting requirements for non-accrual loans. Well-capitalized institutions are not required to raise additional capital due to collateral value decline. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 is amended to include an Office of Independent Examination Review. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 is amended to establish the Office of Independent Examination Review, headed by the Independent Examination Review Director appointed by the Council. The Director is authorized to hire staff and investigate complaints from financial institutions regarding examinations, practices, or reports. Meetings are held regularly to encourage participation. The Office of Independent Examination Review, established under the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978, conducts regular meetings to discuss examination procedures, review examination quality assurance, and adjudicate supervisory appeals. The Director of the Office of Independent Examination Review conducts regular meetings to discuss examination procedures, review examination quality assurance, adjudicate supervisory appeals, and report annually to relevant committees on examination reviews and recommendations for improvements. SEC. 5. RIGHT TO INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF MATERIAL SUPERVISORY DETERMINATIONS. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 is further amended to include the right to independent review of material supervisory determinations. Financial institutions have the right to obtain an independent review of material supervisory determinations in final examination reports. They must file a written notice with the Independent Examination Review Director within 60 days of receiving the report, identifying the determination in question and providing reasons for disagreement. The financial institution has the right to request any information relied upon by the agency in the final report. The Director will determine the appeal on record or refer it to an Administrative Law Judge for a confidential hearing within 60 days of receiving the petition for review. The Director or Administrative Law Judge conducts a de novo review to determine the agency's decision independently based on relevant statutes and evidence. The Director's decision must be made within 60 days and is considered final agency action binding on the agency and financial institution. The financial institution has the right to petition for judicial review of final agency action within 60 days. The Director must report annually to specific committees on actions taken, without disclosing individual financial institutions' information. The Federal financial institutions regulatory agency is prohibited from retaliating against financial institutions or delaying actions beneficial to them for exercising appellate rights. This section does not limit the agency's ability to take enforcement actions.
