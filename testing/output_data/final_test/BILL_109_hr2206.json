    "content": "The \"Veterinary Workforce Expansion Act of 2005\" may be cited as the Veterinary Workforce Expansion Act. Congress finds that veterinary medicine is crucial for public health, as veterinarians play a key role in preventing infectious diseases, ensuring food safety, promoting healthy environments, and providing animal healthcare. There is a need to enhance national capacity in research and training for emerging infectious diseases, and veterinarians are uniquely qualified to address these challenges. Veterinarians are crucial for public health, addressing high priority issues like bioterrorism, food safety, and environmental health. There is a shortage of veterinarians in public health practice, with 28,000 job openings expected by 2012. The turnover rate in 2012 was nearly 38 percent due to growth and net replacements. The Nation's veterinary medical colleges lack the capacity to meet the current and future demand for veterinarians essential for public health preparedness. SEC. 3. COMPETITIVE GRANTS PROGRAM. Part E of title VII of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a Competitive Grant Program for Veterinary Medicine. The Secretary will award competitive grants to eligible entities to increase the number of veterinarians in the workforce. Eligible entities include accredited schools offering postgraduate training in public health practice areas. The Secretary will award competitive grants to eligible entities to increase the number of veterinarians in public practice areas and research on high priority disease agents. Applications must be submitted to the Department of Education for review and consideration based on specified criteria.

Grant funds can be used for construction, equipment, and capital costs to expand veterinary medicine programs.
