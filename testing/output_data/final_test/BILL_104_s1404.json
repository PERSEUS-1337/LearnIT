Victims can enforce an order of restitution for up to 20 years, and bankruptcy discharge does not affect restitution orders.

The court orders restitution and notifies potential claimants. The Attorney General issues a certificate of release or discharge of any lien imposed, upon acceptance of a bond or determination of fair market value of the property. The provisions of various sections of the Internal Revenue Code apply to an order of restitution and the lien imposed, with modifications by regulations issued by the Attorney General to align with differences in liabilities. References to the Secretary in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are interpreted as the Attorney General, and references to tax are interpreted as order of restitution. A notice of lien imposed is considered a notice of lien for taxes under State or local laws. Enforcement of an order of restitution can be done through execution against the property. The order of restitution can be enforced by execution against the property of the person it is ordered against, similar to civil judgments. Bankruptcy discharge does not affect the enforceability of a lien. If a person with a restitution lien files a civil action for money damages, they must notify the parties entitled to restitution and the Attorney General. Failure to provide timely notice can result in dismissal of the civil action. The Office of Victims of Crime or State agencies providing restitution to crime victims can intervene in a civil action if deemed in the interests of justice. SEC. 3. COSTS RECOVERABLE. Amends Section 1918(b) of title 28, United States Code to include recovery of amounts advanced for contraband purchases in sting operations during investigations leading to convictions."
