    "content": "The Act titled \"Creating Jobs Through Cooperatives Act\" is established for the purpose of promoting job creation through cooperatives. The Congress finds that Federal policy can promote cooperative development, benefiting communities by advancing local economic stability, increasing circulation of capital, attracting new capital in low-income areas, and creating investment opportunities for low- and moderate-income Americans. Cooperatives operate nationwide across various sectors of the economy. The purpose of this Act is to establish a Federal program that will create jobs and increase economic development by promoting cooperative development in various sectors of the United States economy. There are 29,000 cooperatives in the United States accounting for more than $3 trillion in assets, over $500 billion in total revenue, $25 billion in wages and benefits, and nearly two million jobs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cooperative development\" in this Act refers to technical assistance provided for financial forecasting, feasibility analysis, business planning, and other preparatory activities to ensure that cooperative organizations adhere to legal obligations and are governed transparently. The cooperative development activities include educating board members, management, employees, local communities, and the public, providing organizational planning, and hosting networking events and conferences. The curr_chunk discusses the involvement of cooperative organizations, professional organizations, and entities in cooperative development, offering professional development and administrative support. A cooperative organization is defined as a group working together for common needs. The term \"eligible project area\" is also defined. The curr_chunk defines an \"eligible project area\" as a location within specific census tracts or areas adjacent to low-income communities, with special approval by the Secretary. The Secretary will classify eligible project areas and limit the number of funded projects in certain areas. A local cooperative development center is defined as a nonprofit organization with expertise in cooperative organizations. The program refers to the National Cooperative Development Program, and the Secretary is the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The National Cooperative Development Program is established under SEC. 4. The National Cooperative Development Program, established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, provides grants to local cooperative development centers and partners with financial institutions to establish loan programs for cooperative organizations. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development established the National Cooperative Development Program to provide grants and financial products for cooperative organizations. At least 50% of the program funds are allocated for grants to local cooperative development centers, which may also receive grants for carrying out necessary activities. The Secretary will enter grant agreements with selected local development centers and provide grants accordingly. Grants will be for at least one fiscal year and may extend up to 3 years. Centers will be selected through a competitive process based on technical capacity to carry out eligible projects. The selection of local development centers for grants is based on their technical capacity to deliver assistance, offer cooperative development, provide matching funding, develop successful organizations, and have a positive economic impact on the area. Under the program, the Secretary may withhold financial assistance or terminate grant agreements if entities fail to meet performance targets or violate grant agreements. Under the program, the Secretary provides technical assistance, monitors local centers, offers guidance to communities, sets project eligibility criteria, and establishes performance targets. A significant percentage of projects funded under the program must involve cooperative organizations that are women- or minority-owned. SEC. 5. REPORTS. Local cooperative development centers and financial institutions receiving grants must submit a report to the Secretary within 12 months detailing grant expenditures and activities. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the assistance provided under the Act. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on cooperative organizations created, best practices from local cooperative development centers, compliance with performance targets, case studies of benefiting organizations, and additional information to promote future cooperative development. The Secretary is required to issue regulations within 180 days of the Act's enactment. $25,000,000 is authorized for the National Cooperative Development Program annually from 2013 to 2017."
