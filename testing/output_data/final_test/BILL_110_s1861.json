The Administrator has the authority to convey the northern and southern portions of the property to the Museum under certain terms and conditions to protect US interests. An agreement must be reached within 90 days for the conveyance, addressing mitigation of developmental impacts.

The selection of the appraiser must be mutually acceptable. The Administrator and the Museum must agree on the terms and conditions for an independent appraisal of the property. The appraisal must assume no hazardous substances are present and provide a value for the property. The appraisal for the property must include values for the property as a whole, as well as separate values for the northern and southern portions, considering any impact on value from a partial conveyance. The purchase price will be deposited into the Federal Buildings Fund, with the Administrator having discretion on expenditure, but requiring 30 days advance notice to the Committees. The property will be conveyed through a Quit Claim Deed. The property will be conveyed through one or more quit claim deeds, with the northern portion dedicated for a national health museum for 99 years, and the southern portion available for various uses. The northern portion may revert to the United States without repayment. The United States may reclaim the northern portion of the property if not used for a national health museum within 99 years or if museum construction does not begin within 5 years. The Administrator has the authority to enforce reversionary rights. The property reverts to the United States under the custody of the Administrator if not used for a national health museum within 99 years. Conveyance must occur within 3 years of enactment, with possible extensions for museum obligations. The Act's requirements apply to any property conveyed before the deadline or any extensions. SEC. 4. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. The Administrator is authorized to contract with the Museum for environmental response actions under CERCLA. Costs incurred by the Museum will be credited to the property's purchase price. This does not affect compliance with environmental laws. SEC. 5. INCIDENTAL COSTS. The Museum is responsible for all costs related to complying with the Act, including studies, surveys, relocating tenants, and mitigating impacts on Federal buildings. The Museum will cover relocation costs up to an agreed amount with the Administrator. Any excess costs will be credited towards the property purchase price. SEC. 6. LAND USE APPROVALS. Existing Authorities: This Act does not limit the authority of the National Capital Planning Commission or the Commission of Fine Arts. The Administrator must cooperate with the Museum on zoning and land use matters related to property development. Cooperation is subject to limitations, and the Administrator is not required to incur any costs. Consent for zoning and permitting is contingent on property development in accordance with the Act. The Museum must submit annual reports detailing development and construction activities to the Administrator and Committees for five years after the property conveyance or museum facility completion."
