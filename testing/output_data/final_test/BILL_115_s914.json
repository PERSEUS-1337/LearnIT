    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Drinking Water Assistance Act of 2017\". Congress recognizes the importance of safe drinking water for the health and well-being of all individuals in the United States. They acknowledge the presence of emerging contaminants in water systems and the potential health risks they pose, especially to vulnerable populations. The Safe Drinking Water Act mandates the EPA to regulate and periodically assess unregulated contaminants. The Government Accountability Office found limited progress in prioritizing unregulated drinking water contaminants based on public health concern. Data on exposure and health effects of contaminants are lacking, hindering regulatory determinations. The Administrator has taken over 10 years to address contaminants awaiting regulatory determinations. Obtaining data on other contaminants may take decades. The 2016 Drinking Water Action Plan recommended strengthening drinking water health advisories through collaboration and risk management. It is crucial for various stakeholders to work together to ensure the safety of public water systems in the United States. The public water systems in the United States are considered among the safest globally. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term \"contaminant\" means any substance in water. \"Contaminant of emerging concern\" or \"emerging contaminant\" refers to a substance that may affect health and lacks a national regulation. \"Federal research strategy\" is the interagency strategy developed under section 4(c)(1)(A)(i). The \"Working Group\" is also defined. The term \"Working Group\" refers to the group established under section 4(b)(1). SEC. 4. RESEARCH AND COORDINATION PLAN FOR ENHANCED RESPONSE ON EMERGING CONTAMINANTS. The Administrator is required to review Federal efforts on emerging contaminants and collaborate with stakeholders to establish a strategic plan. An Interagency Working Group on Emerging Contaminants must be established within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Health and Human Services will establish a Working Group to analyze the public health effects of emerging drinking water contaminants. The group will include representatives from EPA, NIH, CDC, ATSDR, and USGS. The Administrator may appoint the United States Geological Survey and other Federal agencies to assist in carrying out the subsection. An existing working group's duties may be expanded or modified for the Working Group. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will coordinate the Federal research strategy within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Director will coordinate with agencies to establish a National Emerging Contaminant Research Initiative to develop a Federal research strategy and necessary support for improving methods of identifying and treating emerging contaminants. The Director will coordinate with agencies to establish a National Emerging Contaminant Research Initiative for joint agency review, interagency cofunding, and information sharing. Research on emerging contaminants will consider peer-reviewed conclusions and prioritize contaminants in consultation with the Administrator. Federal participation includes the National Science Foundation. The Director will coordinate with federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Environmental Protection Agency, National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States Geological Survey, and other relevant agencies for research in water quality, environmental exposures, and public health. Nongovernmental organizations and research institutions will also be consulted for input. The Director will coordinate with federal agencies, NGOs, and research institutions for the National Emerging Contaminant Research Initiative. Agencies will issue research solicitations and make grants based on the Federal research strategy. The National Emerging Contaminant Research Initiative will select research proposals based on merit to receive grants for significant progress. Eligible entities, including State and local agencies, can submit research proposals to federal agencies. Federal Assistance and Support for States includes a study conducted by the Administrator to increase assistance for States needing testing facilities for emerging contaminants in drinking water samples. The Administrator will identify methods to increase technical assistance on emerging contaminants to States, facilitate access to contract testing laboratories, and implement actions at Federal laboratory facilities. The Administrator will provide analytical support for States needing testing facilities for emerging contaminants. A report on the study's results must be submitted to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment. Within three years, a program will be developed to assist eligible States with testing and analyzing emerging contaminants based on the report's findings. To be eligible for assistance under this paragraph, a State must submit an application to the Administrator containing required information. The Administrator will evaluate applications based on merit using identified criteria, including available laboratory facilities and resources. The Administrator prioritizes States for assistance based on the severity of the contaminant, prevalence, and financial distress of affected communities. The Administrator can waive the application process in emergencies and require an abbreviated process for past monitoring support. A database of resources is maintained to assist States with testing for emerging contaminants. Stakeholder groups with scientific or material interest in emerging contaminants include drinking water and wastewater utilities, laboratories, Federal and State emergency responders, State primacy agencies, public health agencies, and water associations. The Administrator will establish a database that is searchable and accessible through their website, containing information on qualified contract testing laboratory facilities for emerging contaminants and resources available in Federal laboratory facilities. This database will be integrated into the Water Contaminant Information Tool of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Administrator may request funding up to $15,000,000 annually to carry out the Environmental Protection Agency's Water Contaminant Information Tool. A biannual report on progress must be submitted to Congress, and states, local governments, and tribes must still meet their obligations regarding drinking water treatment and monitoring."
