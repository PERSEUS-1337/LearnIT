The Smaller War Plants Corporation had subcontracting authority during WWII to help small businesses financially. This authority expired after the war but was reinstated in 1951 during the Korean War. In 1951, during the Korean War, Congress created the Small Defense Plants Administration (SDPA) with powers similar to the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC) during WWII. In 1953, the SDPA's subcontracting authorities were transferred to the Small Business Administration under the Small Business Act of 1958, which included Section 8(a) for subcontracting. Initially, the SBA's subcontracting authority was not limited to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. Federal programs for racial and ethnic minorities began developing around the same time as those for small businesses, with executive orders issued to prohibit discrimination in defense-related contracts. These initiatives gained importance after the Kerner Commission's report on urban riots in 1966 highlighted the need for special encouragement for African Americans to enter the workforce. The urban riots of 1966 led to the need for special encouragement for African Americans to enter the economic mainstream. Presidents Johnson and Nixon established the 8(a) Program to provide this support. Johnson's President's Test Cities Program used SBA authority to award contracts to firms in urban areas, while Nixon's program focused on minority-owned small businesses. The SBA's regulations for the 8(a) Program were first articulated in 1970. The SBA's 8(a) Program was established in 1970 to assist disadvantaged persons in becoming self-sufficient businesses. In 1978, Congress granted statutory authority for the program to focus on minority-owned businesses. The 1978 amendments to the SBA's 8(a) Program allowed subcontracting with socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, defined as those at least 51% owned and controlled by individuals who have faced prejudice or bias. The amendments recognized Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and other minorities as socially disadvantaged groups. The SBA's 1978 amendments granted discretion to recognize additional socially disadvantaged groups based on specific criteria. Regulations established a three-part test for determining minority groups' disadvantage and defined standards for evidence and rebuttal procedures. The 8(a) Program identified racially or ethnically listed groups as socially disadvantaged and defined economically disadvantaged individuals as those with limited capital and credit opportunities. The SBA's 8(a) Program was originally established for disadvantaged individuals, but in the 1980s, it was expanded to include small businesses owned by four \"disadvantaged\" groups, including Community Development Corporations (CDCs). The program defines economic disadvantage as a personal net worth of less than $250,000 at entry ($750,000 for continuing eligibility). The SBA's 8(a) Program expanded in the 1980s to include small businesses owned by Community Development Corporations (CDCs), Indian tribes, Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs), and Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs). Congress created CDCs in 1981, and in 1986, Indian tribes and ANCs became eligible. ANCs were further deemed economically disadvantaged in 1992, and NHOs were recognized in 1988. The 8(a) Program includes small businesses owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs), which are nonprofit corporations controlled by Native Hawaiians and benefitting them. Participating firms are eligible for federal contract set-asides, sole-source awards, and SBA assistance. Detailed requirements govern eligibility, set-asides, and related issues, with special rules for 8(a) firms owned by groups. Eligibility for the 8(a) Program is limited to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the United States. The eligibility requirements remain the same throughout the program, with specific definitions provided by the Small Business Act and SBA regulations. Businesses must be for-profit entities operating primarily within the United States or making a significant contribution to the U.S. economy. Businesses eligible for the 8(a) Program must be small, independently owned and operated, not dominant in their field, and meet specific size standards set by the SBA Administrator. Size standards are based on the number of employees or gross income, with considerations for industry-specific criteria like passenger air transportation or data processing. Businesses can be determined to be other than small due to affiliations, joint ventures, subcontracting arrangements, or franchise agreements, as long as their income or personnel numbers, along with those of their affiliates, exceed the size threshold. Participants in the 8(a) Program must be at least 51% owned by socially and economically disadvantaged U.S. citizens. Ownership in the 8(a) Program must be at least 51% by socially and economically disadvantaged U.S. citizens, with conditions on ownership to prevent benefits from going to non-disadvantaged individuals or non-participant businesses. Non-disadvantaged individuals and non-participant businesses can own up to 10-20% of another 8(a) firm if they own at least 10% of one. Participants in the 8(a) Program must be controlled by disadvantaged individuals, who must have managerial experience and devote themselves full-time to the business. Non-disadvantaged individuals can only be involved in management to a limited extent. Socially disadvantaged individuals must control 8(a) businesses and have managerial experience, with limited involvement allowed for non-disadvantaged individuals. Designated groups have a rebuttable presumption of social disadvantage, but this can be overcome with credible evidence. Socially disadvantaged individuals not part of designated groups must prove their social disadvantage with evidence. This includes showing objective distinguishing features, personal experiences of social disadvantage, and negative impacts on business entry or advancement. The SBA considers education, employment, and business history to assess disadvantage. Economically disadvantaged individuals are also considered socially disadvantaged. Economically disadvantaged individuals seeking eligibility for the 8(a) Program must provide a personal statement and financial documentation, including personal income, net worth, and asset value. Net worth must be below $250,000 for initial eligibility and below $750,000 for continued eligibility. Ownership in a prospective or current 8(a) business and equity in a primary residence are excluded from net worth calculations. To qualify for the 8(a) Program, applicants must demonstrate good character, business integrity, and two years of experience in their primary industry. Waivers may be granted for firms with less than two years of experience if disadvantaged individuals have management experience and technical expertise. To qualify for the 8(a) Program, applicants must demonstrate technical experience, adequate capital, successful performance, and resources to carry out their business plan. Section 8(a) allows agencies to award contracts to small businesses, either through set-asides or sole-source awards, without competition under certain conditions. The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) allows agencies to use competitive procedures for procurement, but set-asides and sole-source awards are also permitted. The 8(a) Program is a recognized competitive procedure that encourages agencies to subcontract to small disadvantaged businesses. Awards made through set-asides or sole-source contracts count towards government goals for small disadvantaged businesses. The SBA is prohibited from accepting procurements for award under Section 8(a) in certain circumstances. The SBA is prohibited from awarding an 8(a) contract if the price exceeds fair market value or if it would have an adverse impact on small businesses. Otherwise, agencies can offer contracts to the SBA for award as an 8(a) contract under specific conditions. The SBA may accept contracts for the 8(a) Program at its discretion, with protests only heard if bad faith or federal law violations are shown. Contracts under $4 million ($7 million for manufacturing) are awarded without competition, while those exceeding this value may be awarded through a set-aside or on a sole-source basis. Contracts under $4 million ($7 million for manufacturing) are awarded without competition. Contracts exceeding this value may be awarded through a set-aside with competition limited to 8(a) firms, or on a sole-source basis under certain conditions. The 8(a) Program has key requirements such as inability to protest eligibility for an award, a maximum participation of nine years, and one-time eligibility for firms or disadvantaged individuals. One-time eligibility for the 8(a) Program states that firms or individuals who have exited the program are generally not eligible to participate again. Ownership limits apply when at least 50% of assets are the same between firms. Family members cannot use their disadvantaged status to qualify a firm if another family member has already done so. Additionally, there are limits on the amount of 8(a) contracts a firm can receive. Firms in the 8(a) Program may not receive additional sole-source awards exceeding $100 million in combined competitive and sole-source awards. 8(a) firms in the \"transitional stage\" must meet increasing annual revenue targets from non-8(a) sources to remain eligible for sole-source contracts. Non-8(a) sources are ineligible for sole-source 8(a) contracts unless they correct the situation. Limitations on subcontracting require small businesses to perform at least 50% of the costs incurred under the contract. Tribes, ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs do not participate in the 8(a) Program directly, but businesses owned by them can participate. Firms owned by Indian tribes, ANCs, NHOs, and CDCs must be \"small\" under the SBA's size standards to participate in the 8(a) Program. Certain affiliations with the owning entity or other business enterprises are excluded in size determinations, unless a substantial unfair competitive advantage is determined. ANC-owned firms have faced early graduation from the program for exceeding size standards. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes must meet SBA's size standards to participate in the 8(a) Program. ANC-owned businesses must be for-profit, unconditionally owned, and substantially controlled by the ANC. Management of tribally or ANC-owned firms can include individuals not from the tribe if certain conditions are met. Indian tribes, ANCs, NHOs, and CDCs must demonstrate managerial skills to run their firms. NHO-owned firms require NHO control of the board, while CDCs need experienced managers. These entities are presumed socially disadvantaged, with ANCs considered economically disadvantaged by statute. Indian tribes and NHOs must establish economic disadvantage. Indian tribes must provide data on tribe members and unemployment rates. The SBA requires Indian tribes, ANCs, NHOs, and CDCs to demonstrate managerial skills to run their firms. NHOs must show NHO control of the board, while CDCs need experienced managers. ANCs are considered economically disadvantaged by statute. Indian tribes and NHOs must establish economic disadvantage by providing data on tribe members, unemployment rates, per capita income, and access to capital. NHO-owned firms must meet economic disadvantage thresholds for 8(a) eligibility, with good character requirements applying to officers or directors. CDC-owned firms must demonstrate managerial skills, while ANCs are considered economically disadvantaged by statute. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes must demonstrate potential for success by meeting specific criteria such as having been in business for at least two years, showing management experience, successful performance on contracts, and adequate capital. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes must demonstrate potential for success by meeting specific criteria such as having been in business for at least two years, showing management experience, successful performance on contracts, and adequate capital. Additionally, these firms must annually submit information to the SBA showing how they have provided benefits to their respective communities. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes participating in the 8(a) program can provide benefits to their communities through various services such as funding cultural programs, employment assistance, scholarships, and more. These firms are eligible for 8(a) set-asides and sole-source awards, with ANCs and Indian tribes able to receive awards exceeding $4 million. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes in the 8(a) program are subject to the same regulations as other 8(a) firms, with some differences in eligibility requirements. They may participate in the program only once and have limits on ownership and contract amounts. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes in the 8(a) program have unique eligibility rules. They can confer eligibility multiple times and for an indefinite period. There are no limits on the number of firms they may own in different industries. They can also receive sole-source awards even after reaching a total contract limit. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes in the 8(a) program have unique eligibility rules, allowing them to receive competitive and sole-source contracts exceeding set dollar amounts. Challenges to the program based on racial and ethnic group disadvantages have resulted in varied court outcomes. In its 2012 decision in DynaLantic Corporation v. U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. District Court found the 8(a) Program not unconstitutional on its face, citing compelling government interest in minority business development and narrow tailoring of the program. However, it was deemed unconstitutional as applied in the military simulation and training industry due to lack of evidence of discrimination. The court found no evidence of discrimination in the simulation and training industry regarding the 8(a) Program. It rejected claims that the program favored minority groups over others, noting that all applicants must demonstrate economic disadvantage. The court emphasized the program's history and requirements, stating that race-neutral methods were insufficient before Congress authorized set-asides for disadvantaged small businesses in 1978. The court found that the 8(a) Program was intended for business development, not to favor minority firms. It requires evidence of a compelling need and is narrowly tailored with limits on program participation. The court emphasized the nine-year limits on program participation for individual owners and firms in the 8(a) Program, as well as the requirement that SBA may not accept a provision if it negatively impacts other small businesses. A 2015 decision by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia upheld the constitutionality of the 8(a) Program, noting its attributes that ensure race-conscious remedies do not last longer than necessary. The court emphasized the constitutionality of the 8(a) Program, noting six key factors: unsuccessful alternative remedies, flexibility without quotas, non-inclusivity, temporal limits, proportionate goals, and continuous eligibility monitoring. The Rothe decision on government contracts and the DynaLantic litigation settlement have implications for the 8(a) Program, which aims to support minority firms without burdening non-minority firms. The constitutionality of the program was emphasized by the court, highlighting key factors such as unsuccessful alternative remedies, flexibility, non-inclusivity, temporal limits, proportionate goals, and continuous eligibility monitoring."
