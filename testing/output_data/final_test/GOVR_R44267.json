    "content": "This report addresses frequently asked questions about federal land ownership and state efforts to control federal lands within state borders. It discusses the extent, cost, and history of federal land ownership, the constitutional basis for federal land ownership, and the legal authority of states to manage federal lands. It also reviews current and past state actions to foster divestiture of federal lands and how Congress determines federal land ownership through legislative proposals. The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the total land in the United States, with four agencies administering 95% of this land. The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres of land in the United States, with four agencies administering 95% of this land. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), and Forest Service (FS) manage about 610 million acres for various purposes such as energy development, conservation, recreation, and wildlife protection. The federal government owns 640 million acres of land in the United States, with agencies like BLM, FWS, NPS, and FS managing 95% of it. These agencies oversee 61% of Alaska's land and 46% of the land in the western states. They received a total of $15.47 billion in FY2016 for managing federal lands. The federal government owns 640 million acres of land in the United States, managed by agencies like BLM, FWS, NPS, and FS. These agencies received $15.47 billion in FY2016 for managing federal lands, with appropriations disbursed among states based on various factors. Federal land ownership began when the original 13 states ceded title to more than 40% of their \"western\" lands. Between 1781 and 1802, the original 13 states ceded over 40% of their western lands to the central government, totaling 237 million acres. Additional states were formed from these lands. The U.S. federal government acquired lands west of the Mississippi River, except for Texas, primarily from foreign governments. Major acquisitions included the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 (530 million acres), treaties with Great Britain and Spain in 1817 and 1819 (76 million acres), and other purchases and treaties between 1846 and 1853 (620 million acres). The last major acquisition was Alaska in 1867 (378 million acres). When states joined the United States, they gave up rights to claim lands retained by the federal government. The Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress authority over the lands, territories, or other property of the United States, allowing them to dispose of and regulate these lands. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad power to manage public lands without limitations. Congress has broad authority over federal land, which overrides conflicting state laws under the Supremacy Clause. Various statutes like FLPMA and the Wilderness Act grant federal agencies specific land management powers, but some aspects are left to the states. Federal agencies have authority over federal land, but certain wildlife-related statutes like the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act also play a role. Regulations issued under these statutes are considered supreme and override conflicting state laws. Agencies cannot delegate land management to states without specific statutory authority. The federal-state relationship is defined by applicable statutes for each agency and management topic. The federal agencies have primary responsibility for federal land management, with limited authority to delegate certain aspects to states. For example, the Mineral Lands Leasing Act allows the DOI to consider and comply with state standards for pipelines on federal lands, but delegation is not authorized. However, the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act permits the DOI to delegate royalty management on federal lands to states. The Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act (FOGRMA) allows DOI to delegate royalty collection to states, but not environmental oversight. Courts determine delegation based on the extent of authority given away. Federal agencies must cooperate with states but may not fully delegate. State input in federal land management may be allowed through federal rules or actions. States have legal authority to manage federal lands within their borders to the extent that Congress has chosen to give them such authority, determined by relevant statutes. For example, states have traditional authority over water rights and wildlife management. States have authority to manage federal lands within their borders based on relevant statutes. This includes regulating hunting and fishing, which must align with state laws. However, states do not have control over grazing, wild horse management, or oil and gas development on federal lands, as federal agencies oversee these areas. Federal laws or regulations take precedence unless Congress has provided an exemption. States can manage federal lands within their borders for activities like hunting and fishing, but federal laws take precedence over state laws. Congress determines the extent of states' authority to manage federal lands under the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution. States cannot exceed congressional authorization under the Supremacy Clause. States can obtain authority to manage federal lands if Congress transfers ownership to them. Congress can legislate to direct certain resources or activities on federal lands to be managed by states. Roughly 20 states have taken actions to gain more state and local control over lands. 20 states have sought more state and local control over federal lands and resources, citing concerns about federal land management, accessibility for recreation, and development limitations. Measures considered include supporting land transfer to states, creating task forces to examine transfer issues, asserting management authority over federal lands, and allowing state management under lease arrangements. Efforts in western states to reduce federal land ownership have included measures such as long-term lease arrangements, state activities on federal lands, and demands for abatement of poor resource conditions. Some states, like Utah, have enacted laws seeking to transfer federal lands to the state, but challenges exist as states cannot obtain ownership of federal lands through state law. These efforts have faced opposition and support from various stakeholders. In recent years, some states have considered measures to express support for federal lands or limit the sale of federal lands within the state. However, efforts by a state to claim control of federal lands are likely to be unconstitutional as Congress has the authority to regulate and manage federal lands under the Property Clause and Supremacy Clause. Only an act of Congress can expand states' authority over federal lands. Efforts to gain more state control over federal lands, particularly BLM and FS lands, have been ongoing for decades. The Sagebrush Rebellion in the late 1970s and early 1980s involved state and local legislation, court challenges, and proposals for federal legislation to achieve this goal. However, these efforts have not led to significant divestiture due to various reasons, including legal obstacles stemming from agreements made by western states upon statehood. Western states generally agreed to disclaim all right and title to unappropriated public lands, which would remain at the sole disposition of the United States. This language was included in federal enabling acts and state constitutions, making state laws asserting title to federal lands contradictory. States have not enforced these laws, leaving federal land ownership as a policy choice for Congress. Recent Congresses have considered bills related to land acquisition and disposal, including proposals for specific land parcels and protective designations like national monuments. Several proposals have been made in recent Congresses regarding land acquisition and disposal. These include establishing new federal land units like national monuments, conservation areas, and parks, increasing funding for acquisitions, transferring federal parcels to individuals or entities for public use, and reauthorizing or establishing new disposal authorities. Some bills also aim to accelerate land sales, such as those identified by the BLM. Several bills proposed various measures related to federal land ownership and disposal. These included accelerating land sales, allowing states to select federal lands for lease or sale to generate funds for education, and limiting federal land ownership or acquisition in certain states."
