Television is a pervasive presence in American homes, with the average household having 2.5 TVs and a TV being on for 7 hours a day. Children spend an average of 21 hours a week watching TV, which can influence their perceptions and behaviors. Research shows a strong link between children's exposure to televised violence and behavioral issues. Numerous studies confirm that children who regularly watch violent TV shows are more likely to display aggressive behavior and become desensitized to real-life violence. Additionally, sexual content on television can also impact children significantly. Research suggests that heavy exposure to TV programming with strong sexual content can lead to early sexual activity among teenagers. The National Association of Broadcasters adhered to a code of conduct emphasizing the careful selection of program subjects to responsibly use television's influence. Broadcasters have a responsibility to ensure that programs for children cater to a range of interests and contribute to their development. Violence, whether physical or psychological, should be approached with caution. Broadcasters must handle violence responsibly, avoiding exploitation and presenting its consequences to victims and perpetrators. They should also treat marriage, family, and sexual content sensitively, considering the family atmosphere in which programs are viewed. Graphic portrayal of sexual acts is prohibited. The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned its code of conduct in 1983 after legal challenges on advertising restrictions. The programming standards of the code were never found to violate antitrust laws. Since the National Association of Broadcasters abandoned its code of conduct in 1983, programming standards on broadcast and cable television have deteriorated significantly. Public concern about the impact of television on children and society has increased, with polls showing over 80% of Americans worried about the graphic nature of content and glorification of criminal behavior. Congress has urged the television industry to address these concerns, leading to some steps being taken to improve programming standards and content. In 1992, the broadcast television industry agreed to guidelines against excessive violence. The industry later conducted studies on violent content and implemented a rating system for harmful programming in 1999. Despite these efforts, many Americans, especially parents, are still unhappy with declining television standards. The Department of Justice ruled in 1993 that voluntary programming guidelines by the television industry would not violate antitrust laws. This ruling aimed to improve program content and provide valuable information to advertisers and viewers. The Children's Television Act of 1990 mandates that US television broadcasters must cater to the educational needs of children, but analyses show they have not met this obligation. The popularity of educational video and PC games among children is on the rise. Violent video games are popular among teenagers, with 64 percent regularly playing them. These games often glamorize violence, with players rewarded for \"kills\". The graphic and extreme nature of these games can negatively influence impressionable children. Music is a popular form of entertainment among American children and teenagers, with teens listening to an average of 10,500 hours of rock or rap music between 7th and 12th grades. Teens are heavy purchasers of music, often favoring genres that depict violence. Music has the power to influence perceptions, attitudes, and emotional states, with potential benefits for emotional, psychological, and physical health, but also the potential for negative influence. The Act does not give the Federal Government new authority to restrict entertainment content beyond existing laws. It also does not endorse any additional government actions to limit such content. Additionally, voluntary agreements on guidelines for entertainment material are exempt from antitrust laws. The Act exempts joint discussions in the entertainment industry to create voluntary guidelines for child-appropriate content from antitrust laws, with limitations on boycotting.

The Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission are required to submit a report to Congress on the compliance with ratings or labeling systems in the motion picture, recording, and video game industry within 12 months of the Act's enactment.
