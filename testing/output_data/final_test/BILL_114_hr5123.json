An individual can file a subsequent claim with the Court of Federal Claims for benefits under this part without final agency action on the original claim.

The individual can appeal a denial of their claim to a hearing officer and then to the Director if the original claim is denied within 180 days. The Court of Federal Claims will review the claim without considering any prior determinations by the Bureau or its hearing officers.
