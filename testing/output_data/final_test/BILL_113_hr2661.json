    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Veterans Access to Timely Medical Appointments Act.\" Congress acknowledges the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' obligation to provide timely access to healthcare for eligible individuals who served in the Armed Forces. Timely scheduling of primary and specialty care appointments is crucial to meeting veterans' healthcare needs and preventing medical conditions from worsening due to treatment delays. An audit by the Comptroller General of the United States revealed unreliable data on medical appointment wait times reported by the Veterans Health Administration. This lack of accurate measurement hinders the Secretary's ability to identify and address areas needing improvement, leading to discrepancies between published positive results and veterans' actual experiences. The Comptroller General found inconsistencies in implementing scheduling policies across Veterans Health Administration medical centers, hindering timely appointments. Oversight of policy compliance and telephone service management were also found lacking, impacting veterans' access to care. Patient complaints about unreturned phone calls were prevalent in the reviewed medical centers. During fiscal year 2012, unreturned phone calls were a top complaint. The Veterans Health Administration distributed best practices for telephone access to improve clinical care. The Secretary is failing to provide timely medical appointments for veterans, hindering their access to benefits and healthcare. SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF MEDICAL APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING POLICY FOR VETERANS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must implement a standardized scheduling policy within 180 days to ensure veterans can schedule primary care appointments within seven days and specialty care appointments within 14 days. The Secretary must ensure the scheduling policy is reliable and accurate, uniform procedures are followed, and detailed guidance is issued to ensure consistency. The Secretary must ensure consistent implementation of scheduling policy at each medical center and related facilities, only allowing trained employees to schedule appointments. Annual performance reports for each Veterans Integrated Service Network must be made public. The Secretary will assess resources of each Network every 180 days to meet scheduling requirements. The Secretary may reprogram funds and allocate resources within the Veterans Health Administration to ensure each Network meets scheduling requirements. Congress must be notified of any reprogramming. Medical centers must implement best practices for phone access outlined by the Veterans Health Administration. The Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, in consultation with veterans service organizations, shall submit an annual report to Congress on the progress of implementing the Act, including an assessment of data reliability on appointment wait times. The annual report to Congress includes an assessment of meeting telephone call timeframes, scheduling medical appointments accurately, and not changing appointments without veteran request at Department medical facilities."
