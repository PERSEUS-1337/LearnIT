    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Guard Investigations Transparency and Improvement Act of 2014.\" It codifies the establishment and duties of the Office of Complex Administrative Investigations in the National Guard Bureau. The Office of Complex Administrative Investigations in the National Guard Bureau, under the Chief's direction, conducts complex administrative investigations related to National Guard members in State status, including sexual assault cases, upon request from specified authorities. The governor of a State or territory, or the Commanding General of the National Guard of the District of Columbia can authorize complex administrative investigations involving factors like jurisdictional questions, specialized training, and the need for an independent investigation to ensure fairness and impartiality. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau determines if a matter relates to a National Guard member in State status. Final reports from the Office are treated as Inspector General reports. Reports are submitted to congressional delegations. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau submits final investigation reports to Congress, with personally identifying information redacted. Annual reports include a summary of investigations and trends in findings. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau ensures that the Office maintains necessary personnel and capabilities for investigations involving sexual assault allegations. Procedures and instructions are issued as needed for the discharge of duties. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau issues instructions for the discharge of duties, including the repeal of a superseded instruction."
