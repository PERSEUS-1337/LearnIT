    "content": "Congress has passed domestic content laws like the Buy America Act to protect American manufacturing. The Trump Administration's focus on domestic manufacturing has renewed interest in Buy America, which applies to federally funded transportation projects. This includes highways, public transportation, aviation, and Amtrak. Buy America applies to federally funded transportation projects, including passenger rail like Amtrak. It requires the use of U.S.-made iron and steel and domestic production of other manufactured goods. This report analyzes the effects of Buy America on steel and rolling stock manufacturing in the context of industry trends and its impact on the transportation system. It also discusses how Buy America aligns with international trade agreements and a new provision requiring imports on federally funded projects. The report discusses Buy America requirements for federally funded transportation projects, including passenger rail like Amtrak. Different agencies administer Buy America provisions, and waivers are possible in certain situations. State or local projects not using federal funds are not subject to Buy America. Buy America provisions for FHWA-administered funds, found at 23 U.S.C. \u00a7313 and 23 C.F.R. \u00a7635.410, apply to iron and steel in highway projects. Waivers can be granted by the Secretary of Transportation if not in the public interest, materials not produced in the US, or if domestic materials raise project costs by over 25%. Buy America does not apply to raw materials like iron ore or waste products, including scrap steel. Requirements are waived for products not predominantly iron and steel. In 2012, FHWA clarified that a manufactured product must consist of at least 90% iron and steel to be subject to Buy America requirements. FHWA grants waivers for certain iron products used in steel manufacturing. Buy America requirements are waived for products not predominantly iron and steel by FHWA, but not by other DOT agencies and Amtrak. For rolling stock purchases using FTA funds, the Buy America requirement is waived if a certain percentage of components are produced in the US. The Buy America provisions require that more than 60% of the cost of rolling stock components be made in the US, with final assembly also taking place in the US. For non-rolling stock goods purchased with FTA funds, 100% of components, including steel and iron, must be made and assembled in the US. The Buy America provisions mandate that Amtrak must buy goods with a domestic component content greater than 50% by cost. The U.S. government funds transportation projects through grants or loans to avoid violating international trade agreements. The United States, along with 47 other WTO members, have commitments under the GPA and free trade agreements allowing access to national procurement markets. These agreements require national treatment, allowing firms to bid on government contracts over a certain dollar threshold. This also allows U.S. firms to bid on contracts in foreign markets with equal treatment. The United States, as a WTO GPA signatory, excludes state and local governments from coverage, causing tension with trading partners like Canada and the EU. In 2010, the US allowed Canadian firms to bid on certain subnational contracts in exchange for Canada's agreement to cover its provinces under the WTO GPA. Cargo preference is another restriction on federally supported projects. Cargo preference is a requirement for a portion of government-impelled cargoes to be carried on U.S.-flag vessels. A provision in the FY2009 Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act specifies that at least 50% of imported cargo financed with federal funds must be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels. This provision may complicate transportation projects subject to Buy America requirements. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) within DOT is working on regulations for cargo preference requirements from the FY2009 NDAA. FHWA applies these requirements to federally supported highway projects. MARAD also applies cargo preference to vessel components for ships with federal loan guarantees. Buy America requirements have seen changes in recent surface transportation acts. In recent surface transportation acts, Buy America requirements were addressed to prevent project segmentation and ensure all contracts within a project's scope adhere to the regulations. This was exemplified during the reconstruction of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge by CalTrans after a major earthquake in 1989. The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) decided to reconstruct the Bay Bridge after a major earthquake in 1989. They used imported steel for the project to save costs and avoid Buy America requirements. The eastern span was controversially built using steel from China. The provision prohibiting project segmentation now requires utility relocation work to be Buy America-compliant, causing initial concerns about delays. FHWA delayed implementation in response to these concerns. The FHWA delayed the implementation of Buy America requirements until January 1, 2014, in response to concerns about utility relocation work. The effects of compliance on highway projects, utilities, and manufacturers remain unknown. MAP-21 and the FAST Act made changes to increase transparency in the waiver determination process and adjust the threshold for public transportation rolling stock. The FAST Act also eliminated Buy America requirements for public transportation projects costing less than $150,000. The Trump Administration has raised the Buy America threshold for public transportation projects to $150,000 and requires FTA to certify items can be bought in the US. Efforts to protect domestic industries are part of the \"Buy American and Hire American\" initiative, including using US materials for new pipelines. Steel made in the US from imported scrap or slabs is not allowed. The memorandum states that steel made in the United States from imported scrap or slabs is not considered produced in the US. Buy American Laws require the use of US-made steel unless waived by the federal agency. US mills produce steel in three ways: minimills, traditional integrated mills, and blast furnaces. The production of steel in the United States involves ovens turning coal into coke, which is then combined with iron ore to produce pig iron in blast furnaces. A small portion of U.S. production uses direct reduction technology. The raw materials for steel production mostly come from domestic sources, with scrap used by minimills obtained domestically. Integrated steel mills primarily use iron ore from Minnesota's Mesabi Iron Range and Michigan's Iron Range. The taconite used in steelmaking is formed into pellets containing magnetic iron particles. Buy America waivers allow U.S. steel mills to use imported inputs for steel production, exempting them from Buy America requirements. It is uncertain how these requirements may change in response to President Trump's executive order. Steel is cast into various shapes after production. After steel production, slab converters seek nonavailability waiver for domestically made steel slabs due to insufficient supply from U.S. mills. FHWA has denied waivers, supported by steel industry groups, as it would weaken Buy America rules under President Trump's executive order. The economic effects of Buy America on the steel industry are difficult to assess due to lack of relevant data. Industry estimates show that steel produced for the Buy America market represents a small portion of total domestic demand. In 2015, 20 million tons of steel were consumed in public and private construction projects, including non-transportation projects. The Buy America policy affects steel used in various projects, including transportation and non-transportation sectors. In 2015, 1.7 million tons of steel were used in rail transportation projects, accounting for 1.6% of U.S. steel production. The policy aims to support steel industry employment, which has decreased due to higher productivity. Labor hours needed to produce one ton of steel have significantly decreased since 1980. The Buy America policy aims to increase demand for U.S.-made steel to boost steel industry employment. If demand increases by 1 million tons, it could create around 1,000 new jobs. Steel mill workers earn an average annual wage of $78,965. Buy America also restricts sourcing of iron and steel for state and local governments and Amtrak using federal funds. The Buy America policy restricts sourcing of iron and steel for state and local governments and Amtrak using federal funds, affecting the manufacturing of rolling stock such as intercity passenger rail trains and buses. Final assembly of rolling stock must occur in the United States, with a significant portion of components also manufactured domestically. The U.S. domestic market for railroad rolling stock was $19 billion in 2016, directly employing 30,100 workers in 2015. The Buy America policy affects the production of equipment not publicly funded, like freight locomotives and rail cars. The U.S. market for new street, subway, and transit cars was $2.6 billion in 2017. Foreign manufacturers dominate intercity passenger rail cars and rail transit vehicles in the U.S., but Buy America requires them to establish assembly plants in the country. For example, in 2015, CRRC, a Chinese company, began building a $95 million plant in the U.S. Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC), a Chinese state railways unit, is constructing a $95 million assembly plant in Springfield, MA, to produce 284 subway cars for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. The plant plans to hire 150 factory workers and start full production in 2018. U.S. plants may face challenges in exporting due to cost structures, varying requirements, and global demand being mostly outside North America. Assemblers of transit vehicles in North America rely on a global supply chain for steel, aluminum, and components like transmissions, axles, and engines. Purchased steel and components make up 50% of manufacturing costs. Public-sector investment in public transportation systems is seen as crucial for the passenger rail car manufacturing industry. Domestic demand for new passenger rail cars has varied from 497 units in 2011 to 1,141 in 2009. Since 2006, domestic manufacturers have shipped 8,970 new passenger cars to Amtrak and transit agencies, with a backlog of over 3,700 vehicles reported in 2016. The outlook through 2022 predicts more than 5,000 new passenger rail cars, including intercity, commuter rail, and transit cars. The future of federal assistance for passenger rail car purchases is uncertain, impacting demand for new vehicles. Despite Buy America rules, domestic transit bus manufacturing remains a small sector. In 2016, bus manufacturing revenue was $5.1 billion, including school buses, intercity buses, and public transit buses. Bus manufacturers in the public transit market produce 4,000 to 6,000 buses annually. New Flyer and Gillig dominate the North America heavy-duty transit bus market, with Nova also holding a significant share. New Flyer makes fewer than 1,000 buses in Minnesota and Alabama, while Gillig produces between 1,100 and 1,600 buses in California. Nova's bus plant in Plattsburgh, NY, manufactures 40-foot and 62-foot articulated buses. Orion stopped bus assembly in the US in 2013 due to low public sector investments. New Flyer acquired NABI that year. BYD, a Chinese company, entered the US transit bus market, currently making 200 electric buses in California with plans to increase to 1,000 annually. Buy America aims to protect US manufacturing but could raise costs and completion times for transportation projects. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that Buy America rules impact highway and transit projects by requiring the use of domestically produced iron, steel, and manufactured goods. Projects can apply for a waiver if costs increase by more than 25%. US steel prices are higher than those from other countries. The average U.S. hot-rolled band price has been consistently higher than Chinese and Western European prices in recent years. However, higher transportation costs for imported steel may reduce or eliminate its cost advantage at a specific project site. In 2015, domestic hot-rolled band was $200 per metric ton higher than Chinese steel, with additional costs of about $60 per metric ton for freight, insurance, and handling from Asia. This left a Chinese cost advantage of $140 per ton at dockside, depending on the costs of moving steel to the job site. The Buy America policy can increase costs for rolling stock procurements in public transportation. A study shows that buses in the US are twice as expensive as those in Japan and South Korea, limiting choices and innovation. Importing buses could provide a greater variety of products at lower prices, improving service quality and encouraging people to use public transit. Administering and enforcing Buy America also incurs additional costs. The direct costs of Buy America are mainly related to administering and enforcing its requirements, absorbed by state and local government project sponsors. These costs include contractors documenting the national origin of products, preparing waiver requests, and potential delays in project completion leading to higher costs. Buy America requirements have caused concerns among state departments of transportation and private developers, leading to project delays and difficulties in obtaining financing. In a survey, Buy America was cited as a major cause of project delays in the public transportation industry. The FY2009 Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act established cargo preference requirements for imported materials purchased with federal financial assistance, potentially raising transportation project costs and causing delays. U.S.-flag vessel shipping rates are higher and services less frequent compared to foreign-flag vessels, making imported materials subject to cargo preference less attractive to project sponsors. The Buy America requirements may increase transportation project costs and completion time, but are mentioned less often than environmental requirements by state transportation officials. Of states avoiding federal funds due to requirements, environmental requirements are cited more frequently than Buy America. Supporters argue that Buy America supports domestic manufacturing employment and encourages foreign manufacturers to establish factories in the U.S. The Buy America requirements support domestic manufacturing employment and encourage foreign manufacturers to establish factories in the U.S. Policy options for changing Buy America include tightening, loosening, standardizing, or broadening restrictions. The FAST Act increased the share of public transit rolling stock components produced in the U.S. Other bills, like the Invest in American Jobs Act of 2015, have also aimed to modify Buy America to be more restrictive. The Invest in American Jobs Act of 2015 and the Buy American Improvement Act of 2017 propose changes to increase Buy America requirements for public transit rolling stock components. This includes tightening regulations, reevaluating FHWA regulations, developing audit requirements, and setting new standards for component value measurement. The bill would require Amtrak and FAA to search for domestic suppliers before seeking a waiver. Buy America requirements would apply to projects financed with passenger facility charges. No significant proposals in the 115th Congress to loosen Buy America requirements. The FAST Act raised the threshold for public transportation purchases subject to Buy America. The Buy America requirements have been standardized for rolling stock purchases, with proposals to expand them to other parts of the transportation system and sectors like clean energy manufacturing. Legislation such as the American Pipeline Jobs and Safety Act of 2017 aims to extend Buy America requirements to gas and hazardous liquid pipelines regulated by DOT. H.R. 683 proposes a new safety standard for pipelines to use only U.S.-made steel from iron ore and taconite. Another bill, H.R. 1524, aims to require clean-energy goods purchased with federal funding to have 85% American-made content. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 added Buy America requirements to projects receiving assistance from state revolving funds. Buy America provisions have been included in various bills and annual appropriations acts for grants under the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 imposed Buy American requirements on federally funded projects. Several bills in the 115th Congress aim to make the Buy America provision permanent. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 included Buy America requirements for clean water and drinking water projects funded by the act. A bill in the 115th Congress, S. 181, introduced by Senator Brown, aims to expand Buy America to federal infrastructure programs without such requirements and include additional construction materials."
