    "content": "Since 1975, 35 states have implemented high risk pools (HRPs) to provide nonprofit health insurance to individuals with preexisting conditions. These pools vary in plan options and are administered by private health insurance carriers. Despite nearly 4 million eligible individuals, only 199,020 were enrolled in HRPs in 2008. Limited funding for subsidies on high premiums is believed to be a factor by the National Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans (NASCHIP). The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established a temporary federal High Risk Pool (HRP) program to provide coverage for uninsured individuals with preexisting conditions until January 1, 2014. The program, known as the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP), aims to help individuals with preexisting conditions obtain coverage until preexisting condition exclusions are prohibited in 2014. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established a Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) to provide coverage for uninsured individuals with preexisting conditions until 2014. The PCIP can be administered by either a state or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with different names and carriers depending on the state. The PCIP is operated by the North Carolina Health Insurance Risk Pool, Inc., a state-sponsored non-profit organization. 27 states administer their own PCIP plan, while 23 states and DC have HHS run the program. The Secretary may carry out the federal HRP program directly or through contracts to eligible entities. The Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (OCIIO) within the Office of the Secretary is responsible for administering the temporary high-risk pool program and associated funding to states. The Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (OCIIO) oversees the high-risk pool program and funding to states. Richard Popper leads the Insurance Programs Group, part of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO). HHS selected Government Employees Health Association, Inc. (GEHA) as the third-party administrator for 23 states and DC for the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP). Eligible entities to contract with the Secretary for PCIP must be a state or nonprofit organization. The PPACA appropriated $5 billion for the temporary High-Risk Pool (HRP) program, which is insufficient according to Richard Foster, the chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The funding may run out by 2011 or 2012, leading to substantial premium increases. Many states opted out of participating in the program due to concerns about inadequate funding. The High-Risk Pool program funded by the PPACA may face a funding shortage, leading to potential adjustments in health coverage, premiums, or state taxpayer contributions. States like Wyoming have expressed concerns about insufficient funding until 2014. The Secretary plans to allocate funds using a formula similar to CHIP, with reallocation of unspent state allotments after two years based on enrollment and expenditure assessments. The PCIP program supplements state HRPs and is funded based on enrollment and expenditure assessments. Federal enrollees must be without credible coverage for six months prior to applying. Credible coverage includes various health plans and programs. The PCIP program requires eligible individuals to be without credible coverage for six months prior to applying. Eligibility criteria include having a preexisting condition and providing documented evidence of being refused individual coverage based on health grounds. Eligible individuals for the PCIP program must be without credible coverage for six months prior to applying and meet specific criteria related to their health or preexisting conditions. Additionally, they must be a citizen or national of the United States or lawfully present in the country. HHS is implementing a new computer matching program with OPM, SSA, and NFC to verify citizenship or nationality. To apply for the PCIP program, eligible individuals must submit an application with personal information, medical condition details, and proof of denial for coverage due to a preexisting condition. Application options include paper, online, or by phone. A new computer matching program is being implemented to verify citizenship or nationality. The Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) offers coverage to individuals denied individual coverage or certain benefits due to preexisting conditions. State-administered HRPs may have varying application procedures. The Congressional Budget Office estimated enrollment to reach 400,000 to 700,000 by 2013 with federal spending potentially between $10 billion and $15 billion. Enrollment in the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) ranged from 12,437 in 2011 to 700,000 in 2013. The lower than expected enrollment was attributed to initial focus on operational matters rather than public education efforts. CCIIO is now working on increasing enrollment through aggressive strategies. Director Steven Larsen stated that CCIIO has an aggressive strategy to encourage enrollment of eligible individuals by meeting with local stakeholders, providers, and advocacy groups like the American Cancer Society and American Diabetes Association. They are actively reaching out through webinars, meetings, and collaborations with agencies serving individuals with disabilities to spread awareness about the PCIP program. The PCIP program is easing eligibility standards to facilitate enrollment in federally administered states. Starting July 1, 2011, applicants can provide a letter from a healthcare provider dated within the past 12 months stating their medical condition. Specific coverage policies are not addressed by the law. The Secretary has the authority to establish additional requirements for the PCIP program, including coverage policies and network adequacy. PCIPs must have a sufficient number and range of providers to ensure all covered services are available. Certain benefit categories must be covered, while excluded categories include cosmetic surgery and in vitro fertilization. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) outlines specific exclusions for the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP), such as custodial care, in vitro fertilization, abortion services (except in certain cases), and experimental care. PCIP coverage must have an actuarial value of at least 65% and an out-of-pocket limit not exceeding $5,950 for individuals in 2011. The Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) in 2011 had a maximum annual cost-sharing limit of $5,950 for individuals. Cost-sharing varied between states and PCIP options, with deductibles ranging from $0 to $5,000 for medical expenses and $100 to $500 for drug expenses. PCIPs may have coinsurance or flat dollar co-payments after the deductible. Premium rates for PCIP must be fair and affordable under the PPACA. Premium rates for the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) must be fair and established at a standard rate for a standard population. Age rating cannot exceed a factor of 4 to 1. PPACA subsidizes premiums with $5 billion for claims and administrative costs. PCIP premiums vary by state, plan benefits, and deductibles. In 2011, monthly premiums ranged from $69 to $1,806 for state-administered PCIPs and $116 to $842 for federal PCIPs. HHS announced a 20.67% average premium decrease for federally administered PCIPs in July 2011 to make enrollment more affordable. The average premium decrease for federally administered PCIPs is 20.67%, bringing them closer to individual market rates in some states. Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming will not see a reduction in PCIP premiums. HHS has provided guidance to states on how to lower premiums in state-administered PCIPs, but it is unclear how many states will adjust their rates."
