If Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving a rule, it cannot take effect. Special expedited procedures are in place for congressional action on these resolutions. The Congressional Review Act of 1996 allows Congress to disapprove regulatory rules issued by federal agencies through expedited procedures. These procedures regulate action in the Senate, set deadlines, and impose restrictions on opportunities for action. Expedited procedures govern congressional consideration of joint resolutions to disapprove or approve specific actions authorized by statutes. The expedited procedure under the Congressional Review Act of 1996 allows Congress to take timely action on resolutions of disapproval or approval by ensuring that it can be completed within a limited period of time. These procedures function as rules of each house of Congress and require action by both houses and the President for enactment. The Congressional Review Act establishes time periods for congressional action on joint resolutions disapproving executive branch regulations. These periods, known as the initiation period, action period, and waiting period, each run for 60 days and play a key role in how the Act operates. The Congressional Review Act includes procedures for reconciling House and Senate actions on disapproval resolutions. These procedures are not bound by specific time constraints and can be influenced by various actions from Congress or the President. The Congressional Review Act establishes expedited procedures for Congress to consider disapproval resolutions overriding rules or regulations. These procedures are available if the resolution is submitted during a specified initiation period and can be considered by the Senate.

The action period applies only to initial consideration in the Senate. The Congressional Review Act allows for expedited procedures for Congress to consider disapproval resolutions overriding rules or regulations. The Senate has 60 days of session to complete initial consideration of a disapproval resolution following congressional receipt of the rule. If Congress adjourns its session sine die within the 60-day period, both the initiation period and action period start over in the new session. This provision ensures that Congress has the full periods established by law to act on a disapproval resolution under the expedited procedure.

If Congress adjourns its session sine die within the 60-day period, both the initiation period and action period start over in the new session to prevent time constraints on completing action on a disapproval resolution. The Congressional Review Act sets out procedures for Congress to consider disapproval resolutions overriding rules. A \"major rule\" cannot take effect until 60 days after being published in the Federal Register and submitted to Congress. The President can waive this requirement. The Congressional Review Act establishes a 60-day waiting period for \"major rules\" before they can take effect, unless the President waives this requirement for expedited implementation. Rules that are not \"major\" or for which the President waives the waiting period can take effect after 30 days, as per the Administrative Procedure Act. The waiting period for \"major rules\" is defined in calendar days, while the action and initiation periods depend on the congressional schedule. The waiting period for \"major rules\" under the Congressional Review Act is defined in calendar days, while the action and initiation periods depend on the congressional schedule. The waiting period expires first, the initiation period falls between the other two, and the action period for the Senate expires later due to breaks in Senate meetings. The Congressional Review Act's waiting period for \"major rules\" expires after 14 weeks or 96 calendar days. The initiation and action periods pause during congressional recess, ensuring that resolutions can still be considered under expedited procedures. If a resolution is submitted after the initiation period expires, Congress cannot consider it under the Act's expedited procedures.

Even after the waiting period ends, Congress can still use expedited procedures to disapprove a rule that has already taken effect, regardless of sine die adjournment. If Congress enacts a resolution disapproving a rule that has already taken effect, the rule \"shall be treated as though [it] had never taken effect.\" The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove a \"major rule\" within 60 days before it takes effect. If Congress enacts a resolution disapproving a rule that has already taken effect, the rule would be treated as though it had never taken effect. This retroactive effect only applies to disapproval resolutions submitted and finalized according to the Act's provisions. If Congress overrides or abolishes a regulation through procedures not meeting the Act's requirements, the retroactive effect would not apply. Additionally, the waiting period terminates immediately if either house rejects a disapproval resolution or sustains a veto, but if the President vetoes a resolution to disapprove a \"major rule,\" the waiting period continues.

Resolutions may differ between chambers, causing potential issues in reaching agreement on a single version before sending it to the President. The Act regulates the process of selecting a single vehicle for further action after each house adopts its own measure, addressing procedural and technical challenges that could be easily overcome if majorities in both chambers wished to disapprove a rule. Members can prevent problems by coordinating their efforts to ensure disapproval resolutions share the same text. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove a rule within 60 days before it takes effect. Resolutions submitted in each house would share the same text. If a disapproval resolution did not meet the content requirements of the Act or was not submitted during the initiation period, Congress could still consider it under its ordinary procedures. If enacted, the resolution would put the regulation out of effect, but the agency could propose a similar rule. The Act prohibits a new rule only if the disapproval resolution meets specific requirements and was submitted during the initiation period.

The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove a rule within 60 days before it takes effect. If no disapproval resolution is submitted before the discharge procedure becomes available, the motion can be offered closely after submission. The committee of jurisdiction can mark up and report the measure before or after the discharge procedure. Once the committee reports, it cannot be discharged, but the resolution goes to the calendar for consideration. Amendments can only be recommended in committee and must be adopted on the floor to become part of the measure. Amendments are prohibited on the Senate floor under the Act. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove a rule within 60 days before it takes effect. The committee may find little purpose in acting on amendments to a disapproval resolution due to restrictions on amendments on the floor. However, the committee could potentially report an amended version of the resolution as an original measure to expedite consideration under the Act. Amendments can only be recommended in committee and must be adopted on the floor to become part of the measure. Amendments are prohibited on the Senate floor under the Act. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove a rule within 60 days before it takes effect.

Amendments are prohibited on the Senate floor under the Act. The Congressional Review Act provides an expedited procedure in the Senate for considering a disapproval resolution, ensuring that the Senate can vote on the motion to proceed without facing obstacles like postponement, amendments, or reconsideration. Points of order against the measure are waived, and certain motions are prohibited to maintain the focus on the disapproval resolution. The Congressional Review Act does not explicitly make the disapproval resolution privileged, but Senate precedents indicate that a motion to consider a disapproval resolution is not debatable. This allows the Senate to continue and complete the process without facing obstacles like postponement or amendments. The Congressional Review Act allows the Senate to continue consideration of a disapproval resolution without interruptions or amendments. Once the motion to proceed is adopted, the resolution becomes the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of, and motions to consider other business or postpone the resolution are prohibited.

If the Act did not prohibit other intervening actions, opponents might delay a vote by offering motions to table the resolution and to adjourn. The Act ensures that both houses must agree to a measure in identical form before it can be presented to the President for approval. The Congressional Review Act allows both chambers to take final action on a disapproval resolution by holding it at the desk and voting on the resolution received from the other house. This ensures that both houses must agree on the same measure before it can be presented to the President for approval. The Congressional Review Act allows both houses to take final action on a disapproval resolution by voting on the resolution received from the other house, without amending it.

Joint resolutions of disapproval must be presented to the President for approval after passing Congress. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to pass joint resolutions disapproving of rules, which must be presented to the President for approval. If the President vetoes the resolution, a two-thirds vote in each house can override the veto. However, if a new administration takes office before congressional action, the rule may not be vetoed. This was seen in 2001 when Congress disapproved of an ergonomics regulation proposed by the Clinton Administration.

Coordination between the two houses is crucial to avoid issues in enacting disapproval resolutions. A disapproval resolution amended in this way would apparently cease to fulfill the requirements for a disapproval resolution to be eligible for the expedited procedure. When received in the other house, the amended resolution would then fail to qualify for the automatic hookup for which the Act provides. Instead, the second house could refer it to committee, which might either report it with or without amendment, or take no action and effectively kill the measure. The easiest way for supporters of disapproval to deal with this difficulty would be to prevent or defeat any amendment that would have this effect. The Congressional Review Act does not provide a procedure for one house to adopt a disapproval resolution from the other without first considering its own. This could create difficulties if a resolution is only submitted in one house or if resolutions are introduced in both houses but not acted upon. The Act does not have expedited procedures in the House, making it challenging for supporters of the disapproval resolution to move it forward. The Congressional Review Act does not have expedited procedures in the House for adopting a disapproval resolution from the other house. Supporters of the disapproval effort may need to ensure corresponding resolutions are submitted in both houses to prevent delays in consideration. In the 107th Congress, the House of Representatives took action on a disapproval resolution while its companion measure remained in committee. Cooperation from leadership was necessary for the House to act on the measure. Enacting a disapproval resolution would render the disapproved rule ineffective and prohibit the agency from issuing a similar rule. The House of Representatives took action on a disapproval resolution in the 107th Congress, rendering the disapproved rule ineffective and prohibiting the agency from issuing a similar rule without subsequent legislative authority."
