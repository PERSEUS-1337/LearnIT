    "content": "Congress has a long history of providing federal disaster assistance, dating back to 1803 when the 7th Congress passed legislation to aid residents of Portsmouth, NH after a fire. Over the years, Congress has expanded disaster assistance to individuals, businesses, and infrastructure for humanitarian reasons and to enhance interstate commerce. In the 1930s, legislation was passed to provide disaster loans for public facility repair and reconstruction, as well as funding for damaged highways and bridges. During the 1950s to the 1980s, Congress passed legislation to authorize federal disaster assistance programs, including funding for highways and bridges damaged by natural disasters, federal loans and tax assistance for individuals affected by disasters, and the establishment of the presidential disaster declaration process. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was created in 1979 to coordinate federal disaster relief efforts. Since the 1980s, Congress has overseen FEMA's disaster relief efforts and assessed the Stafford Act to meet current needs, including potential assistance after a terrorist attack. The Act allows the President to issue major disaster or emergency declarations for federal aid in response to such events. The Stafford Act allows the President to issue major disaster or emergency declarations for federal aid in response to catastrophic events. Emergency declarations are for a limited range of assistance and can be issued without a request from the state governor or tribal leader under specified conditions, such as terrorist incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing and the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon. Recent incidents like the mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando, as well as vehicular attacks in Nice and Ohio State University, have raised concerns about the Stafford Act's ability to provide assistance for terrorist attacks. Certain terror incidents may not meet the criteria of a major disaster due to legal definitions and the Act's focus on natural catastrophes. The criteria for a major disaster declaration in the United States is limited to incidents like fire, flood, or explosion, raising questions about whether a terror attack would qualify. Meeting the definition is necessary but not sufficient for receiving assistance, as the incident's cost must also exceed state and local government capacity. FEMA assesses damage costs, particularly to public infrastructure, comparing it to the state's population to determine eligibility for assistance. FEMA uses a \"per capita threshold\" to assess state and local government capacity for disaster declarations. Some argue that the Stafford Act's current framework is adequate for terrorism incidents that may not cause enough damage to qualify for major disaster assistance. Some argue that for terrorist incidents not causing enough damage for federal assistance, state and local governments and insurance should be the main sources of aid. They suggest that such incidents could still receive Stafford Act assistance under an emergency declaration, which allows for broader federal assistance in emergencies. An emergency declaration under the Stafford Act can provide various forms of assistance to individuals and households affected by a terrorist incident, including housing and grants through FEMA's Individuals and Household Program (IHP) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA) grants for medical, dental, and funeral expenses. Some argue that the wide range of assistance provided by a major disaster declaration is more suitable for most acts of terrorism. Some argue that the assistance provided under an emergency declaration is too limited, as it does not include the Crisis Counseling program or certain types of Small Business Administration disaster loans. Major disaster declarations offer more extensive assistance, including eligibility for disaster loans for homeowners, renters, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Additionally, major disaster declarations are seen as important symbolic gestures of federal support to states and localities. The Stafford Act requires major disaster declaration requests to be made by state governors or tribal leaders based on severity and magnitude of the incident. Requests include a letter to the President with supplemental material and information about the incident, specifying types of federal assistance needed. Preliminary Damage Assessments (PDAs) provide damage estimates for public infrastructure and households, crucial for FEMA's evaluation. FEMA compares damage estimates to state population to recommend major disaster declaration if damages exceed $1.42 per capita. Emergency declaration requests follow similar procedures but do not have specific formulas like the per capita threshold. FEMA evaluates severity and magnitude to recommend emergency declarations to the President. The ultimate decision to declare and grant federal assistance for emergencies and major disasters rests solely with the President. An incident must meet three criteria for a major disaster declaration: definition, unmet need, and state action. The Stafford Act defines a major disaster as any natural catastrophe or any fire, flood, or explosion in the U.S. that causes severe damage warranting assistance to supplement state efforts. The definition of a major disaster can be applied prescriptively or open to interpretation, with certain incidents eligible for federal assistance under the Stafford Act. The list of natural disasters may be seen as open-ended, while human-caused incidents are limited to \"fire, flood, or explosion.\" The interpretation of the definition may limit certain incidents from receiving assistance. The definition of a major disaster under the Stafford Act may limit incidents from receiving federal assistance, with the President having discretion in determining eligibility. Incidents must exceed state and local capabilities to qualify for a major disaster declaration. Under the Stafford Act, the Governor of the affected state must request a declaration by the President for a major disaster when the disaster surpasses state and local resources. FEMA evaluates the severity of the damage based on factors like cost, impacts, insurance coverage, mitigation efforts, previous disasters, and other federal aid programs to determine the need for federal assistance. The estimated cost of assistance is crucial as it includes the per capita threshold and unmet needs of families and individuals. Attacks like the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting and the 2015 San Bernardino shooting had high fatalities but low damages to public infrastructure, making it challenging to reach the per capita threshold. States must implement their emergency plans, allocate resources, and agree to cost-sharing requirements to qualify for major disaster assistance. The Governor must provide information on state and local resources committed to disaster relief and certify compliance with cost-sharing requirements. An incident must meet three criteria to qualify for a disaster declaration. Assistance for a disaster declaration includes Public Assistance, Individual Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Assistance. Mitigation Assistance (HMA) focuses on repairing infrastructure damage, while Individual Assistance (IA) helps families with temporary housing and grants for post-disaster needs. HMA provides grant funding for mitigation projects, which can be identified before a disaster declaration. FEMA does not exclusively handle all disaster response and recovery operations, as the President can direct federal agencies to support state and local efforts. When a disaster is declared, FEMA coordinates federal agencies through Mission Assignments to support state and local response efforts. FEMA reimburses agencies for activities through the Disaster Relief Fund. Major disaster declarations activate the Small Business Administration Disaster Loan Program. The Small Business Administration (SBA) Disaster Loan Program offers three main types of loans for disaster-related losses: Home and Personal Property Disaster Loans, Business Physical Disaster Loans, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL). Home Physical Disaster Loans provide up to $200,000 for primary residence repairs, Personal Property Loans offer up to $40,000 for replacing personal items, and Business Physical Disaster Loans provide up to $2 million for businesses and nonprofits to repair or replace property. EIDLs offer up to $2 million to help with financial obligations and operating expenses. Loan proceeds are for working capital to alleviate economic injury and resume normal operations. SBA disaster loans provide financial assistance to businesses and organizations to alleviate economic injury and resume operations. Private non-profit organizations are eligible for SBA physical disaster loans and EIDLs. SBA disaster loans are often the only federal assistance available to businesses after a terror attack. Emergency disaster declarations require meeting specific criteria, including definition, unmet need, and state action. FEMA does not provide assistance to the private sector after a disaster. The Stafford Act allows for federal assistance in emergencies to supplement State and local efforts to save lives and protect property. This includes situations like terrorist attacks or nontraditional incidents. The Act's procedure for emergency declarations can be useful in cases involving federal property or programs. The President can exercise authority under section 502 or 503 in emergencies where the primary responsibility for response lies with the United States. Consultation with affected state Governors is required if possible. This authority is rarely used but could allow for swift action, especially in cases of terrorism. Emergency declarations can later be converted to major disaster declarations. Section 501(b) has been invoked three times. The use of Section 501(b) for major disaster declarations is rare and has been invoked only three times: the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia explosion, and the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Pentagon. It is debated whether this authority should be limited to federal responsibilities or used in all terrorist incidents regardless of location. Section 501(b) of the Stafford Act allows the President to act quickly without waiting for a gubernatorial request for assistance. Concerns exist about its potential overuse in terrorism-related situations, leading to an expansion of federal assistance. Requests for emergency declarations must be made by the Governor based on the severity and magnitude of the situation exceeding state and local capabilities. In certain circumstances, federal assistance may be necessary without a gubernatorial or tribal request. The President can issue an emergency declaration independently. The state or tribal nation must implement its emergency plan, allocate resources, and agree to cost-sharing requirements for federal aid. The Governor must take appropriate action under State law and describe state and local efforts to alleviate the emergency. An emergency declaration may be issued by the President based on a Governor's request, if specific criteria are met. Emergency declarations allow for essential services and activities to be carried out to reduce future damage, but provide less assistance than a major disaster declaration. Repair and replacement of public infrastructure or nonprofit facilities are not covered under emergency declarations. Emergency declarations under the Stafford Act allow the President to direct federal agencies to support state and local response efforts. Housing assistance and SBA disaster loans can be provided under an emergency declaration, although usually on a limited basis. SBA disaster loans are typically available only to private, non-profit organizations. SBA disaster loans are generally only available to private, non-profit organizations for \"PA-only\" declarations, which may be seen as a limitation for businesses like malls, movie theaters, or nightclubs. The section discusses past terror attacks that received federal assistance under the Stafford Act, including the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting. The San Bernardino and Ohio State attacks are not included as Stafford Act declarations were not requested. Table 1 compares each incident, noting that in all but one case, the declaration was issued on the same day. An emergency declaration was issued to Oklahoma for the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building Bombing on April 19, 1995\u2014the day of the bombing. FEMA's Urban Search and Rescue teams were deployed, and debris removal began despite the area being a FBI crime scene. Director James Lee Witt highlighted the challenges of response operations in such a unique environment. Lee Witt explained the conflict between the search and rescue teams and the FBI during the aftermath of the bombing on April 19, 1995. A major disaster declaration was issued, allowing for the activation of the Crisis Counseling program to help survivors. FEMA's aid was limited due to the majority of damage being to federal facilities. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, a major disaster declaration was issued for New York and Virginia. The government allocated $40 billion for recovery and security measures, including aid to families, businesses, and transportation safety. FEMA approved 163 disaster loans totaling $7.3 million, with the majority going towards individual and family assistance. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, $20 billion was allocated for recovery efforts in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. FEMA provided urban search and rescue teams, debris removal, crisis counseling, and housing aid. In New York, FEMA's expenditures surpassed $8.7 billion, while in Virginia, aid was mainly for families and individuals. The SBA Disaster Loan Program was triggered, with 6,384 loans approved in New York totaling roughly $551 million. In Virginia, SBA approved 256 loans for $31 million, including one business loan for $125,500 and 255 EIDL loans. An emergency declaration was issued to Massachusetts on April 17, 2013, after the Boston Marathon Bombing, leading to a large manhunt and eventual capture of the perpetrators. FEMA provided Category B emergency protective measures in response to the incident. FEMA provided Category B emergency protective measures and Public Assistance for Norfolk and Suffolk counties following the Boston Marathon Bombing. The incident period was extended from April 15 to April 22, 2013, with FEMA covering 75% of eligible costs totaling over $6 million. State and local agencies in Massachusetts were authorized to use preparedness grant funding for law enforcement and first responder overtime costs related to the investigation and security measures. SBA approved four EIDL loans for $214,300 in response to the Boston Marathon Bombing. Florida Governor Rick Scott requested $5 million for emergency protective measures after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. The President denied the request for assistance. The President denied Florida Governor Rick Scott's request for $5 million in emergency protective measures after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, citing that the request did not demonstrate the need for federal assistance beyond the state and local governments' capabilities to save lives and protect property. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate stated that an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act is only appropriate when federal assistance is necessary to supplement state and local efforts in response to a catastrophe. The request for an emergency declaration was denied for the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. FEMA approved reallocating funds for overtime costs in Florida. SBA provided Economic Injury Disaster Loans for the attack. The debate over the scope of government assistance for terrorism victims under the Stafford Act includes questions about fiscal responsibility and the role of the federal government. Some argue for assistance in all terrorism cases, while others believe it should only be provided for incidents meeting specific criteria. The definition of a major disaster plays a key role in determining eligibility for assistance. The definition of a major disaster in the Federal Disaster Relief Act of 1950 includes natural disasters and human-caused incidents that warrant federal disaster assistance. The debate over government assistance for terrorism victims under the Stafford Act revolves around the scope of assistance and eligibility criteria. Congress expanded the definition of a major disaster in the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 to include various incidents such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and more, that cause significant damage warranting federal assistance. The governor of a state or the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia must certify the need for disaster assistance and assure the expenditure of funds for the same purpose. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 expanded the definition of a major disaster to include incidents like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes. The definition was amended in 1988 to limit human-caused incidents from receiving federal assistance. Congress amended the definition of a major disaster in 1988 to exclude human-caused incidents from federal assistance, broadening the scope to cover natural catastrophes. The expansion of legislative intent in the administration of the Disaster Relief Act has raised congressional concerns. The Stafford Act was not designed to address non-natural catastrophes, leading to strain on programs meant for natural disasters. Congress amended the definition of a major disaster in 1988 to exclude human-caused incidents from federal assistance, causing concerns about the act's ability to respond to social issues. Governor Rick Snyder's request for a major disaster declaration for the Flint water contamination incident was not granted due to the specificity of the amended definition. The FEMA Administrator denied Governor Snyder's request for a major disaster declaration for the Flint water contamination incident, stating it did not meet the legal definition of a major disaster as it was not caused by a natural disaster. The strict enumeration of human-caused incidents in the definition raised concerns about eligibility for federal assistance. The FEMA Administrator denied Governor Snyder's request for a major disaster declaration for the Flint water contamination incident, stating it did not meet the legal definition of a major disaster as it was not caused by a natural disaster. Concerns were raised about eligibility for federal assistance due to the strict enumeration of human-caused incidents in the definition. Some argue that incidents could be recast to fit the definition, such as by interpreting firing a gun or releasing gas as a type of explosion. An example of this was seen in the unsuccessful appeal of the Flint water contamination incident. The unique disaster in Flint does not meet the legal definition of a major disaster under 42 U.S.C. \u00a75122. It poses imminent and long-term threats to citizens, requiring special consideration for assistance programs. The disaster, similar to a flood, caused infrastructure damage through lead contamination in water, raising concerns about broad interpretations leading to \"declaration creep.\" The definition of a major disaster under 42 U.S.C. \u00a75122 may not cover incidents like the one in Flint, which caused lead contamination in water. There is a debate on whether incidents without fire or explosions should be considered major disasters or emergency declarations. Congress could consider amending the definition to explicitly include terrorism to ensure incidents like these receive federal assistance. Multiple U.S. governmental agencies have different definitions of terrorism, leading to a lack of consensus. The definition of terrorism varies among U.S. governmental agencies, with some requiring political motivation while others do not. This discrepancy can impact the eligibility for Stafford Act assistance. One suggestion is to expand the types of assistance available under emergency declarations instead of amending the definition. For example, crisis counseling and SBA disaster loans could be made available to address a wider range of events. Expanding types of assistance under emergency declarations could address events with high casualties but little infrastructure damage. Concerns exist that FEMA may not recommend a major disaster declaration for terrorism incidents below the $1.42 per capita threshold, potentially excluding incidents like the Orlando Pulse nightclub attack. Damage to businesses is not considered in the threshold calculation. In formulating the per capita threshold for disaster assistance, businesses are not considered, leading to challenges for populous states like Illinois in meeting the threshold despite significant damage to rural communities. Some argue that loss of life should have more weight in FEMA's declaration recommendations, especially for events like terror attacks with limited infrastructure damage. If Congress is concerned about the per capita threshold for disaster declaration, they could consider using the value of statistical life (VSL) to assess the monetary value of fatalities in incidents like terror attacks. This objective criteria could help determine if federal assistance is warranted, although some may question the need to alter the current threshold. Some may argue that adjusting the per capita threshold for disaster declaration is unnecessary as FEMA already considers damage and the President makes the final decision. Highly populated states with a higher tax base could fund their recovery without federal assistance. Congress limited the President's authority for human-caused incidents but may need to reconsider for emergency declarations. The definition of an emergency in the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 was broadened, giving the President more discretion to issue emergency declarations, especially in response to acts of terrorism. FEMA does not use a per capita threshold formula for emergency declaration recommendations, making them more suitable for certain types of terror attacks like mass shootings. Some argue that there is no need to change the Stafford Act to make it easier for \"soft target\" attacks to receive a major disaster declaration. Some may question the decision to issue an emergency declaration for terror attacks, as it is easier to obtain than a major disaster declaration. Governor Rick Scott expressed disappointment over the denial of an emergency declaration for the Orlando shooting, calling it the deadliest in U.S. history. He criticized President Obama for not defining it as an emergency and urged for federal assistance. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 broadened the definition of emergencies, giving the President more discretion to issue declarations, especially for acts of terrorism. FEMA does not use a per capita threshold for emergency recommendations, making them suitable for mass shootings. There are debates on whether the Stafford Act needs to be changed to make it easier for \"soft target\" attacks to receive major disaster declarations. Some incidents, such as the 2016 Flint Water crisis and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, have received emergency declarations in the past. There are debates on why the Pulse nightclub shooting did not receive the same treatment. Assistance under emergency declarations is limited primarily to governmental entities, with some temporary housing and Other Needs Assistance available. Critics argue that the Stafford Act may need to be revised to provide more comprehensive assistance, especially for mental health support. The Stafford Act provides limited assistance under emergency declarations, with mental health support not covered. Congress could consider expanding assistance for terror attacks, including SBA disaster loans. This section explores how SBA Disaster Loan programs could aid businesses, individuals, and households after a terrorist attack. The SBA Disaster Loan Program provides federal funding to assist businesses, individuals, and households following a terrorist attack. It offers support through presidential and SBA declarations, making disaster loans available for recovery activities. The type of declaration determines the loans available, including assistance for businesses, individuals, and households. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers federal funding for businesses, individuals, and households after a terrorist attack. Different types of declarations determine the available loans, including Home and Personal Property Disaster Loans, Business Physical Disaster Loans, and EIDL for economic injury. In response to a terror attack, SBA disaster loans may be available through a gubernatorial request for assistance, allowing private nonprofit entities in the disaster area to qualify for loans. Disaster loans are not available to renters and homeowners under this type of declaration. SBA disaster loans are available to eligible homeowners, renters, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in the disaster area or contiguous counties. EIDL may also be available under this declaration. The SBA Administrator can issue an EIDL declaration based on a governor's certification of substantial economic injury to at least five small businesses. Small agricultural cooperatives and private nonprofit organizations in the disaster area are eligible for SBA disaster loans under this declaration. The SBA Administrator issues an EIDL declaration for economic injury. Loans cannot be used to repair damages from a terror attack but for working capital to alleviate economic injury. Different types of loans are available depending on the declaration type. Congress could consider making all SBA disaster loan types available after a terror attack for certain declarations. The SBA Disaster Loan Program provides assistance for economic injury, not physical damage from a terror attack. Congress may consider expanding loan availability for certain declarations. Additionally, the HUD's CDBG program offers grants for recovery efforts after a disaster, focusing on low- and moderate-income areas. Congress can provide supplemental appropriations for CDBG to address unmet disaster needs. Congress has authorized supplemental appropriations of funds through the CDBG program in response to terror attacks. For example, after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, $12 million in CDBG funding was allocated for economic development activities. Following the September 11 attacks, $700 million in CDBG funding was provided to New York for assistance to damaged properties and businesses. After the September 11 attacks, Congress allocated $2 billion in CDBG assistance to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation for economic revitalization. An additional $783 million was later appropriated to New York for the city's economic recovery efforts, including financial assistance to properties and businesses. These funds were used for infrastructure redevelopment and economic revitalization activities. CDBG disaster assistance is funded through supplemental funding, provided by Congress when disaster needs exceed annual appropriations. This typically occurs after large incidents like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, as Congress must debate and pass supplemental funding. Funding for CDBG disaster assistance is not available for all incidents, potentially excluding smaller terror incidents. The need for supplemental funding for CDBG disaster assistance may hinder smaller terror incidents from receiving aid promptly. One suggestion is to fund CDBG disaster assistance through annual appropriations to expedite the process. Congress could explore ways to provide assistance to businesses affected by terrorist incidents through major disaster or emergency declarations. Critics may argue the need to determine specific circumstances for implementing this approach. Some argue that changing the process for CDBG disaster assistance to annual appropriations could shift determinations to a federal agency, potentially increasing federal expenditures. Questions arise about using the Stafford Act for terror incidents with high casualties and limited damage, as it primarily focuses on recovery efforts. Creating a permanent CDBG program for disaster assistance could open the gateway for smaller incidents to receive aid. The existing Stafford Act authorities primarily focus on recovery efforts for damaged buildings and infrastructure. FEMA's assistance includes the Other Needs Assistance (ONA) grant program, which can cover funeral expenses, but private insurance may already meet those needs. Expanding ONA to cover additional costs after a family member's death and including emergency health care costs for the uninsured after a terrorist event could be beneficial. However, beyond these areas, little of FEMA's assistance programs would apply. Various approaches have been outlined to address perceived gaps in assistance following a terrorist event. The Stafford Act may need amending to include terrorist attacks for major disaster assistance, but some believe its current structure is sufficient. The decision will be influenced by federal costs and views on the government's role in addressing terrorism. Concerns exist about amending the Act for soft target and nonconventional terror attacks. Some believe amending the Stafford Act to include terrorist attacks for major disaster assistance could shift financial burden to the federal government. Others argue that federal assistance should only be provided when state and local financial capacity is lacking."
