    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2010\" and includes amendments to the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances such as 5a-Androstan-3,6,17-trione and Androst-4-ene-3,6,17-trione. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances such as 3b,17b-diol, 4-chloro-17a-methyl-17b-hydroxy-androst-4-en-3-one, 4-chloro-17a-methyl-17b-hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,11-dione, and other similar compounds. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances such as 3b-hydroxy-androst-4-en-17-one, 3b-hydroxy-estr-4-en-17-one, 3b-hydroxy-estra-4,9,11-trien-17-one, 17a-methyl-androst-2-ene-3,17b-diol, and other similar compounds. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances such as 3b-hydroxy-androst-4-en-17-one, 3b-hydroxy-estr-4-en-17-one, 3b-hydroxy-estra-4,9,11-trien-17-one, 17a-methyl-androst-2-ene-3,17b-diol, and other similar compounds. Additionally, new drug or hormonal substances derived from or structurally similar to anabolic steroids are also included in the amendment. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances like anabolic steroids listed in subparagraph (A), which are considered to be anabolic steroids if created with the intent of promoting muscle growth or causing a pharmacological effect similar to testosterone. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow the Attorney General to temporarily schedule new anabolic steroids that meet specific criteria. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow the Attorney General to temporarily schedule new anabolic steroids to prevent their unlawful importation, manufacture, distribution, or dispensing. The order issued shall not take effect until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, and may expire within 24 months, with a possible 6-month extension. The Attorney General can issue a temporary scheduling order for new anabolic steroids under the Controlled Substances Act, which may last up to 24 months with a 6-month extension. This order can be replaced by a permanent scheduling order, and is not subject to judicial review. The Attorney General can also issue a permanent order adding a substance to the list of anabolic steroids if it meets the criteria. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include labeling requirements for anabolic steroids. It is unlawful to import, export, manufacture, distribute, dispense, sell, or offer to sell anabolic steroids with false labeling. The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the possession, distribution, or sale of anabolic steroids without proper labeling. Products with approved applications are exempt from this requirement if labeled according to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Criminal penalties apply for violations. The Criminal Penalties for violating the Controlled Substances Act regarding anabolic steroids include imprisonment of up to 10 years and fines up to $500,000 for individuals and $250,000 for entities. The United States Code imposes criminal penalties of up to $500,000 for individuals and $2,500,000 for entities for violating the Controlled Substances Act regarding anabolic steroids. Civil penalties for violations include fines of up to $500,000 per violation for importers, exporters, manufacturers, or distributors, and up to $25,000 per violation for retail sales. Retail sales violating the Controlled Substances Act can result in civil penalties of up to $25,000 per violation. Each sale or product offered for sale is considered a separate violation. Continued offers to sell after written notice can lead to additional violations. Violating with a product on the specified list incurs double the civil penalty. The term 'product' refers to a discrete article prepared for sale. The Attorney General may collect data to identify products containing anabolic steroids and publish a list of non-compliant products. Each package or differently labeled article is considered a separate product. The Attorney General can identify products with anabolic steroids and publish a list of non-compliant products. The absence of a product from the list does not prove it does not contain an anabolic steroid. The Sentencing Commission Guidelines are outlined in Section 3. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines for offenses involving anabolic steroids, including those not in traditional forms like tablets or capsules. The guidelines will be updated to base sentences on the entire weight of the mixture or substance for such cases. The United States Sentencing Commission will update sentencing guidelines for anabolic steroid offenses to ensure penalties are consistent regardless of the form of the substance. Additional actions may be taken to enforce this Act. The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration will report to Congress every 2 years on anabolic steroids scheduled temporarily under the Act and the reasons for such scheduling."
