Worker Paycheck Fairness findings are outlined in Title II.\" The Congress recognizes that workers should not be required to pay dues supporting non-essential activities of labor organizations. Many workers lack information about how their dues are used for activities beyond collective bargaining. Workers who pay dues or fees often lack information about their rights and how labor organizations spend their money. It is important for individuals to have the right to make informed choices about the causes they support. The purpose of this title is to ensure workers have information about their rights regarding dues to labor organizations and the use of employee dues. It also aims to protect workers' right to make informed choices about causes they support. Written consent is required. The labor organization must obtain prior, voluntary, written authorization from employees for any dues or fees used for activities not necessary for representing employees in labor-management issues. The authorization must clearly state that it is not mandatory and that any fees paid may be used for non-essential activities. An authorization for non-essential activities by a labor organization remains valid until revoked with 30 days notice. Violations result in liability for damages to affected employees. The labor organization can be held liable for damages and equitable relief in federal or state court by employees or a group of employees. The court may also award attorney's fees and other costs to the plaintiff in addition to any judgment. An action can be brought within 2 years after the employee knew or should have known about dues or fees misuse by a labor organization, extending to 3 years for willful violations. SEC. 204. NOTICE: Employers with union-represented employees must post a notice informing them that any dues or fees collected by the union require prior written authorization if used for non-essential activities.

The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 requires labor organizations to comply with written requests for complete copies of reports or documents filed under section 201. SEC. 206 prohibits labor organizations from retaliating against employees for exercising their rights. SEC. 207 mandates the Secretary of Labor to create necessary regulations within specific timeframes. SEC. 208 states the effective dates for different sections of the title."
