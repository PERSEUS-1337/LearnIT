    "content": "The \"Portable Generator Safety Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section highlights key points related to portable generator safety. Congress finds that portable generators emit carbon monoxide gas, leading to numerous preventable injuries and deaths. Over 260 deaths related to carbon monoxide poisoning from generators were reported from 2000 to 2006, with 32 deaths in the last three months of 2006 alone. Consumers often lack awareness of the hazards posed by these generators. Since 1997, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has aimed to reduce injuries and deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning. However, current labeling standards for portable generators are insufficient in protecting consumers from harm. Implementing mandatory safety standards and warning labels for portable generator carbon monoxide could significantly decrease the risk of injury or death. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will require all portable generators to be equipped with carbon monoxide interlock safety devices within 180 days. These devices will detect carbon monoxide levels and automatically shut off the generator to prevent serious harm or death. Additionally, labeling and instruction requirements will be implemented. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will mandate warning labels on portable generators to alert consumers about the carbon monoxide hazard within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The labels must be prominently displayed in English and Spanish, with the word \"DANGER\" in at least 1-inch tall font. Portable generators should be used outdoors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. Each generator must have a pictogram warning of the gas's harmful effects, and instruction manuals should include clear safety statements. Portable generators emit carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas that is odorless and deadly. To prevent poisoning, generators should only be operated outdoors, away from windows, garages, and air intakes. It is crucial never to use generators indoors, even with ventilation, as symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure include feeling sick, dizzy, or weak. If these symptoms occur, shut off the generator, move to fresh air, and seek medical help. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a public outreach program within 180 days of this Act to educate consumers about the dangers of carbon monoxide emissions from portable generators, with a focus on the start of each hurricane season."
