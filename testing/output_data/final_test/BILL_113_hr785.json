    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Halt Index Trading of Energy Commodities (HITEC) Act\". The Congress notes a significant increase in investment in commodities markets, with futures contracts traded in the US growing from 630,000,000 in 1998 to over 3,200,000,000 in 2007. Speculators now own 70% of all open commodity futures contracts, a reversal from the past where physical hedgers held 70%. The surge in speculation is mainly due to trading of commodity index funds. Investment in commodity index funds has surged in the last 2 decades, with net long positions reaching over $160 billion in February 2012. Institutional clients like pension funds and universities are among the investors in these funds. The surge in investment in commodity index funds over the last 2 decades, with net long positions exceeding $160 billion in February 2012, has attracted institutional clients like pension funds and universities. The majority of investors in these funds do not use the commodities involved but aim to profit from their value increase through rolling practices, leading to increased market volatility and higher prices for commodities like crude oil. Excessive speculation in commodity index funds has led to higher retail prices for citizens, with oil prices potentially inflated by $1 per gallon. This has negatively impacted economic growth and consumer wallets, hindering the nation's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Congress has taken steps to regulate commodity trading but more action is needed to limit positions in the commodities markets. Congress believes immediate action is necessary to ban commodity index trading in energy commodities due to elevated oil prices. SEC. 3. PREVENTION OF EXCESSIVE SPECULATION IN ENERGY COMMODITIES.
