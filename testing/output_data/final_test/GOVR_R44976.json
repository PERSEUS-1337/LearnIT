    "content": "A business incurs a Net Operating Loss (NOL) when its taxable income is negative, known as a \"loss year.\" NOL can be used to obtain a tax refund for past years or reduce future taxes. It can be carried back for up to two years or carried forward for up to 20 years, with exceptions for certain losses like casualty or disaster-related. Net Operating Loss (NOL) can be carried back three years for theft or disaster losses, five years for farming losses, and 10 years for specified liability losses. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) cannot carry back an NOL but can carry it forward for up to 20 years. To carry back a loss, a taxpayer must file an amended income tax return or an application for a tentative refund. The taxpayer recalculates their tax liability for the earliest eligible carryback year by claiming the loss as part of that year's tax deductions. To carry a loss forward, a taxpayer claims the loss as a deduction against future income on their tax return, thus reducing the tax owed. A taxpayer may irrevocably waive the carryback period. Valuing a future tax reduction requires discounting the tax savings to determine its \"present,\" or economic, value. The economic value of carrying back a loss exceeds carrying it forward. A carryback provides a tax refund, while a carryforward reduces tax liability in the future. The ability to offset income with losses dates back to the Revenue Act of 1918, allowing for one-year carryback and carryforward periods. The current NOL regime, established in 1997, shortened the carryback period to two years and extended the carryforward period to 20 years. The NOL regime, established in 1997, shortened the carryback period from three years to two and extended the carryforward period from 15 years to 20 years. Changes to the carryback period since 1997 have involved temporary extensions or targeted provisions, such as those in response to the financial crisis. For example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allowed business taxpayers with $15 million or less in gross receipts to extend the NOL carryback period for up to five years. The NOL regime, established in 1997, shortened the carryback period from three years to two and extended the carryforward period from 15 years to 20 years. Changes to the carryback period since 1997 have involved temporary extensions or targeted provisions, such as those in response to the financial crisis. For example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allowed business taxpayers with $15 million or less in gross receipts to extend the NOL carryback period for up to five years. The extension was intended to assist businesses through the 2001 recession and in response to the destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 extended the carryback period from two to five years for qualified losses occurring in the Gulf Opportunity Zone.

Changes to the carryback period since 1997 have involved temporary extensions or targeted provisions.

The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 extended the carryback period from two to five years for qualified losses in the Gulf Opportunity Zone. This allows for income smoothing through NOL carrybacks. Firm B can reduce its total tax liability by carrying back its year-two NOL. By recalculating its year-one tax liability, the firm can receive a partial refund for taxes paid in year one. This results in Firm B having the same total tax liability as Firm A. Firm B's total tax liability is $17.5 million, the same as Firm A, due to carrying back its loss to smooth income. Carrybacks are more valuable than carryforwards, as shown by the example of Firm B's $25 million loss. If carried forward, it would reduce year-three taxes by $8.75 million, but if carried back, it would receive a refund of $8.75 million. The economic value of an $8.75 million reduction in taxes one year in the future is determined by its present value, which is calculated based on the return on investment. The present value of an $8.75 million refund in taxes from carrying the loss back is simply $8.75 million. Firm B prefers to carry its loss back for an $8.75 million refund in taxes received immediately. Carrying losses forward may be necessary for firms with little recent income. Policymakers may consider extending the carryback period to help smooth out changes in business income and taxes over the business cycle. Extending the carryback period would enhance income smoothing by offsetting losses against past profits, but increase revenue losses. Economic theory suggests indefinite extension could minimize tax distortion on investments, increasing efficiency. It would reduce tax burden on risky investments, sharing risk with the government and potentially boosting investment. Extending the NOL carryback period could shift private risk to the government, potentially increasing economic efficiency. However, practical limitations may prevent indefinite carrybacks due to negative revenue effects, especially during economic downturns. Encouraging risky investments is generally beneficial, but during economic booms, additional incentives may be unnecessary and inefficient. Extending the carryback period could help businesses smooth their incomes. Extending the NOL carryback period to match the typical business cycle duration could enhance income smoothing and risk reduction for businesses. Allowing losses to accrue interest until claimed in the future could increase the value of carrying losses forward. The government could consider allowing losses to accrue interest at market rate to create parity between loss carrybacks and carryforwards. New businesses and financially struggling firms may not benefit from carrying losses forward if they have no income or low probability of generating income in the future. House Speaker Paul Ryan's \"A Better Way\" blueprint proposes eliminating the loss carryback period and allowing losses to be carried forward indefinitely with interest accrual. The proposal in the tax reform framework includes eliminating the loss carryback period and allowing losses to be carried forward indefinitely with interest accrual. This could negatively impact some firms' ability to smooth income or address cash-flow problems, potentially increasing effective tax rates for affected businesses. Congress could consider allowing taxpayers to receive a tax refund in the year losses were incurred as an alternative to the carryback and carryforward regime. Taxpayers could receive a tax refund in the year losses were incurred, aligning the treatment of losses with other expenses. Allowing refunds for losses is seen as the opposite of taxing profits when realized, presenting tradeoffs for startups and financially struggling businesses. Financially struggling firms and startups could benefit more from loss refunds than the current carryback/carryforward system. Refunding losses would provide immediate benefits instead of waiting to deduct losses in the future. However, this could lead to significant revenue losses. Implementing a refund system would require determining the tax rate at which losses would be valued, with one option being a flat 35% refund for most corporations. Pass-through entities could have a varied refund structure. Refunding losses for pass-through entities could have varied structures, with income taxed at individual rates. Setting a flat refund rate for all taxpayers may lead to tax sheltering. Anti-abuse provisions similar to passive activity loss limits could help prevent abuse. Establishing a business on paper is easy, but without safeguards, there could be attempts to generate paper losses for tax offsetting purposes."
