    "content": "Many states have voter ID requirements for casting a ballot, with some requiring a photo ID and others accepting nonphoto IDs or no ID at all. The flexibility, allowed documents, exceptions, and recourse for noncompliance vary across states. Photo ID requirements have been a significant policy debate topic. This report provides an updated overview of state requirements for voters to present some form of ID before casting a ballot in a federal election. Thirty-two states require voters to show an ID to cast a ballot at a polling place, with some states permitting alternatives to photo IDs. Fourteen states allow voters to present non-photo IDs like voter registration cards, utility bills, or bank statements. Some states require voter ID but accept non-photo documents. The report discusses differences in voter ID requirements among states and recent developments in voter identification policy debates. The National Commission on Federal Election Reform, known as the \"Carter-Ford Commission,\" recommended improving voter identification verification at polling places by requiring official identification for voter registration and casting ballots. The Carter-Ford Commission recommended improving voter identification verification by requiring official identification for voter registration and casting ballots, citing the need to protect the sanctity of the franchise. This recommendation was incorporated into the Help America Vote Act in 2002, which includes requirements for states on voting systems, voter information, provisional voting, and voter registration. Title III of the Help America Vote Act in 2002 requires states to maintain a single list of registered voters accessible to all election officials. It also includes a voter identification requirement for individuals registering to vote by mail for the first time, who must provide a valid photo ID or other documents with their name and address. This requirement does not apply to those registering under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 requires states to maintain a single list of registered voters and includes a voter identification requirement. A voter can submit a provisional ballot if they do not provide required documentation, which will be counted if deemed eligible by election officials. States are allowed to have stricter election administration requirements than those imposed by the act. After the Help America Vote Act of 2002, states implemented voter ID laws, with some even stricter than the federal requirements. The Carter-Baker Commission recommended states to adopt voter ID requirements, including a photo ID meeting REAL ID Act standards, provided at no cost to voters. Some members of the commission found the recommendation for free voter IDs troublesome, similar to concerns about stringent photo ID requirements. A bill from the 109th Congress proposed federal photo ID requirements for voting in federal elections, including proof of citizenship and a 48-hour deadline for presenting ID for provisional ballots. The 109th Congress proposed federal photo ID requirements for voting, including proof of citizenship and a 48-hour deadline for presenting ID for provisional ballots. Public opinion surveys show majority support for requiring a photo ID to vote, with discussions on balancing voter fraud prevention and voter rights. Several states have adopted similar voter ID requirements. According to surveys, overall support for voter ID has decreased from over 80% in 2006 to about 75% in 2014. A Pew Research Center survey found that 98% of respondents had the necessary identification. A Washington Post poll showed that about half of respondents believed voter fraud was a major problem in presidential elections, while 40% believed voter suppression was a major issue. Overall, surveys show a decrease in support for voter ID from over 80% in 2006 to about 75% in 2014. A poll revealed that about half of respondents viewed voter fraud as a major issue in presidential elections, while 40% saw voter suppression as a major problem. Respondents were evenly split on whether vote fraud or voter denial was a bigger concern. Awareness of evidence on voter fraud occurrence and responses to different types of photo ID were not addressed in the surveys. These policy concerns continue to be debated. Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress contain provisions pertaining to voter ID, with some promoting or protecting voter ID requirements and others seeking to modify, restrict, or eliminate such requirements. H.R. 885, for example, would shield voter ID requirements from certain challenges by amending Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Several bills in the 114th Congress address voter ID requirements. H.R. 2867 and S. 1659 aim to restrict voter ID use by amending the VRA to require preclearance for state changes to voter ID requirements. H.R. 3277 seeks to eliminate voter ID requirements altogether, while H.R. 3364 would require states to provide an alternative to voter ID, allowing voters to sign a sworn statement attesting to their identity. The bill would require states to make preprinted statements available to absentee voters and at the polls, prohibit requiring a voter who presents the form to vote a provisional ballot, and restrict voter ID requirements by prohibiting a voter ID that has an associated cost. Additionally, S. 1912 would allow tribal identification cards to be accepted as valid for voter ID purposes. The curr_chunk discusses the varying voter ID requirements across states, with 32 states requiring ID before voting and the rest having nondocument requirements. The information is organized into five categories based on document ID, voter's photograph, and ID requirements. The varying voter ID requirements across states are described in tables based on document ID, voter's photograph, and enforcement. States may differ in how strictly they enforce ID requirements, impacting a voter's ability to cast a ballot. In 13 states, strict photo ID requirements are enforced at polling places, while 4 states require nonphoto ID. Other states allow alternative means of identification, such as signing an affidavit or providing a nonphoto ID, with the option to cast a provisional ballot if necessary. In Georgia and Indiana, strict photo ID requirements were enacted in 2003 and 2005, respectively. North Dakota implemented a similar requirement in 2015. Oregon and Washington conduct mail-in elections, with Washington requiring a photo ID or signature for in-person voting, while Oregon uses signature verification for both mail-in and in-person ballots. Some states with strict ID laws provide exceptions for certain voters. Some states with ID requirements provide exceptions for certain voters, such as Kansas allowing religious objections to photo ID and Alabama and Missouri allowing voters without IDs to cast regular ballots with affidavit signatures from election officials. States with less strict ID laws, like Florida and South Carolina, allow provisional ballots without ID to be counted under certain conditions. In states with photo ID requirements, voters can submit a ballot with a \"reasonable impediment\" declaration. Sixteen states had photo ID requirements for the 2014 federal election, with Wisconsin and North Dakota enacting theirs in 2015. Arkansas and Pennsylvania's requirements were rejected by state courts. Table A-1 in the Appendix details the photo ID requirements for 19 states. In 14 states, voters must provide identification, either a photo or nonphoto ID. Approximately 60% of voters live in states with voter ID requirements, with 30% in photo ID states and 20% in nonphoto ID states. Around 30% live in states with strictly enforced voter ID requirements. Most states accept driver's licenses or state-issued IDs, and all but one state accept a U.S. passport or federal photo ID. Some states require IDs to show the voter's address. In several states, voter ID requirements vary, with some states specifying acceptable IDs like tribal IDs. The range of authorized IDs is broad, including employee, neighborhood association, public assistance, retirement center, and student IDs, among others. Each state has unique ID requirements, with some requiring IDs to show the voter's address. Some states have specific voter ID requirements, including a wide range of acceptable IDs such as birth certificates, Social Security cards, and utility bills. Each state has its own unique ID requirements, with some states only accepting a narrow range of documents. Some states have specific voter ID requirements, with a narrow range of acceptable IDs like driver's licenses or state-issued IDs. Free IDs are available for qualifying voters in states with strict photo ID requirements. In eight states, including Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Virginia, and Wisconsin, there are varying voter ID requirements for absentee voting. Some states do not strictly enforce voter ID requirements, while others have strict photo ID requirements but do not extend them to absentee voters. Notable exceptions include North Dakota allowing absentee voters without approved IDs to have their identities attested by other qualified voters, and Virginia's ID requirement only applying to in-person absentee ballot applications. In states with enforced photo ID requirements (Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin), voters without ID can cast provisional ballots, which may be counted if an accepted ID is presented within a specified period. Some states allow ID submission via mail. Other states permit voting without ID by signing an affidavit or casting a provisional ballot subject to confirmation. In 14 nonphoto ID states, voter eligibility may be challenged or investigated. 10 states allow voters without acceptable ID to establish identity at polling places. Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and Utah strictly enforce ID requirements, with varying options for voters without ID. Missouri requires two election judges to sign an affidavit for a voter without ID to cast a ballot. Among the nonphoto ID states, Missouri's requirements for voter identification are similar to North Dakota's strict photo ID requirement. In states with strictly enforced ID requirements, verification of identity must occur within a specified time period after the election, ranging from 2 to 10 days or before a meeting of election officials. Ohio allows voters without identifying information to present it within 7 days after the election. In Louisiana, a voter without a \"generally recognized\" photo ID must sign an affidavit and provide other identifying information to an election official. In Indiana, a voter without a current or recently expired photo ID can cast a provisional ballot and must appear at the county elections office by noon on the Monday after the election. In Ohio, voters must present an Ohio or federal government ID or specified document dated within the last year. State voter photo ID laws have been the subject of litigation, challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and state constitutional provisions. These laws have drawn attention due to a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding them. The 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling upheld the constitutionality of an Indiana voter photo ID law, which has drawn attention. Challenges under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act are notable for addressing discriminatory voting practices based on race, color, or language minority membership. This section allows private citizens or the government to challenge such practices that deny or abridge the right to vote. The report analyzes challenges to voter photo ID laws under the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 2 of the VRA, focusing on recent court rulings in North Carolina and Texas. It also discusses the implications of these challenges and references the 2008 Supreme Court ruling upholding an Indiana voter photo ID law. The Supreme Court upheld Indiana's voter photo ID law, stating that it imposes a limited burden on voting rights justified by the state's interest in protecting elections. The law requires voters to present a government-issued photo ID, but eligible voters can cast provisional ballots if they don't have one. The Court did not agree on a specific rationale for upholding the law. The Supreme Court upheld Indiana's voter photo ID law, citing a \"limited burden\" on voting rights justified by the state's interest in protecting election integrity. The opinion emphasized that valid, neutral justifications are relevant even if partisan political interests were a motivation for enacting the law. The possibility of \"as applied\" challenges to voter photo ID laws was left open if evidence of burdens on voters' rights could be shown. Litigation challenging state voter photo ID laws is ongoing in lower courts, with recent court rulings evaluating two state laws. In a long-running litigation, two state laws were evaluated by U.S. Court of Appeals rulings. The Fourth Circuit invalidated North Carolina's voter photo ID law for racially discriminatory intent, while the Fifth Circuit ruled that Texas' law had a discriminatory effect on minorities' voting rights. Modifications were required for the Texas law, but the issue of discriminatory intent was remanded. The Fourth Circuit invalidated North Carolina's voter photo ID requirement due to racially discriminatory intent, as ruled in North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory. The U.S. Supreme Court denied North Carolina's request for a stay, meaning the law will not be in effect for the November 8 election. The appellate court found evidence of discriminatory intent in North Carolina's voting laws since the 1980s, with attempts to suppress African American voting rights. After the VRA preclearance requirements were struck down in 2013, the legislature quickly passed restrictive voting legislation. The court found discriminatory intent in North Carolina's voting laws, which were described as the most restrictive since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Legislative history, including the use of racial data, played a significant role in the court's decision. The court also considered the impact of the law on different races, finding errors in the lower court's conclusions. The court found discriminatory intent in North Carolina's voting laws, which were described as the most restrictive since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. African-American voters disproportionately use the voting procedures eliminated or reduced by the challenged law due to socioeconomic disparities, making them a necessity. The court concluded that the law was enacted to \"entrench\" the majority party's control of the legislature, even if for partisan ends. The court found discriminatory intent in North Carolina's voting laws, which were described as the most restrictive since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The court held that targeting voters based on race constituted racial discrimination. In a separate case, the Fifth Circuit ruled that a Texas voter photo ID law must be administered to rectify a discriminatory effect on voters without the required ID. The Fifth Circuit ruled that the Texas voter photo ID law had a discriminatory effect on minorities' voting rights, violating the VRA. The court remanded for consideration of a remedy and found that the law was not equivalent to a poll tax. The issue of discriminatory intent was reversed and remanded for further consideration by the district court. In August, a plan was approved allowing certain Texas voters without ID to cast a ballot with a \"reasonable impediment declaration.\" In September, the district court ordered Texas to ensure voter education materials reflect the court's August order on administering the voter photo ID law for the November 8 election. The Veasey case found the law discriminatory under the VRA, citing Supreme Court precedent. The opinion highlighted the burden on minorities and approved the lower court's findings that the law disproportionately affects Texans in poverty. The State of Texas filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing for a reversal of the Fifth Circuit's holding that the voter ID law has a discriminatory effect. If the Court agrees to hear this case, a decision would be expected after November 8, and therefore would not affect the 2016 election. The Arkansas Supreme Court invalidated a voter photo ID law less than three weeks before the November 2014 election, citing state constitutional provisions that only four listed voter qualifications should be required. The court found that upholding the law would disenfranchise voters and go against the intent of the state constitution framers. The constitutionality of voter photo ID laws under the U.S. Constitution, VRA, and state provisions is still being debated. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of an Indiana voter photo ID law in 2008. Litigation is ongoing regarding voter ID laws and their potential violation of the VRA. Issues such as implementation problems, voter difficulties in obtaining IDs, effects on turnout, and risk of fraud may arise. Some states have had photo ID requirements in effect for multiple presidential elections, while others will implement them for the first time in the November 2016 election. Lawsuits have been filed in some states that could affect voter ID requirements. Changes in election administration can introduce uncertainty in the voting process. Implementing changes in election administration is a complex process with potential effects on various aspects of the voting process. Policymakers should allow sufficient time for implementation to ensure smooth adjustments for election officials, pollworkers, and voters. Changes such as moving polling places may impact a limited number of voters, while others like altering voting systems or identification procedures can affect all voters in the state. Education of the voting public and adjustments to training and procedures may be necessary to ensure successful implementation before the election. Changes in election administration require proper training and procedures for pollworkers to ensure a smooth implementation on Election Day. Voters may need to take actions like obtaining an ID to avoid issues like long lines and misapplication of rules. Lack of awareness or acceptable ID could lead to delays and complications, especially in high-turnout elections. Some pollworkers may not be adequately trained to recognize acceptable IDs, causing further issues. Implementation of new or modified voter ID requirements could increase polling-place problems, but risks can be mitigated through administrative preparation, pollworker training, and voter education. Most local election officials believe training and education are crucial in preventing issues at polling places and see a need for improvement. Implementation of new or modified voter ID requirements could increase polling-place problems, but risks can be mitigated through administrative preparation, pollworker training, and voter education. Census data suggest that 8-10% of the U.S. population relocates to another state approximately every five years, creating difficulties for voters who move to a state with different voter ID requirements. Acceptable forms of identification differ by state. Acceptable forms of identification for voters vary by state and may be obtained from different agencies. Voters with approved IDs need to bring them to the polling place. However, discrepancies like name changes or missing information on the ID may require rectification. Studies show that 80% to 95% of registered voters have valid IDs. In states with strictly enforced ID requirements, voters must obtain an acceptable ID to cast a ballot. Some states offer free IDs to qualifying voters, but the process may require additional documents and incur costs, potentially hindering eligible voters. In states with strictly enforced voter ID requirements, voters may face difficulties in obtaining necessary documentation, potentially burdening certain groups like the poor, elderly, and minorities. Provisional ballots can be cast without an accepted ID in most states, but must be validated with required documentation at the county election office within a specified time frame. Few voters encountered ID problems in Kansas and Tennessee during the 2012 election, with a low percentage of provisional ballots being counted. Data on the impact of voter ID requirements in other states is lacking. The term \"turnout\" in this report refers to the number of voters in an election. Voter fraud includes voter impersonation and illicit voter registration, activities that voter ID could help reduce. Most observers agree that all eligible voters should have equal opportunity to vote and steps should be taken to protect the election process from fraud. These goals are essential for election integrity but can sometimes conflict. The focus on providing access to the ballot box for all eligible voters may increase the risk of improper inclusion of ineligible individuals on voter rolls or successful voter impersonation. Voter ID laws are seen as more effective in preventing voter impersonation rather than illicit registration, although some argue they can also help prevent erroneous voter registration. Some propose solutions like digital photographs in electronic pollbooks to reduce the risk of excluding eligible voters, especially elderly, poor, and minority groups, due to a focus on preventing voter fraud. This apparent conflict may not have significant effects on actual access to voting. Some argue that measures to decrease voter fraud may not significantly impact actual access or fraud. Voter fraud is seen as more of a risk with absentee and mail-in voting than at polling places. There is no consensus on how to interpret data on voter fraud, given the complexities of the election process. The complexities of the election process make collecting data for scientific analysis difficult, especially when controlling for factors other than voter ID requirements. The impact of voter ID requirements on election results depends on factors like the closeness of the contest. For example, a 2% change in turnout due to an ID requirement may not affect the outcome if the margin of victory is 5%, but it could change the outcome if the margin is only 1%. The impact of voter ID requirements on election results is uncertain, with no clear consensus on its effects. Election officials generally support photo ID requirements but believe it could negatively affect turnout while increasing election security. Voter fraud is seen as uncommon, but the debate continues on how to balance security and accessibility in elections. A systematic risk analysis of election processes is needed to determine the most vulnerable points for election integrity. Voter ID has received legislative attention, but without proper analysis, it's hard to prioritize reducing risks. State legislators are likely to continue considering identification requirements. Legislators in states are expected to continue considering voter ID legislation in the future. Over 200 voter ID bills were reviewed during the 2015-2016 and 2013-2014 election cycles, a decrease from previous cycles. Courts and the Department of Justice are likely to take further action on voter ID laws. The 2016 election will provide valuable data on the impact of voter ID laws, which Congress may analyze. As more experience is gained with voter ID requirements, a consensus may emerge on their benefits and drawbacks. The benefits and drawbacks of voter ID requirements are being considered, with questions about voter fraud, risk factors, and impact on legitimate voters. Voter ID laws are expected to remain a significant topic beyond the 2016 election. The text discusses ID requirements for voting in states with voter ID laws, detailing the types of IDs accepted, exceptions for certain voters, and recourse for those without accepted IDs. It also includes information on when the requirements were enacted and whether free IDs are available. The text discusses voter ID requirements in states, categorizing them as strictly enforced or not based on italics in state names."
