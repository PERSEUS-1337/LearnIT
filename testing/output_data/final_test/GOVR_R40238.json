    "content": "The Presidential Records Act (PRA), enacted in 1978, mandates the collection and retention of presidential records for public access. These records are crucial for understanding the executive branch's operations, but may contain sensitive information. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) assumes responsibility for these records at the end of a President's term. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) mandates the collection and retention of presidential records under the supervision of the Archivist of the United States. The PRA requires all presidential records, including those created on electronic platforms, to be deposited in a designated location. Incumbent Presidents have varied in their interpretation of the PRA, raising concerns about maintaining accurate and accessible archives, especially with the increasing use of electronic platforms. The 113th Congress passed H.R. 1233, signed into law as P.L. 113-187, which amends the Presidential and Federal Records Act to regulate the collection and retention of records created by incumbent Presidents, including electronic records. It sets guidelines for reviewing records and prohibits the use of non-official electronic messaging accounts for creating federal records. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) was enacted in 1978 to regulate the collection and retention of presidential records, including electronic records. Recent amendments to the PRA require records to be forwarded to an official email address within five days and prohibit the use of non-official electronic messaging accounts for creating federal records. Congress may oversee the implementation of these amendments to ensure appropriate capture, retention, and future access of presidential records. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) regulates the collection and maintenance of presidential records, including electronic materials. Records are under the control of the President while in office and then become property of the federal government upon leaving office. The PRA applies to records dating back to Ronald Reagan and includes various types of documentary materials. Upon leaving office, an outgoing President can restrict access to certain archived records for up to 12 years under Chapter 22 of Title 44 of the U.S. Code. Certain presidential files may be exempted from public access indefinitely based on six criteria outlined in 44 U.S.C. Section 2204, including national security, foreign policy, federal office appointments, statutory exemptions, trade secrets, confidential communications, and personnel or medical files. The Presidential Records Act allows the Archivist of the United States or federal courts to determine which records can be released to the public, with a provision to protect personal privacy. Different presidential administrations have interpreted the Act differently, as seen in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. The Act does not define the scope of privilege for incumbent or former Presidents. The Presidential Records Act has been subject to varying interpretations by different administrations. P.L. 113-187, the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, aims to clarify certain provisions that have been historically interpreted differently by Presidents. Executive Order 13233, issued by President George W. Bush, granted broad authority to deny access to presidential documents post the 12-year restriction period, allowing for indefinite delays in releasing certain records. Former Presidents had 90 days to review documents requested under FOIA, with incumbent Presidents able to extend the review period indefinitely. The Archivist had no means to challenge these decisions. President Barack Obama revoked Executive Order 13233 with Executive Order 13489, granting Presidents and former Presidents 30 days to review records for release after a 12-year restriction. Incumbent Presidents could claim executive privilege for a former President's records, preventing their release unless ordered by a court. Under E.O. 13489, the Archivist consulted with officials to determine the validity of executive privilege claims made by former Presidents. The incumbent President had the authority to decide whether to release a former President's records, with the Archivist required to abide by this decision unless directed otherwise by a court order. If the Archivist denied a claim and determined records should be released, both Presidents were given 30 days' notice. This executive order vested much of the records disclosure authority in the hands of the incumbent President. The Presidential Records Act gives authority over records disclosure to the Archivist, but E.O. 13489 allowed the incumbent President to decide on releasing a former President's records. The 113th Congress passed the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, providing a 60-day review period for presidential records. The Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 established a 60-day review period for presidential records, allowing an extension of 30 days if necessary. It supersedes Executive Order 13489 and requires any claim of executive privilege to be made by the former or incumbent President. The law also prohibits individuals convicted of mishandling NARA records from accessing presidential records and prohibits the use of non-official electronic messaging accounts for creating presidential records. The Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 established a review period for presidential records, superseding Executive Order 13489. It prohibits the use of non-official electronic messaging accounts for creating presidential records. The definition of presidential record includes materials created by the President or immediate staff, with no specific limitation on platforms. The sender and content of a message on an electronic messaging account determine if it qualifies as a presidential record. The terms \"official electronic messaging account\" and \"non-official electronic messaging account\" may not affect the qualification of a record as a presidential record. Alternatively, the Archivist could issue an interpretive rule in the Federal Register. The Archivist could issue an interpretive rule in the Federal Register to define \"non-official electronic messaging account\" and clarify legislative language. Congress may need to amend the law or the Archivist could promulgate a regulation to ensure all qualifying presidential records are captured, especially those created on electronic messaging accounts without automated archiving technology. The Presidential Records Act requires collection and accessibility of records, which are now mostly created electronically. New technologies need to be considered for record-keeping. NARA ensures electronic records of former Presidents are preserved, including social media content. Incumbent Presidents manage their records during their term. NARA collaborates with Presidents to capture and preserve social media records. NARA created an Executive Office of the President (EOP) system within its Electronic Records Archive (ERA) to preserve and make available presidential records, including electronic records from the George W. Bush Administration. The ERA is used to review and make these records available to the public, but it does not yet preserve the electronic records of the Clinton Administration. The ERA has the capability to manage electronic records of any President, including President Obama's records after his tenure ends. The National Archives' ERA can manage electronic records of any administration, including archiving emails and texts from the EOP system in real-time with attachments. The Obama Administration extensively used public websites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for presidential communication. Automatic archiving of social media use is not currently possible, so a combination of manual and automated techniques is used. The White House is searching for a comprehensive automatic archiving option for social media. The Obama Administration utilized public websites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for presidential communication. EOP employees are instructed to use their EOP email accounts for work-related communications, with exceptions for emergencies. Nonwork email accounts or platforms used for work must have records forwarded for archiving according to White House policy. NARA receives presidential records at the end of each administration, tracking the increasing volume of electronic records. Presidential Libraries have seen a significant growth in electronic records, surpassing paper holdings. Presidential Library holdings in electronic form have surpassed paper holdings, with the email system for the George W. Bush Administration alone being much larger than any other Presidential Library's textual holdings. The increase in electronic records poses challenges for archivists in processing and making them available. The informal communication style in presidential record emails often mixes personal and record information, requiring more redactions. NARA received 20 million presidential record emails from the Administration of William J. Clinton. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) submitted testimony to the House in June 2010 regarding the management of presidential records. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about the challenges of managing electronic records, citing the significant increase in digital information volume. The George W. Bush administration transferred 77 terabytes of data to the National Archives, 35 times more than the Clinton administration. The George W. Bush administration transferred a significant amount of electronic records to the National Archives, including 70 million pages of textual records, 43,000 artifacts, 200 million emails, and 4 million digital photographs. This marked a 3,500% increase in electronic records compared to the previous administration. The challenge lies in ensuring perpetual access to the diverse platforms used to create these records. In recent Congresses, legislative proposals have been introduced to amend the Presidential Records Act, giving Congress the authority to oversee the implementation of the Act. These proposals aim to require the Archivist to regulate and oversee the incumbent President's records management practices, especially in light of technological advancements that have led to the proliferation of presidential records across various electronic platforms. The Archivist may be required to oversee a sitting President's records management for the first time, ensuring consistency in record-keeping practices across Administrations. The Archivist, appointed by the President, is authorized to oversee record management without political bias. H.R. 1234 aimed to have an official reporting to Congress on the President's actions, potentially causing tension. The evolving use of social media poses challenges for archiving. Congress may need to monitor the Administration's compliance with the Presidential Records Act. The Administration's adherence to the Presidential Records Act through manual archiving techniques for social media use is in question. Congress may want to promote cost-effective technology for automated record capture. Electronic platforms create records at a higher volume, raising concerns about capturing all Presidential records and ensuring public accessibility. The curr_chunk discusses the potential challenges of preserving records created on current technologies for future access. It also mentions legislative efforts to amend the Presidential Records Act, including the Electronic Message Preservation Act introduced in the 113th Congress. The curr_chunk discusses proposed amendments to the Presidential Records Act, focusing on the management of electronic Presidential records during the President's term in office. It includes provisions for the Archivist to establish standards for record management, certify the President's compliance, and report to Congress annually. The committee reported on H.R. 1234, addressing outdated provisions in current law related to electronic recordkeeping. The bill prohibits creating presidential records on non-official electronic messaging accounts without forwarding copies to official accounts within five days. H.R. 1234 was favorably reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the 112th Congress but has not seen further action. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to clarify the release of presidential records: H.R. 1144 and H.R. 3071. Both bills aimed to amend the Presidential Records Act to allow a 60-day review period before releasing unreleased records, with a possible 30-day extension for review. The bills also required any claim of executive privilege to be made by the applicable former President. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the Presidential Records Act, including H.R. 35 and H.R. 1387. These bills aimed to address concerns about misinterpretation of the PRA by presidential administrations and clarify electronic recordkeeping requirements for the incumbent President. Representative Towns introduced H.R. 35, the Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2009, to reinstitute pre-Bush archiving policies, shorten record review period to 20 days, and revoke E.O. 13233. The bill required justification for protected records and passed the House on January 7, 2009. It was then referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. On March 9, 2009, Representative Paul W. Hodes introduced H.R. 1387, the Electronic Message Preservation Act, to amend regulations for the management of electronic Presidential records. The bill required the Archivist to establish standards for efficient record management during the President's term. H.R. 1387 aimed to update regulations for electronic Presidential records management, including controls for message capture, accessibility, and preservation. The bill required the Archivist to certify the electronic records management system annually and report to Congress on compliance. Additionally, a report on the volume and format of electronic Presidential records was to be submitted within a year of a President leaving office. H.R. 1387 focused on updating regulations for electronic Presidential records management, including message capture, accessibility, and preservation. The bill required the Archivist to certify the system annually and report to Congress on compliance. Vice Presidents also have discretion in determining which records qualify as presidential under the PRA, with similar recordkeeping duties as the President. The court ruled in favor of former Vice President Cheney's claim that he has discretion over which of his records are preserved and released to the public. Vice presidential records are to be preserved in the same manner as presidential records according to 44 U.S.C. Section 2207. The court ruled in favor of former Vice President Cheney's discretion over preserving his records, pursuant to 44 U.S.C. Section 2207."
