    "content": "The 111th Congress continued the health reform debate, with Senator Baucus releasing principles for reform. Multiple bills were introduced, leading to the passage of H.R. 3962 in the House and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the Senate. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 3590, consolidated and amended bills passed by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the Senate Finance Committee. Congress did not appoint a formal conference committee for negotiations, opting for discussions between chambers. President released a health reform proposal on February 22, 2010. The President released a health reform proposal on February 22, 2010, combining provisions from Senate and House bills. A bipartisan meeting on health reform was held on February 25, 2010. This report provides background information on health insurance and describes reform approaches and bills in the 111th Congress. It does not analyze the potential impact of the reform approaches or bills. The current health reform bills aim to address issues with health insurance and services, as costs are increasing and coverage is declining. State reforms are providing insights for federal debates, with similar issues from the 1990s resurfacing today. The existing recession exacerbates many of the issues addressed by health reform legislation. Health insurance reform encompasses a wide range of policy options, from addressing specific issues like expanding coverage for uninsured children to broader proposals that change how people access healthcare. The variety of reform approaches makes a comprehensive discussion challenging. Health insurance reform approaches differ in objectives and priorities among stakeholders. Objectives can include reducing the number of uninsured individuals and decreasing reliance on insurance for medical care. Some believe excessive insurance leads to higher healthcare costs. Legislation aims to control the rapid growth of medical care prices by promoting cost-consciousness in health insurance choices. Advocates believe addressing the rising cost of insurance is crucial before tackling other healthcare issues. Cost-reducing approaches range from preempting state laws that increase insurance prices to implementing a single government payer system. Advocates of single payer systems argue it would enhance the healthcare system. Advocates of single payer systems believe it would improve administrative efficiencies and reduce overall health insurance costs. Legislation in the 111th Congress aims to improve medical care quality and health insurance products. Proposals to enhance health outcomes, increase information availability on high-quality healthcare, and establish disease management systems are gaining interest. However, these provisions may not reduce the number of uninsured individuals or impact medical costs. The definition of adequate health insurance is a significant consideration beyond the scope of this report. Sponsors of coverage extension bills are likely to face complex questions regarding the type of coverage needed. Extending coverage raises questions about the type of coverage needed. Stakeholders have varying preferences and needs, leading to different reform approaches. Consumers may prioritize low-cost insurance over insurers' profits. Health insurance reforms in the 111th Congress may include incremental improvements that address the varying preferences and needs of consumers, such as low-cost insurance options and community-rated premiums. The 111th Congress may consider a range of health insurance reforms, from incremental improvements to broader reforms. Previous reforms have increased insurance availability but have not solved the issue of uninsured individuals. Medicaid and CHIP expansions have led to some loss of private coverage, but have reduced uninsurance rates for children. Questions remain about the cost of reform plans. The 111th Congress may consider various health insurance reforms, ranging from subsidies for individuals to market reform approaches. Research suggests significant subsidies may be necessary to encourage the uninsured to purchase coverage. Market reform approaches aim to reduce costs and increase options by addressing government laws and regulations that have raised insurance costs. Several health insurance reform bills have been introduced in the 111th Congress, aiming to expand coverage through various approaches such as replacing existing coverage with a national government-provided health insurance program, expanding public programs, and encouraging state-based reforms. Some proposals focus on creating a national health insurance program. In the 111th Congress, various health insurance reform bills aim to establish a national health insurance program, providing basic coverage to all Americans regardless of ability to pay or employment status. Proposals include social insurance or a national health service approach, with government-administered and financed systems. Medicare serves as an example of social insurance for the elderly and disabled. The national health service approach includes universal coverage and reforms in healthcare production, with potential roles for private insurers. Critics raise concerns about governmental intrusion, while proponents argue for the need for significant changes to achieve universal insurance coverage. Bills in the 111th Congress aim to expand public health insurance programs for specific groups. Legislation in the 111th Congress aims to expand public health insurance programs for specific groups, such as eliminating the Medicare waiting period for disabled individuals and expanding Medicaid coverage. These bills focus on targeted demographics and are not summarized in the report, but their impact should not be underestimated. Past health insurance reforms have shown success in increasing coverage for previously uninsured individuals through programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. Expanding public health insurance programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP has been successful in reducing the percentage of uninsured children. Legislation in the 111th Congress aims to extend coverage to more uninsured individuals by building on existing programs. Utilizing public programs for expansions may be more cost-effective than typical private coverage, especially for those who cannot afford private insurance. Proposals to expand public coverage face the obstacle of \"crowd out,\" where private coverage may decrease. Crowd-out is low when public programs cover low-income individuals, but rises with higher income levels. Private health insurance covers over 60% of the U.S. population, funded by workers and employers. Some bills focus on expanding employer-based coverage, while others address small employers' needs. Efforts to expand or strengthen the employer-based market for insurance can help reduce the number of uninsured individuals, especially since over 80% of uninsured individuals under age 65 are employed or have ties to employment. Members of the 111th Congress have introduced bills to subsidize workers' or employers' share of premiums and mandate coverage. Efforts to expand or strengthen the employer-based market for insurance aim to reduce the number of uninsured individuals, especially those with ties to employment. Proposals include tax incentives, employer mandates, and improving pooling in the small employer market. Large employers have cost advantages due to risk spreading and economies of scale. Most health insurance in the United States is obtained through employment, with group plans having tax advantages. Individual market plans are priced based on health status, leading to potential price disadvantages for those with medical conditions. Some insurers can refuse coverage based on health conditions. Individual market plans in many states can refuse to sell to individuals with health conditions or offer policies that exclude coverage for specific conditions. Approaches aim to improve the individual market by increasing choices and portability of health insurance. Tools include giving tax advantages to individually purchased insurance and providing subsidies for coverage. One option is to replace tax benefits for employer-based health insurance with new benefits for individual market coverage. The proposal aims to replace tax benefits for employer-based health insurance with new benefits for coverage in the individual market, incentivizing people to switch. However, limitations such as health underwriting and lack of guaranteed availability of plans may make individual insurance less affordable for some compared to employer-sponsored plans. Risk pooling in the individual market is limited, and individual underwriting is common, affecting the options available to individuals. The individual market has limited risk pooling and common individual underwriting. If employers drop coverage, healthy individuals may easily find replacement policies, while less healthy individuals could become uninsured. Administrative costs are high due to lack of economies of scale. Most bills proposing individual market solutions are combined with other reforms. This includes establishing a \"connector\" or \"exchange\" to facilitate insurance purchasing and negotiation with plans. Bills in the 111th Congress aim to improve private health insurance accessibility and affordability by reducing state regulation, broadening risk pools, and promoting consumer-driven health plans. States regulate insurance business, with laws covering patient protections, rate development, and rate approval procedures. Insurance carriers must adhere to fair marketing practices, filing grievances, and appeals processes. States have benefit requirements for health insurance products. Proposals to reduce state regulation could lower costs for some but increase costs for others. Insurers face challenges selling products across state lines due to varying laws. Proposals encouraging small employers to join health purchasing groups aim to pool together small groups to lower premiums for small firms with older or less healthy workers. Bills in the 109th and 110th Congresses aimed to encourage professional and trade associations to offer coverage through pooling, providing regulatory relief for insurers. However, most bills did not require premiums to be calculated across the entire group, limiting the increase in risk pools. Other bills proposed establishing programs similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to negotiate with a limited number of health plans and average premiums across all plans offered through the program. The bills in the 109th and 110th Congress aimed to encourage professional and trade associations to offer coverage through pooling, with premiums averaged across all enrollees for each plan. Community-rating could lead to increased prices for young healthy individuals but lower prices for older or sicker individuals. This trade-off may be acceptable if the goal is to increase insurance coverage among those who need it most. However, if healthier and younger groups find rates excessive, they may drop coverage, increasing costs and undermining risk spreading objectives. Only New York has implemented \"pure\" community-rating. \"Only New York has \"pure community rating,\" where individual-market premiums cannot vary by any factor, including age. Other states have implemented rate banding or adjusted community rating to pool risk. Federal policies should consider existing state laws to avoid undermining state improvements. \"Consumer driven\" reforms aim to offer more choices, raise cost consciousness, and reduce overall premium growth.\" Proposals for high deductible health plans with health savings accounts aim to reduce premium growth and unnecessary healthcare utilization. State experimentation with insurance reforms may influence federal changes towards achieving universal coverage. State-based health insurance reforms serve as a blueprint for federal changes, with some legislators preferring states to address coverage gaps. Legislative proposals may include grant funds for states to continue reforms on their own, reflecting local needs. However, state-based reforms face obstacles such as ERISA restrictions on passing laws affecting employer benefits. State-based health insurance reforms face challenges such as ERISA restrictions on employer benefits and funding issues. States' ability to pay for reforms fluctuates with economic conditions, leading to the need for federal reforms to ensure equity. Proponents suggest combining private insurance with expanding public programs to cover the uninsured. Public programs are being used to extend coverage among the uninsured, as no single approach is seen as sufficient. Bills advocating multiple approaches include market improvements, subsidies for low-income populations, and allowing individuals to keep their current health insurance. Health reform bills in the 111th Congress include new and reintroduced bills, with a focus on improving quality of care and managing chronic diseases. The combination approach is favored by many in the policy community and has been advocated by the President. Proposals from AHIP and The Health Coverage Coalition for the Uninsured advocate multidimensional approaches to health insurance reform. Major provisions of bills in the 111th Congress include replacing existing coverage with a national government-provided program, expanding privately sponsored coverage, encouraging state-based reforms, and expanding both private and public coverage options. The National Health Insurance Act introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to provide medical and hospital services to all eligible individuals, including U.S. wage earners and their dependents not eligible for Medicare. The National Health Insurance Act proposed to provide medical and hospital services to eligible individuals, funded by public agencies.

It authorizes $5 billion annually from 2010-2014, funded by repealing TARP. The Secretary of Health and Human Services would establish a national program for small employers and self-employed individuals to access quality, affordable health insurance, modeled on FEHBP. An eligible entity would administer the program to provide coverage to employees and individuals. The bill aims to establish a pilot program for carriers to offer a model health benefits plan and assess its impact on healthcare costs and access. It sets minimum standards for health benefits plans and creates the National Health Coverage Commission to develop adequate coverage models and cost-sharing mechanisms.

A Small Business Health Board would monitor implementation, and navigators would assist with education and enrollment activities. Qualified health insurance issuers could provide health benefit plans to employees and self-employed individuals. The Act proposed by Senator Snowe in 2009 would limit pre-existing condition exclusions, establish a 3% risk corridor for insured gains/losses, and develop a minimum set of benefits for nationwide plans. It would also offer a health insurance tax credit to qualified small businesses.

The bill also expands Medicaid and CHIP, and establishes a National Advisory Commission on Expanded Access to Health Care. The Health Care Act of 2009, introduced by Senator Bernard Sanders, aims to encourage states to develop universal health care systems. It proposes the establishment of a state-based Universal Health Care Coverage Commission to provide guidance and funding for state plans offering comprehensive health care. States can apply for grants to develop these plans, with the potential for demonstration grants for up to five states. The state plans must provide health benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent. The plan proposed in the amendment to H.R. 3962 includes provisions for state reinsurance programs, high-risk pools, private insurance reforms, state innovation programs, and administrative simplification. It also establishes Association Health Plans, requirements for interstate purchasing of health insurance coverage, and expands tax preferences for health savings accounts and high-deductible health plans.

Benefits include Medicare parts A and B, prescription drug coverage similar to Blue Cross Blue Shield, and additional coverage for children, pregnant women, and low-income individuals. Funding comes from individual premiums, employer contributions, state payments, and general revenue funds, with premium subsidies based on income. The Healthy Americans Act introduced by Senator Wyden in February 2009 requires adults to purchase a Healthy American Private Insurance (HAPI) plan, with premium subsidies based on income. Dependent children enroll through their family plan, and states establish a Health Help Agency (HHA) to ensure at least two HAPI plans are offered with certain standards. Late enrollment penalty applies for those not initially enrolling in a HAPI plan or other qualified plan. The Healthy Americans Act introduced by Senator Wyden in February 2009 requires adults to purchase a Healthy American Private Insurance (HAPI) plan, with premium subsidies based on income. The legislation would establish certain standards for HAPI plans, including limiting preexisting condition exclusions and prohibiting discrimination based on health status. It would also authorize states to establish a State Choices for Long-Term Care Program and require the Secretary to establish Chronic Care Diseases Management programs and Education Centers. Additionally, a federal fallback would provide access to HAPI plans for states that do not establish a Health Help Agency (HHA).
