    "content": "The Attorney General announced on June 10, 2002, that American citizen Jose Padilla, also known as Abdullah Muhajir, was arrested upon his return from Pakistan for allegedly plotting to use a radiological bomb in the United States. Padilla was detained as a material witness but was later declared an \"enemy combatant\" by President Bush and transferred to the Department of Defense custody. The Administration argues that the law of war allows indefinite detention of members or associates of terrorist organizations without formal charges. The Administration initially denied Jose Padilla access to his attorney, arguing he has no constitutional right to one as he has not been charged with a crime. After a federal judge ruled in Padilla's favor, the government claimed that allowing him to communicate with his lawyer would endanger national security, but the judge rejected this argument. The case was certified for appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit ruled that the President lacks authority to detain U.S. citizens as enemy combatants. Padilla was granted limited access to his attorney under government monitoring. The Supreme Court vacated the decision and stated the case should have been brought in the Fourth Circuit. Another American citizen, Yaser Esam Hamdi, detained as an enemy combatant, had his petition heard on the same day. Yaser Eser Hamdi, captured in Afghanistan, initially detained at Guantanamo Bay, transferred to a naval brig in South Carolina. Held in military custody without charge. Government claimed authority to detain him without trial or access to attorney for national security. Fourth Circuit agreed, Supreme Court partially reversed, affirming President's detention authority. The Supreme Court reversed part of the decision regarding Yaser Eser Hamdi's detention, affirming the President's authority but ruling he was entitled to a hearing. An agreement was reached for Hamdi to return to Saudi Arabia without a hearing. The government sees the Hamdi decision as applicable to Padilla and Guantanamo Bay detainees, but the cases are different as Hamdi was captured on the battlefield. Unlike Padilla, Hamdi was not accused of specific unlawful acts. The Supreme Court ruled that the President's authority as Commander-In-Chief justified the detention of combatants captured during hostilities. The Administration argued that congressional authorization could be found in the Authorization to Use Force (AUMF) and other statutes. The Court did not clarify the scope of the AUMF authority or address the President's inherent authority to order detentions. The law of war categorizes individuals in armed conflicts as combatants or civilians, determining their legal status. The distinction between combatants and civilians in armed conflicts determines their legal status and protections. Combatants are authorized to fight according to the law of war, while civilians are protected from deliberate targeting as long as they do not take up arms. Combatants must minimize civilian casualties and distinguish themselves from civilians to limit exposure to military attacks. Failure to do so may result in denial of privileges. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 determine the treatment of individuals in armed conflicts. Parties have the right to capture and detain enemy soldiers and civilians posing a threat. Detention is for security reasons, not based on guilt, to remove threats from the battlefield. The law of war allows for the capture and detention of enemy combatants and civilians to prevent them from aiding the enemy. Internment and property confiscation are permitted to deprive the enemy of resources. The President has the authority to restrict, intern, or remove enemy aliens deemed dangerous during a declared war. The Supreme Court has upheld internment programs. The Supreme Court has upheld internment programs under the Alien Enemy Act, allowing for the detention of enemy aliens without criminal trial. It is unclear if individuals who are neither POWs nor enemy aliens can be detained without charges, raising questions about due process under the Constitution and international law. The conditions of detention may also raise concerns about whether they constitute punishment, despite the Department of Defense's assertion that detaining \"enemy combatants\" is not punitive. The Department of Justice relies on two cases to argue that American citizens can be detained as \"enemy combatants\" without criminal charges, citing Ex parte Quirin and In re Territo. However, others argue that these cases are specific to wars declared by Congress and do not apply to American citizens. The President issued a proclamation after eight Nazi saboteurs were caught by the FBI. The President issued a proclamation after eight German saboteurs were caught by the FBI, declaring that enemies entering the US for hostile acts should be tried according to the law of war. The saboteurs were tried by military commission for entering the US by submarine and conspiring to use explosives on war industries. The Supreme Court, in Ex parte Quirin, denied their habeas corpus writs, upholding the commission trial as constitutional. The Supreme Court upheld the trial of German saboteurs by military commission, finding their citizenship irrelevant to their status as \"enemy belligerents.\" The Court applied international common law of war and the President's proclamation to determine their status. The Supreme Court upheld the trial of German saboteurs by military commission, applying international common law of war. Unlawful combatants are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts that render their belligerency unlawful. The Supreme Court upheld the trial of German saboteurs by military commission as unlawful combatants, distinguishing between enemy soldiers and civilians who commit hostile acts during war. The Court recognized the petitioners as unlawful combatants and limited its opinion to the specific facts of the case. The Supreme Court upheld the trial of German saboteurs by military commission as unlawful combatants, distinguishing between enemy soldiers and civilians who commit hostile acts during war. The Court recognized the petitioners as unlawful combatants and limited its opinion to the specific facts of the case. In another case, an American citizen captured during battle in Italy petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that his U.S. citizenship should prevent him from being held as a prisoner of war. The court disagreed, stating that citizenship does not necessarily affect the status of one captured on the field of battle. The court upheld the trial of German saboteurs as unlawful combatants, distinguishing between soldiers and civilians who commit hostile acts. It found that citizenship does not affect the status of a prisoner of war captured on the battlefield. The court upheld the trial of German saboteurs as unlawful combatants, distinguishing between soldiers and civilians who commit hostile acts. Citizenship does not affect the status of a prisoner of war captured on the battlefield. Citizens associated with the military arm of an enemy government entering the country for hostile acts are considered enemy belligerents under the Hague Convention and the law of war. The court did not address the detention of citizens associated with armed groups not affiliated with an enemy government. The opinions in Territo and Quirin may not fully support the President's designation and detention of Padilla as an enemy combatant. The language on capturing and detaining unlawful combatants without criminal charges may be considered as dicta. The Supreme Court rejected the President's power to detain indefinitely a person accused of being an unlawful combatant solely based on membership in a group not recognized as a legitimate belligerent. Previous cases show that U.S. citizenship is not relevant in the treatment of enemy forces during declared wars. The Supreme Court's decision on the treatment of enemy forces does not address the constitutionality of determining who qualifies as an enemy combatant or POW. The President's classification of Al Qaeda as a criminal organization, not a state, raises questions about their status under the law of war. Taliban fighters captured in Afghanistan may fit the traditional definition of enemy combatants. In Ex parte Milligan, the Supreme Court ruled that civilians in states upholding government authority and with open courts cannot be tried by military commission, even during wartime. The case involved a civilian citizen of Indiana allegedly linked to a group planning sabotage against the North. The Court recognized military commission jurisdiction over violations of the laws of war but emphasized that these laws cannot be applied to citizens in loyal states with functioning courts. The Supreme Court ruled in Ex parte Milligan that civilians in states with functioning courts cannot be tried by military commission during wartime. The case involved a civilian from Indiana linked to sabotage plans against the North. The government argued that Milligan could be held as a prisoner of war if the military tribunal lacked jurisdiction. The Supreme Court ruled in Ex parte Milligan that civilians in states with functioning courts cannot be tried by military commission during wartime. Milligan argued that he could not have acquired belligerent rights or placed himself in a position to violate laws of war. The Court agreed, stating that as he had lived in Indiana for twenty years, he could be punished in Indiana's courts if he conspired with bad men, but he could not plead the rights of war as he was not engaged in legal acts of hostility during the rebellion. In Ex parte Milligan, the Supreme Court ruled that civilians in states with functioning courts cannot be tried by military commission during wartime. The Court found that Milligan, who had lived in Indiana for twenty years, could not plead the rights of war as he was not engaged in legal acts of hostility during the rebellion. The Court distinguished its holding from Quirin by stating that Milligan was a non-belligerent and not subject to the law of war. In Ex parte Milligan, the Supreme Court ruled that civilians in states with functioning courts cannot be tried by military commission during wartime. The Court found that Milligan, who had lived in Indiana for twenty years, could not plead the rights of war as he was not engaged in legal acts of hostility during the rebellion. Despite Congress' efforts to immunize executive officials for actions done under military authority during the Civil War, the Supreme Court of Illinois upheld damages awarded to Madison Y. Johnson, who was accused of being a belligerent but never charged with any offense. The Hamdi Court found that Milligan did not apply to a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan. Justice O'Connor wrote that Milligan does not undermine the Government's authority to seize enemy combatants. The Supreme Court's ruling in Ex parte Milligan emphasized that Milligan, a resident of Indiana, was not a prisoner of war and therefore could not be tried by a military tribunal. The Court highlighted that Milligan's status as a civilian arrested at home was crucial to its decision. The government argued that during wartime, the President has the authority to detain individuals deemed dangerous or likely to assist the enemy, as seen in Moyer v. Peabody. The government asserts the historical \"unavailability\" of due process rights for enemy combatants. In Moyer v. Peabody, the Supreme Court declined relief to a plaintiff detained without charge during a miners' strike, stating the governor has final judgment in good faith arrests to prevent insurrections. The Court's views were based on Colorado laws empowering the governor to suppress insurrections. The Supreme Court upheld the governor's authority to use the militia to suppress insurrections, allowing for arrests as a precautionary measure. The Court emphasized that the governor's judgment in detaining individuals during times of insurrection is final and not subject to jury review, as long as the actions are taken in good faith. The Supreme Court upheld the governor's authority to detain individuals during insurrections as a precautionary measure, stating that public danger justifies executive action over judicial process. The Court emphasized that immunity exists for using deadly force in actual battles or martial law situations. The Moyer case does not establish general executive authority to detain individuals without constitutional restrictions. Other courts have ruled that those wrongfully detained by the President can seek damages. Twentieth-century history shows the internment of individuals deemed dangerous during national emergencies. The Alien Enemy Act, enacted in 1798, allows the President broad authority to treat individuals likely to act as enemy agents on U.S. territory as alien enemies. This includes members of enemy armed forces, who may be tried by military commission or court-martial if accused of a crime. American citizens accused of spying or sabotage have been tried in federal court, while individuals captured on the battlefield abroad are handled according to government regulations interpreting the law of war. The Alien Enemy Act grants the President authority to impose restrictions on alien enemies during war. President Wilson issued a Proclamation warning alien enemies against hostilities. Offenders could face penalties, restraint, security requirements, or removal from the US under the Act. The government defended the Act's constitutionality as a valid exercise of Congress' power over alien enemies during war. The Alien Enemy Act grants the President authority to impose restrictions on alien enemies during war, based on Congress' power to declare war. The Act was defended as vital for national security to prevent harm from spies and propagandists. The government argued that the statute did not require a hearing prior to internment, as the President needed to act based on suspicion in the context of war. The Alien Enemy Act allowed regulations on alien enemies deemed a threat to national security. Orders could be challenged through habeas corpus petitions. Instances of enemy spies entering the US led to arrests and charges under the Articles of War. The Alien Enemy Act allowed regulations on alien enemies deemed a threat to national security, leading to arrests and charges under the Articles of War. Waberski, a German officer charged as a spy, was initially tried by a military tribunal but later sentenced to death by a military commission after a jurisdictional dispute between the Departments of War and Justice was resolved through compromise. President Wilson commuted Witzke's sentence to life imprisonment at hard labor in Fort Leavenworth and later pardoned him, possibly due to doubts about the military tribunal's jurisdiction to try the accused spy. The question of military jurisdiction over accused enemy spies arose again in the case of United States ex rel. Wessels v. McDonald, a habeas corpus proceeding brought by Herman Wessels challenging his detention by military authorities while awaiting court-martial for spying. The German Imperial Navy spy used a forged Swiss passport to enter the US and operated in New York City as an enemy agent. He contested his detention, arguing he should be tried by an Article III court, but the court found military jurisdiction valid for spying, not a crime under international law. Constitutional protections did not apply to enemy spies. The Supreme Court did not address the merits. In 1918, a bill was introduced in the Senate for trial by court-martial of non-military persons accused of espionage. Attorney General T.W. Gregory opposed the idea, citing statistics on war-related arrests and prosecutions. Of 508 espionage cases, 335 resulted in convictions, 31 in acquittals, and 125 were dismissed. Sedition charges led to 110 convictions and 90 cases of disloyalty. The Attorney General opposed trial by court-martial for civilians accused of offenses outside military territory, stating that complaints were likely exaggerated due to wartime stress. He emphasized the importance of trying suspects according to American legal standards. During World War II, President Roosevelt used the Alien Enemy Act to intern aliens considered dangerous or likely to engage in espionage or sabotage. The Attorney General established \"prohibited areas\" for aliens of Japanese, Italian, or German descent, with regulations overseen by the Alien Enemy Control Unit. During World War II, President Roosevelt extended the program to cover citizens and enemy aliens, issuing Executive Order 9066 to prescribe military areas. The order amended previous proclamations regarding aliens and restricted areas, transferring authority to the Department of War. The Department of Justice denied that the transfer was to avoid constitutional issues. The House Select Committee Investigating National Defense Migration found a significant shift in authority regarding the restriction or detention of citizens during World War II. The War Department felt congressional authorization was necessary for enforcement, leading to the enactment of legislation punishing violations of exclusion orders. This policy resulted in mass evacuation and compulsory internment of persons of Japanese descent on the West Coast. During World War II, persons of Japanese descent were subjected to compulsory internment at \"relocation centers,\" while individuals of German and Italian descent underwent loyalty hearings to determine their internment status. The Supreme Court upheld the internment program in cases like Hirabayashi, citing it as a valid wartime security measure. The Supreme Court upheld the internment program during World War II, including the Executive Order that restricted citizens of Japanese descent. The Court questioned the constitutionality of the exclusion measure but did not review it due to concurrent sentences. The relevant inquiry focused on equal protection and whether the curfew was a necessary protective measure against sabotage and espionage. Justice Douglas noted that due process considerations did not apply in this case. In Korematsu, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of an American citizen for remaining in his home located in a \"Military Area\" off-limits to persons of Japanese descent. The Court validated the treatment of Japanese-Americans in internment camps but did not consider the constitutionality of the detention itself. The Supreme Court validated the treatment of citizens similar to enemy aliens under Executive Order 9066, avoiding the statutory scope of the Alien Enemy Act. In Ex parte Endo, the Court ruled that loyal citizens could not be detained based on Japanese ancestry, finding no statutory support for internment. The Court did not address the constitutional issue but interpreted the executive's power during wartime. The Supreme Court ruled in Ex parte Endo that loyal citizens could not be detained based on Japanese ancestry, as detention did not further the campaign against espionage and sabotage. The Court avoided addressing the constitutionality of internment of citizens based on loyalty or explicit authorization by Congress. The Court's use of the term \"concededly loyal\" suggests a Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process for determining loyalty or dangerousness. An American with no enemy association was still subjected to an exclusion order, highlighting the need for reasonable notice and a chance to be heard. Homer Wilcox, a pacifist from Ohio, was forcibly removed despite being deemed harmless by an exclusion board. The manager of a religious publication promoting pacifism was indicted for fraud in connection with the publication. The court reversed the damages awarded to Wilcox, citing his activities as a reasonable ground for exclusion under Executive Order 9066 and 18 U.S.C.\u00c2\u00a7 1383, due to concerns of disloyalty and subversive activities that could endanger military security in specific areas. The court upheld the exclusion of Wilcox under Executive Order 9066, citing concerns of espionage and sabotage. The Japanese internment program has been discredited, convictions vacated, and victims compensated, but the constitutionality of detaining citizens during war remains unresolved. Courts played a role in determining the justification of restrictions on citizens of other ethnic backgrounds under Executive Order 9066. The court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause did not require compensation for persons detained under Executive Order 9066. Cases like Hirabayashi supported the constitutionality of preventive detention during war if due process was provided. Congress ratified Executive Order 9066, enforcing penalties for violations. The internment of Japanese-American citizens during wartime required a presidential order and specific legislation for validation, not authorized by the Executive Order. Only German military members captured on U.S. beaches were treated as enemy combatants. Collaborators were tried in federal courts for treason. During wartime, collaborators were tried in federal courts for treason or violations of other statutes. Hans Haupt, father of a saboteur, initially sentenced to death for treason, later received life imprisonment which was commuted on the condition of leaving the country. Helmut Leiner, charged with treason, was acquitted but interned as an enemy alien. Anthony Cramer, an American citizen convicted of treason, had his conviction overturned by the Supreme Court. Emil Krepper, a pastor in New Jersey, came under suspicion. Emil Krepper, a pastor in New Jersey, was indicted for violating TWEA and receiving a salary from the German government without reporting his activity as a foreign agent. Cases involving collaborators with the Quirin eight did not result in military determinations of enemy combatant status. It is unclear what kind of association with Germany would have enabled detention as enemy combatants under the law of war. After the Quirin decision, the Attorney General sought legislation to strengthen criminal law for internal security during wartime. The proposed War Security Act aimed to address gaps in criminal law, particularly in punishing hostile enemy acts on US territory. The House Judiciary Committee supported the bill, citing the need for military commissions due to the inadequacy of the penal code in punishing potential enemy saboteurs. After the Quirin decision, the Attorney General sought legislation to strengthen criminal law for internal security during wartime. The proposed War Security Act aimed to address gaps in criminal law, particularly in punishing hostile enemy acts on US territory. The House Judiciary Committee supported the bill, citing the need for military commissions due to the inadequacy of the penal code in punishing potential enemy saboteurs. The Internal Security Act of 1950 was introduced in response to the North Korean attack on South Korea, aiming to combat foreign conspiracy threats through strengthened espionage statutes and amendments to the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Attorney General proposed a bill to strengthen espionage statutes, amend the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and authorize U.S. intelligence agencies to intercept communications. The legislation was deemed necessary due to the modern warfare threats and internal operations that could weaken the country. The bill also included measures to exclude subversive aliens, detain or supervise aliens awaiting deportation, and restrict travel for members of communist organizations. President Truman supported the bill. Opponents of the McCarran Act, including President Truman, believed the registration requirements were likely unconstitutional or ineffective, raising concerns about civil liberties implications. Senator Kilgore introduced the Emergency Detention Act to address security concerns by allowing preventive incarceration of individuals with suspected subversive ties during a national emergency. At the time, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383 supported the declaration of military areas and enforcement of restrictions against dangerous aliens or citizens. The Kilgore bill proposed a program for internment of enemies with procedural safeguards. The final version of the ISA included the McCarran Act and the Emergency Detention Act. President Truman vetoed the bill due to his opposition to the McCarran Act, expressing concerns about the effectiveness of the provisions in achieving their objective without suspending the writ of habeas corpus. The ISA, passed by Congress over President Truman's veto, authorized preventive detention for national security purposes during emergencies. It allowed the President to declare an \"Internal Security Emergency\" in specific situations, maintaining internment camps from WWII for future crises. The Attorney General could issue warrants for apprehension of individuals during national emergencies under the act. The ISA allowed the President to declare an \"Internal Security Emergency\" and detain individuals believed to engage in acts of sabotage or espionage. Detainees had rights including the right to counsel and evidence presentation by the Attorney General. The Internal Security Act allowed the President to detain individuals suspected of espionage or sabotage on behalf of foreign Communist parties. Despite no internal emergencies being declared, concerns arose about potential misuse of the act to detain citizens with unpopular beliefs. Efforts were made to amend or repeal the act, with the Justice Department supporting its repeal. In 1971, Congress repealed the Emergency Detention Act and replaced it with a prohibition on detaining American citizens without congressional approval. This change aimed to prevent arbitrary executive authority over citizens during national security emergencies. Executive Order 9066 was rescinded in 1976, and Congress later repealed 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383. The Alien Enemy Act and subsequent legislation suggest that the President did not have the constitutional power to detain individuals as enemy combatants without specific circumstances. The repeal of the Emergency Detention Act and the enactment of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001(a) indicate that American citizens cannot be detained as enemy agents without conviction. The detention of American citizens as enemy combatants without conviction is questioned, as past conflicts have not utilized this approach despite the perceived internal security risks. One U.S. citizen remains in custody as an enemy combatant, while a Canadian citizen was held in U.S. military custody without being charged. Mohamed Mansour Jabarah, a Qatari national, was held for interrogation without charges. Ali Saleh Kahlah Al-Marri, a Qatari national lawfully present in the United States, was declared an \"enemy combatant\" and transferred to military custody. Originally detained as a material witness in connection with the September 11 attacks, he was later charged with credit card fraud but designated an \"enemy combatant\" by President Bush. Currently held in Charleston, South Carolina, his habeas corpus petition was dismissed for improper venue. This case is similar to Hamdi's, who was captured on the battlefield and not charged with any offense. The court cited the Geneva Convention as legal authority for detaining the petitioner as a prisoner of war. The question was whether a U.S. citizen could be treated as a prisoner of war. Hamdi claimed he was not a member of Al Qaeda or the Taliban and was in Afghanistan for humanitarian assistance. The Fourth Circuit ruled that if Hamdi is an 'enemy combatant' captured during hostilities in Afghanistan, his detention is lawful. The court emphasized deference to the government's determination but rejected the idea of indefinite detention without judicial review for American citizens. The district court ordered the government to provide more information to support its conclusion that Hamdi is an enemy combatant. The court found the petitioner entitled to due process under the Fifth Amendment and intended to inquire into the authority of the person determining Hamdi's status, the screening criteria used, national security aims, and compliance with military regulations and international law. On appeal, the government argued that the proof submitted was sufficient, which the Fourth Circuit agreed with. The Fourth Circuit agreed with the government's argument that the proof submitted was sufficient to support Hamdi's status as an enemy combatant. The court found no disputed facts that would necessitate an evidentiary hearing and dismissed the legal arguments put forth on Hamdi's behalf. The Supreme Court vacated the Fourth Circuit decision and remanded it to allow Hamdi a meaningful opportunity to contest his status as an \"enemy combatant.\" The Supreme Court, led by Justice O'Connor, emphasized the importance of due process for citizens held as enemy combatants. They rejected the government's argument that courts should have a limited role in such cases and emphasized that a state of war does not give the President unlimited power over citizens' rights. The Court also disagreed with the Fourth Circuit's view that the facts surrounding Hamdi's detention were undisputed, highlighting the need for a neutral decision-maker to review the evidence. The Supreme Court ruled that Hamdi could be detained as an enemy combatant only if he was found to have supported hostile forces and engaged in armed conflict against the United States. They suggested a balancing test to weigh the risk of wrongful detention against the government's interest in fighting a war, allowing for tailored enemy combatant proceedings without all the procedures of a criminal trial. The Supreme Court ruled that indefinite detention for interrogation purposes is not authorized under the AUMF, emphasizing the need for evidence to detain individuals as enemy combatants during ongoing military conflict. The Supreme Court ruled that detaining American citizens as enemy combatants without explicit authority is not permitted under the AUMF. Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg agreed that due process, including the right to counsel, should be provided to individuals like Hamdi. Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens dissented, arguing against the detention of a U.S. citizen in such circumstances. The Supreme Court did not resolve the case of Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen arrested in Chicago under suspicion of involvement in a plot to detonate a \"dirty bomb.\" A majority of five Justices vacated the Second Circuit's opinion in favor of Padilla due to lack of jurisdiction. Four Justices would have found jurisdiction based on \"exceptional circumstances\" and affirmed the holding that detention is prohibited under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001(a). The dissenters suggested that preventive detention of subversive citizens might be acceptable in certain situations. The Supreme Court did not resolve the case of Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen arrested in Chicago under suspicion of involvement in a plot to detonate a \"dirty bomb.\" The District Court for the District of South Carolina granted Padilla's motion for summary judgment and ordered the government to release him from military detention, suggesting he could be kept in civilian custody if charged with a crime or determined to be a material witness. Padilla's attorneys argued against incommunicado detention for months on end, stating that using unlawful procedures to extract information is not justified, even if the information obtained is more reliable than that acquired through extreme forms of torture. The judge disagreed with the government's argument that Jose Padilla's detention is covered under the Hamdi decision's interpretation of the AUMF, stating that express authority from Congress would be necessary as the AUMF contains no such authority. Padilla's alleged terrorist plans were thwarted when he was arrested on a material witness warrant. The court found that Jose Padilla's detention as an enemy combatant was not necessary or appropriate, and is barred by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001(a). The government's argument for detention outside the battlefield under the AUMF was not persuasive, as the President's interpretation does not automatically make it lawful. The court disagreed with the government's argument that the President has inherent authority as Commander-in-Chief to determine wartime measures. The government has appealed the case to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and requested a stay of the district court's order to release Padilla from military detention. The government has requested a stay of the district court's order to release Padilla from military detention, arguing that his case is similar to Ex parte Quirin. The Second Circuit and Fourth Circuit courts disagreed with this argument, with Padilla's attorneys citing similarities to Ex parte Milligan. The government argues that Padilla, like the petitioners in Quirin, is a belligerent associated with the enemy seeking to aid in hostile acts during wartime. Unlike Milligan, who was a civilian, Padilla did not enter the country illegally or as part of a military offensive. The government's argument assumes no difference between the landing of German saboteurs in Quirin and Padilla's case. The government argues that Padilla, like the petitioners in Quirin, is a belligerent associated with the enemy seeking to aid in hostile acts during wartime. The relevant factor is whether the petitioner had ever left the country and traveled to \"enemy territory,\" regardless of how he re-entered the country. The surreptitious nature of the petitioners' arrival onto the territory of the United States through coastal defenses was a major determinant of their status as enemy combatants. Padilla's apparently lawful means of entry may not affect his status as a prisoner of war. The government argues that Padilla's arrival by apparently lawful means does not impact his status as a prisoner of war. They claim that the laws of war apply to Al Qaeda, making anyone associated with them an \"enemy belligerent.\" However, it is unclear if Al Qaeda qualifies as a belligerent under the law of war. The government contends that Padilla engaged in hostile acts, unlike the petitioner in Milligan. The legality of Padilla's acts of hostility is questioned, similar to the case of Milligan who was not a lawful combatant. Padilla, like Milligan, may not have been engaged in legal acts of hostility as he is not a lawful belligerent. Milligan's membership in the Sons of Liberty did not make him a legitimate belligerent, nor did it justify his detention as a prisoner of war. The government argues that Padilla, unlike Milligan, is associated with the armed forces of the enemy, making him a belligerent. The distinction in Quirin was the nature of the enemy forces with whom he was associated, rather than mere association with a hostile force. The petitioners in Quirin were working for the armed forces of an enemy State in a declared war. The validity of Milligan has been questioned by scholars, with some suggesting it only applies to martial law or civil wars. The portion in Milligan stating Congress couldn't authorize the President to detain civilians may have less precedential value. The Hamdi Court emphasized that Milligan was not a prisoner of war, distinguishing it from Quirin. The law of war allows seizing bodies and property of enemy aliens. The Administration argues that detaining \"enemy combatants\" is solely the President's authority, while Congress has the power to regulate captures and confiscation of enemy property. The Steel Seizure Case is cited as a reference for determining the extent of the President's authority. The Court declared unconstitutional President Truman's order seizing control of steel mills during a labor dispute, citing lack of legislative authority. Justice Jackson outlined criteria for determining Presidential authority, emphasizing the need for congressional authorization. In cases where the President's actions go against Congress's will, his power is weakest as he can only rely on his own constitutional powers. The courts can only support the President's exclusive control if they prevent Congress from acting on the matter. The President's claim to such power must be both conclusive and preclusive. The President's claim to exclusive power must be scrutinized carefully to maintain the balance of our constitutional system. The disagreement lies in whether specific authorization from Congress is required for the actions taken. Padilla and Hamdi argue that such authorization is missing, while the government asserts that Congressional authority exists, citing the Authorization to Use Force and title 10, U.S.C. The government argues that the identification and detention of enemy combatants is authorized by Congress' provision in the Authorization to Use Force and title 10, U.S.C. The scope of this authority remains debated, with some questioning the absence of explicit language regarding the detention of alien enemies or American citizens captured in war. The government argues that the lack of a formal declaration of war does not affect the authority to detain alien enemies or American citizens captured away from the battlefield. While a declaration may not be necessary for the existence of an armed conflict under international law, it may be needed to determine the applicable domestic laws for aliens or citizens. Statutory provisions like the Alien Enemy Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act require a declared war for their application, not just authorization to use force. The Emergency Detention Act from 1950 to 1971 also had similar requirements before its measures could be invoked. The Uniform Code of Military Justice allows for the detention and trial of civilians suspected of aiding the enemy during a war declared by Congress. The requirement for a formal declaration of war by Congress in these cases is still unclear, but previous legal reasoning suggests it may not be necessary. The Manual for Courts Martial (MCM) defines \"time of war\" to include declared war and a factual determination by the President of hostilities. The MCM does not restrict references to \"enemy\" to mean an enemy government or its armed forces, as offenses like \"misbehavior before the enemy\" do not require a declaration of war. Military practice includes detaining enemy combatants in conflicts without a formal declaration of war or congressional authorization. The Manual for Courts Martial (MCM) defines \"time of war\" broadly, including declared war or a factual determination of hostilities by the President. The issue of holding citizens as \"enemy combatants\" without a formal declaration of war remains unresolved in modern court rulings. While international law favors capturing enemies on the battlefield, war powers involving off-battlefield conduct have traditionally been subject to legislation rather than implied authority. The Supreme Court ruled that the President cannot create regulations for capturing enemy property without a declared war, even with limited war authorization from Congress. It is argued that military detention of non-military persons in the US, especially US citizens, requires Congress's explicit permission. This raises questions about whether Congress intended to allow the President to detain American citizens with fewer restrictions than enemy aliens during a declared war. The AUMF may authorize the use of force anywhere in the world, including within the United States, against persons involved in terrorist activities. This raises questions about the extent of the President's authority to declare individuals as wartime enemies and use force against them, even within the US. Some argue for a more limited interpretation of the AUMF to align with international law. The AUMF may authorize the use of force worldwide, including in the US, against terrorists. Questions arise about the President's authority to declare individuals as enemies and use force, aligning with international law. Arguments exist regarding the interpretation of the AUMF in relation to international law and the Constitution, particularly concerning the detention of enemy combatants. The government argues that Congress also authorized the detention of enemy combatants under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 956(5), but the Supreme Court plurality did not address this, relying on the AUMF for authority. The Second Circuit in Padilla rejected the argument that funds must \"clearly\" authorize detention of American citizens. The government dropped the argument in the Fourth Circuit, but it was found persuasive. The legislative history of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 956(5) does not show acceptance of a separate category of wartime detainees. The language was first codified in 1984 and has been included in defense appropriations bills since 1942. The defense appropriations bill authorizes the Secretary of War to use available funds for expenses related to maintaining prisoners of war and other detainees in military custody. This includes building facilities like stockades and providing water supply. During Senate debate, a question was raised about a specific page in the bill. Senator from Tennessee is asked about new language in the bill regarding expenses for maintaining prisoners of war and other individuals in Army custody. The Senator explains that enemies found in the country are taken up by the Army and need to be provided for, including civilians who may need care. There is a query about existing laws governing the detention of these individuals. The Army wants to ensure there is legal authority for taking certain individuals into custody. The committee inserted a provision in the bill to address this. It is deemed necessary to detain certain individuals for the country's safety, but the specific legal authority for this action is questioned. The Army seeks legal authority to detain individuals for safety reasons, but there is currently no authorization for their care, feeding, and imprisonment. Senator Danaher questions the lack of statutory provision for taking them into custody. Senator Danaher looked up the authority for the Army to detain persons, citing the Alien Enemy Act. He highlighted the President's proclamations under this authority and emphasized the importance of understanding the situation. The amendment was agreed to. The amendment was agreed to in 1983 and codified in 1984. The Senate debate focused on the meaning of \"other persons similar to prisoners of war\" and the President's authority to detain prisoners of war. The legislative history suggests the language was meant to pay for authority found elsewhere, such as in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 21. It is unlikely that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7956(5) would amend 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 21 regarding the requirement for a declared war or Presidential proclamation. The Defense Authorization Act does not imply authorization for actions not provided for by Congress. Legislation post-Act suggests Congress did not intend for anyone to be interned in the US except as a prisoner of war or enemy alien. In 1945, a provision criminalized aiding in the escape of interned individuals. The petitioners in Hamdi and Padilla argued that detaining U.S. citizens as \"enemy combatants\" without statutory authority is forbidden by Congress. They referenced 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001(a), which prohibits the imprisonment or detention of citizens without congressional approval. This provision was created to prevent internments like those during WWII. The Supreme Court has interpreted this law to prohibit any detention by the U.S. without congressional authorization. The Supreme Court ruled against detaining U.S. citizens without congressional authorization, except in cases following the law of war. Justices had differing opinions on the application of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) in Hamdi and Padilla cases. The Department of Justice argues that the AUMF applies to both cases. The Fourth Circuit previously found that \u00a7 4001(a) does not apply to enemy combatants like Hamdi, but may apply to U.S. prisoners like Padilla. Congress has the authority to regulate the detention of enemy combatants, as seen in the Detention of Enemy Combatants Act introduced in the 109th Congress. The Detention of Enemy Combatants Act, H.R. 1076, introduced in the 109th Congress, asserts congressional authority to limit the detention of U.S. persons as enemy combatants to defined circumstances and address due process concerns. The act would authorize the President to detain U.S. persons in certain situations. H.R. 1076 authorizes the detention of U.S. citizens and residents deemed \"enemy combatants\" with access to legal representation. It does not suspend habeas corpus and does not apply to non-U.S. citizens captured overseas. The bill acknowledges the challenges in identifying enemy combatants in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The bill authorizes the detention of U.S. citizens and residents deemed \"enemy combatants\" to protect national security interests. It allows the Executive broad latitude in determining who may be detained and emphasizes the need for congressional authorization for detention. The bill authorizes the detention of U.S. persons connected with terrorist acts, ensuring constitutional protections and habeas corpus rights, with Congress responsible for oversight to guarantee due process. Section 3 of the bill authorizes the detention of enemy combatants, defined as U.S. persons or residents involved with Al Qaeda in terrorist acts against the United States. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, would establish the criteria for designating enemy combatants. The military would use existing rules of engagement to identify enemy combatants during battle. Section 4 of the bill outlines procedural requirements for detaining U.S. persons or residents who may pose a threat to the United States. It includes clear standards, procedures to preserve the government's ability to detain individuals, protection of classified information, access to judicial review, and access to counsel. Section 5 limits the duration of detention to the ongoing war against Al Qaeda. The President must certify ongoing war against Al Qaeda and detainee investigation for prosecution. Detention must prevent aid in terrorist acts. Certification renewed every 180 days. Secretary of Defense designates detention location with humane treatment requirements. Reports to Congress required. Section 6 of H.R. 1076 requires an annual report to Congress identifying individuals detained under the Act. It is unclear who would be \"subject to\" the provisions but not detained. Section 7 defines a \"U.S. person\" as per the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(20) and its inclusion in H.R. 1076. It also mentions a separate subsection defining \"U.S. person or resident\" to include aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. H.R. 1076 aims to cover a broader category of persons than the current definition, excluding aliens lawfully admitted on a temporary basis or unlawfully present in the U.S. The omission raises questions about the President's authority to detain individuals not covered under the defined section. Section 8 of the bill includes a sunset provision terminating the authority by December 31, 2007, or earlier if the conflict with Al Qaeda ends. Petitioners argue for U.S. citizens held in military custody under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7. Petitioners argue that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001(a) prohibits military detention of U.S. citizens as enemy combatants, leaving legal questions under the Constitution and international law. The Supreme Court has not expressly upheld detention of U.S. citizens during war, and Ex parte Milligan invalidated military detention of a civilian for law of war violations. The Milligan Court ruled that Congress cannot authorize military jurisdiction in areas not under martial law. The legality of detaining enemy combatants without solid legal precedent is debated. The Korematsu decision only upheld the exclusion of Japanese-Americans from military areas. Ex parte Endo invalidated the detention of a loyal U.S. citizen. In 1950, Congress passed the Emergency Detention Act (EDA), which allowed the President to detain individuals deemed likely to engage in espionage or sabotage during an Internal Security Emergency. The act was never enforced, and H.R. 1076 aims to provide detainees with access to counsel and the right to challenge their detention through a writ of habeas corpus. H.R. 1076 raises concerns about violating the constitutional prohibition of bills of attainder by authorizing the President to detain individuals based on their affiliation with Al Qaeda. The detention is seen as potentially punitive, despite being preventive in nature. Section 5 requires certification for detention, linking it to ongoing investigations or legal proceedings. The Detention of Enemy Combatants Act may face challenges as a potential violation of ex post facto laws, which prohibit punishing individuals for acts that were innocent when committed. This could apply if a U.S. person is detained for past involvement with Al Qaeda or cooperation with terrorists. The Detention of Enemy Combatants Act may be challenged for violating ex post facto laws if a detainee is held for past involvement with Al Qaeda or cooperation with terrorists. The legality of detention depends on meeting constitutional requirements for temporary deprivation of liberty. The Act does not apply to non-resident aliens or non-citizens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Legislation may raise constitutional issues when it applies differently to non-resident aliens, as all aliens in the US have protected liberty interests under the Fifth Amendment. While administrative decisions on immigration status have less stringent due process requirements than criminal procedures, aliens are not treated as having fewer rights under the Constitution in other proceedings. However, during a declared war, enemy aliens can be detained and deported based on their nationality. During a declared war, enemy aliens can be subject to detention and deportation based on their nationality. The Supreme Court has validated such programs in the past. Congress may have the authority to define who may be interned as an enemy, but the President may need specific authorization from Congress to intern persons as enemies. International legal issues apply to the detention of enemy combatants, as it is subject to the international law of war. H.R. 1076 would not authorize the detention of enemy combatants who are non-permanent resident aliens. H.R. 1076 addresses the detention of enemy combatants under the law of war. It may allow the detention of civilian persons protected by the Fourth Geneva Convention. The application of the 1949 Geneva Conventions during the war on terrorism is unclear. H.R. 1076 may fulfill U.S. obligations under common article 3 but lacks a clear definition of \"enemy combatant.\" The term \"enemy combatant\" is typically used in the context of the law of war. Combatants, including soldiers and others engaged in combat, are lawful military targets, but capture and detention are preferred over killing. Aiders and abettors of the enemy are usually treated as criminal civilians, not lawful military targets. The use of military force against enemy combatants and criminals in areas with law and order suggests a global battle scenario. The Supreme Court's stance on \"enemy combatants\" is still evolving. The Supreme Court's evolving stance on \"enemy combatants\" and executive detention for the war on terrorism remains uncertain. Lower courts have not reached a consensus on the extent of executive power, raising questions about Congress's authorization for detaining American citizens without trial. The broad language of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force allows for military action to prevent terrorism, but it may not grant the President all war powers typically reserved for formal declarations of war. The President may assert war powers for detaining individuals like Hamdi captured on the battlefield during hostilities, while Congress may withhold authority for individuals like Padilla, an accused enemy agent operating domestically, except through regular due process of law. Congressional activity post-Quirin decision suggests no significant departure in restricting civil liberties during war. If Congress passes legislation allowing detention of individuals as enemy combatants, future detentions may face fewer legal obstacles. However, constitutional due process issues are still likely to arise."
