Congress finds that approximately 6,000,000 Jews were killed during the Holocaust, with John Pehle playing a crucial role in persuading President Roosevelt to take action to rescue Jews from Nazi extermination camps during World War II. During the Holocaust, John Pehle helped secure funds for the rescue of Jews in France and Romania and provided critical information to President Roosevelt about the plight of deported Jews in Europe. John Pehle, along with Secretary Morgenthau and Randolph Paul, met with President Franklin Roosevelt on January 16, 1944, to deliver a document titled Personal Report to the President. This led to the establishment of the War Refugee Board through Executive Order 9417, with John Pehle appointed as the Acting Executive Director. John Pehle played a crucial role in implementing the US government's policy to rescue and provide relief to victims of enemy oppression. He drafted a diplomatic cable to all US missions to prevent the Nazis from exterminating Jews and other persecuted minorities in Europe. John Pehle spearheaded new programs to increase refugee flow from Nazi persecution to neutral countries in Europe, allowing for resettlement in Northern Africa, Palestine, and the Americas. In 1944, he and the War Refugee Board facilitated food aid to stateless civilians in internment camps and supported 3,000,000 Allied and Axis prisoners of war. President Franklin Roosevelt promoted John Pehle to Executive Director of the War Refugee Board in March 1944, coinciding with a warning issued by the Board against those involved in the systematic murder of Jews in Europe. In April 1944, the Board, under Pehle's direction, urged neutral nations to increase diplomatic missions in Hungary to prevent the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps. John Pehle led the War Refugee Board's efforts to rescue hundreds of thousands of Jews from Nazi concentration camps in 1944 and 1945, supporting Holocaust survivors and upholding American values of aiding the oppressed. Raoul Wallenberg's heroic actions saved over 100,000 Hungarian Jews with the help of resources provided by sympathizers. Congress authorizes the presentation of a gold medal to John Pehle's family for his service to the nation. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal. Duplicate medals may be created. The Secretary is authorized to create duplicate bronze medals of the gold medal, with proceeds covering costs. The medals are considered national medals and numismatic items under the Act. Proceeds from sales can be used as authorized. SEC. 5. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE. The United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund can be used to pay for the costs of medals struck under this Act. Sales of duplicate bronze medals will deposit funds into the Fund."
