    "content": "The U.S. Public Health Service aims to increase breastfeeding rates among mothers, with targets set for different stages of infancy. Health professionals recommend breastfeeding for at least the first six months of life. Breastfeeding rates have been steadily increasing since 1992. Breastfeeding rates increased steadily from 1992-2004, believed to benefit both mother and child by reducing childhood illnesses and chronic diseases. Concerns arise for working mothers needing to express milk during work hours or breastfeed in public places. Legal issues and controversies have emerged regarding where a mother can breastfeed. State and federal legislation related to breastfeeding has been proposed and enacted. Legislation at the state level addresses issues such as exemption of nursing mothers from public nudity laws, affirmation of breastfeeding in public places, and exemption from jury service. Thirty-eight states and Puerto Rico have laws protecting nursing mothers and promoting breastfeeding. Some states also have laws regarding breastfeeding in the workplace and support programs. At the federal level, legislation has been enacted to support breastfeeding mothers, including excusing or postponing jury duty and affirming the right to breastfeed in federal buildings. Proposed legislation in the 109th Congress aims to further promote breastfeeding. The 109th Congress has proposed legislation to further promote breastfeeding, including the Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention America Act (S. 1074) and the Child Health Investment for Long-term Development Act of 2005 (H.R. 4222). These measures are currently in committee. S.Res. 403 authorizes the President to provide assistance for improving the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. The Breastfeeding Promotion Program, part of the Child Nutrition Programs, promotes breastfeeding as the best method of infant nutrition and aims to increase public acceptance in the United States. The Breastfeeding Promotion Program, authorized by the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004, aims to build a supportive breastfeeding environment for women. Funding for federal breastfeeding support is provided by the FY2006 Department of Agriculture appropriations bill. Funding for federal breastfeeding support was appropriated for not less than $15 million for a breastfeeding support initiative and other activities in the proposed Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2007. Legislation affirms the right to breastfeed on federal property or in federal buildings. In the 108th Congress, bills were introduced to support breastfeeding. S. 418 and H.R. 2790 aimed to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect breastfeeding as a form of sex discrimination in employment. The bill proposed to protect lactation as a form of sex discrimination and amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit for employers enabling mothers to breastfeed at work. It also aimed to expand the definition of medical care to include breastfeeding equipment and services, set performance standards for breast pumps, and ensure women receive information on breastfeeding. Other bills in the 108th Congress indirectly referenced breastfeeding in relation to mercury exposure and HIV prevention. Several bills and a resolution in the 109th Congress address aspects of breastfeeding, including protection for new mothers in the workplace, tax incentives, and performance standards for breast pumps. H.R. 2122, introduced by Representative Carolyn Maloney, aims to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect breastfeeding, provide tax incentives, and set performance standards for breast pumps. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act Amendments of 2005 aim to promote breastfeeding in the workplace by clarifying that it is protected conduct under Title VII. This includes amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to define sex discrimination to include lactation. The bill aims to promote breastfeeding in the workplace by clarifying sex discrimination to include lactation. It proposes a tax credit for employers providing breastfeeding facilities, covering 50% of qualified expenses up to $10,000. Qualified expenses include breast pumps, consultation services, and other related exclusive use property. The bill proposes a tax credit for employers providing breastfeeding facilities, covering 50% of qualified expenses up to $10,000. This includes breast pumps and other exclusive use property. Title III of the bill focuses on safe and effective breast pumps, requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish performance standards for breast pumps suitable for regular workplace use. Title IV of the bill would amend the definition of \"medical care\" in the Internal Revenue Code to include breastfeeding equipment and services. This includes breast pumps and other equipment designed to assist mothers in breastfeeding or expressing milk for their child. The bill also requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish standards for breast pumps suitable for regular workplace use. The HeLP America Act, introduced by Senator Tom Harkin in 2005, includes provisions for wellness programs and breastfeeding. Section 105 of Title I establishes the \"Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative\" for hospitals to be certified as breastfeeding centers. Certification is based on international guidelines. The HeLP America Act introduced provisions for wellness programs and breastfeeding. Hospitals would need to meet requirements for breastfeeding policy and treatment to be certified as baby-friendly. The Director would assess compliance and provide up to $20,000 for certification. Another provision establishes a task force for promoting breastfeeding in the workplace. The bill introduces a task force for promoting breastfeeding in the workplace, with guidelines for composition, appointment periods, and funding sources. It also amends the Family and Medical Leave Act to include provisions for lactation periods and facilities at work, requiring employers to provide lactation periods during each work day. The bill requires employers to provide lactation periods and facilities at work, with provisions for enforcement and remedies. It also amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to improve the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. The bill aims to improve the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries by establishing a comprehensive strategy and an Interagency Task Force. It highlights the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding in preventing infant deaths and recognizes the advantages of breastfeeding in a resolution introduced by Senator Richard Durbin. The resolution introduced by Senator Richard Durbin aims to protect a mother's right to breastfeed and remove barriers faced by women. Legislation concerning breastfeeding may be introduced in the 109th and 110th Congress."
