    "content": "The \"Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The definitions are outlined in Section 2. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms such as Administrator, air carrier, aircraft, airport, foreign air transportation, and interstate air transportation. The term \"major air carrier\" refers to an air carrier that holds a certificate under section 41102 of title 49, US Code, and accounted for at least 1% of domestic-scheduled passenger revenues in the previous year. A \"qualified individual\" is someone licensed, certified, or otherwise qualified to provide medical care in a State, including an ambulance attendant. The Administrator will review FAA regulations on medical kit equipment and training for flight attendants. If necessary, revised regulations will be proposed. Additionally, reports on deaths that occur on aircraft will be required. During the 1-year period after the enactment of this Act, a major air carrier must submit monthly reports to the Administrator detailing the number of deaths on their aircraft, including age and cause of death, specifically focusing on cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation. The Administrator may request information on deaths or medical incidents on aircraft, including whether the aircraft was diverted, to aid in deciding on requiring automatic external defibrillators in airports and on air carriers. SEC. 5. DECISION ON AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS. The Administrator must decide within 120 days whether automatic external defibrillators should be required in airports and on aircraft operated by air carriers. If required, regulations or legislation must be proposed to implement the decision. If the Administrator decides that automatic external defibrillators should be required on aircraft operated by air carriers, a notice of the decision will be published in the Federal Register. The decision will include information on the size of aircraft and class of flights where defibrillators should be required. The proposed regulations for defibrillators on aircraft and at airports include requirements for training, equipment, and medication. The proposed regulations for defibrillators at airports include requirements for equipment and medication. The Administrator cannot mandate defibrillators on helicopters or aircraft with a payload capacity of 7,500 pounds or less. Individuals are generally not liable for damages in Federal or State court for providing assistance during an in-flight medical emergency, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct."
