    "content": "The Army is composed of an Active Component (AC) and a Reserve Component (RC), with debates over the distribution of units between them. Advocates either favor a stronger AC emphasis or a stronger RC emphasis, with some believing RC units can replace AC force structure while saving money. The distribution of units between the Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) in the Army is a topic of debate. Advocates of a stronger AC emphasis argue that replacing certain AC units with RC units may not be cost-effective and could hinder the Army's ability to respond rapidly to crises. Congress plays a significant role in determining the AC/RC force mix, with broad powers over the armed forces outlined in the Constitution. Congress plays a significant role in authorizing and funding the Army's Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC), setting end strengths, ensuring proper equipment and supplies, determining pay and benefits, establishing personnel policies, and overseeing the Department of Defense. It also has the authority to allocate roles and missions, adjust reserve activation authorities, determine training regimens, establish or disestablish units, specify unit composition, and designate the number and types of units within each component. In recent years, interest in the AC/RC mix has grown, especially for the Army, due to large-scale mobilizations of RC forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Concerns about federal spending and budget constraints have led to considerations of shifting towards a more cost-effective RC force structure. The Administration's FY2015 budget request proposes this shift towards the RC. The Administration proposes shifting the AC/RC mix towards the RC, with RC forces making up 54.1% of the Army by FY2017. There are discussions about reallocating brigade combat teams towards the ARNG, and the Army's Aviation Restructuring Initiative suggests moving attack helicopters to the AC. Other proposals recommend a greater shift towards the RC, with RC forces making up 58% of the Army. The debate over the Army's force structure mix between active and reserve components intensifies in Congress, with discussions on the importance and relevance of each component in the future strategic environment. Competition for resources between the active and reserve components will be a key issue in the 113th Congress. Competition between active and reserve components for resources will fuel debate, as seen in the Air Force's force structure recommendations. The ratio of AC and RC forces has shifted over time, with Congress playing a central role. Historically, force structure was mainly in the reserve component, except during major conflicts when the active component was expanded. During World War II, the U.S. armed forces grew from 350,000 to over 12 million personnel. After the war, the size was reduced to 1.5 million, but during the Korean War in 1950, it doubled to 3.2 million with a major reserve mobilization. The active force size remained relatively stable in the following decade. Since the Korean War, the United States has maintained most of its force structure in the active component, with a slight majority of Army force structure being in the reserve component since 1989. Active duty forces continue to dominate the military, unlike the pre-World War II era when militia and reserve forces outnumbered standing elements. The American military posture is still dominated by standing forces of the four military services, despite a shift towards ready reserves since the Cold War. The Total Force Policy, established in 1973, aimed to integrate Active, Guard, and Reserve forces into a cohesive unit. General Creighton Abrams implemented a policy to integrate Guard and Reserve forces with the active Army, rebuilding it to 16 divisions within budgetary limits. This ensured that the Army could not be deployed to war without the Guard and Reserve, as seen in Vietnam. The roundout brigade program was a key aspect of this integration, restructuring certain divisions to include Reserve Component brigades. In the 1970s and 1980s, initiatives were implemented to improve active-reserve integration, including assigning AC divisions two AC brigades and a \"roundout\" National Guard brigade. A new law in 1976 made it easier to activate RC personnel. The Persian Gulf War in 1990-91 tested this integration, with over 238,000 RC personnel activated, strengthening support for the Total Force Policy. RC performance in the conflict supported the Total Force Policy, but areas of readiness needed improvement, particularly with the roundout brigades. Three ARNG brigades were mobilized for Operation Desert Shield, but faced delays and readiness deficiencies, not becoming combat ready until after the war ended. The roundout brigades were not activated until four months after Desert Shield began, did not deploy with their parent divisions, and were not combat ready until the day of the cease-fire. Controversy arose over their viability and readiness levels, with criticism focused on their lack of readiness to deploy immediately in response to a crisis. The roundout brigades faced readiness problems before Desert Shield/Storm but were validated for deployment three months after activation. The Persian Gulf War led to reforms with the Army National Guard Combat Readiness Reform Act of 1992, focusing on improving ARNG combat units' readiness and compatibility with AC units. The Army National Guard Combat Readiness Reform Act of 1992 aimed to enhance ARNG readiness by recruiting experienced personnel, revising training focus, improving medical evaluations, ensuring system compatibility, and providing more funding for early deploying units. The end of the roundout brigade program in 1993, coupled with the Soviet Union's collapse, accelerated the integration of Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) forces. During the post-Cold War era, the Army National Guard and Army Reserve underwent restructuring to align with reduced force requirements. The Army National Guard retained combat and support units, while the Army Reserve focused on support roles and provided Echelon Above Division and Echelon Above Corps units. The drawdown was followed by increased deployment of Reserve Component forces in various conflicts. The increased deployment of Reserve Component forces in conflicts like Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Haiti led to a shift in perspective on their suitability as substitutes for Active Component units. The performance of RC units in Iraq and Afghanistan validated the Total Force Policy, although some argue that AC and RC units are not interchangeable. The deployment of Reserve Component forces in Iraq and Afghanistan led to debates over their effectiveness compared to Active Component units. Despite arguments that RC units had less complex missions, advocates claim they were effective and could have handled combined arms maneuver missions if given the opportunity. Congress authorized expansions of the active Army and Marine Corps during these conflicts, leading to a higher ratio of AC to RC forces. However, with the end of the wars and ongoing reduction of forces, a multi-year drawdown of AC forces is underway, likely resulting in a decline in the proportion of AC to RC forces in these Services. The Army determines unit distribution between AC, ARNG, and USAR through Total Army Analysis (TAA), which assesses demand based on future scenarios, operational needs, and resource constraints. The AC/RC force mix is dynamic, influenced by national security strategies and available resources. The Army has the largest reserve component and the highest ratio of reserve to active personnel. The Army consists of an Active Component and two Reserve Components: the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. The Active Component includes soldiers who serve full-time and can be deployed worldwide for various military operations. It comprises both combat and support units. The Army's reserve components, the Army National Guard of the United States and the United States Army Reserve, provide trained units and qualified personnel for active duty in times of war or national emergency. The Army National Guard also has a state role, stemming from colonial-era militias. The Army National Guard, with a long historical pedigree, is both a federal and state organization consisting of 54 separate National Guard organizations. The ARNG has been a part of the organized militia of states since 1933 and falls under Congress' authority to raise and support Armies. The Army National Guard consists of 54 separate organizations, with one under federal control and the others operating at the state or territorial level. National Guardsmen can be called to duty in various ways, with part-time personnel required to train regularly. Additionally, there are full-time support personnel who handle daily functions. The Army National Guard consists of 54 separate organizations, with part-time personnel required to train regularly. Full-time support personnel handle daily functions, including equipment and aircraft maintenance, and operational missions as authorized by government titles. The ARNG can be federalized during war or other military missions, and also assists in natural disasters and homeland security operations under state governor control. The USAR, established in 1908, is a purely federal entity with direct combat and support units. The US Army Reserve (USAR) is a federal entity composed mainly of support units. Part-time soldiers train regularly, with full-time support personnel making up 14% of total strength. Unlike the Army National Guard, the USAR is always under federal control and focuses on brigade-level operations. Brigades can operate independently and can be combined with other units for missions. The US Army Reserve is composed mainly of support units and focuses on brigade-level operations. Brigades can be combined with other units to form divisions, corps, and armies for large-scale operations. The Army is part of a joint team and plays a significant role in providing landpower in joint operations. The Army's role in joint operations is to provide landpower, defined as the ability to gain, sustain, and exploit control over land, resources, and people. This includes imposing the Nation's will on adversaries, establishing a stable environment for peace, addressing catastrophic events, and supporting forces in the air and sea. The Army's contribution to the joint force depends on its ability to exercise landpower effectively. The Army's role in joint operations is to exercise landpower, controlling land, resources, and people to maintain advantages gained by joint forces. The Army provides critical enabling capabilities such as joint command and control, communications, air and missile defense, and logistics. The AC/RC force mix is determined by national security strategic guidance documents, outlining the Army's role and specific missions in the national security architecture. The Army uses specific missions and responsibilities to determine the type of force needed, balancing between heavier and lighter forces for various operations. Budgetary considerations and strategic guidance influence the size and composition of the Army, aiming for a \"full spectrum\" force capable of diverse operations. Resources are allocated during conflicts to expand the Army and provide necessary equipment and training. During conflicts, the Army receives resources for expansion and training. However, during peace, resources decrease, impacting readiness and modernization efforts. The Total Army Analysis process determines the AC/RC force mix based on future scenarios and operational demands. The Army determines its AC/RC force mix based on future scenarios, operational demands, and resource constraints. The force mix is presented to Army leadership for budget approval. The Army expresses the force mix in terms of units, with the brigade combat team (BCT) being the primary unit. In FY2014, there were 38 Active Component BCTs and 28 Army National Guard BCTs. The Army decided to add a \"maneuver battalion\" to its Infantry BCTs and Armored BCTs in 2013. The Army is adding an additional maneuver battalion to its Infantry and Armored BCTs, increasing combat capability despite BCT deactivations. The Army aims for a force structure of 52 BCTs to implement defense strategy effectively. The Army is adjusting its force structure to meet sequestration-imposed funding levels, with potential reductions in FY2016. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates across-the-board spending cuts, impacting defense programs. DOD guidance influences the Army's force levels and budget planning. The Army is adjusting its force structure due to sequestration-imposed funding cuts, potentially reducing its size to 420,000 AC, 315,000 ARNG, and 185,000 USAR. This force level would result in insufficient capacity to implement the U.S. defense strategy. Non-BCT formations, such as combat aviation brigades and logistics units, also play a significant role in military operations. The Army is adjusting its force structure due to funding cuts, potentially reducing its size. Non-BCT units, like combat aviation brigades, are important in military operations. The mix of AC and RC forces is complex, with factors like utilization, readiness, effectiveness, cost, and risk considered. In March 2014, the Army proposed the Aviation Restructuring Initiative (ARI) to reallocate aircraft between AC and National Guard units for better mission alignment and cost savings. This proposal has sparked discussions. The major elements in developing the AC/RC force mix include utilization, readiness, effectiveness, cost, and risk, all linked to meeting national security requirements in a budget-constrained environment. Other factors, particularly concerning the National Guard, are also considered. Anticipated future demand for Army units is a key driver for force structure, involving assumptions about likely threats, deployment frequency, and mission types. The demand for Army units is a key factor in determining the AC/RC force mix. AC and RC units may not always be interchangeable due to differences in availability and capability. AC units are often better positioned to respond to immediate crises. AC units are better positioned to respond to immediate crises as they require less preparation time. AC units are preferred for missions with a substantial train-up period, while AC units are often chosen for forward presence missions overseas. Some argue that AC units are superior to RC units in certain capabilities, especially for high-intensity combat missions. The use of Reserve Component (RC) units is debated for certain missions, such as high-intensity combat or combined arms maneuver. Historically, activation of RC units was limited to times of war or national emergencies, but new authorities allow for activation without a declaration of emergency. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act expanded activation authorities for reservists, allowing activations for up to 120 days for disaster response and up to one year for preplanned missions. This has increased the use of reservists and eased concerns about their availability. Since 2007, there have been limitations on the activation of reserve forces, including statutory limits on the number of reservists that can be activated and the duration of their active duty. Additionally, DOD policy imposes stricter restrictions on the frequency and duration of reserve activations. Defense planners must consider the time it takes to activate reservists, notify units, assemble personnel, and conduct training. Army units in World War II typically deployed for the duration of conflicts. During World War II, Army units deployed for the duration of conflicts. However, starting with the Korean War, individuals were rotated in and out of theater periodically. In Vietnam, soldiers had one-year tours of duty before returning home. This rotation policy aimed to prevent extended periods in combat but caused turbulence affecting unit cohesion. Concerns about separating soldiers from their families for long periods arose with the growth of military families. The DOD established deployment policies for the Active and Reserve forces due to the prolonged operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The DOD established a \"deployment-to-dwell\" policy in 2007 for Active and Reserve components, with AC forces having one year of deployment followed by two years at home station, and RC units having one year mobilized followed by five years demobilized. AC units are tied to time deployed, while RC units are tied to time mobilized, including pre-deployment training. Deployment policies were implemented due to prolonged operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The differences in policy for Active (AC) and Reserve (RC) units play a critical role in cost estimates using a deployed unit cost approach. Questions arise about the major threats Army units will face, response times, types of units, duration of operations, and the need for multiple deployments. Considerations include the capabilities of AC and RC forces, their alignment with force structure, and statutory limits. The readiness of military forces is crucial for meeting assigned missions. Questions arise about aligning determinations with force structure, modifying reserve activation authorities, adjusting deployment-to-dwell ratios, and ensuring sufficient rest time between deployments for recruiting and retention. The Department of Defense defines readiness as the ability to fight and meet mission demands, with reporting done through the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRSS). The Army determines unit readiness through the Commanders Unit Status Reports (CUSR) submitted to DRSS-Army. Readiness is assessed based on personnel, equipment availability, equipment readiness, and training. Unit commanders lead the evaluation process following Army regulations, sometimes requiring professional military judgment. The Army determines unit readiness through Commanders Unit Status Reports (CUSR) submitted to DRSS-Army. Readiness is assessed based on personnel availability, equipment readiness, and training. Regulations require the commander to apply professional military judgment, especially in training assessments. Personnel readiness is measured using \"P-level metrics\" including ratios of available personnel for deployment, qualified personnel in duty positions, and senior personnel. Ratings from these metrics determine the overall \"P-rating\" of the unit. The Army assesses unit readiness through Commanders Unit Status Reports (CUSR) based on personnel availability, equipment readiness, and training. The \"P-rating\" is determined by the lowest of three ratings, reflecting personnel shortages. Another factor is the \"S-level,\" which assesses the availability of key equipment based on ratios of critical items possessed compared to authorized amounts. The S-level assesses the availability of key equipment in a unit based on ratios of critical items possessed compared to authorized amounts. Ratios generate a rating between 1 and 4, with the lowest rating determining the overall \"S-rating\" of the unit. Units are assessed as S-1 with all important equipment, while shortages result in ratings of S-2, S-3, or S-4. Funding plays a significant role in equipment availability. The availability of equipment in Army units is heavily influenced by funding and allocation decisions. In the past, RC units had lower priority for equipment compared to AC units, but this changed during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2013, AC units had 91% of their authorized equipment on hand, ARNG had 91%, and Army Reserve had 86%. Equipment readiness is also important, ensuring that the unit's equipment is fully functional. The \"R-level\" in Army units is determined by the percentage of fully mission capable equipment and weapon systems. It is heavily influenced by funding and unit manning, with RC units having dedicated support personnel for maintenance. Lack of funding can lead to poor equipment readiness. The readiness of Army units is assessed based on personnel, equipment, and training. Training readiness is subjective and relies on commanders' judgment. Units are evaluated on mission essential tasks and rated as trained, needs practice, or untrained. All units, regardless of component, train to the same standard. During the ARFORGEN cycle, RC units are funded to achieve platoon or company level proficiency before deployment, while AC units aim for battalion or brigade level proficiency. Variations in training frequency, resources, and unit representation can impact commanders' judgments on training readiness. Operational deployments may also influence the assessment of a unit's proficiency. The C-level rating, derived from four areas (P, S, R & T), reflects a unit's ability to fulfill core functions and mission essential tasks. Commanders can adjust the C-rating based on military judgment, but not the ratings of resource categories. Army commanders have limited ability to upgrade or downgrade the C-level rating of their unit. The C-level rating of a unit can be adjusted by commanders based on military judgment, with limitations on resource category ratings. Commanders can upgrade or downgrade the C-level by one rating level for brigades and smaller organizations, and by up to two levels for divisions and corps headquarters. Approval from a higher ranking commander is required for changes of two rating levels. The metrics discussed are important for measuring readiness, but other measures also exist. Certain measures of readiness, such as personnel turnover rates, skill qualifications, language qualifications, and military education completion, are available to commanders for decision-making. Factors like discipline, morale, leadership, and experience are important but not formally integrated into the readiness assessment process. Due to limited resources, the Army uses \"tiered readiness\" to maintain units at different readiness levels. During the Cold War era, the Army used \"tiered readiness\" to maintain units at different readiness levels. With the reduction in force structure after the Cold War, the Army began using reserve units more frequently and invested in improving their readiness. This approach allows designated units to be continually maintained at the highest state of readiness, while others are kept at lower readiness levels. This helps in sharing the burden of deployment among more Army units. The Army employs the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process to bring units from a lower state of readiness to a high state of readiness for deployment. AC BCTs are trained up to the brigade level, while ARNG BCTs are only trained up to the platoon and company level before mobilization. Additional resources could help improve ARNG BCTs' training readiness. The Defense Readiness Reporting System assesses military forces' ability to meet mission demands. Units with a C-1 rating should have the resources and training proficiency to fulfill core functions effectively. However, disparities in training readiness exist, especially for ARNG BCTs, impacting their deployment in complex or short-notice operations. Some commanders may overestimate or underestimate their unit's training status due to various factors like experience, observation of training events, and attitude towards judging outcomes. Factors like unit discipline, morale, key personnel's tenure, and leadership abilities can significantly impact a unit's ability to fulfill core functions. These factors are not captured by the P, S, and R-level ratings in the Defense Readiness Reporting System. The use of upgrade/downgrade authority for C-level ratings by commanders may introduce disparities in unit readiness ratings. Experience factors not fully captured in P-level ratings, which use grade as a proxy for experience. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) may not fully capture experience differences between Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) personnel, leading to disparities in unit readiness ratings. Factors such as military service years and civilian experience are not adequately reflected in the ratings. It is important to determine if readiness levels differ between AC and RC units and identify factors associated with any differences to improve comparability. Additionally, subjective areas of readiness assessment, like training evaluations, may vary in how AC and RC commanders make determinations. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) is designed to assess unit ability to execute missions based on capabilities. However, there is a lack of studies on the correlation between readiness levels and actual unit performance. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 required a report on costs of deployable units in the Armed Forces. The DOD submitted a report to Congress on the costs of deployable units in the Armed Forces, which was evaluated by the GAO. The GAO noted that the report did not compare the effectiveness of active and reserve units, citing differences in their employment. It is generally accepted that similar active and reserve units should have comparable effectiveness levels after sufficient training, but data on unit effectiveness is limited. The report on the costs of deployable units in the Armed Forces did not include a discussion on the effectiveness of active and reserve units. Data on unit effectiveness is limited, raising questions about the training needed to make reserve units comparable to active units. The report did not address the effectiveness of active and reserve units, highlighting the need to determine the training required to align reserve units with active units in terms of effectiveness, considering factors like training practices, military and civilian experience, readiness levels, and cost considerations. The comparative cost of AC and RC units is a key consideration for policy makers. While inactive RC units are cheaper than AC units, the costs become roughly equivalent when both units are activated due to similar equipment and personnel authorizations. Studies have shown varying cost differentials based on factors like the range of costs considered and the apportionment of costs between AC and RC units. The cost comparison between Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) units is crucial for policymakers. While inactive RC units are cheaper than AC units, the costs become similar when both are activated due to similar equipment and personnel authorizations. Studies show cost differentials based on factors like the range of costs considered, apportionment between AC and RC, and assumptions about RC unit activity levels. Some analyses focus only on personnel costs or include operations and maintenance costs, overlooking other expenses like military procurement and construction costs. The cost comparison between Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) units is essential for policymakers. Various costs, including military procurement, research and development, and construction costs, need to be considered. However, determining comparative AC and RC costs can be challenging due to the exclusion of certain expenses like health care and commissaries. Additionally, costs covered by other agencies, such as Veterans' Affairs and the Treasury Department, also impact the total cost of both AC and RC forces. Determining comparative AC and RC costs is challenging due to difficulties in apportioning certain costs. Some costs can be easily allocated, while others, like procurement of major weapons systems, pose challenges. The active component has separate budgetary accounts for personnel and operations, making allocation easier. However, costs from accounts like R&D, primarily for the active component, are harder to attribute to the reserve component. Determining comparative costs between active and reserve components is complex due to challenges in allocating certain expenses. Costs related to purchasing reserve component equipment should not solely be attributed to the active component, as the reserve component benefits from activities funded by the active component. Some costs are difficult to divide between the two due to a lack of research on the most appropriate allocation methods. For example, determining veterans' benefits usage between active and reserve personnel poses challenges. The comparative costs between active and reserve components are influenced by factors such as the frequency of reserve unit activation. If reserve units cost less than active units when not activated and about the same when activated, costs vary based on activation frequency. An activated reserve unit for one year out of every two years will be more expensive than one activated for one year out of every three years. The cost comparison between active and reserve components is influenced by the frequency of reserve unit activation. An RC unit activated for one year out of every two years will be more expensive than one activated for nine months out of every two years. Deployment-to-dwell ratios are crucial in understanding RC costs, especially with large-scale rotational deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. These ratios also impact the \"boots on the ground\" output metric. The correlation between cost input and various outputs is a significant change in discussing AC and RC costs today. The Army Reserve provides nearly 20% of the Army's trained Soldiers and units, for just six percent of the Army budget. The cost per active soldier is calculated at $200,000 per year, while the cost per reserve soldier is $40,000 per year, indicating that reserve soldiers cost one-fifth as much as active-duty soldiers. This cost allocation method has faced criticism for how costs are distributed between the active and reserve components. The cost allocation method between the Active and Reserve Components has been criticized for not reflecting the work performed. Alternative approaches aim to compare the use of active versus guard and reserve forces per dollar spent, including a \"life-cycle\" cost approach. The cost allocation method between Active and Reserve Components has been criticized for not reflecting the work performed. Alternative approaches compare the costs of active and reserve personnel using a \"life-cycle\" cost approach. The life-cycle cost method estimated the lifetime cost of an AC servicemember at nearly $2.4 million and the RC servicemember at about $790,000. Reserve personnel cost about 60% of what active personnel cost per deployment, making reserves a good deal as they are only paid for when needed. Their retirement being deferred until age 60 makes it much less expensive than for active members. The cost allocation method between Active and Reserve Components has been criticized for not reflecting the work performed. Alternative approaches compare the costs of active and reserve personnel using a \"life-cycle\" cost approach. The second method estimated the compensation for different types of servicemembers and calculated the \"cost per duty day\" in FY2005. Reserve personnel cost between 91% and 109% of what active personnel cost per day of duty performed. The analysis compares the cost of active and reserve personnel per duty day. A busy reservist is cheaper to use than a statutory one. However, adding full-time benefits like TRICARE for Life health care makes part-time reservists more expensive. The focus shifts to the cost of maintaining a continuous unit presence in overseas theaters during high deployment rates to Iraq and Afghanistan. Deployed unit cost models consider variables that impact cost calculations. The \"cost approach\" for comparing AC and RC forces considers deployment-to-dwell ratios and pre-deployment training time. Jacob Klerman first developed this approach in Rethinking the Reserves. The analysis estimates the number of units needed to maintain continuous presence in a deployment location, with AC units requiring three units and RC units requiring eight units. This is based on deployment and training schedules. The author analyzes the cost comparison between Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) units based on deployment-to-dwell ratios. According to DOD guidelines, the relative cost of RC units is 67% of AC units in peacetime and 101% in wartime. The author manipulates variables such as deployment-to-dwell ratios and reserve component involvement in deployments to determine the cost per unit of \"boots on the ground.\" The analysis compares the cost of Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) units based on deployment-to-dwell ratios. Factors such as activation frequency, deployment length, and training time impact the relative costs, ranging from 58% to 141%. Favorable cost scenarios for reserves involve less frequent activation, longer deployments, and lower estimates of RC costs in peacetime. Less favorable scenarios include more frequent activations and intensified AC rotation. The analysis compares the cost of Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) units based on deployment-to-dwell ratios. Factors such as activation frequency, deployment length, and training time impact the relative costs. The Army, like other Services, faces budget constraints and must prioritize resources. DOD uses the concept of risk to convey the impact of inadequate resources on its missions. This includes military and political risk, which relate to the ability of U.S. forces to resource and sustain operations, as well as operational risk, which considers the successful execution of strategy within various costs. The Department of Defense uses risk to assess the impact of insufficient resources on its missions, including military, political, and operational risks. Operational risk involves evaluating the Department's ability to carry out current, planned, and contingency operations within acceptable human, materiel, financial, and strategic costs. Force management risk focuses on recruiting, retaining, training, and equipping the All-Volunteer Force, while institutional risk pertains to management and business practices supporting DOD missions. Future challenges risk evaluates the Department's capacity to successfully execute future missions and prepare for potential shocks. The Department of Defense assesses risks related to insufficient resources for missions, including military, operational, and future challenges. The focus is on fielding superior capabilities to deter emerging threats in the midterm and long term. Many AC/RC force mix proposals do not fully explore risks but instead concentrate on costs. A more comprehensive risk assessment alongside cost evaluations could be more beneficial for decision-makers. The lack of examination of risks in AC/RC force mix proposals compared to costs of AC and RC units raises questions about decision-making priorities. The discussion focuses on examining costs and risks associated with AC and RC units in force mix decisions. Congress may want a detailed analysis of specific risk elements in the force mix process. Decision-makers may need guidelines for comparing cost savings and risks, rather than relying solely on subjective criteria. Factors influencing military forces' ability to meet national security requirements are crucial. Additionally, historical traditions and ideological beliefs play a role in maintaining a substantial military force structure in the National Guard. In the colonial and founding eras, standing armies and a naval establishment were seen as threats to democratic sovereignty. Citizen-soldiers were preferred during military crises. Distrust of professional forces decreased after World War II. Concerns have been raised about the military's reflection of the U.S. population since the All-Volunteer Force in 1973. Reserve components are seen as more geographically dispersed. The current debate about Army AC/RC mix focuses on shifting force structure between the AC and the RC. Some argue that properly trained and equipped reserve forces can replace a portion of AC force structure and generate cost savings. Others believe certain RC forces may not be as capable as AC forces. The debate over the Army's AC/RC mix involves concerns about the readiness and capabilities of reserve forces compared to active duty forces. Some argue that replacing AC units with RC units could hinder the Army's ability to respond quickly to crises and sustain operations. Others suggest adjusting the mix of units between AC and RC to optimize cost-effectiveness. Congress may consider various approaches for the future Army AC/RC mix, including supporting Administration proposals, gathering more information on key factors, directly adjusting the mix, or influencing it by adjusting contributing factors. One option is to back the Administration's proposals on the AC/RC force mix outlined in the President's FY2015 budget request. The President's FY2015 budget request includes proposals for the Army AC/RC mix. Congress considers professional judgment of military officers and officials, with some advocating for more consideration of reserve leaders' opinions. There are concerns about institutional biases in the Army and varying levels of political influence between AC and RC, leading to suboptimal force mix outcomes. Congress may evaluate specific AC/RC mix options for a deeper understanding. Congress could seek additional information to evaluate specific AC/RC mix options by directing new studies or establishing processes to collect, analyze, and share new data. Despite recent studies on AC/RC force mix, unresolved issues remain that could lead to better decisions. Recent studies have provided insight into comparative costs, but disagreements persist on methodological aspects. Areas like readiness levels comparability between AC and RC units have received less research attention. Some analysts believe more emphasis is needed on the role risk plays in determining the appropriate AC/RC mix. Congress could direct studies to compare readiness levels between AC and RC units, assess performance differences at the end of training cycles, and understand the link between readiness metrics and operational performance. The Senate version of the FY2015 NDAA calls for a National Commission on the Future of the Army to address these issues and improve the AC/RC force mix determination process. Army and Army National Guard leaders have conflicting opinions on the need for the National Commission on the Future of the Army. General Raymond Odierno stated that detailed internal and external analysis, including studies by the Rand Corporation and OSD CAPE, have already been conducted. He questions the need for additional expertise from a commission and highlights the potential $1 billion annual cost if the process is delayed. At a hearing, General Frank Grass and Lieutenant General Jeffery Talley expressed differing views on the need for an Army commission. Grass suggested an external review of the Reserve component balance, while Talley believed the Army could address challenges internally due to budget issues. If Congress decides to proceed with a commission on the Army, it is crucial to ensure all three components are well represented. The Army has mixed feelings about the necessity of a national commission, suggesting valuable insights could be gained through other academic endeavors. Existing data may not be sufficient to evaluate arguments on AC/RC mix, and there is a lack of objective data on the effectiveness of AC and RC units. Congress could direct the Army to improve data collection and analysis for better decision-making. Congress could establish an independent agency to analyze and share data valuable for congressional deliberations, especially regarding the comparative effectiveness of AC and RC units. This agency could assess performance during pre-deployment rotations to inform decision-making on AC/RC mix and identify integration barriers. Congress may adjust AC and RC strength levels or reallocate units between components based on the agency's findings, if there is consensus on the need for changes. Congress could directly influence the AC/RC force mix by adjusting end strengths, potentially increasing the role of the Reserve Component in national security or bolstering the Active Component if needed. This could be achieved through changes in end strengths set by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act. Congress has the power to adjust the size of the Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) to meet national security needs. However, these changes could have negative consequences if done hastily or in a way that creates imbalance between combat and support forces. Congress could also direct the transfer of units between components if not satisfied with the proposed force structure. Congress could influence the AC/RC force mix by assigning or prioritizing roles and missions by component, addressing issues concerning the utilization of the components. This approach would allow Congress to impact the force mix without specifying a specific mix, potentially avoiding contentious decisions and strained relationships with the Army. Congress could influence the AC/RC force mix by assigning roles and missions based on the strengths of each component. Utilizing RC for predictable missions that benefit from long-term relationships could optimize force generation processes. This approach would provide predictability for RC units in missions requiring regional expertise, Homeland Defense, or Defense Support to Civil Authorities. One study suggests that missions requiring rapid response or high readiness are best suited for the AC, while another study indicates that engagement missions may be better allocated to RC units. Senior Army officials are hesitant to use RC units for certain missions due to concerns about their training compared to AC units. Differences in training processes and available training days could be mitigated to improve the utility of RC units for complex operations. Some Army leaders argue that ARNG BCTs may not perform complex operations as proficiently as AC BCTs, leading to a heavy reliance on AC BCTs in operational plans. The differences in training processes between AC and RC units contribute to this perception, with AC BCTs trained up to brigade level and ARNG BCTs only up to platoon and company level. This disparity affects the readiness of ARNG BCTs for deployment and conducting assigned missions. The Army Chief of Staff highlighted the readiness issue of ARNG BCTs, stating that without Combat Training Center rotations, they struggle to train at company, battalion, and brigade levels. Complex organizations like brigade combat teams face more difficulties in training compared to less complex units like transportation and maintenance units. The Army Chief of Staff emphasized the readiness challenges of ARNG BCTs due to the lack of Combat Training Center rotations, hindering training at various levels. General Odierno highlighted differences in training between AC and ARNG BCTs, suggesting additional CTC rotations for the latter to address training limitations caused by geographic dispersion. General Mark Milley, the commander of U.S. Army Forces Command, has advocated for additional funding and training days for ARNG BCTs, along with increased access to CTCs. This may require statutory changes and could conflict with civilian employment of reserve personnel, potentially increasing costs. RC personnel face challenges in accessing professional military education opportunities, such as Senior Service Colleges and the Sergeants Major Academy, due to limited slots and the need to balance military training with civilian careers. This can disadvantage them compared to their active duty counterparts. To address the training disparities between Reserve Component (RC) personnel and Active Component (AC) peers, providing more opportunities for individuals to attend professional military education schools could be beneficial. Another approach could involve setting new promotion and assignment criteria for senior RC officers and enlisted personnel, such as requiring specific educational qualifications or developmental assignments. Additionally, mandating a higher number of days of service per year for certain leadership positions could help bridge the gap in training. Some reserve advocates believe that senior AC officers are hesitant to use RC units due to institutional biases, as RC success could weaken the justification for AC force structure. They advocate for increased integration of AC and RC personnel to reduce negative stereotypes and limit the AC's ability to sideline RC units. Promoting greater use of the RC involves making RC units the \"force of first choice\" for certain missions, such as peacekeeping, training foreign militaries, and humanitarian relief. Partnerships between AC and RC units can enhance training levels and integration between the two components. The Army has initiated the \"Total Force Partnership Program\" to pair AC and ARNG units for training and leader development. This program aims to promote informal leader development, shared training opportunities, and lessons learned between various formations such as BCTs, corps, divisions, aviation brigades, fire brigades, and multifunctional brigades. As of June 2014, 20 AC BCTs have been paired with 28 ARNG BCTs. The Total Force Partnership Program pairs AC and ARNG units for training and leader development based on geographic considerations and unit types. This program aims to enhance the effectiveness of both the AC and RC, with potential benefits for RC readiness and force mix. Congress may wish to further explore the benefits of this program. The Aviation Restructure Initiative aims to modernize the Army's aviation units by eliminating obsolete air frames, reducing sustainment costs, and efficiently organizing to meet operational commitments. Congress may consider integrating RC battalions into AC brigades or reserving AC positions for RC personnel on active duty tours. The Aviation Restructure Initiative aims to modernize the Army's aviation units by reducing aircraft in the Active component and National Guard. The Active component will inactivate three combat aviation brigades and move LUH-72s to Fort Rucker for training. The National Guard will maintain 10 aviation brigades, receive Apaches from the Active component, and increase its UH-60 fleet with modern Black Hawk helicopters. Overall, the Active component will reduce by 686 aircraft, while the National Guard will reduce by 111 aircraft. This restructuring will result in more capable formations for responding to contingencies. The Army Reserve is replacing AH-64 Apache Battalions with assault battalions for cost savings. The National Guard Association objects to losing AH-64s, citing loss of capabilities and experienced pilots. The Army's current plan aims to reduce Active Component end strength from 570,000 to 450,000 soldiers, with a potential further reduction to 420,000 soldiers without repeal of budget caps. This would also involve reducing active brigade combat teams from 45 to 32, divesting almost 700 aircraft, and eliminating 3 combat aviation brigades. The Army's plan includes reducing Army National Guard end strength from 358,000 to 335,000 soldiers, potentially further to 315,000 soldiers without budget cap repeal. The Guard would divest AH-64 Apache and OH-58 Kiowa helicopters but receive 111 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from the Active Component for crisis response missions. Units transferring Apache helicopters to the active Army will receive priority for modernized Black Hawks. The Army is concerned about meeting requirements due to budget caps, leading to reductions in end strength and brigade combat teams. The planned reductions include greater cuts in Active Component end strength and brigade combat teams, as well as proposed aviation changes. The committee recommends a review of the methods used to determine the Army's future force structure, including the mix between Active, Guard, and Reserve forces. They also suggest increased funding for procurement and maintenance to convert UH-60A to UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters, procure additional UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters for National Guard modernization, and enhance overall training opportunities. The section prohibits reducing end strength for Army personnel and transferring AH-64 attack helicopters from the Army National Guard to the regular Army in fiscal year 2015. The Comptroller General will assess methods used to determine future force structure of Reserve Component forces. The committee recommends increases in funding for procurement and operation and maintenance accounts to accelerate conversions of UH-60A to UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters, procure six additional UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters for Army National Guard modernization, and increase training opportunities and depot-level maintenance in the Army National Guard. The National Commission on the Future of the Army Act of 2014 prohibits the reduction of Army personnel below authorized end strengths for fiscal year 2015. This includes specific numbers for active duty personnel, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve. Additionally, there are limitations on the use of funds for the transfer or divestment of certain aircraft assigned to the Army National Guard. The National Commission on the Future of the Army Act of 2014 prohibits reducing Army personnel below authorized end strengths for fiscal year 2015, including specific numbers for active duty, National Guard, and Reserve. Funds for fiscal year 2015 cannot be used to divest, retire, or transfer AH-64 Apache aircraft assigned to Army National Guard units as of January 15, 2014, or reduce personnel related to these aircraft below September 30, 2014 levels. The Secretary of the Army must ensure the readiness of these aircraft and crews during fiscal year 2015. The National Commission on the Future of the Army Act of 2014 prohibits reducing Army personnel below authorized end strengths for fiscal year 2015 and restricts the use of funds for AH-64 Apache aircraft. Funds cannot be used to divest, retire, or transfer AH-64 Apache aircraft from the Army National Guard to the regular Army without specific certifications from the Secretary of Defense. The National Commission on the Future of the Army was established with eight members appointed by various officials. Appointments had to be made within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The National Commission on the Future of the Army requires appointments to be made within 90 days of the Act's enactment. If appointments are not made by the specified date, the authority expires and the number of Commission members is reduced. Consideration should be given to individuals with expertise in national and international security policy, military forces capability, and force structure design when making appointments. The National Commission on the Future of the Army will study the structure of the army, including security policy, military forces capability, force structure design, organization, and reserve forces policy. Members will be appointed for the life of the Commission, with a Chair and Vice Chair selected from among them. Meetings will be held as needed, with a majority of members constituting a quorum. The Commission will conduct a comprehensive study of the Army's structure and policy assumptions regarding size and force mixture to assess and make recommendations for modifications necessary to meet mission requirements efficiently and within available resources. Special consideration will be given to ensuring depth and scalability to meet combatant command needs while achieving cost-efficiency. The Commission will evaluate the Army's structure and policy assumptions to ensure cost-efficient capacity for combatant command needs, maintain a peacetime rotation force, and balance affordability, efficiency, capability, and readiness. The Commission will evaluate force generation policies for the Army, including size, force mixture, readiness, training, equipment, personnel, and maintenance of reserve components. It will also assess the distribution of responsibility for Army National Guard personnel and force structure allocation to States and territories, as well as the strategic basis and decision-making processes for this allocation. The Commission will conduct a study on transferring Army National Guard AH-64 Apache aircraft to the regular Army, considering specified factors. A report with findings and recommendations will be submitted by February 1, 2016. The Commission is empowered to hold hearings. The Commission has the power to hold hearings, gather information from federal agencies, and use postal services. Commission personnel may receive compensation. The Commission members may receive compensation at a rate not exceeding $155,400 per day for their duties. Officers or employees of the United States serving on the Commission do not receive additional compensation. Travel expenses, including per diem, are allowed for Commission members. The Chair of the Commission has the authority to appoint and terminate staff without following civil service laws. The Commission has the authority to appoint and terminate an executive director and additional personnel without following civil service laws. The Chair can set their compensation, not exceeding level V of the Executive Schedule. Federal Government employees can be detailed to the Commission without reimbursement. The Commission can appoint an executive director and personnel without following civil service laws. The Chair can set compensation not exceeding level V of the Executive Schedule. Temporary and intermittent services can be procured under specific conditions. The Commission will terminate 90 days after submitting its report. Funding for the Commission's activities can be sourced from appropriations for the Army. The committee directs the Comptroller General of the United States to submit a report on the Department of the Army's data, analysis, decision-making processes, and plans for structuring, readying, and managing the forces of the Army. The report will assess how the Army determines the size and force mixtures of its components to fulfill national security missions. The committee recommends creating a commission to study the size and force structure of the Army, including active-duty forces, the U.S. Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. This is in response to ongoing analysis and decision-making processes within the Army and Department of Defense to achieve required savings. An independent review of Army size and force is deemed necessary. The committee recommends establishing a national commission to review the size and force structure of the Army, including active-duty forces, the U.S. Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. The commission would submit a report to congressional defense committees by February 1, 2016, and prohibit any reduction in Army end strength or divestment of AH-64 Apache aircraft in fiscal year 2015. The commission would consist of eight members appointed by congressional leaders and the President. The commission, consisting of eight members appointed by congressional leaders and the President, would conduct a comprehensive study of the Army's structure, including plans to transfer Apache aircraft from the ARNG to the regular Army. It would also evaluate the distribution of responsibility and authority related to the allocation of ARNG end strength and force structure to states and territories, considering potential changes to existing legislation. The committee acknowledges challenges faced by the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force due to the Department of Defense's interpretation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The committee expects the Secretary of Defense to support the National Commission on the Future of the Army in a balanced manner. The committee recognizes challenges faced by the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force due to FACA oversight. The Army's '1993 Offsite Agreement' has guided reserve component force structure decisions for 20 years, outlining roles for ARNG and USAR. The Army's reserve components have core competencies in combat support and combat service support. The ARNG focuses on a balance of combat and supporting arms, while the USAR specializes in combat support and service support. This alignment of core capabilities among the Army's reserve components has effectively served the Nation, the Army, and domestic support and public safety needs. The committee recognizes the success of the agreement regarding reserve components' core competencies in combat, security, and support missions. The Army is encouraged to maintain the reserve components as an operational reserve and manage the distribution of combat capabilities in line with the 1993 Offsite Agreement. H.R. 4870 prohibits the transfer of AH-64 Attack helicopters from the Army National Guard to the active Army. The Army's fiscal year 2015 budget proposes a restructuring of aviation assets, including transferring Apache helicopters from National Guard to active Army, shifting Blackhawk helicopters to National Guard, and retiring Kiowa Warrior helicopters for affordability reasons. The Committee approves the proposal, except for the transfer of Apache aircraft from the National Guard. The Committee is concerned about the impact of retiring TH-67 aircraft on the rotary wing industrial base and directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the aircraft being divested, including the number of airframes, transfer destinations, costs, and impact on the domestic industry. The Secretary of the Army is prohibited from divesting any aircraft until the report is submitted. The Secretary of the Army is prohibited from divesting any aircraft until a report is submitted by the Secretary of Defense. Historical data shows that the active component of the U.S. armed forces has been smaller than the reserve components for most of the nation's history. The United States has always maintained a substantial proportion of its military force structure in the reserve components due to ideological reasons rooted in the nation's founding principles. The preference for citizen-soldiers over professional military forces dates back to the colonial and founding eras, where standing armies were seen as a threat to democratic sovereignty and individual liberty. Congress has the authority to raise and support armies and maintain a navy, reflecting a historical aversion to a large professional military force. The Federalist Papers emphasized the importance of establishing a well-trained militia to augment professional forces in times of need and serve as a check on their power. This arrangement aimed to have a select corps of militia ready for defense when necessary, reducing the reliance on a large professional military force. The Federalist Papers advocated for a well-trained militia to supplement professional forces in times of need and act as a safeguard against their power. This approach aimed to reduce the need for a large standing army and relied on citizens being prepared to defend their rights. The distrust of professional forces decreased in the 20th century, but support for a strong reserve component remains for security against a standing army. The maintenance of reserve forces is justified for providing strategic depth and augmenting active forces during crises. Reserve forces have been called into service for major U.S. conflicts, allowing the armed forces to rapidly expand in size during wars like World War II, Korea, and Desert Storm. The availability of a wide array of reserve unit types enhances the Services' capacity to conduct specific types of missions, providing flexibility across a wide range of situations. Reserve activations during interventions like in Haiti targeted specialized skills such as military police, transportation, and civil affairs. Reserve forces cost much less than active component forces when not activated, historically kept down by intentionally manning units at less than 100% capacity. The military keeps personnel costs low by manning units below full capacity and using vehicles and equipment less. New research challenges this approach. The active component military is small, volunteer-based, with low turnover, raising concerns about its representation of the American population. The reserve component, though facing similar issues, is geographically dispersed and integrates with civilian life. The reserve component serves as a critical link between the armed forces and the civilian population, ensuring the military is viewed as part of the community. The Army Force Generation model focuses on increasing unit readiness over time for operational deployment. The Army's rotational model replaces the linear readiness construct, focusing on resourcing, training, and deploying cohesive units efficiently. Units progress through three force pools: Reset Pool for reintegration and training, Train/Ready Pool for proficiency restoration, and Available Pool for deployment readiness. The unit achieves the required operational capability. There are statutory provisions for ordering Reserve Components to active duty, including provisions for National Guard members and retired reservists. Section 12301(a) of Title 10 U.S.C. allows for involuntary activation during war or national emergencies. During a national emergency or war, the Service Secretaries can authorize the involuntary activation of reservists for up to 24 months. Up to 1 million Ready Reserve members can be on active duty at once without needing approval from Congress. This authority was used during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the Presidential Reserve Call-up (PRC) authority was insufficient, leading to the use of Section 12304 of Title 10 U.S.C. by President George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks. This authority allowed for the involuntary activation of up to 200,000 members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve for up to 365 days, used for Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom/New Dawn. Activation under this authority continues to the present. The President can activate reservists from the Individual Ready Reserve without Congress approval, but must notify Congress within 24 hours. This authority was used during various conflicts like the Persian Gulf War, Haiti intervention, Bosnian peacekeeping mission, conflict with Iraq, and Kosovo mission. Activated reservists cannot enforce federal authority or assist in disaster response, except in emergencies involving weapons of mass destruction or terrorist attacks. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 allows for involuntarily activations of Selected Reserve units for up to 365 consecutive days of active duty, with a limit of 60,000 members at any given time. The authority to activate reservists for preplanned missions in support of a combatant command rests with the Service Secretary, and must be included in the service's budget materials. This authority is not intended for emergent operational or humanitarian missions. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 allows for involuntarily activations of Selected Reserve units for up to 365 consecutive days of active duty, with a limit of 60,000 members at any given time. This provision is now codified at 10 U.S.C. 12304b. In its FY2014 and FY2015 budget requests, the Army specified its plans to use this authority for various smaller ongoing operations. Another provision in the Act, codified at 10 U.S.C. 12304a, allows the Secretary of Defense to order units and individuals of the Reserve components for disaster response activation. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 allows for involuntarily activations of Selected Reserve units for up to 365 consecutive days of active duty, with a limit of 60,000 members at any given time. This provision is now codified at 10 U.S.C. 12304b. In its FY2014 and FY2015 budget requests, the Army specified its plans to use this authority for various smaller ongoing operations. Another provision in the Act, codified at 10 U.S.C. 12304a, allows the Secretary of Defense to order units and individuals of the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Air Force Reserve to active duty for up to 120 days \"when a governor requests federal assistance in responding to a major disaster or emergency.\" The Coast Guard Reserve also has a similar short-term disaster response activation authority. A dual status commander is an officer who serves as both a state National Guard officer and a federal military officer. They can command non-federalized National Guard forces and federal forces separately. The Governor of the affected state is the principal authority during a major disaster, supported by the Adjutant General as the principal military authority. Retired Reserve members can be involuntarily ordered to active duty. Members of the Retired Reserve can be involuntarily ordered to active duty in times of war or national emergency. There are no limits on the number of retired reservists who can be called to active duty, and they may be kept on active duty for the duration of the war plus six months. The Secretary of each military department has the authority to order certain retired reservists with regular retirement to active duty. There are limits on the amount of time recalled retirees can serve, but these limits do not apply in times of war or national emergency. Activation of National Guard personnel under Title 32 of the U.S. Code, Section 502(f) allows for involuntary duty with federal pay and benefits, controlled by the governor. This authority has been used for security at airports post-9/11, response to hurricanes, and border security missions. National Guard personnel can be called up by their governor for full-time duty under state active duty, where they are considered state employees. This includes responding to disasters, civil disorders, and protecting critical infrastructure from potential terrorist attacks. The studies listed in this appendix focus on AC/RC cost and force mix, as well as national defense, military reform, and DOD budget choices. The reports are listed in chronological order, covering various aspects of the Reserve Component. Key points and recurring themes from surveyed reports on the future role of the Reserve Component include AC/RC cost, force mix, national defense, military reform, and DOD budget choices. The reports cover various aspects of the Reserve Component and highlight key recurring points. The reports on the future role of the Reserve Component highlighted key points related to cost and force mix considerations. Cost is a significant planning factor, with variations in cost elements and allocation methods between the Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC). Non-activated RC personnel are more cost-effective than AC personnel due to reduced training time. Using RC forces can be more cost-effective than AC personnel due to lower training time and associated costs. However, when activated, RC costs can increase significantly, especially when considering output such as \"days deployed.\" This cost advantage may diminish due to increased compensation costs when activated. When RC forces are activated, their costs increase significantly compared to AC units due to stricter mobilization limits and post-activation training. This results in higher costs per \"day deployed\" for RC units. Cost advantages in AC units are seen with high-cost equipment and extensive training needs, while RC units with lower training needs have a cost advantage. The Reserve Component (RC) offers additional value beyond cost savings, such as providing opportunities for part-time service, civilian expertise, and strengthening public support for operations. Studies suggest that the RC is best utilized for predictable missions that benefit from long-term relationships. The Reserve Component (RC) offers value beyond cost savings, providing opportunities for part-time service, civilian expertise, and strengthening public support for operations. Policy makers should consider the RC's capability for unpredictable deployments and long-term stability in missions. AC units have frequent turnover, while RC units offer comparative long-term stability. The Reserve Component (RC) is believed to benefit Combatant Commander Theater Security Cooperation and Building Partner Capacity activities through long-term personal relationships. RC forces are well-suited for Homeland Defense missions and provide strategic depth, allowing for quicker deployment compared to Active Component (AC) units. This strategic depth argument counters criticism that RC units are more expensive and less effective than AC counterparts. Some argue that keeping expensive and less effective Combat Aviation Brigades (CABs) in the Reserve Component (RC) is necessary for quickly reconstituting force structure during crises. Mission requirements dictate whether Active Component (AC) or RC units are more suitable, with AC units preferred for rapid response missions and RC units for enduring deployments. Multiple RC units may be needed to match the output of a single AC unit. In the case of an \"operationalized RC,\" the 1:5 deploy-to-dwell ratio rule requires multiple RC units to match the deployment frequency of one AC unit. Placing certain support units in the RC, like a Medium Truck Company, can be advantageous due to shorter post-mobilization training periods. Comparatively shorter post-mobilization training periods increase the number of days deployed, decreasing the cost per day deployed ratio. Anecdotal examples suggest RC units like Military Police and Civil Affairs may be more effective due to daily civilian practice. However, a comprehensive examination of military effectiveness in relation to force mix is lacking. Military forums avoid discussing whether RC units are as effective as AC units once trained-up. The chapter written by Jennifer Buck explores different methods to analyze the costs of active and reserve components. One method compares the total budget with the portion supporting the force, while another estimates the cost of individual reserve members. Discussions on the effectiveness of reserve units compared to active duty units are avoided in military forums. The cost of reserve components is determined by factors such as availability for deployment, duty days served, and analysis of brigade combat teams. Differences in costs between active and reserve components are mainly due to lower operating tempo, part-time pay and benefits, and smaller infrastructure costs. The more the guard and reserve are used, the higher their cost. Using the traditional method and FY2005 figures, the guard and reserve require 8.6% of the total budget. The traditional method of budget allocation for the guard and reserve components may not accurately reflect their true costs, as it does not consider factors such as research and development costs, equipment transfers, and institutional support. When factoring in supplemental war funding, the guard and reserve's share of the budget rises to 9.4%. This method may be more suitable for a reserve component used primarily as a strategic reserve rather than one called upon for operational missions. The traditional method of budget allocation for the guard and reserve components may not accurately reflect their true costs. Two alternative approaches were developed to compare the use of active versus guard and reserve forces per dollar spent. The \"life-cycle\" variant estimates the lifetime cost of an AC servicemember at nearly $2.4 million, and the RC servicemember at about $790,000. This analysis shows that reserves are a good option in terms of cost efficiency. The analysis shows that reserves are cost-effective as their retirement is deferred, making them cheaper than active members. The \"duty day\" variant estimates the cost per duty day for AC personnel, statutory reservists, and busy reservists. It concludes that the more days reservists serve, the less costly they are to use, with busy reservists being cheaper than statutory ones. The analysis compares costs of active duty units to reserve units, showing that reserve units are cheaper during peacetime but cost about the same when activated. Adding full-time benefits to reservists makes part-time reservists more expensive relative to their availability. The analysis compares costs of active duty units to reserve units, showing that reserve units are cheaper during peacetime but cost about the same when activated. However, when reserve units are used as part of a rotational force, their relative costs increase significantly, reaching up to 120% when activated. The study compared costs of active duty units to reserve units, showing that reserve units are cheaper during peacetime but cost about the same when activated. However, when reserve units are used as part of a rotational force, their relative costs increase significantly. The study used three approaches to estimate comparative costs, with data primarily from FY2004 and FY2005 budget documents. The duty day variant includes various costs like training, medical readiness, and equipment. Assumptions about career length and deployment ratios impact results. Cost elements and unit cost model are not fully described. The paper presents different costing alternatives without endorsing a specific approach. The report presents different costing alternatives for reserves, rejecting the traditional method. It questions the calculation of retired pay accrual rates for reservists and highlights the higher daily rate for busy reservists compared to active component servicemembers. The unit cost model approach increases relative costs to 84%. The report questions the calculation of retired pay accrual rates for reservists and highlights the higher daily rate for busy reservists compared to active component servicemembers. It suggests re-thinking various aspects of the reserve components, particularly the Army's reserve personnel, due to a changed threat environment and different utilization patterns. The unit cost model approach increases relative costs to 84%, reaching as high as 120% when activated. The report discusses the cost differences between Reserve Component (RC) and Active Component (AC) forces, highlighting the need to consider both peacetime and wartime costs. It emphasizes the importance of rotation policy in determining the relative costs of AC versus RC Boots on the Ground (BOG). The report emphasizes the importance of rotation policy in determining the relative costs of Reserve Component (RC) versus Active Component (AC) forces. Suggestions for modifying reserve compensation models are also presented, highlighting that reservists spend less time in uniform and can be paid less in years when they are not mobilized. This results in reserves being much less expensive than active-duty forces in peacetime. During peacetime, reserves are much less expensive than active-duty forces. Reservists train less and may have lower skill levels compared to AC forces, requiring intensive post-mobilization training to sharpen their skills. The cost of reservists in wartime varies with frequency of use and rotation policy. During peacetime, reserves are much less expensive than active-duty forces. Reservists may have lower skill levels compared to AC forces, requiring intensive post-mobilization training. The assumption that military skills atrophy when not training seems plausible for military-specific skills. It is considered impolite to discuss the effectiveness of RC units compared to AC units in public forums. There are different types of military jobs where civilians may have more repetitions, leading to better performance by the RC. During peacetime, reserves are more cost-effective than active-duty forces. Reservists may require intensive post-mobilization training due to lower skill levels compared to active-duty forces. It is believed that military skills deteriorate when not in training, especially for military-specific activities. The effectiveness of reserve units compared to active-duty units is a sensitive topic. Adjustments to unit-for-unit cost estimates should be made based on evidence of combat effectiveness differences. During peacetime, reserves are more cost-effective than active-duty forces. Reservists may require intensive post-mobilization training due to lower skill levels. The crucial comparison is the cost to maintain one RC unit BOG compared to an AC unit. The ratio of RC units to AC units needed to maintain one unit BOG is slightly less than three based on current rotation policy. The Reserves convert estimates of required units into relative costs for wars fought with rotation. Cost advantages diminish, with remaining differences not commensurate with lower combat effectiveness. The shift to a rotational scenario increases the relevant cost of reserves. Recommendations include using the RC in fewer roles and cutting reserve force structure to be more cost-effective. Further study is needed on the methodology. Further study is needed on the methodology used in chapters 2 to 7, which discuss historical data, reserve policy, costs, and proposed alternative reserve organizations. Chapter 5 specifically reviews the relative cost of Reserve Components (RC) compared to Active Components (AC) forces. According to deployment-dwell ratios, 3 AC units and 8 RC units are needed to maintain one unit continuously deployed. The ratio of RC to AC units is slightly less than 3. Rotation estimates are based on DOD guidelines from 2007. If actual rotation practice from 2007-2008 is used, the ratio changes to 1.8 for AC and 6.7 for RC. The author analyzes the costs of AC and RC units deployed and non-deployed, calculating a \"cost per unit of BOG\" metric. In peacetime, RC units cost 67% of AC units, while in wartime, they cost 101%. By manipulating deployment variables, potential relative costs range from 58% to 141%. Favorable scenarios for reserves involve less frequent activation, longer deployments, and reduced train-up time. The author explores cost comparisons between AC and RC units, highlighting factors like deployment frequency, train-up time, and relative costs. Assumptions about RC missions, BOG/dwell ratios, and post-mobilization training significantly impact cost estimates. The discussion is exploratory and requires further analysis for a comprehensive understanding. The analysis is exploratory and requires further discussion for a comprehensive understanding. The calculation of AC or RC costs is linked primarily to basic pay, which may limit the accuracy of relative costs. Assumptions about train-up times and rotation rates are based on Army BCTs and may not be applicable to other unit types. The report questions the logic of cutting reserve force structure based on increased relative costs under a rotational deployment policy. It warns that reducing compensation for reserves could lead to imbalances in the force, impacting new accessions and potentially creating a top-heavy reserve. The report questions cutting reserve force structure based on increased costs under a rotational deployment policy, warning of potential imbalances in the force and a top-heavy reserve. Independent Panel Review provides recommendations for Army leadership on RC employment and supports ARFORGEN model for sourcing Army requirements. The report recommends institutionalizing a cultural change in the Army to view Reserve Component (RC) units as an operational component of the Total Army. It suggests structuring, training, and manning the RC to achieve higher readiness levels with lesser pre-deployment training. The current structure of the RC is seen as healthy by the panel. The panel views the current structure of the Reserve Component (RC) as healthy and about right, rejecting arguments that the Army's dependence on the RC violates its purpose. The RC has proven its worth and capability for current and future operations, with the ability to be operationally employed at costs comparable to the Active Component (AC). The report proposes 3 alternatives for supplying forces under an ARFORGEN scenario, with Alternative 1 suggesting an all AC sourcing. The report proposes 3 alternatives for supplying forces under an ARFORGEN scenario: Alternative 1 is an all AC sourcing solution, Alternative 2 is an AC and RC sourcing solution based on current practice, and Alternative 3 is a \"hybrid\" solution with 37,000 RC personnel allocated into different force bands. Alternative 1 is deemed not feasible due to operational and support skills realignment issues. Alternative 2 is costly but doable, while Alternative 3 is a hybrid approach that leverages RC readiness effectively and is cost-efficient. The Panel emphasizes the importance of maintaining RC capabilities at a lower level to prevent skill atrophy and ensure the AC can meet demands without significant skill redistribution. The report provides a cost-benefit analysis of the Reserve Component (RC) compared to the Active Component (AC), showing that RC costs range from 24-33% of AC costs when not activated, 95-100% when deployed, and 77-104% as part of the ARFORGEN cycle. The study was directed by the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army in 2010. The review of the principles, policies, and assumptions governing the employment of U.S. Army Reserve Components in an era of persistent conflict was conducted by a panel of three retired general officers. The methodology included interviews with key leaders and a literature review. The report accepts the current Army structure and does not assess potentially contentious issues. The report accepts the current Army structure, including Reserve Component (RC) structure, without assessing large-scale changes. It recommends restructuring the RC to focus on lower echelon and support units for higher readiness levels. This could be controversial for the Army National Guard (ARNG) with its higher echelon combat structure. The report primarily focuses on increasing the ratio of Active Component (AC) forces. The report focuses on increasing the ratio of RC forces, which may limit the value of its AC/RC mix conclusions. Changes in Army obligating authority could question certain conclusions. The cost table in Chapter 5 lacks detail on the methodological underpinnings of the cited studies. It is difficult to evaluate the utility of the table without copies of three reports. The Reserve Components of the Armed Forces have evolved into an operational reserve with full-spectrum capability after years of combat deployments. This transformation represents a significant investment in resources and personal sacrifices, providing essential operational capabilities and strategic agility to the Department of Defense. The Reserve Components of the Armed Forces have evolved into an operational reserve with full-spectrum capability, representing a significant investment in resources and personal sacrifices. The report provides background and recommendations for the future role of the Reserve Component, emphasizing their cost-effective operational forces and strategic depth for contingencies. The National Guard and Reserve should be a \"force of first choice\" for tasks they are well-suited for, given their skill sets and cost-effectiveness. The report recommends refining existing cost methodologies for the Total Force to accommodate a long-term view and better compare personnel, operating, and life-cycle costs. It also suggests updating methodologies to reflect emerging operational parameters and changes in how the force will be used. The report suggests refining cost methodologies for the Total Force to compare costs of similar capabilities across services and allocate overhead costs equitably. The Guard and Reserve are best suited for predictable missions that benefit from long-term relationships, such as Homeland Defense. They provide strategic depth in mission areas like rotational deployments. The Reserve Component (RC) is well-suited for various mission areas, including rotational deployments, Theater Security Cooperation, Building Partner Capacity, Homeland Defense, Defense Support to Civil Authorities, and supporting DOD or service institutional needs. Options for rebalancing the Total Force include using RC for force structure building and assigning cost-effective operational missions to the RC. Establishing habitual relationships between specific Guard and Reserve units with Combatant Commands and other DOD service components for long-term planning and training. National or regional RC units staffed with personnel willing to serve on Active Duty more frequently. Meeting emerging needs like cyber defense, ISR, countering WMD, regional engagement, and Homeland Defense missions. Increasing integration of AC and RC forces into blended units. Assigning institutional support tasks to RC units. The report prepared by the Office of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs highlights the need for changes in recruiting, equipping, training, and caring for Reserve Component personnel. This includes necessary revisions to law, policy, and doctrine to integrate RC units into the operational force. The study was a collaborative effort involving various organizations and was directed by the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The report emphasizes the value of Reserve Component organizations and recommends using them as a \"force of first choice\" for certain tasks due to their cost-effectiveness and skill sets. The report questions the cost-effectiveness of using Reserve Component (RC) forces without comparing them to Active Component (AC) forces. It suggests that RC forces are more suitable for missions with predictable schedules, rather than immediate combat roles. This contrasts with using RC forces for combat operations with sufficient training and resources. The Army reorganized the Reserve Component (RC) as an operational reserve due to demands from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The study aimed to assess the utilization of AC and RC units and analyze policy options to adjust the balance of forces. Key questions included identifying heavily deployed occupational categories and evaluating if utilization rates exceeded DOD planning objectives. The study examines the cost factors in assigning missions to the Army's Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) units. It suggests that missions should be assigned to the most cost-effective component if both are equally effective, but differences in capabilities and task efficiency should also be considered. Various approaches to measuring the relative cost of the RC can lead to different conclusions, with cost advantages being most evident in the RC when comparing end strength to appropriations. The report highlights the cost advantages of placing capabilities in the Reserve Component (RC) for strategic depth and as an \"insurance policy\" for unanticipated missions. Cost-effectiveness is maximized when capabilities are actually used, with full-time services in the Active Component (AC) being cost-effective when used full-time. However, for brigade combat teams, there are unlikely to be significant cost savings from placing operational capabilities in the RC instead of the AC. The study highlights that costs are similar between the Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC), suggesting that operational unit rebalancing should be based on factors other than cost. The RC provides additional value such as the ability to serve part-time, civilian expertise, and a link to the public, potentially increasing support for Army operations. Policymakers are advised to consider the future demand for high-utilization skills when reshaping the AC and RC. Policy makers need to assess the risks of insufficient strategic depth in high and low-utilization skills when considering rebalancing forces. If converting billets from low-utilization skills hinders the Army's ability to meet demand, alternative options should be explored. The report highlights the lack of a well-developed predictive model for deployment and utilization of individuals in the Army. It suggests that decisions about reshaping the Army should consider future demands, which are inherently speculative and risky. The Army Reserve is identified as the most unbalanced component in terms of high-utilization career members. The study conducted by RAND, sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, analyzed the utilization of career fields in the Army components. It identified high and low-utilization fields and highlighted the potential skills shortage if all personnel were converted to high-utilization fields. RAND's findings were based on Army data from 2001 to 2011. The RAND study analyzed Army utilization of career fields from 2001 to 2011, covering various missions from combat to security assistance. The data is relevant for predicting force utilization in similar operations but may not apply to protracted major conflicts. RAND suggests the need for a predictive model encompassing a full spectrum of Army operations beyond Iraq and Afghanistan experiences. RAND's analysis of high and low-utilization career fields in the Active Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserves indicates that chemical operations and medical and health care fields are low-utilization career fields. The lack of utilization of medical and health care personnel in particular may warrant further study. The F. AC/RC ARFORGEN Costing Model 2012 Executive Summary provided by the Army G-8 Programs Analysis and Evaluation branch focuses on determining comparable costs for AC and RC units in an ARFORGEN cycle. The analysis focuses on comparing costs for AC and RC units in an ARFORGEN cycle. Findings show that RC ARFORGEN pipeline costs are generally lower for personnel and O&S compared to AC units. The cost differential is greatest in units with lower equipment operating costs. The 12-month limit on RC unit mobilization can lead to increased costs when demand is high. The cost to operationalize the RC relative to personnel and O&S costs is small, about 2%-3% of the total ARFORGEN cycle cost. The cost to operationalize the RC relative to personnel and O&S costs is small\u2014about 2%-3% of the total ARFORGEN cycle cost for any given unit type. Equipment recapitalization costs can be significant for equipment-intensive units like Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs) and Combat Aviation Brigades (CABs). The RC remains a cost-effective measure to preserve strategic depth, with RC units available in months compared to years for active duty units. PA&E conducted a study involving Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and various Army units to provide cost estimates for different deployment scenarios. The study's cost elements were broad, but lacked detailed methodology discussion in the briefing slides. These estimates could be valuable for future Army cost and force mix studies. The briefing slides lack detailed methodology discussion, making it unclear how figures were determined. The study assumed two months of post-mobilization training for deploying reserve units, which may be questioned for brigade combat teams. Cost ratios cited are for one active and one reserve unit over an entire ARFORGEN cycle, potentially understating reserve unit costs by not considering factors like limits on reserve rotation policy. The report emphasizes the need for reforms in the U.S. military to maintain global preeminence in the face of new threats and budget cuts. Despite prioritizing the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions, the Department of Defense has yet to implement necessary reforms to sustain military preeminence. The report highlights the need for reforms in the U.S. military to sustain global preeminence amidst new threats and budget cuts. It recommends shrinking the Army to 480,000 active-duty troops, transferring some armored brigades to the reserve component, and promoting more lateral personnel assignments between the active and reserve components. The report recommends reducing the Army to 480,000 active-duty troops, transferring some armored brigades to the reserve component, and promoting more lateral personnel assignments between the active and reserve components. This downsizing is supported by DOD's plan to decrease Army end strength to 490,000 by 2017, with further reductions suggested through streamlining headquarters and shifting capabilities to the Guard and Reserve. A force of 480,000 would match pre-9/11 Army size but with enhanced capabilities due to reorganization into highly capable brigade combat teams. The Army should adjust its balance between active and reserve components, transferring some armored brigades to the National Guard to enhance capabilities and reduce costs. This downsizing is part of DOD's plan to decrease Army end strength to 480,000 by 2017, while maintaining highly capable brigade combat teams. The U.S. Army has significantly increased the number of armored brigades in the active force since 2003. Moving four of these brigades to the Army National Guard could save resources while maintaining quick response capabilities. Implementing a program of personnel exchanges between active and reserve components would enhance readiness for both. Army National Guard officers should be able to serve on active duty, and vice versa, to strengthen overall readiness. The report suggests allowing Army personnel to shift to reserve status for professional development, supporting reversibility and breaking down cultural barriers between active and reserve components. Published by CNAS, the report addresses maximizing national security in times of defense spending reductions. The CNAS study highlights the military and cost-effectiveness of Reserve Component (RC) forces, noting that they are highly capable and less expensive to maintain than active forces. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review suggests that effective use of the National Guard and Reserves can lower overall costs and ensure the right mix of equipment. However, the citation from the QDR does not fully support this assertion. The quotation notes that the debate surrounds the comparative costs between the AC and RC, with the effective use of the RC potentially lowering personnel and operating costs. However, there is a lack of quantification of these savings and no data provided on the capabilities of reserve formations compared to active forces. The report recommends transferring four ABCTs from the AC to the RC, raising concerns about the effectiveness of National Guard ABCTs compared to AC ABCTs due to limited training time and sophisticated weapon systems. The Reserve Forces Policy Board (RFPB) found that the Department lacks knowledge of the fully-burdened and life-cycle costs of military personnel, leading to uninformed manpower decisions. The report presents a methodology to capture these costs on a per-capita basis for informed decisions on the mix of Active and Reserve forces. No specific life-cycle cost methodology is proposed in the report. The report highlights the lack of a defined policy for comparing costs between Active and Reserve Component forces in the Department of Defense. This results in senior leaders lacking complete data for informed decision-making on the optimal force mix. The services do not consistently consider various cost factors when determining Reserve Component costs. The report identifies wide variance in cost factors used by components in their analysis, with inconsistency in considering military-related costs borne by other federal agencies. The DOD Deputy Comptroller's \"Composite Rates\" for manpower costs conflict with Directive Type Memorandum 09-007, as they do not account for the full costs of military or DOD. The report highlights discrepancies in cost factors used by components, especially in considering military-related costs borne by other federal agencies. The current DOD Directive and its replacement do not include all relevant cost factors, particularly in retirement and health care costs for Reserve Component forces compared to Active Component forces. The RFBP emphasizes the need for improved visibility on these costs and provides examples for developing a life-cycle cost model. These costs should always be included in any study conducted for the Department of Defense. Cost factors to be considered in studies comparing active and reserve component personnel or forces include basic pay, retired pay accrual, allowances, special and incentive pay, PCS costs, Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Fund contribution, DOD healthcare costs, dependent education costs, family housing costs, commissary costs, Treasury contributions for concurrent receipt, and base operations support costs. Additionally, studies should also include Treasury contributions to MERHCF and military retirement fund, Department of Veterans Affairs budget, Department of Labor's Veterans Education and Training Service, and service-level non-compensation costs. The cost to the U.S. government in FY2013 for Active Component personnel was $384,622 and $123,351 for Reserve Component personnel, including compensation, procurement, operations, maintenance, military construction, and RDT&E costs. When only DOD compensation costs are considered, the figures are $108,307 for AC personnel and $34,272 for RC personnel. Adding compensation-related costs from other federal agencies increases the figures to $162,586 for AC personnel and $57,242 for RC personnel. Costing experts reviewed previous studies to identify fully-burdened and life-cycle individual cost elements. The study identified fully-burdened and life-cycle individual cost elements for manpower cost studies, with input from military leaders and subject matter experts. The report focuses on average annual costs of traditional reserve duty compared to active component forces, but does not address differential costs by community or reserve costs associated with periodic mobilization. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of costs between the Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC), including procurement, RDT&E, military construction, and O&M costs. It raises concerns about the unclear relationship between costs and outputs like \"days deployed\" and the potential objections to the allocation of certain costs. Some O&M and military construction costs may not accurately reflect the resource consumption of AC and RC forces. There are concerns about how veterans' benefits costs are determined, with potential inaccuracies in estimating benefits for current personnel. Differences in benefits consumption between active and reserve personnel are also noted. Differences in consumption of veterans' benefits by active and reserve personnel may impact cost allocation. Changes in force mix can affect costs differently, with some elements less sensitive to manning level adjustments. The current international order presents an opportunity for policymakers to address defense budget challenges. The federal budget outlook emphasizes the need for responsible reductions in defense spending to address internal cost pressures and strategic focus on likely threats. The Budget Control Act of 2011 calls for $500 billion in defense spending cuts over ten years, but across-the-board cuts could impair military capabilities. A strategy is proposed to spread reductions over a ten-year period and prioritize areas of cost growth to prevent loss of military capacity. The paper outlines a strategy to address challenges in defense spending by reducing military capacity and capability through three key reforms: designing a force better aligned for future challenges, improving acquisition system efficiency, and controlling rising personnel costs. Recommendations include reducing the active duty Army by 200,000 soldiers and increasing reservists and National Guardsmen to handle ground combat responsibilities. These reforms aim to maintain capability to face future challenges while ensuring a sustainable defense budget. The discussion paper proposes transitioning military capacity to the reserve component, citing the National Guard and reserve units' excellent performance in recent wars. The paper is part of The Hamilton Project's initiative to generate innovative economic policy ideas. The discussion paper recommends significant changes to Army force structure, suggesting a decrease in the Active Army by 200,000 soldiers and an increase in the Reserve Component by 100,000 soldiers. However, the paper lacks strong analytical underpinnings and does not thoroughly examine issues such as comparative costs, availability for surge deployments, and capabilities, leading to contentious recommendations with potentially high risks."
