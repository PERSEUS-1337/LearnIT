The \"Give Fans a Chance Act of 1997\" adds conditions to the Antitrust Exemption Act of 1961, stating that it does not apply to professional sports leagues with restrictions on ownership transfers to the public or non-compliance with relocation procedures. The \"Give Fans a Chance Act of 1997\" requires clubs to provide notice of proposed relocation at least 180 days before the season starts in the new location. The notice must be in writing, delivered in person or by certified mail, made available to the media, published in newspapers, and include details about the new home community and reasons for the move. During the 180-day notice period, a proposal can be made to purchase the club to keep it in the home community, ensuring league membership if successful. During the 180-day notice period, the club must give the opportunity for a proposal to be presented to keep the club in its home community. The owner must respond in writing with detailed reasons for refusing any legitimate offer. The league will make the final determination. The league will determine the relocation of a club out of its home community before the 180-day notice period expires. Interested persons can present testimony at a hearing, and the league will consider any inducement proposals offered. The league will consider fan loyalty, support, and negotiations with the club before approving or disapproving its relocation. The league will consider various factors when deciding on a club's relocation, including the ownership's contribution to the need for relocation, public financial support received, stadium adequacy, financial losses, and viability. The league will consider factors such as financial viability, home community location, opposition from stadium authority, and investor interest when deciding on a club's relocation. The Act and its amendment will take effect on the first day of the first month starting more than 180 days after the Act's enactment."
