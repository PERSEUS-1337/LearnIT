ZIP stands for \"Zoning Improvement Plan\" and is used for mail sorting and delivery. ZIP Codes have evolved to include 9 and 11 digits, but most customers only know their five-digit code. The ZIP Code system was introduced by the U.S. Postal Service in 1963 to facilitate mail sorting and delivery. The first number in the ZIP Code indicates the general geographic area of the nation, while the second and third numbers represent regions of the United States. The fourth and fifth digits route the mail to specific post offices. Additional four-digit numbers added in 1983 allow mail to be sorted to specific streets or buildings. The ZIP Code system introduced by the U.S. Postal Service in 1963 facilitates mail sorting and delivery. ZIP Code information is used by various entities for purposes beyond mail delivery, such as demographic research, insurance rates, and advertising. USPS collaborates with state and local authorities and private companies to align ZIP Codes with postal and non-postal needs. ZIP Codes are based on delivery post office locations and may not correspond to political jurisdictions. The location of delivery post offices often does not align with political jurisdiction boundaries, leading to millions of Americans receiving mail from neighboring areas. This discrepancy has increased over the years, especially in growing suburban regions where jurisdiction boundaries have changed. The use of ZIP Codes for non-postal purposes has further complicated matters for postal patrons whose mailing addresses do not match their actual residences. Residents face various issues due to discrepancies between their mailing addresses and actual towns or cities of residence. Problems include higher automobile insurance rates, confusion during municipal elections, misdirected sales tax revenues, jury duty notices sent to ineligible individuals, misdirected emergency service vehicles, and complaints from homeowners in expensive neighborhoods. In a 1990 hearing, ZIP Code misalignment issues were discussed, with ten members of Congress and the National League of Cities highlighting problems in their districts. For example, Haddon Township, NJ, lacks a delivery post office, causing residents to receive mail from neighboring towns with different ZIP Codes. This leads to complaints about diminished housing values and loss of community identity. The 1990 hearing discussed ZIP Code misalignment issues, with local governments and the National League of Cities proposing bills to allow them to determine local addresses or ZIP Code boundaries. USPS opposed this, stating it would be disastrous to lose control over mailing addresses. A USPS survey found that realigning delivery boundaries to match municipal boundaries would require 1,600 new postal facilities and 10,500 carriers. Additionally, there was a concern about the availability of new ZIP Codes in certain large areas, with 924 out of 1,000 three-digit combinations already assigned by the end of 1989. In 20 areas, 90 or more of the 100 possible ZIP Codes had been assigned, with all 100 ZIP Codes in Houston used. USPS faced criticism for denying local ZIP Code change requests, with only 2 out of 26 approved by the agency. The Government Accountability Office suggested USPS provide better reasoning for its decisions. USPS has made efforts to review and monitor ZIP Code boundaries, with criteria for changes based on factors like delivery growth. Local ZIP Code changes are sensitive and often involve significant community input. The USPS requires approval from various managers before proposing ZIP Code changes, with a focus on operational considerations. Managers must address crossing municipal boundaries and seek input from officials. Municipal boundaries and customer interests are key factors in zone splits for ZIP Code adjustments. The process for considering ZIP Code changes involves consulting municipal offices and considering all reasonable solutions. The USPS began considering requests for boundary adjustments based on \"community identity\" concerns in 1999. The USPS emphasizes the need for improvement in handling ZIP Code change requests based on community identity concerns. It is important to consider community wishes and offer reasonable accommodations when possible, using the customer survey process. Requests can only be denied with valid, objective reasons consistent with the Review Process. The USPS emphasizes the importance of accommodating community identity concerns when handling ZIP Code change requests. Requests should not be denied out of fear that other communities will make similar requests. The process involves submitting a written request with rationale to the district manager, who then forwards it to the Area Office for review. The process for requesting a ZIP Code change from USPS involves submitting a written request to the district manager, who forwards it to the Area Office for review and approval. The district manager must identify issues, propose solutions, and provide a determination within 60 days. If denied, specific justifications must be given, and an appeal process is available. If feasible, a formal survey of customers is required. If the request for a ZIP Code change is feasible, a formal survey of affected customers is required for approval. A simple majority of survey respondents is sufficient. Customers can appeal to headquarters if USPS decides not to change boundaries due to \"municipal identity\" issues. An appeal can be made to the manager of delivery operations, except if a majority of customers do not support the change in the survey. The operations specialist at USPS headquarters determines if \"reasonable accommodation\" was provided for boundary review appeals. The manager of delivery operations makes the final decision within 60 days. Positive effects of the boundary review process include a 64% accommodation rate in 1991. In 1991, 64% of boundary review appeals at USPS resulted in accommodations. Requests for new ZIP Codes are common, but USPS believes other options are often simpler, such as minor adjustments in carrier routes. Customers see a new ZIP Code as a way to establish postal identity, but alternative solutions are available. Adjustments in carrier routes can solve community boundary problems without changing USPS delivery structure. Customers can use an alternative city name in their addresses to address community identity issues, but this may not help non-USPS services locate homes accurately. USPS advises adding the alternate city name into the AMS before including it in an address. USPS sorting technology reads all lines of the address to obtain the delivery point barcode, and using an unapproved alternative city name could hinder delivery. Large-scale mailers can work with USPS to improve their address files for more efficient sorting. The ZIP Code was expanded to nine digits in 1983 (ZIP +4), and the 10th and 11th ZIP Code numbers created in 1991 allow mail to be sorted directly to a residence or business. USPS may refine municipal mailing lists to eliminate errors based on the less sophisticated use of the five-digit code. If a new ZIP Code is requested, it's important to understand the underlying reason for the request. The Postal Service addresses complaints about poor delivery service promptly, resolves issues related to population growth or facility obsolescence, and considers community identity concerns when reviewing ZIP Code modifications. Constituents may be unaware of the boundary review process and may have been discouraged from requesting changes in the past. USPS policies now prohibit a negative response to ZIP Code modification requests. USPS officials must fully explain reasons for refusing ZIP Code modifications, based on operational and cost data. Legislation has been introduced to establish ZIP Code boundaries in statute, with only one becoming law in 2006. USPS advises against substituting city names before ZIP Codes without approval. When addressing mail, it is important to not substitute the city name before the ZIP Code without USPS approval. This can lead to mail being misdirected or returned as undeliverable due to mismatched information."
