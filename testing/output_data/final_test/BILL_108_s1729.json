    "content": "The Medication Errors Reduction Act of 2003 may be cited as the Act. It includes an informatics systems grant program for hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a grant program to assist eligible entities in offsetting costs related to implementing clinical health informatics systems to improve patient safety and reduce medication errors. The grant authority will end on September 30, 2013. The grant program will cover costs for purchasing, leasing, and installing computer software and hardware, improving existing systems, acquiring communication capabilities for data access, storage, and exchange, and providing education and training on patient safety information systems to eligible entity staff, which includes hospitals. An eligible entity seeking a grant under this section must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information. Special consideration will be given to entities serving a large number of Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP eligible individuals. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP programs account for a significant portion of the patient population. 20% of grant funds must be reserved for rural hospitals. The rural hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for grant funds, including being located in a rural area as defined by the Social Security Act or designated by the State as a rural hospital. If there are limited funds available, reserve funds may be allocated based on the number of rural hospitals applying for grants. The Secretary may reduce reserved funds for hospitals with excess amounts and use them for grants to other eligible entities. Grants awarded under this section are limited to the applicable percentage of project costs or specific amounts for hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. The applicable percentage for eligible entities receiving grants under this section is determined by the Secretary based on total net revenues from specific healthcare programs. Eligible entities must provide necessary information to evaluate and ensure proper use of grant funding. The Secretary must submit annual reports to the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee on the grant program, detailing the number of grants, project nature, recipient distribution, and other relevant information. The Secretary must submit a final report to the committees on the grant program established under this section, along with recommendations for legislation and administrative action. $93,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for making grants. From 2004 to 2013, $4,500,000 is authorized annually from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for grants to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. The funds remain available without a fiscal year limitation until September 30, 2013."
