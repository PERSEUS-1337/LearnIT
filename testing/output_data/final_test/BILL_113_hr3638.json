    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Road Usage Fee Pilot Program Act of 2013\". Congress acknowledges recommendations for transitioning away from the fuel tax to a mileage-based fee system for transportation funding, citing reports from the National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission and the National Surface Transportation and Revenue Study Commission. The Congressional Budget Office highlights the decreased purchasing power of the gas tax since 1992. Since 1990, gas tax revenues have consistently decreased by over one-third due to increasing fuel efficiency, changing transportation patterns, and inflation. By 2030, corporate average fuel economy standards will reduce Highway Trust Fund receipts by more than 20 percent, leading to some industries paying more than their fair share for road use. The Road Usage Fee Pilot Program is introduced to address the decrease in gas tax revenues and ensure fair payment for road use by industries. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish the Road Usage Fee Pilot Program to provide grants for pilot studies on mileage tracking methods, payment systems, and implementation of mileage-based fee systems in jurisdictions. Eligible entities must submit an application to be considered for a grant. The Secretary will select pilot studies exploring concerns such as privacy, compliance, acceptance, equity, integration, cost, enforcement, fraud, and feasibility. Priority will be given to studies serving as models for broad implementation, addressing rural and urban equity, and involving multistate projects. The Secretary will reserve at least 10 percent of funds for pilot studies conducted with planning organizations. These studies will explore various aspects such as privacy, compliance, acceptance, equity, integration, cost, enforcement, fraud, and feasibility. The pilot projects will involve high volumes of vehicles, integrate with revenue systems and demand management plans, potentially lead to mileage-based fee systems, incorporate intelligent transportation technologies, and test revenue collection systems. An eligible entity receiving a grant under this Act must provide 20 percent of the grant funds from non-Federal sources for the supported activities. SEC. 4. WORKING GROUPS. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall establish working groups including a technology and privacy group to evaluate technology platforms and standards, a transportation system and equity group to assess costs and success in achieving user equity, and an environmental group to evaluate environmental impacts. The environmental working group in the Program evaluates methods to manage demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each working group must have members with relevant experience in the private and public sectors. SEC. 5. REPORTS.\n\n(a) Interim Report - Within 2 years of the first grant disbursement, the Secretary must submit an interim report to Congress on Program progress and working group findings.\n\n(b) Final Report - Within 4 years of the first grant disbursement, the Secretary must submit a final report to Congress with data, feasibility analysis of mileage-based fee systems, and working group evaluations.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefines \"eligible entity\" as State, local, metropolitan planning organization, regional transportation planning organization, or tribal organization. Also defines \"metropolitan planning organization\" and \"regional transportation planning organization\" as per section 134(b) of title 23, United States Code. Authorization of Appropriations: $30,000,000 for grant program under section 3, and $2,500,000 each for working group and report under sections 4 and 5."
