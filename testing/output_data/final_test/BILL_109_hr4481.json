    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Superfund for Hurricane Accountability and Recovery Act of 2005\". It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 established a Federal Superfund trust fund for hazardous substance remediation, with over 45,900 sites evaluated and 1,540 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List. More than 70,000,000 Americans live near a Superfund site, and funding shortfalls have impacted new construction funding for sites in recent years. The Congress finds that receiving new construction funding in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 slowed the pace of existing cleanups, delaying and magnifying public health risks. The reestablishment of the Superfund tax would not affect the liability of responsible parties for hazardous substance releases. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused unprecedented environmental damage in the Gulf Coast States, leading to significant new releases of hazardous substances and damage to 54 listed sites. The Congress acknowledges the environmental damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the Gulf Coast States, resulting in new releases of hazardous substances and damage to 54 listed sites. It emphasizes the need for the removal, remediation, and cleanup of hazardous substances to protect public health and mitigate environmental damage, with costs to be borne by responsible parties.
