    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature intends for the statutory changes to increase voter participation without changing the date of a runoff election. Section 1000 of the Elections Code is amended to establish election dates in each year until January 1, 2020, and a new Section 1000 is added to the code. Section 1000 of the Elections Code establishes election dates in each year, including the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June and November. This section will be effective starting January 1, 2020. Additionally, Section 1301 is amended to require general municipal elections to be held on established election dates. A city council can pass an ordinance to hold its general municipal election on the same day as the statewide direct primary election, statewide general election, school district elections, first Tuesday after the first Monday of March in odd-numbered years, or second Tuesday of April each year. The election must comply with all procedural requirements and be approved by the board of supervisors for consolidation. The city council can pass an ordinance to align municipal elections with specified dates. The ordinance must be approved by the board of supervisors for consolidation. If adopted, subsequent elections will follow the new date unless repealed. This section is effective until January 1, 2020, unless extended by a later statute. Section 1301 is added to the Elections Code, outlining these provisions. Section 1301 of the Elections Code allows a city council to pass an ordinance aligning municipal elections with specific dates, subject to approval by the board of supervisors. This ordinance can set the election date to coincide with the statewide primary or general election, or school district elections. In the event of consolidation, the general municipal election must follow procedural requirements of the code. A city council can set the election date through an ordinance, which must be approved by the board of supervisors. If the election date is changed, at least one election must be held before the ordinance can be repealed or amended. This section becomes effective on January 1, 2020. The Secretary of State will conduct a drawing to create a randomized alphabet for elections. The randomized alphabet for elections is created by drawing letters from capsules in a specific order, which determines the ballot placement of candidates with surnames starting with those letters. The randomized alphabet for elections is determined by six drawings, three in each even-numbered year and three in each odd-numbered year. The results are sent to county elections officials to determine the ballot order of candidates. The first drawing occurs 82 days before April general law city elections in even-numbered years, and the second drawing occurs 82 days before the direct primary of an even-numbered year. The third drawing for ballot order in elections occurs 82 days before the November general election of an even-numbered year. The Secretary of State certifies the order of federal and state candidates on the ballot, while county elections officials determine the order for all other candidates using a randomized alphabet. The fourth drawing for ballot order in elections takes place 82 days before the March general law city elections of each odd-numbered year. The fifth and sixth drawings for ballot order in elections occur 82 days before specific election dates in odd-numbered years. If there is a local election at the same time as a major election date, a different procedure applies. Each randomized alphabet drawing for ballot order in elections is open to the public, with the Secretary of State notifying the media and interested parties at least 10 days in advance. Statewide association presidents and party chairmen are invited to attend or send representatives to the drawing. The Secretary of State conducts a public drawing to create a randomized alphabet for ballot order in special elections. This process is open to the public and involves notifying media and interested parties in advance. The randomized alphabet determines the order of candidates on the ballot for both the primary election and the special election. The randomized alphabet for ballot order in elections is created by drawing letters from capsules in a container. This process determines the order of candidates on the ballot based on the drawn letters. The randomized alphabet for ballot order in elections is determined by drawings held at specific times before the direct primary and November general election of even-numbered years. Results are sent to county elections officials for ballot placement of candidates. The Secretary of State certifies the ballot order for federal and state candidates for primary and general elections. County elections officials determine the ballot order for all other candidates using a randomized alphabet. Drawings for ballot order take place before the June and November elections of odd-numbered years. If there is an election for local government bodies at the same time as a major election date, the procedure in Section 13113 will apply if the last day to file nomination papers for the local election is after the date of the major election drawing. Each randomized alphabet drawing for elections must be open to the public, with the Secretary of State notifying the media and interested parties at least 10 days in advance. Statewide association presidents and party chairmen are invited to attend or send representatives to the drawing to determine the order of candidates on election ballots. In special elections for State Assembly, State Senate, or Representative in Congress, the Secretary of State conducts a public drawing to create a randomized alphabet for determining the ballot order of candidates. This section will be effective from January 1, 2020. This section of the act, effective January 1, 2020, ensures that the term of office for incumbents in office on that date is not shortened. Incumbents affected by the act will hold office until a successor qualifies, with their term not extended by more than four years."
