Amends Title II of the National Housing Act to include a new section for single family risk-sharing with state and local agencies. The Secretary may insure mortgages on single family properties under risk-sharing programs with States or agencies to increase mortgage financing availability in areas with high house prices. State or local agencies will insure a portion of the mortgage under this program. The Secretary may approve applications from State or local agencies to establish a risk-sharing program for mortgage insurance. Approval is based on demonstrating legal authority, financial soundness, and administrative capacity. Violations of requirements may result in cancellation of approval. The Secretary may cancel approval of a State or local agency under the risk-sharing agreement for good cause. The cancellation is effective upon receipt of notice and is final without judicial review. Authority to insure mortgages can be delegated to State or local agencies under the agreement. The State or local agency, under a risk-sharing agreement with the Secretary, must adopt underwriting standards and loan terms for insuring loans without regard to certain Act requirements. Mortgage insurance premiums must be paid by mortgagors, with the sharing of premiums between the Secretary and the agency based on relative risk. The Secretary and State or local agency share administrative costs and risks. The insured portion of the mortgage cannot exceed 80% of the property's appraised value. Total principal amount insured by the Secretary is subject to limitations. The maximum amount for a mortgage insured under this section by the Secretary and State or local agency is limited by the Secretary's insurance cap and conforming loan limits. The principal obligation of the mortgage must adhere to a specific loan-to-value ratio and may include the mortgage insurance premium. Refinancing of an existing insured mortgage is subject to certain conditions. The refinancing mortgage principal cannot exceed the existing mortgage balance plus insurance premium. In case of default, the mortgagee can file a claim for insurance benefits with the agency, which will pay the full amount owed. The Secretary will reimburse the agency if the loss exceeds the insurance amount. The Secretary's obligations under this section are funded by the General Insurance Fund. Section 230 does not apply to mortgages insured under this program, and GNMA cannot securitize these loans. Definitions include 'local agency' and 'State agency'. The term 'State agency' refers to an agency of a State with authority to insure mortgages and participate in the single family risk-sharing program. 'Single family property' is defined as a dwelling for one family, including condominiums and cooperatives. The term 'State' includes several States and territories. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may implement the program authorized by the amendment. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may implement the program authorized by the amendment through risk-sharing agreements with State agencies, bypassing usual regulatory requirements."
