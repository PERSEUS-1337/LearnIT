The National Academy of Public Administration will conduct a study on improving the Compliance, Safety, Accountability initiative of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The study will focus on utilizing predictive safety data, addressing data age concerns, and differentiating between carriers transporting passengers and freight. The safety data should accurately compare individual motor carriers and consider variations in state- and self-reported data, geographic enforcement differences, and exclude crash data where a motor carrier was not at fault. The curr_chunk describes situations where another vehicle crossed the center line, drove the wrong way, rear-ended the carrier's vehicle, or struck it while legally stopped. It also includes cases where the other vehicle was operated by a driver under the influence of alcohol. The curr_chunk states that the carrier may not be responsible for the crash if it was caused by suicide, an animal strike, or if the carrier is not deemed at fault. The National Academy of Public Administration must submit a report to the Secretary and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure within a year of the agreement being made. The National Academy of Public Administration must submit a report to the Secretary and Congress within a year of the agreement being made, with recommendations for improvement to be implemented within 90 days. In this section, the Secretary and Inspector General must certify the completion of implementation. Definitions include \"covered motor carrier data\" and \"motor carrier\" as per title 49, United States Code."
