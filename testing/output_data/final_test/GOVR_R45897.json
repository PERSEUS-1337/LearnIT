    "content": "The first Morrill Act of 1862 established federal support for post-secondary education in agriculture and mechanical arts, leading to the creation of land-grant colleges and universities across the United States. These institutions play a vital role in educating future farmers, ranchers, and citizens, as well as supporting agricultural research and extension programs. Later federal legislation expanded the reach and impact of the original act, providing ongoing funding through various grants administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers capacity and competitive grants for states, including formula funds and peer-reviewed project grants. States often provide matching funds. Legislation has expanded the land-grant system to include historically black colleges, tribal colleges, non-land-grant colleges of agriculture, Hispanic-serving agricultural colleges, and cooperating forestry schools. NIFA is scheduled to relocate from Washington, D.C. in fall 2019. The report focuses on the scheduled fall 2019 relocation of NIFA from Washington, D.C., disparities in state matching funds for land-grant institutions, and the funding of TCU land-grant institutions. It highlights the historical evolution of post-secondary education in the American colonies, with limited availability and focus on classical and professional disciplines for predominantly white men. In the mid-19th century, there was a growing demand for post-secondary education in agricultural and technical fields. Johnathan Baldwin Turner advocated for more accessible industrial education, which laid the foundation for the establishment of land-grant universities. In 1857, Representative Justin Smith Morrill introduced a bill to establish colleges of agriculture through grants of land to the states. This initiative aimed to provide federal land for the establishment of these colleges, similar to the support given for the development of railroads through the Land Grant Act of 1850. The Land Grant Act of 1850 supported the development of railroads. In 1859, Representative Justin Smith Morrill introduced a bill for higher education institutions, which was initially vetoed by President James Buchanan. Morrill reintroduced the bill in 1862 during the Civil War, expanding the areas of study to include military strategy. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act on July 2, 1862, marking the beginning of the U.S. land-grant university system. The Morrill Act of 1890 expanded funding for land-grant universities, prohibited racial discrimination in admissions, and led to the creation of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) known as the 1890 Institutions. This act also established tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) in 1994. Senator Jeff Bingaman introduced the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act in 1993, which became law in 1994 under President Clinton. Land-grant institutions, established by the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890, focus on various academic fields beyond agriculture. There are land-grant institutions in each U.S. state, the District of Columbia, and many U.S. territories. In 2017, 1.7 million students were enrolled in 109 land-grant colleges and universities. In 2017, 1.7 million students were enrolled in 109 land-grant colleges and universities, with federal appropriations provided to U.S. states and territories for the land-grant university system. There are three categories of land-grant institutions: 1862, 1890, and 1994, each established through specific legislation. The 1994 Institutions, TCUs, Cooperating forestry schools, HSACUs, and NLGCAs are eligible for federal funding through specific programs. Federal legislation has defined the roles of land-grant institutions in teaching, research, and extension activities. The roles of land-grant institutions in agricultural research and extension have evolved over the past 150 years through significant legislation like the Morrill Act of 1862. Funding for these institutions is discussed in detail, with federal funding being discretionary unless otherwise stated. The Morrill Act of 1862 designated that each state would receive federal land for colleges focused on agriculture and the mechanical arts. The act also allowed for the use of land scrip if public land was insufficient. Funds from the sale of land or scrip were to support colleges for practical education of industrial classes. The Morrill Act of 1890 further addressed financing for these institutions. The second Morrill Act provided annual appropriations for HBCU land-grant institutions, prohibiting racial discrimination in admission policies but allowing for separate institutions for white and non-white students. This led to the establishment of 19 federally funded institutions. The Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 added Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) to the land-grant university system, creating twenty-nine 1994 Institutions funded through an endowment from the Native American Institutions Endowment Fund. These institutions have discretion in using the endowment payments and are eligible for some research and extension funds. The 1994 Institutions, including Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), have discretion in using endowment payments and are eligible for some research and extension funds. Currently, there are 36 TCUs designated as 1994 Institutions. Agricultural research at land-grant institutions impacts daily life through various investigations such as livestock breeding, agricultural value chains, soil health, and pesticide development. The Hatch Act of 1887 established the research function of land-grant universities. The Hatch Act of 1887 established the research function of land-grant universities by creating agricultural experiment stations to promote scientific investigation and agricultural science. This led to the development of State Agricultural Experiment Stations (SAES) in each U.S. state, insular area, and the District of Columbia, funded through capacity grants or formula funds. In the modern day, 1890 Institutions may be represented by researchers at associated agricultural or research sites within the state. The Evans-Allen Act of 1977 gave 1890 Institutions access to agricultural research capacity grants, distributed according to a statutory formula. 1994 Institutions are not eligible for research capacity grants under the Hatch or Evans-Allen Acts. Section 251 of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 granted 1994 Institutions access to competitive agricultural research funding in partnership with USDA, 1862 or 1890 Institutions, or cooperating forestry schools. Concerns have been raised about the lack of predictable annual research funding for 1994 Institutions compared to 1862 and 1890 Institutions. The McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act of 1962 authorized forestry research funds to be coordinated among state colleges, universities, and the federal government. Originally available only to 1862 Institutions, eligibility was extended to 1890 Institutions in 2008 and 1994 Institutions in 2018. The 1994 Institutions became eligible for research grants under the 2018 farm bill. Agricultural extension disseminates research findings to farmers through a Cooperative Extension System operated by land-grant universities in partnership with federal, state, and local governments. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 established the cooperative extension service to disseminate agricultural research findings to producers and improve practices. Capacity funds were provided to land-grant institutions for extension activities, excluding 1890 Institutions. The 1890 Institutions gained access to extension appropriations in 1977 through NARETPA, while the 1994 Institutions gained access in 1998 through AREERA. This legislation expanded the mission of the land-grant system and increased its geographical expanse. In 1908, modern U.S. territories began participating in the land-grant system, including the District of Columbia and insular areas like American Samoa, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Land-grant institutions established in the 20th century received funds for endowment and maintenance instead of federal lands. The University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, became a land-grant institution in 1908. Land-grant institutions were established in various U.S. territories in the 20th century through legislative acts. The University of the District of Columbia, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, and Northern Mariana Islands all became land-grant institutions through different legislative amendments. In 2018, a farm bill prohibited the designation of new land-grant institutions eligible for agricultural research grants. The 2018 farm bill prohibited the designation of new land-grant institutions eligible for agricultural research grants. Public colleges and universities can apply for NLGCA certification through specific grants programs administered by USDA. This change aims to avoid administrative costs associated with dividing existing land-grant institutions. Public colleges and universities can apply for NLGCA certification through USDA if they offer degrees in agriculturally relevant areas. Over 40 certified NLGCAs are located in 23 states, meeting eligibility requirements for Capacity Building Grants. Private institutions are ineligible, but Hispanic-serving agricultural colleges and universities (HSACUs) can benefit from integrated grants offered by USDA. The USDA offers competitive grants to Hispanic-Serving Agricultural Colleges and Universities (HSACUs) that meet specific enrollment and degree criteria. The 2008 farm bill established a fund for HSACUs, but no funds have been appropriated since then. Since its establishment in 2008, distributions have not been made for HSACU institutions. Section 7129 of the 2008 farm bill authorized appropriations for annual payments, capacity-building grants, and research and extension grants programs specific to HSACU. Cooperating forestry schools eligible for funds under the McIntire-Stennis Act include 1862, 1890, and 1994 Institutions, as well as non-land-grant \"State-supported colleges and universities offering graduate training in forestry.\" States must certify eligible institutions and determine assistance amounts. The 2018 farm bill removed the restriction on institutions being certified as both cooperating forestry schools and NLGCA. The USDA NIFA administers federal grants for research, education, and extension activities. Capacity grants are recurring federal appropriations allocated to states based on formulas, while competitive grants are awarded to specific projects through peer-review processes. Land-grant institutions receive capacity grants under federal legislation. Federal legislation provides capacity grants to land-grant institutions for research, education, and extension, administered by NIFA in collaboration with states, colleges, and universities. These funds support research and extension in agriculture, food, forestry, and socioeconomic welfare in rural and urban areas. The Hatch Act, Smith-Lever Act, Evans-Allen Act, and McIntire-Stennis Act are major sources of capacity funds allocated to eligible state institutions for agricultural research. The Hatch Act dictates the distribution of federal payments to states for FY1955, with funds allocated to the USDA, each state, and the Hatch Multistate Research Fund. State institutions receiving funds must match them with non-federal funding. The Hatch Act, as amended by the 2002 and 2008 farm bills, requires insular areas and the District of Columbia to provide matching funds equal to at least 50% of the Hatch Act funds they receive. The Secretary of Agriculture can waive this requirement if necessary. Other provisions include allocating 25% of funds for multi-state research and integrating cooperative research and extension activities. The Evans-Allen Act provides capacity funding for food and agricultural research at 1890 Institutions, similar to the Hatch Act funds for 1862 Institutions. Recipients must submit a Plan of Work for approval. Evans-Allen appropriations should be at least 30% of the annual Hatch Act appropriations, but currently, they are around 22%. Carryover of unspent funds is allowed for the following fiscal year, with deductions if not used within two years. Evans-Allen appropriations, which should be at least 30% of Hatch Act appropriations, were around 22% in FY2019. Three percent of the funds are reserved for NIFA services, with the rest distributed based on state rural and farm populations. Matching funds from non-federal sources are required for research and extension at 1890 Institutions. The McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act of 1962 authorizes research appropriations for certified cooperating forestry schools, including 1862 Institutions. 1890 Institutions became eligible for McIntire-Stennis funding in 2008, and 1994 Institutions offering forestry degrees were included in 2018. Matching funds are required for research and extension at 1890 Institutions. The McIntire-Stennis Act authorizes funding for forestry research through the Secretary of Agriculture in consultation with a 16-member council. Three factors are considered for funding apportionments: non-federal expenditures for forestry research, state acreage in commercial forest land, and volume of timber cut annually. Matching funds are required for federal apportionments, unlike other acts such as Hatch and Evans-Allen. The Smith-Lever Act authorizes the Cooperative Extension System and provides capacity grants to 1862 Institutions. The Smith-Lever Act authorizes capacity grants for 1862 Institutions for extension education activities, providing about 65% of federal funding. States can use these grants for local, regional, and national projects after submitting a Plan of Work to NIFA for approval. Funding is distributed based on the FY1962 distribution of extension funds. Capacity funds under the Smith-Lever Act are distributed to states based on specific proportions, with matching requirements for federal funds provided to state institutions. The Secretary of Agriculture may waive matching requirements for certain areas if needed. The Smith-Lever Act requires states to spend a percentage of federal grants on cooperative extension activities. Institutions can carry over unspent funds, and NARETPA provides similar funding for 1890 Institutions. The 2008 farm bill amended NARETPA to allocate at least 20% of Smith-Lever Act appropriations to 1890 Institutions for extension activities. However, in FY2019, 1890 Institution extension funds only equaled about 15% of Smith-Lever appropriations. Funds are distributed based on a formula similar to Evans-Allen research funds, with 4% reserved for NIFA. State matching requirements for extension funds are the same as for research funds. Before the 2018 farm bill, 1890 Institutions could carry over up to 20% of their funds. The 2018 farm bill allows 1890 Institutions to carry over 100% of their extension appropriations, providing greater flexibility for long-term projects. The Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 requires annual distributions of interest on the Native American Institutions Endowment Fund, with no withdrawals from the corpus. Recipients can use funds at their discretion for college support and maintenance. In FY2019, the endowment fund generated $4.6 million in interest. 40% of the available funds are reserved for administrative services, with the remaining interest income distributed among the 1994 Institutions based on Indian student count. No interest has been accrued for the HSACU Fund due to lack of appropriations from Congress. The interest income generated in FY2019 is to be distributed among HSACUs based on a formula. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) is a major competitive grants program for agricultural science research, authorized to be appropriated $700 million annually. Its appropriation has increased from $202 million in FY2009 to $415 million for FY2019. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) funding has increased from $202 million in FY2009 to $415 million for FY2019. AFRI grants support research, education, and extension activities in six priority areas identified in the farm bill. Eligible recipients include various institutions and organizations, not limited to land-grant institutions. Section 201 of AREERA amended the Smith-Lever Act to authorize agricultural extension appropriations for 1994 Institutions, awarded competitively. NIFA awards funds through the Tribal Colleges Extension Program (TCEP) for 1994 Institutions to cooperate with 1862 or 1890 Institutions. Smith-Lever 3(d) funds support special programs like Farm Safety, Youth Safety Education, and New Technology for Agricultural Extension. New technology for agricultural extension programs was introduced through the 2008 farm bill, extending funding eligibility to 1890 Institutions. The 2018 farm bill allowed 1994 Institutions to compete for funds in specific programs. Congress passed AREERA in 1998, amending the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act to authorize a competitive research grants program for 1994 Institutions. This program enables scientists at 1994 Institutions to engage in agricultural research addressing various priorities. The 2018 farm bill authorizes grants for students enrolled in 1890 Institutions for careers in food and agricultural sciences, with $40 million in mandatory funding available. It also calls for USDA to recognize at least three centers of excellence at 1890 Institutions focusing on research and extension activities in specified areas. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) focuses on various areas such as farming systems, global food security, natural resources, and emerging technologies. It authorizes $10 million in annual appropriations and funds research at other institutions. NIFA was created in 2008 to provide scientific leadership and administer federal grant programs. In 2018, there were plans to relocate NIFA employees out of Washington, D.C. A cost-benefit analysis in 2019 indicated that most NIFA positions would be relocated. Analysis released on June 13, 2019, showed that 294 out of 315 NIFA positions would need to relocate to the Kansas City Region. This relocation plan could result in a significant vacancy rate, potentially impacting NIFA's ability to manage its mandated programs. Public investment in agricultural research in the United States has decreased since 2008, while private funding has increased. The share of food and agriculture research funded by the public sector dropped from 50% between 1970 and 2008 to less than 25% in 2013. Various factors have influenced this shift, including market expansion, globalization, and legal decisions on intellectual property rights. Figure 2 shows agricultural research funding in 2013 from federal, state, and non-governmental sources. The decline in public investment in agricultural research in the United States since 2008 has been influenced by factors such as market expansion, globalization, and legal decisions on intellectual property rights. Private funding has increased, with a shift towards more private funding for agricultural research. The importance of public funding for meeting agricultural research challenges and ensuring global competitiveness has been emphasized by various organizations. The shift from public to private funding in agricultural research may lead to a focus on profitable crops and technologies. Increasing federal appropriations or state matching funds could support research on less profitable areas. Matching funds for 1890 Institutions, predominantly black, were less in FY2016 compared to 1862 Institutions, predominantly white. In FY2016, 1890 Institutions that do not meet the 100% matching funds requirement must apply for a waiver from USDA or forfeit federal capacity funding. Waivers reduce total public support compared to complete matching funds, creating a disparity between 1890 and 1862 Institutions. If states had provided full matching funds, state contributions for research and extension at 1890 Institutions would have been significantly higher in FY2015 and FY2016. Congress did not initially require state matching funds when creating capacity funding for 1890 Institutions in 1977. In 1998, Congress introduced a 30% state matching requirement for 1890 Institutions, which increased to 50% by 2002. The 2002 farm bill raised the matching requirement to 100% by 2007 and allowed USDA to issue waivers above 50% if states were unlikely to meet the requirement. Removing the waiver option may lead to some states increasing their matching funds to qualify for federal funding, while others may become ineligible without increased state contributions. The 2018 farm bill addresses disparities in state matching funds through a transparency requirement, hoping to incentivize states to provide 100% matching funding for 1890 Institutions. The 1994 Institutions, tribal colleges and universities, are the newest class of land-grant institutions. The 1994 Institutions, tribal colleges and universities, are a newer class of land-grant institutions with limited federal funding compared to 1862 and 1890 Institutions. In FY2018, 1994 Institutions received about 1.2% of research funds and 2% of extension funds compared to 1862 Institutions. In FY2018, there were 61.5% as many 1994 Institutions as 1862 Institutions. The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) has consistently requested increased appropriations for 1994 Institutions, citing funding differences as inequity. Section 7120 of the 2018 farm bill included 1994 Institutions in a new avenue for competitive funding, allowing USDA to provide grants for tribal students. The program provides funding for fees, experiential learning, and student services, with a maximum limit of $500,000 per state per year."
