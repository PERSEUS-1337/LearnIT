    "content": "The routine activities of federal agencies are funded annually by regular appropriations acts. When there are delays, a continuing appropriations act, or CR, provides interim budget authority. Since FY1977, regular appropriations acts have been enacted by the fiscal year's start in only four instances. CRs were used in FY1977 to fund certain unauthorized programs. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal fund obligation without appropriations. During a funding gap or lapse, federal agencies cannot spend funds without appropriations, as outlined in the Antideficiency Act. This guidance was established through opinions issued by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti in 1980 and early 1981. Multiple funding gaps can occur within a fiscal year, typically when a continuing resolution expires without immediate replacement. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from spending funds without appropriations, except as \"authorized by law.\" Agencies are not generally allowed to employ their employees during a lapse in appropriations, but can fulfill legal obligations for orderly termination of operations. Congress has occasionally authorized agencies to incur obligations without appropriations. During a funding gap, government agencies may create obligations for functions related to human safety or property protection despite a lack of appropriations. This can lead to shutdowns of projects and furloughs of non-excepted personnel. After a shutdown, furloughed employees are typically paid retroactively. It is important to distinguish between a funding gap and a shutdown, as they are separate events. During a funding gap, agencies may face shutdowns of projects and furloughs of non-excepted personnel. To prevent funding gaps, proposals for an \"automatic continuing resolution\" have been suggested to provide a fallback funding source. The enactment of appropriations is disrupted, but an \"automatic continuing resolution\" proposal aims to prevent funding gaps. There have been 20 funding gaps since FY1977, with most occurring between FY1977 and FY1995. Multiple funding gaps have occurred in a single fiscal year in four instances. Between FY1977 and FY1995, there have been 20 funding gaps, with the majority occurring in that period. These gaps ranged from 1 to 34 days, with the longest ones lasting between 8 and 17 days before FY1980. Funding gaps typically lasted from one to three days between 1980 and 1990. Since FY1977, there have been 20 funding gaps lasting from one to 34 days, with most occurring between FY1977 and FY1995. These gaps had limited impact on government shutdown activities, with agencies continuing to operate during periods of expired funding. The expectation was that agencies would not shut down during a funding gap before the Civiletti opinions were issued. Continuing resolutions typically ratified obligations incurred prior to the resolution's enactment. During funding gaps between FY1977 and FY1995, agencies continued to operate despite periods of expired funding. Some gaps did not lead to shutdowns due to short durations and expectations of soon-enacted appropriations. However, certain gaps did impact government operations, such as a one-day furlough in 1984. Most gaps occurred when regular appropriations measures were already in place. During funding gaps between FY1977 and FY1995, agencies continued to operate despite periods of expired funding.

Most gaps occurred when regular appropriations measures were already in place. The recent funding gaps in FY1996, FY2014, FY2018, and FY2019 resulted in widespread cessation of activities and furloughs. During the FY1996 funding gap, only 3 out of 13 appropriations acts were signed into law, leading to a furlough of 800,000 federal workers. President Clinton vetoed a CR extending budget authority due to Medicare premium increases. After five days, a deal was reached to end the shutdown and extend funding through December 15. Agencies zeroed out in pending bills were funded at 75% of FY1995 budget authority, while others were funded at the lower of House or Senate levels from FY1996 appropriations bills. The FY1996 funding gap led to a furlough of 280,000 executive branch employees between December 15, 1995, and January 6, 1996. A CR was passed on December 22, 1995, to provide benefits for veterans and welfare recipients and keep the District of Columbia government operating. The shutdown officially ended on January 6, 1996, with the enactment of a series of CRs to reopen affected agencies and provide budget authority through January 26, 1996. The funding gap for FY2014 began on October 1, 2013, as none of the 12 regular appropriations bills were enacted. An ACR was passed on September 30 to cover pay and allowances for certain military members, DOD civilian personnel, and contractors. Over 800,000 executive branch employees were furloughed at the start of the 16-day funding gap, but the number decreased due to legislative actions and reevaluations.

Over 800,000 executive branch employees were furloughed at the start of the 16-day funding gap, but the number decreased due to legislative actions and reevaluations. Congressional action on appropriations during the funding gap was limited to narrow CRs, with only one resolution being enacted into law. The resolution provided interim continuing appropriations for the previous year's programs and activities through January 15, 2014, ending the funding gap. At the beginning of FY2018, the federal government operated under a series of CRs as none of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted. The funding gap started with the expiration of P.L. 115-96 on January 19, leading to a furlough of federal personnel until the enactment of P.L. 115-120 on January 22. In FY2019, 5 of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted, while the remaining seven were funded under two CRs, with the first CR, P.L. 115-245, providing funding through December 7, 2018. The funding gap began after the expiration of P.L. 115-298 on December 21, 2018, leading to a partial government shutdown. It ended when P.L. 116-5 was signed into law on January 25, 2019, after 34 days of the shutdown."
