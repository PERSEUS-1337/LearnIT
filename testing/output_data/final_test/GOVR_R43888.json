    "content": "Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has involved comprehensive economic sanctions, including a trade embargo imposed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 under the Foreign Assistance Act. The embargo was later expanded in March 1962 to include the Trading with the Enemy Act. In July 1963, the Cuban Import Regulations were replaced by the more comprehensive Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) were established under the authority of TWEA and the FAA to prohibit financial and trade transactions with Cuba. Administered by OFAC, the CACR require licensing for all exports to Cuba under the Export Administration Act of 1979. Sanctions on Cuba were further strengthened by Congress through legislation like the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) were established to prohibit financial and trade transactions with Cuba. Sanctions on Cuba were strengthened by legislation such as the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996, and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The LIBERTAD Act codified the economic embargo, with the President retaining authority to amend regulations but unable to eliminate them without a transition government in power in Cuba. The LIBERTAD Act requires the President to end the embargo if a democratically elected government is in power in Cuba. TSRA allows U.S. commercial exports to Cuba but prohibits U.S. government assistance and private financing. President Obama announced a policy shift towards engagement and normalization of relations with Cuba in 2014. The policy shift towards Cuba included rescinding Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, restoring diplomatic relations, and increasing travel and commerce. This decision was made by President Obama in 2015, ending a long period of severed diplomatic relations since 1961. The Obama Administration implemented a policy shift towards Cuba in 2015, ending severed diplomatic relations since 1961. This led to the reopening of embassies in Havana and Washington, with amendments easing the embargo in travel, trade, and telecommunications. President Obama acknowledged he lacked the authority to lift the embargo. President Trump unveiled his Administration's policy on Cuba on June 16, 2017, rolling back some of the Obama Administration's efforts to normalize relations. The new policy includes restrictions on financial transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military and the elimination of individual people-to-people travel. Congressional action would be required to end the embargo by amending or repealing the LIBERTAD Act and other embargo-related statutes. The new policy on Cuba, announced by President Trump in June 2017, includes restrictions on financial transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military and the elimination of individual people-to-people travel. Most of the Obama-era policy changes remain in place, such as reestablishing diplomatic relations and easing sanctions to promote travel and commerce with Cuba. The Treasury and Commerce departments implemented President Trump's policy changes in November 2017, prohibiting direct financial transactions that benefit Cuban military, intelligence, or security services."
