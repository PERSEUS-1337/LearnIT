State educational agencies can apply for grants and must allocate at least 99.75% of the funding to provide subgrants to local educational agencies. To apply for a subgrant under this program, applicants must submit an application to the State educational agency as required. SEC. 3. ALLOCATION. The Secretary allocates funds to states based on student populations in grades 9-12 and previous funding received under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. States then allocate the remaining funds locally. The remaining funds are allocated to local educational agencies based on student populations in grades 9-12 and previous funding received under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. If a State does not apply for an allotment, reallocation may occur. The Secretary or State reallocates funds if a local educational agency does not apply for an allotment. The Secretary may reserve a portion of funds for administration costs, as well as State and local educational agencies. The agency can reserve up to 4 percent of grant funds for administration costs each fiscal year. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS AND OPTIONAL ACTIVITIES. Each local educational agency receiving a grant under this Act must certify to the State educational agency that funds will be used as specified, develop a drug testing and counseling program, and make the plan public. 50% of funds must be used for drug testing students in grades 9. The local educational agency must conduct drug testing for students in grades 9-12 with parental permission, including screening for marijuana, amphetamines, PCP, opiates, and cocaine. 50% of funds will be used for counseling services for students with positive test results. If a student tests positive for drugs, an additional test will be administered. Students in grades 9-12 must undergo drug testing with parental permission, including screening for various drugs. If a student tests positive, additional drug tests will be given every 4 to 6 weeks until parental permission is withdrawn. SEC. 5. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. Each local educational agency receiving funds under this Act must inform parents about the random drug testing and counseling programs. Parents must be notified at the beginning of each school year about enrolling their child in the testing program and the counseling services available. They should also be informed promptly about any positive drug test results or if their child refuses to participate. The agency must maintain confidentiality standards for all information.
