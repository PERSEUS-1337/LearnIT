    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Red Hill Oversight and Environmental Protection Act of 2017\" and includes definitions for various terms. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Administrative Order on Consent/Statement of Work (AOC/SOW) is a legally enforceable agreement between the Navy, DLA, EPA Region 9, and the State of Hawaii DOH entered into on September 28, 2015.\n(2) Congressional defense committees refer to committees defined in section 101(a)(16) of title 10, United States Code.\n(3) Facility means the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Oahu, Hawaii. The Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Oahu, Hawaii was constructed in secret in December 1940 with over 3,900 workers. It was completed in September 1943, ahead of schedule, and is the largest Department of Defense fuel storage facility in the Pacific theater. The facility is underground in volcanic rock with 20 steel tanks encased in concrete and surrounded by basalt bedrock, with only 18 tanks currently operational. The Defense fuel storage facility in the Pacific theater protects over 250,000,000 gallons of marine diesel, F-76, JP-5, and JP-8 fuel. It supports vessels and aircraft of the US Navy and Air Force, Hawaii National Guard, US Coast Guard, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The facility enables the US military to maintain a forward presence and build cooperation with partner nations. The Defense fuel storage facility in the Pacific theater, declassified in 1995, ensures maritime security, regional stability, and free flow of commerce. It was used in 1991 during the Gulf War for fuel transfer and is physically protected and cyber-hardened for operations off the electric grid. The fuel storage facility uses gravity flow to transport fuel to various locations. It is located near the Waimalu and Moanalua Aquifer Systems, which are potential sources of drinking water. The Navy and Defense Logistics Agency have kept the drinking water safe for 70 years, but the facility has experienced unscheduled fuel leaks. The fuel storage facility near the Waimalu and Moanalua Aquifer Systems has experienced chronic releases of petroleum, oils, and lubricants, potentially contaminating Oahu's drinking water supply. Historic records show over 30 leaks dating back to 1947, with an estimated 170,000 gallons of fuel leaked since operations began. In January 2014, the Navy reported a fuel loss of approximately 27,000 gallons from Tank #5 to the EPA and Hawaii DOH. The EPA and DOH negotiated an enforceable agreement with the Navy and DLA following a fuel release of 27,000 gallons in January 2014. The agreement requires actions to address fuel releases and infrastructure improvements, including tank inspection, repair, maintenance, and upgrade alternatives. The Navy and DLA have deadlines for deliverables related to tank upgrades, release detection, corrosion practices, and groundwater protection. The Area Cost Factor for Pearl Harbor may impact decision-making for maintenance priorities. Since a fuel loss in January 2014, the Navy has increased standards for workmanship, oversight, and operator procedures. The Navy has implemented various measures to improve groundwater protection at the facility, including updated operator procedures, increased training, new safeguards, checks, balances, alarm procedures, and the installation of two additional groundwater monitoring wells. The facility now has a total of 12 groundwater monitoring sites. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 4. The Sense of Congress in Section 4 highlights the national strategic importance of a facility in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region that supports military operations, disaster response efforts, and transit movements for the Navy and Air Force. The facility is irreplaceable, and relocating its fuel storage would impact the US military force structure in Hawaii. The facility in Hawaii is crucial for military operations and economic activity, with billions of dollars at stake. Closure would jeopardize national security goals and pose risks to the people of Hawaii. Adequate funding is needed to address long-term challenges and ensure the facility's integrity. The Department of Defense and Congress must commit to multiyear efforts to achieve AOC/SOW deliverables for tanks and infrastructure. Budget submissions should reflect funding needs for preventing fuel leaks and maintaining Pearl Harbor's high ACF. SEC. 5. Budget submissions should reflect funding needs for preventing fuel leaks and maintaining Pearl Harbor's high ACF. The Department of Defense must include in budget justifications a description of how funds will be used to prevent fuel leaks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii. This requirement applies to both the annual budget justification and future-years defense program submissions. The Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency must include in budget justifications a description of how funds will be used to prevent fuel leaks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii. This requirement applies to both agencies' budget submissions to Congress. SEC. 6. ANNUAL LOCALITY ADJUSTMENT OF DOLLAR THRESHOLDS APPLICABLE TO RED HILL. The Secretary of Defense may use up to $6,780,000 for a minor military construction project at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii, funded from Department of Defense appropriations for operation and maintenance and military construction for fiscal years 2017 through 2030. Notification to Congress is required. The Secretary must notify Congress of any decision to carry out an unspecified minor military construction project, including justification and estimated cost. The authority to carry out such projects will end on September 30, 2030."
