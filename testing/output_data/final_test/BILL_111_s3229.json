    "content": "The \"Sustainable Urban Development Act of 2010\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that over half of the world's population resides in cities, which generate most of the global economic output. By 2030, urban populations in the developing world are projected to reach 4 billion, with a doubling of urban populations in Africa and Asia, as well as the number of people living in slums. Additionally, more than half of the 1 billion slum dwellers worldwide are under 25 years old. Urban areas in most countries contribute significantly to the gross domestic product due to the economic benefits of large integrated markets. The economic benefits of large integrated markets drive national economic growth. Over 1.1 billion people lack access to safe water and 2.5 billion lack sanitation services, with costs amounting to 2-5% of GDP in developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa. Insecure property ownership in slums leads to arbitrary rents, evictions, and harassment, especially affecting women. Women, who often head households, face insecurity of tenure which hinders economic development, limits access to credit, and leads to conflicts over property rights. Despite constituting 66% of the workforce, women own less than 15% of private property globally, particularly impacting them in urban areas due to discrimination and gender-biased laws. Cities can promote economic growth by having proper infrastructure, institutions, and policies, as well as providing basic services to all residents. Connective infrastructure like roads and telecommunications is crucial for linking cities to rural areas and the global economy, reducing economic distances. The 2006 National Security Strategy and President Obama's remarks emphasize the importance of integrating poor citizens and least developed nations into the global economy to promote economic growth in urban and rural areas. Investing in clean energy, creating green jobs, building energy-efficient homes, and promoting sustainable development in rural areas to support economic growth. Commitment to working with the United Nations to provide safe housing for families. Goal to improve the lives of 100 million slum-dwellers by 2020. The policy statement emphasizes a commitment to clean energy, green jobs, energy-efficient homes, and sustainable development in rural areas to support economic growth. It also includes a goal to improve the lives of 100 million slum-dwellers by 2020. The United States foreign policy aims to support urban development through various programs that improve governance, land tenure, access to services, shelter, economic empowerment, civic participation, environmental preparedness, economic growth, and poverty alleviation. The United States aims to promote economic growth, alleviate poverty, expand financing for urban housing and infrastructure, prevent waste in development assistance, foster cooperative relations with foreign entities, and support international mechanisms for sustainable urban development policies. The United States and other donors aim to ensure access to basic shelter, affordable housing, safe water, and sanitation in densely populated urban areas. They also promote security of land rights, legal recognition of property rights for all income groups, equitable national land policies, and enhanced land administration services for vulnerable groups. To support vulnerable and marginalized populations, including women, children, the poor, and those living in urban slums, efforts are made to enhance the technical and financial capacity of developing country governments to manage urban growth transparently and accountably. The sustainable urban development strategy is outlined in Section 4. The USAID is tasked with developing a strategy for sustainable urban development in developing countries, consulting with relevant US government agencies and drawing upon successful models from various organizations and entities. The USAID is developing a strategy for sustainable urban development in developing countries, reviewing past programs and strategies to improve urban development, including access to shelter, land tenure security, environmentally sound infrastructure, capacity building for planning and governance, innovative financing, gender equality, and active urban participation. The USAID is developing a strategy for sustainable urban development in developing countries, focusing on promoting active participation of urban dwellers in governance and social services programs, defining objectives and performance measures, integrating programs addressing urban development and slums, and assessing the feasibility of establishing a senior advisor for urban sustainable development within USAID. The USAID is considering establishing a senior advisor for urban sustainable development to provide leadership, technical support, and guidance for urban programming. The advisor would also help build the capacity of government officials in managing urbanization and promote the involvement of local civil society. Additionally, options to leverage the private sector will be evaluated. The USAID is considering establishing a senior advisor for urban sustainable development to provide leadership and guidance for urban programming. Options to leverage private sector partnerships on housing, slum improvement, and finance will be evaluated through various initiatives. Support for collaboration with other donors towards urban development issues is also emphasized. The USAID is considering establishing a pilot urban strategies initiative to support cities in developing countries with sustainable urban development strategies. This includes providing technical and financial assistance to create frameworks for future growth and development. The USAID is considering a pilot urban strategies initiative to support sustainable urban development in developing countries by providing financial support, raising global awareness of urban issues, and integrating the needs of women. The initiative also aims to improve environmental sustainability in urban areas facing severe environmental stress. Developing cities are struggling with environmental stress due to the challenges of expanding infrastructure to accommodate rapid population growth and industrial activity. A plan is being developed for long-term US support for sustainable urban growth in developing countries, involving coordination between various government agencies. The plan for long-term US support for sustainable urban growth in developing countries involves coordination between government agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of the Treasury, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. It also includes leveraging the expertise of US-based city and regional officials, professionals in community, real estate, and banking sectors, private foundations, NGOs, UN organizations, and multilateral development banks. A report is due within 12 months. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress within 12 months of the enactment of this Act, including the required strategy."
