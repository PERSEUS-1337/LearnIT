    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Independent Living Act of 2009\" and includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that there are approximately 2,200,000 wheelchair users in the United States, many of whom qualify for Medicare coverage. These beneficiaries live independently and rely on mobility devices for daily activities. Individuals with long-term mobility impairments require access to appropriate wheelchairs or mobility devices to live independently, participate in society, and improve their quality of life. This need was recognized by Congress in 1965 when the Medicare program was first enacted to assist individuals with mobility disabilities. The Medicare program recognizes the need for appropriate wheelchairs for individuals with mobility disabilities. Currently, CMS interprets a provision to deny coverage for wheelchairs not deemed medically necessary for home use, limiting access to essential mobility devices. The current CMS interpretation of the in-home requirement for Medicare beneficiaries' mobility devices is inconsistent with Federal law, which aims to ensure equality of opportunity and full participation for individuals with disabilities. The current CMS interpretation of the in-home requirement for Medicare beneficiaries with long-term mobility impairments restricts access to necessary mobility devices, leading to unnecessary isolation and contradicting the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This issue was highlighted in the United States Supreme Court's Olmstead decision. The Olmstead decision established the right of individuals with disabilities to live in the most integrated setting appropriate for their needs. Congress expects Medicare coverage to align with medical standards and federal law. The Act aims to align CMS's coverage criteria for wheelchairs and mobility devices with medical standards and federal law, ensuring beneficiaries with long-term mobility needs are not confined to their homes by inadequate devices. It clarifies that such devices are covered under Medicare if used in customary settings for normal domestic purposes. The Act clarifies that wheelchairs and mobility devices are covered under Medicare if used in customary settings for normal domestic, vocational, or community activities. The Act eliminates the in-home restriction for Medicare coverage of mobility devices for individuals with expected long-term needs. This amendment applies to items furnished on or after the date of enactment of the Act."
