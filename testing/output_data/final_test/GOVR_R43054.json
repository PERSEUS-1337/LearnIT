    "content": "Concern has been growing among Members of Congress and the public regarding the financial sustainability of the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program. The Federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund, which funds SSDI benefits, is projected to be depleted by the fourth quarter of 2016, leading to a potential 80% reduction in benefits. The imbalance between SSDI's income and outlays has caused the declining solvency of the DI trust fund, with a significant increase in the number of beneficiaries on SSDI contributing to the rise in spending. The growth in the SSDI rolls has doubled from 4.7 million in 1980 to 11 million in 2013, contributing to financial difficulties in the DI trust fund. This report outlines reform proposals to manage the long-term growth in SSDI rolls, covering program eligibility, historical trends, causes of growth, and federal policy changes. The fourth section discusses options to manage the growth in SSDI rolls, including stricter eligibility criteria, improved program administration, return-to-work incentives, and employer policies. These options could reduce spending in the long term but may not prevent the DI trust fund exhaustion in 2016. For short-term solvency options, refer to CRS Report R43318. SSDI, established in 1956 under Title II of the Social Security Act, is part of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program. SSDI is part of the OASDI program under the Social Security Act, providing benefits to insured workers who meet the disability criteria. In November 2014, 10.9 million individuals received SSDI benefits. To qualify, workers must be insured and statutorily disabled. To qualify for SSDI benefits, workers must be insured and meet the statutory disability criteria. This includes having worked in covered employment for a certain period before becoming disabled. Insured workers must be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable impairment. The monthly earnings limit for SGA is $1,090 for most workers and $1,820 for statutorily blind individuals. To qualify for SSDI benefits, workers must have a severe condition that prevents them from substantial work in the national economy. Cash benefits start five months after disability onset, based on career-average earnings adjusted for inflation. Benefits may be offset if receiving other disability benefits. Average monthly benefits in November 2014 were $1,146 for disabled workers, $309 for spouses, and $343 for children. Disabled workers and certain dependents are eligible for cash benefits and health coverage under Medicare. Medicare spending per disabled beneficiary averaged about $9,900 in 2012. Some SSDI beneficiaries may also qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which provides cash payments to individuals with limited income and assets. SSI recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid in most states. Over 1 million disabled workers ages 18-64 received both SSDI and SSI benefits in December 2013. To apply for SSDI, an individual must file an application with a local SSA field office. To apply for SSDI, an individual must file an application with a local SSA field office. Applications meeting work history and earnings requirements are sent to a state Disability Determination Services (DDS) office for a medical determination. State DDSs decide if applicants meet national disability standards using medical evidence from treating sources. If a claimant's condition is severe and meets SSA's Listing of Impairments, they are considered disabled and eligible for SSDI. Claimants not meeting the criteria undergo a more individualized assessment. After meeting the medical criteria in the listings, claimants proceed to an individualized assessment of their functional capacity to work. If unable to perform past relevant work or other work, benefits are awarded. Denied applicants can appeal, presenting additional evidence and appointing a representative. The appeals process includes reconsideration, a hearing before an administrative law judge, review by the Appeals Council, and filing suit in U.S. district court. The number of SSDI applications doubled from 1980 to 2013. The number of SSDI applications submitted to SSA's field offices doubled from 1.3 million to 2.6 million between 1980 and 2013. The number of awards for SSDI increased by 111% during the same period, with the overall incidence rate rising from 4.4 to 6.3 awards per 1,000 disability-exposed workers. The overall number of disabled-worker terminations also increased by 77% during this time. The termination rate for disabled-worker beneficiaries decreased by 41% from 1980 to 2013, with key factors being death, recovery, and conversion. Death rate decreased by 42%, recovery rate declined by 77%, and conversion terminations occurred when disabled workers reached the FRA. The rise in the recovery rate during the early 1980s was mainly due to the enactment of the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980, which expanded the use of continuing disability reviews (CDR) for all non-permanently disabled beneficiaries. This led to a marked increase in the recovery rate between 1980 and 1982, but political backlash resulted in a temporary moratorium on CDRs for most mental impairment cases. The temporary moratorium on CDRs for mental impairment cases led to an increase in beneficiaries designated as \"permanently disabled\" and a decrease in the recovery rate. Changes to the disability determination process from the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 also contributed to this trend. The recovery rate in 1997 increased due to the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996, which terminated benefits for SSDI and SSI recipients with drug addiction and alcoholism contributing to their disability. The SSDI recovery rate trend was minimally impacted by disability based on DA&A, P.L. 104-121. The number of medical CDRs conducted by SSA decreased after FY2002, leading to a drop in the recovery rate. The growth in SSDI beneficiaries from 1980 to 2013 was mainly driven by disabled workers, whose numbers tripled. The number of disabled workers on SSDI tripled from 2.9 million in 1980 to 9 million in 2013. In contrast, spouses of disabled workers decreased by 66% during the same period. The number of children receiving benefits grew modestly. The increase in SSDI beneficiaries was due to a rise in the enrollment rate and a decline in the termination rate. The insured-worker population saw a growth in the prevalence rate from 2.8% to 5.9% between 1980 and 2013. When age-sex adjusted, the rate increased from 3.1% to 4.6%. The increase in the gross rate is attributed to the aging baby-boom generation and older workers being more likely to qualify for SSDI benefits. The growth in the gross rate of the insured-worker population is attributed to population aging and changes in age and sex distribution. Disagreement exists among researchers and advocates regarding the factors contributing to the growth in the SSDI program. Supporters of higher spending focus on demographic changes, while those wanting to limit spending focus on economic incentives and eligibility criteria. Demographic factors, such as the aging workforce, explain some of the increase in the age-sex-adjusted rate. The growth in the SSDI program is attributed to factors like the aging workforce and the overall increase in the working-age population. The expansion of women in the workforce has also contributed to the rise in SSDI beneficiaries. The labor force participation rate for women aged 16 and older doubled from 1950 to 1999, reaching 60%. The percentage of insured women for disability increased from 51% in 1980 to 67% in 2014, while men's insurance declined slightly. Female age-adjusted incidence rates for disability benefits caught up with men's rates since the late 1990s. The aging of the baby-boom generation increased the number of individuals on SSDI, with older workers more likely to receive benefits. Between 1996 and 2013, there was a shift towards older workers, leading to higher incidence and prevalence rates of SSDI awards. Between 1996 and 2013, the portion of SSDI awards to disabled workers ages 50 to FRA increased from 54% to 66%. Older workers report higher rates of work-limiting disabilities and the definition of disability is less strict at higher ages. DDS examiners consider age as a limiting factor in disability determinations, making older workers more likely to receive benefits even with the same disability. Rates of SSDI growth may slow down in the future as baby boomers reach full Social Security retirement age. Changes in financial incentives also impact program growth, with individuals weighing SSDI benefits against work opportunities and compensation. Economic conditions influence decisions to apply for SSDI, with stronger economies leading to more individuals seeking employment instead. However, adverse labor market conditions may make SSDI benefits more appealing. While most non-meritorious claimants are screened out, some on the margin of program entry may receive awards despite being able to work but choosing not to due to economic circumstances. During economic downturns, individuals may turn to SSDI benefits as a form of unemployment assistance, leading to an increase in applications. The recent recession saw a significant spike in SSDI applications, with a 32% increase from 2007 to 2010. The relationship between the unemployment rate and approval rate is less clear due to delays in the determination process. Several studies have shown a decrease in SSDI approval rates as the unemployment rate rises, leading to more applications during economic downturns. The number of SSDI awards granted by SSA increased by 22% between 2007 and 2010, reaching 1 million. This trend is attributed to individuals who could qualify for SSDI but struggle to find reemployment opportunities during high unemployment periods. The growth in SSDI awards granted by SSA increased by 22% to 1 million. SSDI benefits have become more attractive to lower-skilled workers due to rising replacement rates, making SSDI more desirable than work for many. The increase in SSDI benefits is more attractive to low-wage workers due to rising replacement rates, influenced by wage inequality and benefits formula structure. Researchers debate whether this increase in benefits has led to more applications from low-wage workers. Access to affordable health coverage also plays a role in SSDI application decisions. Congress extended Medicare to SSDI beneficiaries in 1972 due to higher healthcare needs and limited incomes of disabled individuals. Health care costs are significantly higher for disabled workers, with expenditures per capita over four times greater than those without disabilities. Individuals with disabilities typically use more health services and have secondary conditions that further impair overall health, leading to higher healthcare costs. This can make health care coverage prohibitively expensive for some. In 2013, 39% of individuals with disabilities had private health insurance compared to 71% of those without disabilities. The lower coverage rate is due to the availability of government-sponsored health care coverage under Medicare and Medicaid. Some research suggests that individuals with disabilities may apply for SSDI to gain access to Medicare. One study found that 22% of SSDI beneficiaries ages 18-64 lacked health insurance coverage prior to receiving SSDI entitlement. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) may impact SSDI application rates by increasing access to affordable health coverage. This could reduce SSDI applications by making Medicare less valuable but also increase applications by allowing individuals to obtain Medicaid or subsidized coverage during the waiting period. The law's effect on SSDI application rates varies by locality based on factors like Medicaid availability and local health insurance coverage rates. The Social Security program underwent amendments to address issues with SSDI and indirectly affected disability benefits incentives. Changes in retirement age and disability criteria contributed to the growth in SSDI rolls due to financial challenges in the early 1980s. The Social Security program underwent amendments in 1983 to improve the financial condition of the OASI trust fund, including raising the Full Retirement Age (FRA) from 65 to 67. This change led to an increase in the number of workers eligible for SSDI, resulting in a rise in DI spending. The increase in the Full Retirement Age (FRA) from 65 to 67 led to various impacts on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) recipients. Workers aged 65-FRA saw an increase in awarded benefits, with over 7,400 recipients in 2013. The FRA extension also lengthened benefit receipt duration for SSDI recipients near retirement age, with over 455,000 disabled workers ages 65-FRA receiving benefits in December 2013. Additionally, the FRA increase raised the value of SSDI cash benefits compared to early retirement benefits, resulting in a higher reduction for those claiming retirement benefits at age 62. The increase in the Full Retirement Age (FRA) from 65 to 67 had significant impacts on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) recipients. The reduction in benefits for workers claiming retirement at age 62 increased to 25% and will rise to 30% for those with an FRA of 67. Some workers may have opted for SSDI benefits to maximize total cash benefits due to the FRA increase. The Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 expanded the use of continuing disability reviews (CDRs) to assess ongoing disability status. Between January 1982 and fall 1984, SSA issued benefit termination notices to 490,000 of the 1.2 million SSDI beneficiaries subjected to a CDR. The rise in beneficiary terminations due to CDRs led to public outcry and damaged SSA's reputation. Approximately 200,000 beneficiaries had their benefits reinstated on appeal. In response, Congress enacted the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984, changing the standards for evaluating disability. The Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 made significant changes to the criteria for evaluating disability. It revised medical eligibility criteria for Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs) and required a shift in focus from medical factors to functional capacities for mental impairments. The Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 (DBRA) shifted focus to functional capacities for mental impairments and required consideration of the combined effect of non-severe impairments on the ability to work. It also introduced a temporary standard for evaluating pain and aimed to protect deserving beneficiaries while removing non-meritorious ones. The Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 (DBRA) introduced new evaluative criteria for disability, including subjective factors like pain and functional capacity. Despite Congress's intent not to change eligibility standards for SSDI, some researchers argue that these new criteria made it easier for claimants with \"difficult-to-verify\" impairments, such as mental and musculoskeletal disorders, to qualify for benefits. The Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 (DBRA) made it easier for claimants with musculoskeletal disorders to enroll in the program. The percentage of awards due to mental and musculoskeletal impairments increased significantly after the passage of DBRA. Awards based on mental impairments increased from 18% to 26% between 1985 and 2001, then declined to 17% in 2013. The share of beneficiaries with mental impairments increased from 24% to 31% between 1986 and 2012. Awards based on musculoskeletal disorders remained constant at around 13% between 1985 and 1994. The percentage of awardees with musculoskeletal impairments increased significantly from 13% to 36% between 1995 and 2013. The share of all beneficiaries with musculoskeletal impairments grew from 18% to 31% from 1986 to 2013. The growth in musculoskeletal and mental awards led to a decline in awards based on other disabilities. The overall rate of mental and musculoskeletal awards increased, leading to a decrease in other impairments. This growth may have extended the duration of benefit receipt for beneficiaries on SSDI. Beneficiaries with mental or musculoskeletal impairments have lower mortality rates and higher conversion rates, resulting in a longer-than-average time on the program. It is uncertain if changes in population health have impacted the size of the SSDI program, despite improvements in mortality rates over the years. Conditions like obesity and diabetes could potentially increase the program's risk. Researchers have not reached a consensus on the health status of working-age adults, with some studies showing an increase in reported rates of disability, especially among the younger population. However, other research suggests that near-elderly individuals are less likely to report work-limiting disabilities. The lack of a universally accepted definition of disability complicates trends in prevalence. The prevalence of disability in the working-age population varies depending on the survey and definition used. Inconsistencies in disability determination processes may have contributed to the growth in SSDI rolls, but evidence on this issue is inconclusive. Variation in allowance rates can be influenced by disability examiners and judges. Examiners and ALJs with high allowance rates may be offset by those with low rates. DDS examiners use medical and functional evidence to determine if an impairment prevents SGA. Regional differences in demographics, health, and employment can affect initial allowance rates. A study found significant variation in outcomes across examiners within the same DDS office, with up to 60% of applicants potentially receiving different determinations. The appeals process helps mitigate some of this variation, but up to 23% of claimants could still receive different outcomes. Some claimants may have received different outcomes if other examiners had performed the determination. Uncertainty at the initial determination level due to variation across examiners may have led denied claimants to appeal, increasing their chances of receiving SSDI. The study showed that claimants denied by stricter examiners were more likely to appeal. The hearing level has the highest allowance rate, with 48% in FY2013, compared to 33% at the initial level. 75% of denied claimants who contested their initial determinations had their outcomes changed. The study revealed that 75% of denied claimants who appealed their initial determinations had their denials overturned eventually. Variations in allowance rates among Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) at the hearing level were found to impact the number of workers on SSDI. Reports by the SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) highlighted wide variances in ALJs' allowance rates within the same hearing office, with judges at the extreme ends of the distribution scale improperly allowing benefits. Inconsistency in disability determination and appeals process may accelerate benefits receipt for some workers. Improperly allowed benefits in approximately 24,900 cases over seven years resulted in \"questionable costs\" of over $2 billion. One study found that 60% of claimants denied at the hearing level were later awarded benefits within 10 years. Options to manage long-term growth in the SSDI program have been proposed by various sources. Options to manage long-term growth in the SSDI program have been proposed by various sources, including researchers, advocacy organizations, federal agencies, and the Social Security Advisory Board. Lawmakers may need to enact short-term financing to avoid a 20% cut in benefits in 2016, such as a reallocation of the Social Security payroll tax rate or interfund borrowing. One policy option to reduce the growth in the SSDI rolls is to tighten the program's eligibility requirements. The aim is to mitigate the number of marginally disabled individuals on the program while continuing to grant awards to the most severely disabled individuals. Marginally disabled individuals have some remaining capacity to work, so rejecting their applications would generally cause less harm to them than to more severely disabled individuals. Younger individuals with mental impairments and low earnings histories are more likely to be affected by more stringent eligibility requirements. Enacting stricter eligibility criteria for SSDI could reduce spending and encourage some individuals to continue working, increasing tax receipts. However, some may seek other federal support like SSI if they no longer qualify for SSDI. Henry Aaron emphasized the need to balance awarding benefits to deserving individuals while denying them to others. Some Members of Congress are concerned that workers may apply for SSDI between ages 62 and FRA to increase benefits. Policymakers could restrict SSDI eligibility at age 62 to reduce growth in the program. Under current law, individuals aged 62 and at full retirement age (FRA) are only eligible for early retirement benefits, with a 25% to 30% monthly reduction in cash benefits. Eliminating SSDI eligibility at age 62 could save $10.6 billion between 2015 and 2024, but critics argue it would harm older workers unable to work. To qualify for SSDI, workers must earn a minimum number of quarters of coverage based on their age and have worked at least 20 quarters of coverage in the past 10 years. This \"recency-of-work\" requirement limits the program to individuals who have recently worked in covered employment. Increasing this requirement could impact beneficiary enrollment. The agency estimated that increasing the recency-of-work requirement for non-blind disability claimants would reduce federal outlays by $32.4 billion between 2015 and 2024. The stricter requirement would mainly affect individuals with intermittent work histories, particularly women who leave the labor force to care for someone in their household. Increasing the age categories for \"vocational factors\" can impact the assessment of disability benefits for older workers. SSA currently categorizes older workers into four age ranges, but there is a proposal to adjust these ranges to potentially increase benefits for older insured workers. SSA proposed adjusting age categories for older insured workers to increase benefits, but ultimately decided against it. One option is to improve program administration to reduce benefits for non-meritorious claimants. The SSA proposed adjusting age categories for older insured workers to increase benefits but decided against it. Reforms to the administration of the program could reduce growth in the SSDI rolls. Claimants can request a hearing before an ALJ within 60 days of a decision. Most claimants are represented by attorneys at ALJ hearings, which are considered non-adversarial. In the inquisitorial process, an ALJ investigates appeals by questioning claimants and witnesses informally. Proponents argue that this approach encourages more information sharing, while opponents believe it hinders ALJs from making consistent decisions impartially. The Association of Administrative Law Judges (AALJ) and the Social Security Advisory Board (SSAB) advocate for switching from an inquisitorial to an adversarial process to improve the accuracy of ALJs' decisions. This change would allow claimants and SSA to have separate representation, leading to more vigorous cross-examination and potentially better outcomes. Switching to an adversarial process for ALJ decisions, as advocated by SSAB, would allow for more vigorous cross-examination of claimants by SSA representatives, potentially leading to better decisions. This change could also result in more thorough investigations of claimants' medical impairments, improved decision quality, and reduced caseloads for ALJs. The pressure to quickly adjudicate disability claims has led to poorer ALJ decisions and a higher allowance rate. This pressure stems from SSA's 2007 plan to reduce its backlog of disability hearings. Judges find it easier and faster to say 'yes' than 'no' due to less scrutiny on award decisions. A negative decision requires more detailed write-ups for potential appeals, while a 'yes' decision is rarely appealed. The AALJ argues that switching to an adversarial process could improve ALJ decisions by allowing government attorneys to settle cases with a high chance of reversal before the hearing level. This could reduce pressure on ALJs to decide a high number of claims and potentially enhance decision quality. SSA refuted claims of sacrificing quality by granting claims too readily, stating they are making quicker, higher quality disability decisions. Successfully implementing an adversarial process at the hearing level poses challenges. Implementing an adversarial process at the hearing level for SSA poses challenges due to the need for additional expenditures, potential legal obstacles, and past unsuccessful pilot programs. The SSARP pilot program aimed to improve the quality and timeliness of hearing dispositions. Government representatives reviewed hearing requests and represented the agency at hearings. However, concerns arose over the fairness of the disability adjudication process. In Salling v. Bowen, a judge issued an injunction against the SSARP, citing due process concerns and violations of the Social Security Act. Despite SSA's appeal, the program was discontinued in 1987. The SSARP pilot program aimed to improve hearing dispositions but was discontinued in 1987 due to concerns over fairness and violations of the Social Security Act. The effectiveness of government representation in disability determination remains uncertain, as the impact on ALJ decisions and allowance rates is unclear. Medical evidence from claimant's sources is crucial in assessing impairment severity for work eligibility. To determine work eligibility, disability examiners assess the claimant's impairment against SSA's Listings of Impairments. These listings outline severe medical conditions that prevent gainful activity, with most being permanent or life-threatening. If the impairment meets the criteria in the listings, the claimant is considered disabled and eligible for benefits. Otherwise, a more individualized assessment is conducted, considering vocational factors and the claimant's remaining ability to work. The percentage of awards determined at the listings stage has decreased over the years due to outdated nature of the listings, according to SSAB, GAO, and SSA's OIG. SSA had not updated certain listings in over 10 years, and listings for mental disorders in 15 years, leading to inaccurate disability determinations. SSA initiated a two-tiered process in 2003 to update its medical listings for work-limiting impairments. Comprehensive revisions have been completed for nine out of 14 major adult body systems, but delays have been experienced in updating the remaining five systems, including mental disorders which have not been revised since 1985. Delays are attributed to a shortage of qualified staff. SSA officials attribute the delay in updating medical listings to a shortage of qualified staff and the complexity of implementing revisions. Updating the listings could help identify individuals with severe work-limiting disabilities and screen out non-meritorious claimants. The impact of updated listings on benefit receipt is unclear, as claimants denied at this stage may still be awarded benefits based on vocational factors. If eligibility criteria are not met, SSA conducts a more individualized assessment to determine the claimant's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. SSA uses medical and vocational rules to determine disability eligibility for SSDI. They rely on the outdated DOT for occupational information, despite the availability of the newer O*NET. Concerns have been raised about outdated information leading to awards for claimants who could work in unlisted occupations. SSA established the Occupational Information Development Advisory Panel in 2008 to create a new occupational information system (OIS) for disability determinations. An interagency agreement with the Bureau of Labor Statistics was signed in 2012 to test the National Compensation Survey for the new OIS. Testing in FY2013 showed promise, with plans to develop and implement the new OIS by FY2016. The updated OIS may help reduce growth in SSDI rolls by providing more relevant occupational data. The Occupational Information Development Advisory Panel was established by SSA in 2008 to create a new occupational information system (OIS) for disability determinations. The updated OIS may help reduce growth in SSDI rolls by providing more relevant occupational data. The current issue is that the occupational information in DOT reflects an industrial economy, while today's economy is more service-oriented. This shift may allow individuals with certain disabilities to remain in the labor force, but older individuals with disabilities and those with less education may struggle to adapt to modern job demands. Additionally, individuals with disabilities often work in physically demanding jobs, which may not be addressed by an updated OIS. An updated OIS may not reduce the number of individuals with certain chronic conditions from applying for benefits. Increasing the number of full medical CDRs conducted each year could help reduce the disability rolls by ceasing benefits for those with work-related medical improvements. SSA estimates a cessation rate of 17% after conducting over 443,000 full medical CDRs in FY2012. In FY2012, SSA conducted over 443,000 full medical CDRs, resulting in a cessation rate of 17% for 76,000 individuals and their dependents. The agency estimates $14.60 in future savings for every dollar spent on CDRs. A lack of funding for program integrity activities led to a backlog in CDRs, with potential savings of $1.3 billion to $2.6 billion if all reviews had been conducted between 2005 and 2010. Despite efforts to reduce the backlog, SSA still faces challenges in conducting timely disability reviews. SSA faced challenges in reducing the backlog of 1.3 million pending medical CDRs at the end of FY2013 due to reduced DDS staffing levels. Some states implemented furloughs and hiring freezes, limiting SSA's ability to conduct reviews. To address this, SSA transferred cases from furloughed DDS offices to non-furloughed offices and increased DDS staff by 2,900 employees in FY2009 and FY2010. However, an agency-wide hiring freeze in FY2011 hindered further critical hiring efforts. Due to a hiring freeze from FY2011 to FY2013, SSA had limited critical hiring, resulting in a decline in DDS staffing levels. To address the backlog of CDRs and enhance program integrity, support has been expressed for increasing CDR funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows additional appropriations to SSA for program integrity activities like CDRs and SSI redeterminations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated $1.197 billion for CDRs and SSI redeterminations. In FY2014, SSA received $1.197 billion for CDRs and SSI redeterminations, allowing completion of 526,000 CDRs and 2.6 million SSI redeterminations. The agency hired 2,600 DDS employees. For FY2015, $1.396 billion was requested for program integrity activities, enabling 888,000 CDRs and 2.6 million SSI redeterminations. Congress appropriated the maximum amount for FY2015. SSA estimated needing $11.8 billion for program integrity funding. The SSA estimated needing $11.8 billion in program integrity funding to eliminate the CDR backlog by FY2018. The Administration proposed replacing discretionary spending caps with mandatory funding to conduct more CDRs and SSI redeterminations. Additional funding would allow for more full medical CDRs, but a shortage of veteran examiners complicates the process. The shortage of veteran examiners complicates the process of performing more full medical CDRs. DDS examiners experience high turnover rates, with over 20% leaving within their first year. It takes about two years for examiners to be fully trained. Even with additional hiring, it may take years to establish a robust pool of experienced disability examiners. Future marginal savings from additional CDRs would be less than past averages due to diminishing returns. SSA prioritizes beneficiaries most likely to have medical improvement related to work ability, but as completed CDRs increase, the chance of benefit cessation declines for subsequent reviews. The chance of benefit cessation declines as completed CDRs increase. Former SSDI beneficiaries terminated due to medical improvement may reapply and return to the program, with an estimated 20% coming back within eight years. Program integrity activities alone may not substantially improve the financial outlook of the SSDI program, as savings from CDRs take time to accumulate and apply to multiple programs. The full medical CDRs conducted in FY2012 are projected to result in nearly $7 billion in lifetime savings spread out over decades and attributable to various programs. One policy option to combat the growth in SSDI rolls is to provide stronger incentives for beneficiaries to return to work. SSA allows beneficiaries to test their ability to work through a trial work period (TWP) and provides employment and support services. Despite these efforts, few beneficiaries leave the program. Congress enacted the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 to address barriers to employment faced by disabled workers. The Ticket to Work program assists beneficiaries aged 18-64 in rejoining the workforce by providing vouchers for employment, vocational rehabilitation, or other support services through Employment Networks or state VR agencies. Participation is voluntary, with ticket holders deciding when to assign their ticket. Despite higher employment rates among participants, only 2.3% of active tickets are currently in use. According to GAO, low participation in the Ticket to Work program is attributed to a lack of understanding and fear of losing benefits. Researchers suggest early intervention policies to provide employment support services to SSDI recipients shortly after receiving benefits to increase the return-to-work rate. One early intervention option to increase return-to-work rates for SSDI recipients is mandatory work preparation counseling. This could be cost-effective if it targets those with the best chance of success. SSA oversees voluntary grant programs like Ticket to Work, WIPA, and PABSS to increase beneficiary awareness of return-to-work services. Mandatory counseling programs like WIPA and PABSS aim to assist SSDI beneficiaries in returning to work. The impact of these programs on employment outcomes is uncertain, with some studies suggesting a positive effect. However, it is challenging to determine if beneficiaries would have achieved the same results without these services. Some beneficiaries may intentionally keep their earnings below the SGA threshold to remain on SSDI. Some SSDI beneficiaries intentionally keep their earnings below the SGA threshold to retain benefits due to their impairment preventing consistent work. Studies show a small percentage park their earnings to avoid benefit termination. Additionally, many Ticket to Work participants who left work cited poor health as the main reason, potentially leading to a weakened attachment to the labor force and reduced likelihood of returning to work. Several disability-rights organizations advocate replacing the fixed cash cliff with a gradual benefit-offset model for SSDI beneficiaries to increase earnings while on SSDI. This model could improve finances by reducing cash benefits paid out and make work more attractive, potentially increasing beneficiaries' attachment to the labor force. Benefit offset for SSDI beneficiaries aims to make work more attractive and increase earnings. It may not significantly impact the DI trust fund's solvency but could reduce benefit outlays. The SSA is conducting a Benefit Offset National Demonstration project to test this model, where participants lose $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings exceeding a set limit. This approach could potentially decrease the SSDI termination rate and attract more workers to apply for the program. The SSA is implementing a Benefit Offset National Demonstration project to test if benefit offset can increase earnings and reduce dependence on SSDI. Participants lose $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings exceeding a set limit. The project includes Enhanced Work Incentives Counseling to support returning to work. A previous pilot program showed positive effects on earnings but also increased benefit payments. The Social Security Advisory Board (SSAB) called for the early termination of the BOND program in August 2013 due to implementation problems and low participation rates. Terminating BOND was estimated to save approximately $17 million in FY2015. Some researchers suggest focusing on preventing new beneficiaries from entering the program by offering early employment supports. Supported work policies use financial incentives to encourage employers to provide return-to-work services. Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. Some individuals with disabilities may turn to SSDI due to lack of employment opportunities. Experience rating is a process for determining insurance premiums based on past claims. Experience rating is used in various types of employer-sponsored insurance to determine premiums based on past claims, creating incentives for firms to reduce the number of claims. Researchers suggest that the federal government should experience rate the employer's portion of the payroll tax for SSDI to reduce SSDI receipt rates. This system would link payroll tax rates to claim rates, giving employers an additional incentive to support disabled workers. Experience rating was gradually incorporated into the Netherlands' disability insurance system between 1998 and 2003, resulting in a 15% reduction in the DI incidence rate. The country has since seen a decline in its DI prevalence rate. Implementing experience rating in the United States could be relatively simple as employers already report payroll tax data to the IRS, which could be used by the SSA to experience rate the SSDI payroll tax without imposing new reporting requirements. Opponents of experience rating argue that it could lead to discrimination against workers perceived as high risk for disability. Supporters suggest implementing risk adjustments specific to factors like age and health status to address this concern. Critics also point out that experience rating could result in reduced compensation for low-wage workers, as employers may shift additional costs onto employees. Employers may offset higher payroll tax rates by hiring fewer workers, disproportionately affecting low-wage individuals in professions with high disability rates. Critics argue that employer cost avoidance could lead workers to apply for SSDI, increasing program size. To address this, promoting employer-sponsored private disability insurance could reduce the number of SSDI beneficiaries. Private disability insurance (PDI) offers wage replacement and return-to-work services. 40% of private industry workers have short-term disability (STD) insurance, and 34% have long-term disability (LTD) insurance. PDI is cheaper than other employer-sponsored insurance and can be offset by employee contributions. Some suggest promoting employer-sponsored PDI to reduce SSDI rolls by providing support services early in disability onset. Promoting employer-sponsored private disability insurance (PDI) can help reduce the number of workers applying for SSDI by offering financial incentives to employers or making it mandatory for all companies to provide PDI. Currently, some states like New Jersey, New York, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico already require employers to contribute towards some form of short-term disability (STD) insurance. Employer-mandated PDI, also known as temporary disability insurance (TDI), is increasingly popular in many European countries. The Netherlands requires employers to cover sick pay for two years, while the U.K. mandates up to six months of statutory sick pay. Researchers propose all employers provide short-term PDI for two years, including rehabilitation services and partial wage replacement. Employees may contribute up to 40% of the coverage cost. After exhausting employer-sponsored PDI, disabled beneficiaries qualify for SSDI. Beneficiaries found disabled qualify for SSDI, exempt from 2-year PDI requirement. Financial incentives for employers to hire workers with disabilities may be ineffective despite tax credits offered by the government. The effectiveness of financial incentives for employers to hire workers with disabilities is limited. A mandate to provide private disability insurance (PDI) may have a larger impact than tax credits. The mandate could increase the number of beneficiaries in the SSDI program, but the feasibility of a two-year PDI plan in the private insurance market is uncertain. The proposal suggests offering a two-year PDI plan, which may not be financially viable due to stricter eligibility standards in LTD insurance plans. Insurers often require beneficiaries to apply for SSDI to offset risks, but the proposal does not allow this cost-saving measure. The proposal suggests offering a two-year PDI plan that may be economically feasible for insurers by being less generous than current LTD policies. Insurers could raise premiums to make two-year PDI policies profitable, depending on federal mandates and state insurance laws. If premiums are raised too high and compliance penalties for employers are low, employers may choose not to provide PDI."
