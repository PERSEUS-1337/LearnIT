Definitions in the Act include the Secretary of Agriculture and the designation of wilderness areas within the National Wilderness Preservation System. The \"Scotchman Peaks Wilderness Act of 2016\" designates approximately 13,961 acres of National Forest System land in Idaho as the \"Scotchman Peaks Wilderness.\" The Secretary will submit a map and legal description for the wilderness area, with minor corrections allowed. The Secretary may correct minor errors in the map or legal description submitted for public inspection in Forest Service offices. The administration of the corrections to the map or legal description is under the authority of the Secretary. The wilderness area shall be administered by the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act, with certain withdrawals from entry, appropriation, and disposal under public land laws. State jurisdiction over fish and wildlife is preserved, and management activities align with the Wilderness Act. The Secretary can conduct management activities in the wilderness area to maintain or restore fish and wildlife populations, as long as they align with wilderness management plans and policies, including occasional motorized vehicle use. These activities should promote healthy wildlife populations to enhance wilderness values. To maintain wilderness values, management activities should be carried out with minimal impact necessary. SEC. 5. FIRE. The Secretary may take necessary measures for fire control in the wilderness area. SEC. 6. ADJACENT MANAGEMENT. No protective perimeter is created around the wilderness area. Activities outside the area should not be restricted if visible or audible within the wilderness. SEC. 7. INDIAN TRIBES. The Secretary shall ensure Indian tribes have access to the wilderness area for traditional cultural and religious purposes. Temporary closures may be requested by tribes to protect privacy during activities, affecting the smallest area for the shortest time necessary. Access to the wilderness area for traditional cultural and religious purposes by Indian tribes must comply with applicable laws, including the American Indian Religious Freedom Act and the Wilderness Act. Temporary closures may be requested to protect privacy during activities, minimizing disruption to the area. SEC. 8. EFFECT. This Act does not reduce the rights of any Indian tribe."
