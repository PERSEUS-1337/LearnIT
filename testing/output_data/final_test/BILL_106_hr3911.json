The Act \"Medicare Certified Registered Nurse First Assistant Direct Reimbursement Act of 2000\" includes coverage for surgical first assisting services by certified registered nurse first assistants. The term 'surgical first assisting services' refers to services provided by a certified registered nurse first assistant, involving assisting a physician with surgery and related care. The certified nurse must be licensed, have completed 2,000 hours of assisting in surgery, and be certified as a registered nurse first assistant. Payment Amount for surgical first assisting services furnished by a certified registered nurse first assistant is 80% of the actual charge or 85% of the fee schedule amount for the same services if furnished by a physician. Payments to employers are outlined in Section 1833(r) of the Social Security Act. Section 1833(r) of the Social Security Act is amended to include surgical first assisting services provided by certified registered nurse first assistants. Mandatory assignment rules are updated to include certified registered nurse first assistants. They are excluded from bundled payments for covered skilled services. The amendments to the Social Security Act include surgical first assisting services by certified registered nurse first assistants. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may reduce hospital payments to avoid duplicate payments for these services. Effective date of these changes is specified. The amendments made by this section apply to services furnished on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, with recommendations for adjusting payment rates for surgical first assisting services by certified registered nurse first assistants under part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The adjustments should reflect the costs of providing these services, including compensation, overhead, and supervision."
