    "content": "Indonesia faced a severe economic shock during the Asian Financial Crisis in mid-1997, leading to a sharp depreciation of the rupiah, capital flight, high inflation, corporate bankruptcies, and a near collapse of the banking system. Real GDP plunged by 13.2% in 1998, with exports and imports also falling significantly. In 1998, Indonesia's economy suffered a severe downturn with real GDP dropping by 13.2%, exports and imports falling sharply, and living standards decreasing by nearly 13%. President Suharto resigned in May 1998, leading to political unrest and the start of democratic reforms. The country sought financial assistance from international institutions and foreign governments to address the economic crisis. Indonesia received billions in loans and economic aid to recover from the economic crisis. Despite some success in restoring the economy, challenges remain. GDP growth averaged 4.0% from 2000-2003, below pre-crisis levels. Living standards surpassed pre-crisis levels in 2002, with a 12.7% improvement in 2003. However, imports were 21.1% lower in 2003, reflecting the impact of the currency devaluation. Foreign direct investment also declined each year from 1997-2002. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indonesia dropped annually from 1997-2002, with a $14.8 billion decrease in 2003 compared to 1997. Unemployment rate increased from 6.1% in 2000 to 8.7% in 2003. Short-term economic prospects are positive, with GDP expected to rise by 4.6% in 2004 and 5.0% in 2005. However, Indonesia faces challenges that could hinder long-term growth prospects. Indonesia faces challenges including government corruption, weak legal system, high public debt, government control of key sectors, non-performing loans, weak banking system, decentralization issues, and lack of protection for intellectual property rights. Separatist movements and terrorist groups pose threats to political and economic stability, as seen in the Bali and Jakarta bombings. In August 2003, terrorists bombed a U.S.-run hotel in Jakarta, killing 12 people and wounding 150, impacting Indonesia's tourism industry. The country faces challenges including government corruption, weak legal system, and separatist movements. Indonesia's major trading partners in 2002 were Japan, the United States, Singapore, South Korea, and China. Major exports included petroleum, natural gas, and clothing, while imports consisted of petroleum products, organic chemicals, and industrial goods. Indonesia's major trading partners in 2002 were the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore, China, and Malaysia. The top five foreign investors in Indonesia were the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore, China, and Malaysia. Major sectors for foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indonesia include chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper, metal goods, transportation, and real estate. U.S. exports to and imports from Indonesia were $2.5 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, in 2003. U.S. exports to Indonesia declined sharply in 1998 and 1999, remaining relatively flat since then. In 2003, U.S. exports to Indonesia were 44.4% lower than 1997 levels. U.S. imports from Indonesia grew slightly from 1997-2000 but have been flat since. In 2003, U.S. imports from Indonesia were only 3.6% higher than 1997 levels. The top U.S. exports to Indonesia in 2003 were soybeans, textile fibers, and animal feed, while the top U.S. imports were clothing, telecommunications equipment, and crude rubber. U.S. FDI in Indonesia was $7.5 billion in 2002, mainly in the mining sector. In 2001, the Bush Administration announced adding 11 products from Indonesia eligible for duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The U.S. pledged up to $400 million in financial aid and loan guarantees for Indonesia's oil and gas sector. Indonesia has reformed its trade regime over the past decade. Indonesia has reformed its trade regime over the past 10 years, reducing tariffs from 20.0% in 1994 to 7.3% in 2003. The country agreed to eliminate discriminatory trade policies on auto trade after a WTO dispute with the US and EU. Enforcement of US IPR in Indonesia is a major concern, with high piracy levels costing US firms $260 million in lost trade in 2002."
