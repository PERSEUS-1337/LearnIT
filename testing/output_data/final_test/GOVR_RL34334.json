    "content": "The debate surrounds the FDA's ability to fulfill its mission with limited resources. A 2006 report highlighted the agency's lack of resources to handle its complex responsibilities, leading to concerns about underfunding. Former FDA and HHS officials have formed advocacy groups to push for increased funding. Advocacy groups lobby for increased funding for the FDA, citing a lack of resources over the past 25 years. Critics raise concerns about inefficiencies within the agency and call for better resource management. Organizations like CATO and the Hoover Institute propose limitations on FDA's authority and question the need for increased funding. Former FDA Commissioners and interest groups argue that the agency is underfunded for its mission. The FDA budget levels have been supported by representatives of presidential administrations, but concerns have been raised about the agency's resources not increasing in line with its responsibilities. Former FDA Commissioners have testified that the budget is sufficient, but have also expressed worries about the agency's ability to fulfill its role as a consumer protection agency with current resources. This report examines FDA's appropriations history and statutory responsibilities. The report examines FDA's appropriations history and statutory responsibilities from FY1980 through FY2007, providing an overview of budget and personnel levels. It aims to inform discussions on whether the agency has adequate resources to meet its statutory responsibilities, without taking a position on the matter. The data presented is adjusted for inflation to allow for comparison over the 28-year period under review. The FDA regulates a wide range of products valued at over $1 trillion in the U.S. economy, with 25% of American consumer spending on these products. It is responsible for the safety of most foods, cosmetics, human and animal drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. The agency derives authority from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. The FDA has statutory responsibilities that involve product regulation and compliance with federal management laws. This includes setting standards for mammography quality and supporting advisory committees mandated by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. In FY2006, the agency processed over 20,000 pieces of information. The FDA processed over 20,000 information requests in FY2006. Congressional committees overseeing FDA activities include the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Committee on Ways and Means, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the Senate Committees on Aging, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the Judiciary. House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees on agriculture have jurisdiction over FDA's appropriations. The FDA's budget process has historically been under the jurisdiction of agriculture appropriations subcommittees, leading to concerns about underfunding. Former FDA Commissioners have recommended moving the budget process to the Labor, Health and Human Services subcommittees to address this issue. In February 2007, it was suggested that the FDA's budget should no longer be under the Agriculture Appropriations Committees to ensure adequate resources. The agency's total budget for FY2007 is around $2 billion, with limited resources allocated due to the focus on agricultural issues. It was proposed that appropriations should align more with health issues to better serve the FDA's needs. The FDA's total budget is $2 billion, consisting of direct appropriations and other funds from various sources. The agency prepares budget data for Congress in Justification documents, which are transmitted through HHS to the White House Office of Management and Budget for final approval. The FDA's budget is $2 billion, with Justification documents sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget for final approval. Historical budget analysis is challenging due to agency restructuring. User fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers were authorized by Congress in FY1992. The FDA's budget is $2 billion, with user fees authorized by Congress for drug and biologics applications. User fees for medical device and animal drug applications were later authorized. By FY2007, user fees accounted for almost a quarter of FDA's total budget. Personnel strength is measured by the number of full-time equivalent employees, but this measure is imperfect due to factors like pay grade and responsibilities. Adjusting salaries for inflation is challenging due to unique staff expenses like higher salaries and benefits costs. The FDA's budget of $2 billion includes user fees for drug and biologics applications, with user fees accounting for almost a quarter of the total budget by FY2007. Personnel strength is measured by full-time equivalent employees, but this measure may be inaccurate due to factors like pay grade and responsibilities. Adjusting salaries for inflation is challenging due to unique staff expenses such as higher salaries and benefits costs. FTE numbers do not include contractors, providing only a partial measure of workforce strength. The total FDA budget for FY1980 through FY2007, adjusted to FY2000 dollars, shows direct appropriations and other funds sources. The introduction of user fees in 1993 supplemented FDA resources but did not fully replace Congress funding. Budget authority remained relatively flat from FY1980 to FY1988, increased until FY1993, then leveled off. FTEs funded by user fees offset declines in budget authority FTEs from FY1993 to FY2001. Congressional funding without adequate allowances for inflation and other mandates led to FTE declines in areas not receiving user fees. The introduction of user fees in 1993 supplemented FDA resources but did not fully replace Congress funding. FTEs funded by user fees offset declines in budget authority FTEs from FY1993 to FY2001. Congressional funding without adequate allowances for inflation and other mandates resulted in declines in FTEs in areas of the agency not receiving user fees. A 2002 GAO report highlighted how FDA reduced staffing levels to cover costs of unfunded pay raises, impacting its ability to support activities not funded by user fees. The FDA staffing levels fluctuated between fiscal years 1992 and 2007, with shifts in FTEs allocated to different activities. Budget authority and FTEs increased after FY2001 but declined again from FY2002 to FY2007. Concerns were raised about attrition among FDA staff compared to other agencies like NIH. The FDA experienced high turnover among reviewers due to competition from the pharmaceutical industry and higher salaries in the private sector. To retain experienced staff, FDA increased pay for certain reviewers, such as toxicologists and pharmacologists, who were leaving for better-paying jobs in academia and industry. FDA is authorized to pay retention allowances of up to 10% of an employee's basic pay to address this issue. The GAO report highlighted FDA reviewers' lack of participation in training and professional development activities, potentially affecting the agency's ability to meet PDUFA goals. The 2006 IOM report suggested that FDA's high turnover rate may be due to organizational culture issues, leading to the agency issuing retention bonuses to some employees, which has drawn bipartisan criticism and is under investigation by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The FDA faced bipartisan criticism for giving bonuses to high-paid officials instead of frontline staff at risk of leaving. The bonus program was defended by agency officials, citing a decrease in employee turnover from 12-13% in 2002 to 5% in 2006. The bonuses, funded partly by industry fees, did not guarantee retention. Funding comparison between FDA, NIH, and CDC showed a significant increase in CDC's budget since FY1980. Since FY1980, Congress has significantly increased the budgets for CDC, NIH, and FDA. Other science-based regulatory agencies like EPA, OSHA, and CPSC have seen flat or declining budgets. Concerns in the late 1970s led to changes in federal regulations oversight by the Reagan Administration in the 1980s. The relatively flat funding for FDA and other agencies may be attributed to Reagan's regulatory reform efforts. Former FDA Commissioners have highlighted the underfunding of the FDA compared to other regulatory agencies, attributing it to Reagan's regulatory reform efforts and budget constraints. In 1986, FDA's budget was 97% of CDC's and 8% of NIH's, but by 2006, it had dropped to 28% of CDC's and 5% of NIH's budget. Former Acting FDA Commissioner Michael Friedman criticized the lack of budget growth for the FDA compared to the doubling of the NIH budget over the last five years. He emphasized the importance of adequate resources for regulatory review in translational medicine and stated that the American public deserves better from the FDA. The IOM report highlights chronic underfunding of core FDA activities as a primary obstacle to agency improvement. Members of Congress have expressed frustration over the FDA's budget level and officials' reluctance to request increased funding. The FDA Commissioner did not acknowledge the agency's need for additional resources in their testimony. The President's 2004 Budget set a proposed total for discretionary spending, with each agency's request reflecting the Administration's priorities. Former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan stated in a 2007 hearing that chronic underfunding was a primary obstacle to agency improvement. The FDA requires greater appropriations to improve post-market safety, address staff shortages, and enhance oversight of prescription drugs. Current FDA Commissioner emphasizes the need for resources to build a modern FDA that can effectively ensure the safety and efficacy of foods, new products, drugs, biologics, and medical devices. The FDA requires increased funding to improve post-market safety, address staff shortages, and enhance oversight of prescription drugs. The agency aims to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs, biologics, and medical devices for Americans, promoting personalized medicine and a healthier future. The 2006 drug safety report committee highlighted challenges in understanding the FDA's funding needs, with former Commissioner Donald Kennedy emphasizing the importance of pursuing FDA resource requirements. The FDA requires increased funding to improve post-market safety, address staff shortages, and enhance oversight of prescription drugs. Budget authorities prohibit present officials from publicly advocating for more funding, but historical data shows Congress has sometimes granted additional funds above Administration requests, such as for NIH. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) at NIH can bypass budget adjustments made by HHS and OMB through alternative mechanisms. The NCI Bypass Budget, mandated by the National Cancer Act of 1971, is submitted directly to the President for review and transmission to Congress, detailing the funding needed to maintain operations and make necessary increases. The CDC has prepared a budget in response to congressional requests, while the FDA may be seen as a barrier to advocacy groups seeking quick approval for new drugs. Public and congressional attention on the FDA is often triggered by crises or failures in regulatory processes, as seen in the thalidomide episode of 1962. Legislative solutions like the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments of 1962 did not come with increased funding for the FDA, causing years of funding issues. Critics argue that user fees implemented in 1993 have not fully resolved the FDA's funding problems and have created additional complications for the agency. The FDA has faced funding problems and management issues, with critics pointing to the agency's structure as a contributing factor. It is organized into six centers covering various activity areas, including Foods, Human Drugs, Biologics, Animal Drugs and Feeds, and Medical Devices and Radiological Health. Despite changes in center names, the agency's activity areas have remained consistent over the past 25 years. The FDA's activity areas have remained consistent over the past 25 years, but budget comparisons over time are challenging due to changes in categorization. For example, Biologics was once part of the Human Drug budget, making it difficult to separate the two activities in budget justifications. This report provides the most consistent accounting possible based on available information. The report discusses the agency's budget history and steps taken to address problems. The Office of the Commissioner and National Center for Toxicological Research are briefly mentioned. FDA's total budget increased by 136.6% between FY1980 and FY2006, with a greater budget increase than FTEs in each activity area. Tracking FTEs is noted as an imperfect measure of changes. The FDA's budget increased by 136.6% between FY1980 and FY2006, with user fees comprising a significant portion of certain activity area budgets. The reasons for the differing rates of growth in budget and FTEs were not fully explained in FDA budget justifications. The FDA's budget increased significantly between FY1980 and FY2006, with user fees playing a significant role. New statutory authorities often mandate initiatives without providing resources for implementation, leading to challenges in meeting congressional intent. Former FDA Commissioner Frank Young highlighted difficulties in implementing new initiatives due to unfunded mandates and inadequate resources. The FDA faced challenges in implementing new regulations and processes, including the initial ANDA processes and the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. HHS Secretary Shalala estimated the costs of these efforts to be $50 million. The FDA has collected $1.58 billion in prescription drug user fees since FY1993, improving the timeliness of drug reviews. Some advocates see PDUFA as distorting budgeting within the FDA. Advocates criticize PDUFA for distorting FDA budgeting by diverting funds from other uses to maintain drug review activities. FDA's financial situation has changed over the 15 years since PDUFA began, leading to an erosion of funds for other agency needs. The unanticipated PDUFA effect has led to an erosion of core FDA programs, including research support in various activity areas. Research has been integral to the FDA since its inception in 1906, with different areas allocating budgets for research programs. The National Center for Toxicological Research, Office of Orphan Products, Program Management, and Buildings and Facilities also contribute to FDA research efforts. The FDA's research budget has been decreasing within the five activity areas from FY1993 through FY2008. A review of FDA research in 1996 highlighted the need for industry support to convince Congress of the importance of research in fulfilling FDA's mandate. Dr. David Korn emphasized the role of industry in advocating for research funding, stating that industry is the FDA's customer and their support would carry weight with Congress. The subcommittee's report in March 1997 expressed concerns about the decreasing research budget at the FDA. Agency scientists feel that research programs lack strong advocacy from agency leadership and are at risk of being cut as resources decline. The subcommittee emphasized the importance of maintaining intramural scientific expertise to uphold the quality of regulatory activities. Former Commissioners highlighted the lack of financial support for FDA research during a congressional hearing in May 2007. Former Commissioners expressed concerns about the lack of financial support for FDA research programs during a congressional hearing. They emphasized the importance of maintaining well-trained scientific staff to make competent decisions on new breakthrough products. The erosion of funding has impacted the Agency's ability to support groundbreaking research in regulatory science. The FDA faces scientific deficiencies and resource constraints, hindering its ability to meet regulatory responsibilities. A report highlighted the increased demands on the FDA without a proportional increase in resources, leading to a reactive regulatory approach. The FDA Science Board reviewed the status of science and technology at FDA, noting the impact of inadequate funding on technology assessment. Previous reports highlighted consistent concerns about FDA's inability to implement necessary changes due to resource constraints. Advisor Garret A. FitzGerald attributed the agency's struggles to a history of asset stripping by congressional majorities and presidential administrations. Representative Rosa DeLauro highlighted the deteriorating state of science at the FDA and emphasized the need for a solid management structure and plan to effectively utilize additional funds. The FDA Science Board report concluded that substantial and sustained appropriations are necessary for the agency to fulfill its mission. The FDA Science Board report emphasized the agency's need for substantial and sustained funding to prevent staff loss and improve scientific training. Insufficient investment in professional development hinders the workforce from keeping up with advances, leading to risk-averse decisions. Without increased resources, the FDA will struggle to meet its mandates and fall further behind. The FDA Science Board report highlighted the need for increased funding to prevent staff loss and improve scientific training. Without adequate resources, the FDA will struggle to meet its mandates and fall further behind, impacting both public health and the economy. The report provides an overview of FDA's expanding responsibilities and budget from 1980 to 2007, emphasizing the importance of funding to support the agency's mission. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety and labeling of the food supply, as well as regulating cosmetics. In 2001, the agency regulated $417 billion worth of domestic food, $49 billion worth of imported food, and $60 billion worth of cosmetics. This oversight includes about 50,000 food establishments and 3,500 cosmetic firms, with additional guidance provided for restaurants, supermarkets, and other food outlets regulated by state and local authorities. The FDA provides guidance and technical assistance for ensuring food safety. It primarily has a reactive role as most foods do not require prior approval before entering the market. The agency monitors food labels, investigates safety issues, tests for pesticide residues, and sets standards for label information. These activities are mainly carried out by the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). The FDA, through the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), enforces laws like the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. These laws regulate food safety, labeling, and prohibit false advertising. Amendments have added authorities for setting pesticide tolerances, premarket approval for additives, and packaging regulations. The FDA has been given new authorities over the years, such as price comparisons and ensuring accurate product labeling. Acts like the Infant Formula Act of 1980 and the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 have established regulations for manufacturing, labeling, and nutrient standards. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 also plays a role in regulating dietary supplements. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 established health-based standards for pesticides in all foods and provided safety provisions for infants and children. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 eliminated premarket approval of food-contact substances. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 eliminated premarket approval of food-contact substances and introduced a notification process. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 required registration of food facilities and prior notice of imported products to FDA. The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 mandated allergen labeling on food products. The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2006 established a reporting system for adverse events related to dietary supplements. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 required a registry for food safety issues and increased FDA's food budget. Despite gaining statutory authority, FDA's Foods activity did not have the authority to collect user fees. The budget and FTEs for food safety activities saw changes over a 28-year period due to events and policy initiatives. Increases in budget and FTEs in the early 1990s were driven by implementing NLEA and CFSAN reorganization. A drop in FTEs from FY1992 to FY1997 was due to deficit reduction efforts and reallocation within the agency. Construction of a new CFSAN building in 2001 led to budget increases. Funding and FTEs increased in the late 1990s as part of President Clinton's food safety initiative. The late 1990s saw President Clinton's food safety initiative, with increased attention to the food supply after domestic terrorist attacks. Budget increases in FY2002 and FY2003 were followed by a decrease in FTEs. Reorganization of the agency's foods portion occurred post-9/11. Recent food safety concerns have highlighted budget and FTE issues. FDA approval is required for drugs to be sold in the US. CDER works closely with manufacturers throughout the drug approval process, overseeing clinical trials and evaluating data for safety and effectiveness. FDA continues to monitor approved drugs post-market to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Between FY1980 and FY2007, the FDA Human Drugs program saw a 234% increase in funding, with user fees making up a larger portion of the budget. CDER staff analyze data submitted by manufacturers, review adverse event reports, and monitor trends in pharmaceutical use. The FDA's increase in personnel is solely due to user fees collected since FY1993, with a 19% decrease in congressionally funded personnel from FY1992 to FY2007. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 aimed to supplement, not replace, congressional appropriations for FDA activities, with triggers in place to ensure this. The FDA's budget for human drugs is influenced by triggers and the balance between appropriations and user fees. Drug-related responsibilities have evolved with societal and technological advancements in the US. Historical legislation, such as the 1906 Food and Drugs Act, laid the foundation for federal regulation to protect public health. Key laws like the 1938 FFDCA mandated drug safety. The FDA's responsibilities have expanded over the years, with key legislation like the 1938 FFDCA mandating drug safety. The 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments required drugs to be effective as well. Congress has added new areas of responsibility for the FDA, including boosting pharmaceutical research, speeding up drug approvals, and encouraging research in pediatric drugs. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 further amended FFDCA sections to enhance the agency's authority in ensuring safety and effectiveness of drugs. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 expanded the agency's authority in ensuring drug safety and effectiveness, including new requirements for postmarket studies, labeling, and pediatric drug research. The Act also mandated the public availability of information on agency-industry negotiations, pediatric assessments, adverse event reports, and advisory committee recommendations. Biologics are medical preparations made from living organisms, including traditional biologics like vaccines and blood products, as well as therapeutic agents produced by the biotechnology industry. The FDA ensures the purity and effectiveness of biologics by issuing licenses for new products and inspecting manufacturing facilities. Biologics are complex mixtures that may be living entities and are isolated from natural sources or produced using biotechnology methods. FDA also oversees the safety of the nation's blood supply through routine examinations of blood bank operations. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was first delegated in the early. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially delegated to the Hygienic Laboratory in the early 1900s, which later transferred to the FDA Bureau of Biologics in 1972. The FDA merged the Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of Biologics in the early 1980s to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics. In 1987, the FDA split the Center for Drugs and Biologics into CDER and CBER. CBER continues to use NIH facilities until its expected move to the new FDA headquarters in 2012. The FDA has faced challenges in determining the regulatory jurisdiction of biologics, drugs, and devices. In 1991, an agreement stated that traditional biologics and most biotechnology products would be regulated by CBER. However, in 2002, the FDA announced a reorganization, transferring responsibility for most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER in 2003. CBER now focuses on traditional biologics such as vaccines, blood products, and allergenic products. The FDA budget for Biologics, including antitoxins, antivenins, venoms, and blood products, has fluctuated over the years. The introduction of user fees in 1993 led to a decline in funding and FTEs, with a temporary increase post-9/11 emergency funding. The reorganization in the 1980s shifted responsibilities between CBER and CDER for regulating biologics. The FDA's budget for Biologics has fluctuated over the years, with a drop in funding and FTEs from FY2003 to FY2004 due to reorganization of review responsibilities. FDA's authority for biological products approval has changed between 1980 and 2007, governed by the Public Health Service Act and FFDCA. FDA also regulates medical devices involving biologics under various medical device laws. The FDA's authority for biological products approval has evolved over the years, with additional laws creating more responsibilities. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 requires a pediatric assessment for new biologics, while the Project Bioshield Act of 2004 mandates expedited reviews for bioterrorism countermeasures. Proposed legislation aims to expand regulatory activities for follow-on biologics. The FDA is considering a new regulatory pathway for products made by the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry, similar to the approval process for generic chemical drugs under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine regulates animal feeds, veterinary drugs, and devices, with authority to take enforcement actions if needed. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has the authority to enforce regulations for animal feed and veterinary drugs. CVM is responsible for ensuring the safety of human foods derived from animals, setting tolerances for chemicals in meat and poultry, evaluating food safety of animal clones, and ensuring the safety of animal drugs for humans. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine enforces regulations for animal feed and veterinary drugs to ensure the safety of human foods derived from animals. Drug sponsors must demonstrate methods to detect drug residues in food-producing animals. The FDA budget for animal drugs and feeds increased from $46.7 million in FY1980 to $87.6 million in FY2007, with FTEs totaling 516 in FY1980 and 619 in FY2007. The budget for animal drugs and feeds at the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine almost doubled from $44.3 million to $82.4 million in the three-year period from FY1999 to FY2002, with FTEs increasing from 393 to 570. Funding increases were requested to support new statutory requirements and agency-wide initiatives in food safety, antimicrobial resistance, and drug safety surveillance. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine saw a significant increase in funding and staff from FY1999 to FY2002 to support food safety, antimicrobial resistance, and drug safety surveillance. This included initiatives for bioterrorism preparedness and feed safety programs to protect against BSE. Several laws enacted since 1980 aimed to improve veterinary drug availability and streamline the drug approval process. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine received increased funding and staff to support food safety, antimicrobial resistance, and drug safety surveillance. Laws enacted since 1980 aimed to improve veterinary drug availability and streamline the approval process, including the authorization of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs and permitting veterinarians to prescribe extra-label uses of approved drugs. The FDA received increased funding and staff to support food safety, antimicrobial resistance, and drug safety surveillance. Laws enacted since 1980 aimed to improve veterinary drug availability and streamline the approval process. The Animal Drug User Fee Act authorized FDA to collect fees for certain animal drug applications, while the Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act allowed conditional approval for drugs to treat minor animal species and uncommon diseases. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and eliminating unnecessary human exposure to man-made radiation from various products. This includes developing standards for pet foods, monitoring disease outbreaks, and establishing a reportable food registry for tainted foods that may harm humans or animals. Thousands of medical devices, from pacemakers to contact lenses, are regulated by the agency, along with radiation-emitting products like microwave ovens. The FDA regulates medical devices and radiation-emitting products such as microwave ovens, video display terminals, and medical ultrasound and x-ray machines. They review requests for research or marketing, collect and analyze information on device use, set manufacturing regulations, monitor compliance, and provide assistance to small manufacturers. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health oversees most activities related to devices and radiological health. CBER also regulates devices related to blood collection and processing. CBER regulates devices related to blood collection and processing, as well as cellular therapies. In FY1980, FDA's DRH budget was $97,427,000, supporting 1,399 FTEs. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 ensured the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. Several major device legislation pieces were passed between FY1980 and FY2007. Between FY1980 and FY2007, major device legislation was passed, granting FDA new authorities such as enforcing postmarket requirements, recalling unsafe devices, and regulating unapproved uses of approved devices. Legislation also aimed to reduce regulatory burden on FDA, like the Mammography Quality Standards Act. The Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA) aimed to reduce regulatory burden on the FDA by allowing third-parties to conduct inspections and collect certification fees, creating new revenue streams. MDUFMA also authorized the collection of user fees for premarket device review to generate additional revenue. MDUFMA included a trigger to ensure direct appropriations for DRH-related activities were maintained, despite user fees. In 2005, appropriations fell below the trigger amount, prompting Congress to adjust it. Budget and FTEs for DRH-related activities remained stable in the 1980s, increased in the early 1990s, and diverged in the late 1990s. Budget increases in the 2000s did not align with FTE changes. The budget and FTEs for DRH-related activities increased over a 28-year period, with budget increasing by 124.5% and FTEs by 7.1%. Adjusted for inflation, budget authority increased by 94.2%, while FTEs supported by the budget authority decreased by 5.1%. In FY2006, user fees made up 13.5% of the device-related budget, compared to none in FY1980. User fee-funded FTEs accounted for 11.3% of the budget in FY2006. FDA's toxicological research activities are carried out by the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) in Jefferson, AR. The National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) in Jefferson, AR, conducts peer-reviewed scientific research and provides expert technical advice to support FDA regulatory activities. NCTR uses various collaborations to advance its research. The FDA Commissioner has broad authority to conduct research, and the Office of the Commissioner (OC) includes components like the Ethics Program and Office of Crisis Management. Funding for the OC was included in FDA's Program Management budget line in FY1980. The Office of the Commissioner (OC) funding was included in FDA's Program Management budget line. This funding covered program direction, administrative support functions, and ensured efficient use of resources for FDA's consumer protection efforts. The lead office for FDA's inspection and enforcement activities is the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), which includes various components like the Office of Resource Management and the Office of Criminal Investigations. The report provides information on changes in FDA's resources, budget, and FTEs, as well as its statutory responsibilities. It aims to help Congress evaluate if FDA has the necessary financial resources to meet its obligations. FDA-regulated products impact American citizens and global consumers, with about 25% of consumer spending on these products. The FDA regulates a wide range of products valued at over $1 trillion, including food labels, prescription drug ads, coloring in foods and cosmetics, ingredient purity, equipment inspections, and antibiotics in animal feed. Data from annual reports show some year-by-year variation but mostly illustrate trends in FDA regulation. The FDA's budget has almost doubled in direct congressional appropriations since FY1980, with a more than 10-fold increase in other funds, mostly from user fees. This has resulted in an overall budget in FY2006 almost 2-1/2 times that in FY1980. FDA FTEs have seen less than a 1% increase in budget authority-funded positions, but an almost fourfold increase in FTEs funded by other sources, mostly user fees, resulting in an overall 19% increase from FY1980 to FY2006. The human drugs program was the first to include user fee revenue in its budget. The human drugs program was the first to include user fee revenue in its budget. From FY1980 to FY2006, the total budget more than tripled, with user fees contributing 46% of the budget and funding 39% of the FTEs. Congress has generally kept direct appropriations in line with inflation or increased them gradually, except for FY2002. The FDA's budget has seen gradual increases, with a significant exception in FY2002 following the September 11 attacks. However, the agency's research program has suffered, and its data systems are inadequate. The report focuses solely on the FDA budget, without delving into other constraints such as lack of advocacy and leadership vacancies. The FDA's budget has gradually increased, with exceptions in FY2002. The agency's research program has suffered, and its data systems are inadequate. From 1980 to 2007, 36 new statutes addressed FDA activities, but this report does not evaluate their impact on workload and resources. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 highlighted funding issues and brought significant changes to the agency. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 authorized new provisions, including demonstration grants for pediatric device availability, public-private partnerships, expanded clinical trial registry, and strengthened FDA authority for labeling changes. Implementation requires new regulations, industry communication, and resources totaling $250 million in appropriations annually. The report focuses on FDA's financial and human resources, as well as statutory responsibilities. Suggestions to improve FDA's budget situation include restructuring the PDUFA trigger mechanism, bypassing HHS and OMB in budget requests, and submitting a Professional Judgment budget. There is also a proposal to move FDA appropriations to the Labor-HHS subcommittees. The report tracks FDA's budget and employee numbers from FY2007 to FY1980, using data from Justification documents prepared annually by FDA for Congress. FDA indicated constraints on staff time for providing historical data. Justifications are transmitted through HHS to OMB with adjustments made by both agencies. The report tracks FDA's budget and employee numbers from FY2007 to FY1980 using Justification documents prepared annually. These documents provide detailed data and narrative, with variations due to changes in agency organization and other conditions. The section highlights inconsistencies in the data presentation and describes efforts to make the data more consistent. Additional data inconsistencies may exist, not readily apparent in the documents. The report tracks FDA's budget and employee numbers from FY2007 to FY1980 using Justification documents. It uses data from the Actuals column in tables labeled All Purpose Table\u2014Total Program Level, Budget Authority, and User Fees. FDA's total budget consists of direct congressional appropriations (budget authority) and funds collected from other sources (other funds/user fees). The FDA's budget includes funds from sources other than direct congressional appropriations, such as user fees from various acts.
