    "content": "The Act titled \"Geothermal Exploration Opportunities Act of 2015\" introduces geothermal exploration test projects under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. The term 'covered land' in the Geothermal Exploration Opportunities Act of 2015 refers to public land administered by the Secretary or National Forest System land not excluded from geothermal energy development under specific land use plans or laws. The term 'Secretary concerned' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary for land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Geothermal exploration test projects on covered land are categorically excluded from NEPA review requirements. Under NEPA or section 1508.4 of title 40, CFR, geothermal resource exploration operations are exempt if conducted under this Act. Eligible activities include non-drilling geophysical exploration and drilling on leased land for geothermal resource development. Geothermal exploration activities exempt under this Act must cause minimal soil or vegetation disruption, be completed within 90 days, and restore the project site within 3 years. The project completion date must restore the project site to its original condition unless the site is used for energy development or yields geothermal resources for another project. The drilling of a well to test or explore for geothermal resources on leased land must cause minimal surface disturbance and have a site-specific analysis prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The drilling of a geothermal well must meet specific criteria, including minimal surface disturbance and compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The categorical exclusion for drilling a geothermal well is subject to extraordinary circumstances as per Departmental Manual provisions. A leaseholder must provide notice to the Secretary 30 days before drilling begins, and the project must be reviewed within 10 days. The Secretary must review a project within 10 days of receiving a notice of intent to determine if it is an eligible activity. If eligible, the project is considered a categorical exclusion under environmental regulations. If not eligible, the leaseholder is notified accordingly. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 applies to the project, with clear findings on deficiencies required before beginning the project."
