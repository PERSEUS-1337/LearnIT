    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veteran Education Empowerment Act\". Congress finds that over 1,000,000 veterans attended higher education in 2012, facing unique challenges in transitioning from the battlefield to the classroom and workforce. Studies show that veterans struggle with academic skills and adjusting to a different social environment, leading to a high dropout rate. Connecting veteran students can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and vulnerability on campus. The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans is significantly higher than non-veterans entering the workforce for the first time. Mission United emphasizes the importance of mentoring veteran students by other veterans who understand their experiences. Veteran student centers are recognized as best practices by the Student Veterans of America and the American Council on Education. Having a dedicated space for veterans on campus is seen as a critical component for colleges to better serve veteran students. Budget constraints often hinder institutions from providing such spaces, but the 110th Congress authorized funding for veteran student centers. These centers, supported by federally funded staff, have been effective in supporting veteran students. Funded veteran student centers and staff have improved recruitment, retention, and graduation rates, helped veteran students feel connected across campus, and contributed to their successful academic outcomes. Establish, maintain, and improve veteran student centers through a grant program. The Secretary of Education will establish a grant program to assist institutions of higher education in creating and enhancing veteran student centers. Eligibility criteria include a minimum student population of 15,000. The grant program assists institutions with at least 15,000 students, ensuring a minimum of one percent are veterans or Armed Forces members. The institution must be in a region with a significant veteran population and provide programs for local veterans. A sustainability plan is required for the veteran student center. Grant funds are to be used for establishing, maintaining, or improving the center. Each grant awarded under subsection (a) lasts for 4 years and cannot exceed $500,000. The Secretary evaluates institutions annually to ensure proper use of the grant funds. The Secretary may delay future disbursements until institutions correct deficiencies and comply with the grant program. A report to Congress after 3 years will detail the number of grants awarded, recipients, amounts awarded, and how funds were used. The Secretary will also determine if the grant program should be extended or expanded. The grant program established by the Secretary will terminate four years after its establishment. Definitions include \"institution of higher education\" and \"veteran student center\" as spaces for veterans and members of the Armed Forces. A centralized office for veteran services staffed by trained employees and volunteers provides assistance to veterans transitioning to student life, the civilian workforce, networking, and obtaining government benefits. The centralized office for veteran services assists veterans in transitioning to student life, the civilian workforce, networking, and obtaining government benefits. Students may be eligible for understanding how to succeed in higher education, including transferring educational credits."
