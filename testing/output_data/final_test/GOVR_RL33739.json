The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which placed restrictions on companies with controlling interests in public utilities. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA 1935) imposed strict limitations on public utility holding companies to protect the financial health of utility providers, ensure service dependability, and prevent market domination. Supporters of the act argued that it provided a barrier against large corporations' manipulation. However, proponents of repeal claimed that the ownership restrictions and SEC filing requirements were burdensome and hindered investment in the industry. PUHCA 1935's reach had been diminishing over the years, with exemptions created for certain types of power plants under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) in 1978 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, transferring oversight authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state regulatory authorities. This new legislation, known as PUHCA 2005, allows FERC access to holding companies' financial activities without imposing substantive restrictions. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 in 2005 removed restrictions on ownership of public utilities, allowing previously ineligible investors to own them. However, transactions involving utilities still need to meet regulatory requirements enforced by agencies like the DOJ, FTC, and SEC. The significance of this repeal and the new laws enacted in its place must be understood in the context of PUHCA's scope and function. PUHCA 1935 regulated holding companies with subsidiaries in electric utility or gas distribution. Holding companies were defined as those controlling 10% or more of voting securities or having a controlling influence over management. Public utility holding companies faced operational restrictions under the statute. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 regulated integrated public utility systems, including generating plants, transmission lines, and distributing facilities. It aimed to prevent large-scale operations that could hinder localized management and efficient regulation. The act also imposed restrictions on transactions related to public utility corporate structure, requiring mergers and acquisitions to maintain simplicity and be in the public interest. Holding companies were prohibited from holding non-utility businesses. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 aimed to regulate public utility holding companies, restricting them from holding non-utility businesses unless necessary for operations. The SEC was tasked with overseeing securities issuances to prevent debt-equity imbalance. The restrictions were a response to \"power trusts\" that controlled the utility industry through predatory practices. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 aimed to regulate public utility holding companies by preventing them from mixing utility holdings with non-utility businesses to finance risky ventures. The Act was enacted to prevent market power abuse and protect investors from losing savings due to non-utility activities. Despite some disagreement on its effectiveness, Congress had created exceptions to the Act before its recent repeal. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and recent calls for the repeal of the PUHCA 1935 exemptions have sparked debates. Supporters argue that repealing PUHCA would encourage investment in transmission infrastructure and promote industry competition. Even the SEC has supported its repeal. Opponents argue that PUHCA 1935 protects customers. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935, removing SEC-enforced requirements on public utility holding companies. This opened the utility industry to a broader group of investors. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 opened the utility industry to a broader group of investors and allowed public utility holding companies to pursue a wider range of opportunities. However, concerns about market power and cross-subsidization have arisen, leading to the enactment of PUHCA 2005 to provide oversight by FERC and state regulatory commissions. PUHCA 2005 extended FERC's authority over holding company activities to compensate for the removal of SEC oversight. It introduced new reporting and review requirements for holding companies and their subsidiaries to enforce rate regulation and prevent cross-subsidization. Holding companies must maintain relevant records for FERC's oversight. FERC's oversight authority under PUHCA 2005 requires holding companies and their subsidiaries to maintain relevant records for the protection of utility customers regarding jurisdictional rates. This authority aims to prevent improper dealings and cross-subsidization within holding company structures. FERC issued regulations to enforce this scheme through Order No. 667. FERC adopted regulations in Order No. 667 on December 8, 2005, effective February 8, 2006. These regulations outlined new filing requirements for holding companies and traditional service companies, as well as rules for maintaining and providing access to books and records for FERC review. FERC clarified that the Energy Policy Act's Section 1275(c) did not grant authority to issue regulations on previously regulated activities. Therefore, FERC declined to issue further regulations on cross-subsidization, encumbrances of utility assets, diversification into non-utility businesses, or cash management rules. FERC regulations adopted in Order No. 667 on December 8, 2005, outlined new filing requirements for holding companies and traditional service companies. The regulations also addressed access to books and records for FERC review. FERC clarified that it would only adopt new regulations on cross-subsidization or encumbrances of utility assets if current regulations were deemed insufficient. PUHCA 2005 grants state utility commissions authority to access books and records of holding companies and their affiliates upon written request. The new access and review authority granted to FERC and state commissions in PUHCA 2005 allows them to access books, accounts, and records of public utility companies to ensure reasonable rates and reliable service, filling oversight gaps left by the repeal of PUHCA 1935. This helps prevent undue market power and cross-subsidization between utility and non-utility subsidiaries. PUHCA 2005 and Order No. 667 provide exemptions for certain entities and transactions, including Qualifying Facilities, Exempt Wholesale Generators, foreign utility companies, passive investors, broker/dealers, and utilities without captive customers. The statute primarily focuses on 'books and records' and does not grant new substantive authorities to the Commission. FERC certifies that entities in its holding company system will not incur costs or expenses with the public utility or natural gas company. Exemptions are granted for Qualifying Facilities, Wholesale Generators, and foreign utility companies to monitor costs incurred by traditional utilities for reasonable rates. The exemptions aim to remove entities unlikely to impact jurisdictional rates from PUHCA 2005 regulation. The change in PUHCA law granting new authority to review books and records did not affect FERC's primary means of protecting customers served by jurisdictional companies in holding company systems. FERC's rate authorities under the FPA and NGA allow detection and disallowance of imprudent, unjust, discriminatory, or preferential costs from affiliate transactions. This includes power and non-power transactions between regulated and unregulated affiliates in holding systems. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the authority to review the prudence and reasonableness of costs related to affiliate purchases by public utilities. FERC is responsible for regulating interstate transmission of natural gas and electricity, as well as overseeing electric utility mergers. Section 203 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) requires FERC approval for utility mergers within its jurisdiction. This authority was slightly modified by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, but FERC's oversight remains largely unchanged. Under the revised Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, public utilities must obtain FERC approval for various transactions valued over $10,000,000, including sales, mergers, acquisitions, and holding company activities. PUHCA 2005 extends FERC's authority over holding company systems. The FPA grants FERC authority over holding company systems, allowing investigations, hearings, and penalties. PUHCA 2005 reinforces FERC's existing jurisdiction over rates and transactions under the FPA and NGA, not transferring SEC authority. 2005 confirms FERC's authority to regulate transactions under the FPA and NGA, granting the Commission new tools. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removes restrictions on transactions involving public utilities but does not affect FERC's regulation. Holding companies must still comply with SEC reporting requirements and antitrust laws like the Clayton Act and Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for mergers and acquisitions. The United States Justice Department (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforce antitrust laws like the Clayton Act and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for utility mergers. Mergers in the energy industry are reviewed for compliance with antitrust laws to prevent monopolies. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act requires notification of certain mergers to the Attorney General and the Chairman of the FTC before completion. The DOJ, FTC, and FERC have overlapping jurisdiction over electric utility mergers. Approval by one agency does not constitute federal government approval, and transactions are still subject to antitrust laws. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 does not remove all obstacles to electric and gas utility transactions, as state regulatory agencies still have authority to regulate them. Legislators may have intended for state commissions to have increased involvement in reviewing public utility holdings companies. Since the repeal, no new state laws or regulations have been enacted regarding the review of utility mergers. Some states may rely on existing laws for review, while others may introduce new legislation for increased scrutiny or restrictions on transactions. State commissions and FERC may increase regulation of cross-subsidization and financing between utility and non-utility businesses in holding company systems to protect consumers. Analyst predictions vary widely, with some expecting industry centralization and potential merger and acquisition activity. Some analysts predict industry centralization and potential merger and acquisition activity. Non-traditional investors like private equity funds and foreign banks could enter the utility sector, leading to a 50% reduction in major electric utilities."
