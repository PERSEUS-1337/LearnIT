    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Breast Cancer Patient Education Act of 2013\". Congress finds that breast cancer disproportionately affects African-American and Hispanic women, with rural women facing barriers to mammography screening due to healthcare access issues. Individuals undergoing breast cancer surgery should consider breast reconstructive surgery either immediately or at a later date. Immediate reconstruction combines cancer surgery with reconstructive surgery, while delayed reconstruction may be better for those needing radiation. Some women may opt for breast prostheses instead of surgical reconstruction. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 ensures insurance coverage for these options. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 mandates coverage for breast reconstruction after mastectomy, including prostheses. Studies show that many eligible women are not informed about their reconstructive options, and race can impact the likelihood of reconstruction. Studies have shown that race can impact the likelihood of breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Research indicates that African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians have significantly lower odds of receiving reconstruction compared to Caucasians. Language barriers may contribute to lower reconstruction rates among Hispanic patients. Additionally, a study found that patients who primarily spoke English were more likely to undergo reconstruction compared to those with a primary language other than English. The relationship between race and reconstruction rates persisted even when controlling for demographic and clinical factors. Minority women have lower rates of seeing a plastic surgeon before initial surgery, desire more information about reconstruction, and have lower satisfaction without reconstruction. Barriers to reconstruction include lower health literacy, financial issues, and less access to plastic surgeons. There is an unmet need for information among racial and ethnic minority groups regarding reconstruction options and coverage required by the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998. A 2010 study by Warren H. Tseng, M.D. and others at the University of California Davis found that rural patients are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer compared to urban patients. SEC. 399NN-1. BREAST RECONSTRUCTION EDUCATION. The Secretary will implement an education campaign to inform breast cancer patients, especially those from minority groups, about breast reconstruction options and coverage. Patients will be informed about the possibility of reconstruction at the time of surgery or later, availability of prostheses, and their right to choose a provider. The education campaign will inform breast cancer patients, especially minorities, about their right to choose a reconstructive care provider and the option for breast reconstruction at the time of surgery or later. Additional relevant information may also be disseminated as determined by the Secretary. The information disseminated under paragraphs (1) and (2) will be posted on relevant Federal agencies' websites. The campaign will not limit healthcare providers available to patients. The Secretary will consult with medical societies and patient advocates on breast cancer, reconstructive surgery, and minority groups, with a focus on African-American and Hispanic populations. The Breast Cancer Patient Education Act of 2013 requires the Secretary to submit a report every 2 years on activities aimed at improving the health of racial and ethnic minority groups, including Hispanics."
