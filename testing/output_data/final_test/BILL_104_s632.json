    "content": "The \"Child Custody Reform Act of 1995\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section follows. The \"Child Custody Reform Act of 1995\" addresses gaps in Federal and State child custody jurisdictional laws to prevent conflicting custody rulings between States. It aims to clarify jurisdictional issues and ensure consistent application of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980. The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 needs changes to address conflicting State rulings by clarifying jurisdictional provisions and establishing a nationwide child custody database. Without these changes, parents may continue to move children across State borders to evade custody rulings, using their children as pawns for personal retribution. The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 needs modifications to address conflicting State rulings by clarifying jurisdictional provisions. Section 1738A of title 28, United States Code is amended to clarify jurisdictional provisions in child custody cases, ensuring that the state that issued the initial custody determination retains jurisdiction as long as the child or any contestant resides in that state. Continuing jurisdiction is subject to state law limitations when a child is absent from the state. The amendment clarifies that the state issuing the initial custody determination retains jurisdiction as long as the child or any contestant resides in that state, subject to state law limitations when the child is absent. Establishment of National Child Custody Registry. The Social Security Act is amended to establish a national network for State courts to identify child custody proceedings filed in the United States or other countries. Information on custody determinations will be accepted for filing in the registry. The amended Social Security Act establishes a national network for State courts to identify child custody proceedings, including details such as the issuing court, names, social security numbers of parties and children, and the status of the case. The term 'custody determination' and 'custody proceeding' are defined within the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in cooperation with the Attorney General, will create regulations to implement the provisions related to guardianship, termination of parental rights, adoption, protection from domestic violence, and Hague Child Abduction Convention proceedings. Funding will be provided as needed for this subsection. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING SUPERVISED VISITATION CENTERS: The Senate encourages local governments to utilize the Local Crime Prevention Block Grant Program to establish supervised visitation centers for children at risk due to abuse, neglect, or domestic violence, or whose parents are separated or divorced."
