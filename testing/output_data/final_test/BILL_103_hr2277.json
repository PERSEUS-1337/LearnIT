    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"School Repair and Rehabilitation Act\". The Congress finds that a significant number of public school buildings in the United States are in need of replacement or major repairs. A survey shows that 74 percent of school buildings require replacement, with many built before World War II. Additionally, a quarter of public school buildings are in inadequate condition, with various issues such as maintenance needs, environmental hazards, overcrowding, and structural unsoundness. Unemployment rates in the construction industry are also high. Establishment of grant program. The Secretary of Labor provides grants to States and Indian tribes for programs that cover labor and related costs for repairing and rehabilitating school facilities. At least 5 percent of funds are allocated for grants to Indian tribes for their school facilities. The Secretary of the Interior must ensure adequate funding for Indian tribal school facilities under the Snyder Act. The Secretary must receive an application from a State or Indian tribe to be eligible for a grant under section 3, ensuring Federal funds are used to supplement, not replace, non-Federal funds for funded activities. The Secretary may only provide a grant to a State or Indian tribe if they agree to use the funds to establish a program employing individuals to repair school facilities. Priority must be given to unemployed individuals, especially those who have been jobless for a long time. States must coordinate with relevant entities when implementing the program. When carrying out a program established under subsection (a), a State must coordinate with relevant entities in the State, including private industry councils, local government units, nonprofit organizations, and local educational agencies. Labor standards are outlined in Section 6. Labor standards outlined in Section 6 include nondiscrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or political affiliation. Additionally, the Davis-Bacon Act requires contractors to pay prevailing wages to laborers and mechanics on federally assisted construction projects. The Davis-Bacon Act, as amended, requires contractors to pay prevailing wages on federally funded projects. Participants under this Act must receive these rates if working on such projects. SEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\nStates or Indian tribes must submit a report to the Secretary detailing the use of grants received under section 3.\n\nSEC. 8. SELECTION.\n\nGrants under section 3 cannot exceed 10% of funds appropriated for the fiscal year. Priority is given to states with elementary and secondary school facilities in need of repair in high unemployment areas.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, definitions include \"elementary school,\" \"Indian tribe,\" and \"local educational agency.\" The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 defines terms such as \"secondary school,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"State educational agency.\" The Act includes various states and territories within its definitions."
