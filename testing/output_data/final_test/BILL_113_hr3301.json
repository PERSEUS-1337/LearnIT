    "content": "The \"North American Energy Infrastructure Act\" aims to establish a more uniform and transparent process for the construction and operation of energy infrastructure projects at the national boundary of the United States, including oil and natural gas pipelines and electric transmission facilities for import and export purposes with Canada and Mexico. The \"North American Energy Infrastructure Act\" requires a certificate of crossing for the construction and operation of cross-border oil pipelines and electric transmission facilities between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The certificate must be issued within 120 days after final action under the National Environmental Policy Act unless specified conditions are not met. The \"North American Energy Infrastructure Act\" mandates a certificate of crossing for cross-border oil pipelines and electric transmission facilities. The certificate must be issued within 120 days unless specific conditions are not met. The relevant official for oil pipelines is the Secretary of State, and for electric transmission facilities, it is the Secretary of Energy. Additional requirements apply to electric transmission facilities. The \"North American Energy Infrastructure Act\" requires a certificate of crossing for cross-border electric transmission facilities to be constructed, connected, operated, or maintained in compliance with relevant policies and standards. Exclusions apply to oil pipelines and electric transmission facilities for the import or export of oil or electricity to or from Canada or Mexico. The \"North American Energy Infrastructure Act\" exempts oil pipelines and electric transmission facilities for importing or exporting oil or electricity to or from Canada or Mexico from certain requirements if they meet specific conditions. This includes having a permit issued, a certificate of crossing, or a pending application for a permit until a certain date. Other laws may also impact the implementation of these requirements. The \"North American Energy Infrastructure Act\" exempts oil pipelines and electric transmission facilities for importing or exporting oil or electricity to or from Canada or Mexico from certain requirements if they meet specific conditions. This includes having a permit issued, a certificate of crossing, or a pending application for a permit until a certain date. Other laws may also impact the implementation of these requirements, such as the Natural Gas Act and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The Natural Gas Act is amended to allow the importation or exportation of natural gas to Canada and Mexico without requiring an order. Additionally, the transmission of electric energy to Canada and Mexico is addressed in the legislation. The legislation repeals the requirement to secure an order under the Federal Power Act. Conforming amendments are made to state regulations and seasonal diversity electricity exchange provisions. The legislation repeals the requirement to secure an order under the Federal Power Act, and finds that the proposed transmission facilities would not impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or impede coordination in the public interest. No Presidential permit is required for the construction, operation, or maintenance of oil, natural gas pipelines, or electric transmission facilities. Additionally, modifications to existing projects are allowed under the legislation. No certificate of crossing or permit is needed for modifications to existing oil, natural gas pipelines, or electric transmission facilities operating for import/export to Canada or Mexico. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE; RULEMAKING DEADLINES.\n\nSections 3 through 7, and the amendments made by such sections, will be effective on July 1, 2015. Relevant officials must publish proposed rulemaking within 180 days and a final rule within 1 year of enactment.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"cross-border segment\" refers to the part of a pipeline or transmission facility at the US border with Canada or Mexico. The term \"modification\" includes changes like flow direction reversal or volume expansion. \"Natural gas\" is defined as in the Natural Gas Act, and \"oil\" means petroleum. The terms \"Electric Reliability Organization\" and \"regional entity\" have specific meanings. The terms \"Independent System Operator\" and \"Regional Transmission Organization\" are defined in the Federal Power Act, while \"regional entity\" and \"Electric Reliability Organization\" have specific meanings in the context of the Act. The House of Representatives passed the document on June 24, 2014, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
