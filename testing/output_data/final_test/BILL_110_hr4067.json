    "content": "The \"Bridges from Jobs to Careers Act\" may be cited as the short title. Grants are provided to create bridges from jobs to careers. The \"Bridges from Jobs to Careers Act\" authorizes grants for institutions of higher education to improve remedial education, customize instruction, and help students transition into occupational programs. Priority is given to applications from eligible institutions. The Secretary will convene a peer review process to evaluate grant applications for workforce bridge programs at institutions of higher education. Grant recipients must use funds to customize developmental education curricula, including English language instruction, for adult learners. An eligible institution receiving a grant under this section can create workforce bridge programs and use funds to improve retention and completion of developmental education courses through innovative methods. This includes enrolling students in cohorts, accelerating course content, and integrating remediation and college-level curricula and instruction. An eligible institution can use grant funds to improve retention and completion by redesigning class schedules, enhancing teaching quality in remedial courses, and implementing other activities determined to be effective. The Secretary aims to promote student retention and completion in higher education by advising on various educational options. Grants will be awarded for 36 to 60 months, with technical assistance provided. An evaluation of program impacts will be conducted, and best practices will be shared with the public. The Secretary is encouraged to partner with other fund providers for random assignment evaluations in demonstration sites. $35,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2009 and subsequent years, with 5% allocated for specific subsections. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined in this section."
