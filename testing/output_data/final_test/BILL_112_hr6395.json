The \"Foreclosure Accountability and Transparency Act\" defines key terms such as \"alternative to foreclosure,\" \"borrower,\" \"covered residential mortgage,\" and \"foreclosure action.\" The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. SEC. 3. HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS. Before commencing foreclosure on a covered residential mortgage, the person initiating the action must provide the borrower with detailed notice including information on their rights under applicable laws and consumer rights. Before foreclosure on a covered residential mortgage, the borrower must be informed of deadlines for responding, penalties for not responding, and the amounts claimed to be in arrears under the mortgage. Before foreclosure on a covered residential mortgage, the borrower must be informed of deadlines, penalties, and amounts needed to reinstate the account, along with contact information for further assistance and descriptions of additional options like mortgage workout or modification. Before foreclosure on a covered residential mortgage, the borrower must be informed of options like workout, modification, mitigation, and redemption to prevent foreclosure, along with how to obtain additional information on these alternatives. Contact information for further assistance must also be provided, including names, phone numbers, email addresses, postal addresses, and State licensing numbers. Before foreclosure on a covered residential mortgage, the borrower must be informed of options like workout, modification, mitigation, and redemption to prevent foreclosure. The notification must include State licensing numbers of the mortgage holder, servicer, and authorized individuals. Accepted means of notification include writing, electronic mail, telephone, and in-person visits. Borrowers can file an appeal with the Secretary to dispute the actions described. Before foreclosure on a covered residential mortgage, borrowers can appeal to the Secretary to dispute the accuracy of information in the notice. The Secretary will make a determination within 30 days after an appeal is filed. HUD-certified counselors can assist borrowers facing foreclosure by acting as their agent in the process. Borrowers seeking help from these agencies must provide all necessary information and documentation. A borrower has a 60-day period after receiving a notification to apply for a loan modification or start an alternative to foreclosure. No foreclosure action can be taken during this period, which is tolled if the borrower files an appeal. If a borrower applies for a loan modification or seeks an alternative to foreclosure within the 60-day period after receiving a notification, foreclosure cannot be initiated until efforts are made to determine eligibility. The borrower must be provided with an explanation if declared ineligible for a loan modification or alternative to foreclosure. Violation of this section will prevent a foreclosure action. After a foreclosure action, the person initiating it must certify compliance with all laws and regulations and submit documentation to the borrower and recorder's office. The Act requires compliance with loan modification requirements before commencing a foreclosure action. State laws still apply, and non-compliance can prevent foreclosure. The Act mandates compliance with state laws regarding foreclosure actions on residential mortgages, except where they conflict with the Act. State laws that offer greater borrower protection or disclosure requirements than the Act are not considered inconsistent. The Secretary must issue regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment to implement its provisions. The Act will take effect 90 days after enactment and will apply to residential mortgages without foreclosure actions initiated."
