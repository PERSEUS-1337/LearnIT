    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safety and Fuel Economy (SAFE) Act\". The Congress finds that automobile fuel economy standards have helped reduce gasoline consumption and lower fuel costs for consumers. Manufacturers have successfully increased fuel efficiency, but recent trends show a decline in average fuel economy despite larger and more powerful vehicles. Several Government studies suggest that increased fuel efficiency in passenger automobiles is achievable with current technology, without the need for significant changes in size or performance. Safety features can also be enhanced in the current fleet of vehicles. Experts estimate that average fuel economy of 38-45 miles per gallon is feasible with existing technology, and even higher levels are possible with future advancements. Improved automobile fuel economy standards can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, improve air quality, and potentially mitigate global warming. Improved crash safety of automobiles and light trucks in collisions is addressed in Section 3. The Secretary of Transportation will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking by June 1, 2002, to establish a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard for enhancing crash safety of automobiles and light trucks. This standard will include a Crash Aggressivity index (CRAGG index) to measure a vehicle's aggressivity based on stiffness, structure height, and mass. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard by issuing a final rule by June 1, 2003. The rule aims to improve crash safety by reducing vehicle aggressivity and will become effective in phases starting September 1, 2005. The Secretary of Transportation will require motor vehicle manufacturers to report CRAGG index ratings for vehicles manufactured after September 1, 2009. Manufacturers must submit reports annually starting from August 1, 2005, and display the CRAGG index rating on new vehicles at the point of sale from September 1, 2005. The Secretary of Transportation will annually report to Congress on the progress in improving crash safety of automobiles and light trucks, including the comparative improvement in vehicle aggressivity measured by the CRAGG index and fatalities caused by aggressivity in collisions. The Secretary of Transportation will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking by March 1, 2008, to revise the crash safety standard for automobiles and light trucks. The new rule will aim to increase crash comparability and will be effective in phases starting September 1, 2010. The rule for revising the crash safety standard for vehicles will be effective in phases, starting September 1, 2010. Vehicles manufactured after September 1, 2012, must fully comply with the new requirements. If deadlines are not met, vehicles with a gross weight rating under 10,000 pounds must meet the requirements in a phased schedule, with 20 percent compliance in the first year after a missed deadline. The phased compliance schedule for vehicles with a gross weight rating under 10,000 pounds if deadlines are not met: \n- 40% compliance in the second year\n- 60% compliance in the third year\n- 80% compliance in the fourth year\n- 100% compliance after the fourth year In the frontal barrier crash test, requirements include a maximum center of force height of 22 inches and a dynamic stiffness limit for vehicles over 3,500 pounds. The Secretary of Transportation ensures that vehicle compatibility advisory committees have a balanced representation of consumer and safety organizations, insurers, manufacturers, and suppliers. Representatives from organizations not significantly funded by motor vehicle manufacturers are selected. Definitions for 'automobile' and 'light truck' are as per section 32901 of this title. The term 'aggressivity' in relation to motor vehicles is defined as the degree to which a vehicle inflicts damage and causes injury in a collision with another vehicle. This definition is included in section 32901 of title 49, United States Code. \"SEC. 4. INCREASED AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS FOR PASSENGER AUTOMOBILES AND LIGHT TRUCKS.\" Increased Standards in the United States Code now prescribe fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks, with requirements set for model years 2003 and 2005. The fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks in the United States Code are set to increase. For passenger automobiles, the standard after model year 2011 will be 40.0 miles per gallon. For light trucks, the standard after model year 2005 will be 25.5 miles per gallon. The definition of a light truck in the United States Code is amended to include vehicles primarily for transporting up to 10 individuals, with a gross vehicle weight rating of not more than 8,500 pounds, and not classified as a passenger automobile. The Secretary of Transportation is required to issue regulations within 6 months of the enactment of this Act. The amendment requires the issuance of final regulations within one year of enactment. Section 32902(c) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to adjust fuel efficiency standards. The amendments will be effective from January 1, 2006. The amendment requires final regulations to be issued within one year of enactment, adjusting fuel efficiency standards effective from January 1, 2006. This section does not affect existing standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks manufactured before model year 2007. SEC. 5 amends the definition of automobiles to include vehicles up to 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight, effective January 1, 2006. SEC. 6 improves the calculation of average fuel economy. The amendment to Section 32904(a) of title 49, US Code ensures that average fuel economy calculations reflect actual driving conditions and are not solely based on laboratory tests. This amendment applies to automobiles manufactured after model year 2005. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will issue regulations by December 31, 2002, to implement amendments for automobiles manufactured after model year 2005."
