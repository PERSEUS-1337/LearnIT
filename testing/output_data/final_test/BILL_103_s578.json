    "content": "The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 is cited as the short title. Congressional findings and declaration of purposes are included in the Act. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, cited as the short title, includes Congressional findings that recognize the protection of free exercise of religion as an unalienable right secured in the First Amendment. It acknowledges that laws neutral toward religion can burden religious exercise and emphasizes that governments should not burden religious exercise without compelling justification. The Act also highlights the Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. Smith, which virtually eliminated the government's requirement to justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by neutral laws. The Act upholds the compelling interest test from prior Federal court rulings as a practical way to balance religious liberty with other interests. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 aims to restore the compelling interest test from prior court rulings to protect the free exercise of religion and provide a claim or defense for individuals whose religious exercise is burdened by the government. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 protects the free exercise of religion by prohibiting the government from burdening a person's religious practices, except in certain circumstances. Individuals can seek judicial relief if their religious exercise is violated, and attorneys' fees may be awarded. SEC. 4. ATTORNEYS FEES.
