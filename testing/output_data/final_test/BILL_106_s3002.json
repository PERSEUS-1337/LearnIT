    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pipeline Integrity, Safety, and Reliability Research and Development Act of 2000\". Congress recognizes the importance of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines in the nation's energy infrastructure, especially in densely populated areas. With an increasing reliance on pipelines, ensuring their construction and maintenance to minimize safety and environmental risks is a national priority. Early detection of defects is crucial to reducing accidents, requiring advanced technologies for monitoring and inspection by operators and regulators. The Federal Government should invest in pipeline research and development to promote safety and prevent failures. This investment should be part of a coordinated program involving the Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, national laboratories, universities, private sector, and research institutes. SEC. 3. COOPERATION AND COORDINATION PROGRAM FOR PIPELINE INTEGRITY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, will develop a research program for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. The program aims to ensure safety, reliability, and service life of existing pipelines, improve inspection capabilities, and develop techniques for pipelines that cannot accommodate current inspection devices. The research program for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines aims to develop innovative techniques, materials, and technologies to improve pipeline safety, reliability, and integrity. This includes enhancing leak detection devices, minimizing environmental impact, and providing risk assessment tools for optimizing risk mitigation strategies. Additionally, the program aims to identify underground environments that may shorten service life and enhance safety in pipeline siting and land use. Highly secure information systems will also be provided for controlling pipeline operations. The Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, will consider research and development on pipelines for early detection of cracks, defects, and damage, automated internal inspection systems, corrosion control, leak detection, and structural integrity measurement. The research and development programs authorized under this initiative include advancements in pipeline materials, assessing remaining pipe strength, risk analysis models for safety improvements, monitoring outside force damage, and ensuring public safety and environmental protection. Points of contact are designated to coordinate and implement these programs. The Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Energy shall designate officers as points of contact for their respective departments to oversee the implementation of research and development programs authorized under the Act. The point of contact for the Department of Transportation will coordinate the program plan. The Secretaries of Transportation and Energy will designate officers as points of contact to oversee research programs. They will assist in arranging cooperative agreements for research involving their Departments, national labs, universities, and industry. Within 240 days, the Secretary of Transportation will prepare a 5-year program plan in consultation with industry representatives. The Secretary of Transportation will implement a five-year plan for research, development, and demonstration activities in consultation with various stakeholders. They may use contracts, agreements, grants, and other transactions for this purpose. The Secretary of Transportation will implement a research and development program plan using contracts, grants, joint ventures, and other agreements. They will report annually to Congress on the progress and results of the program, including activities of various research organizations. The Pipeline Integrity Technical Advisory Committee is established. The Pipeline Integrity Technical Advisory Committee is established by the Secretary of Transportation in collaboration with the National Academy of Sciences to advise on the research program. The committee's members are appointed based on their technical qualifications. Authorization of Appropriation: $3,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2001-2005 for the Secretary of Transportation from user fees and Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Additionally, necessary sums for the Secretary of Energy for the same period."
