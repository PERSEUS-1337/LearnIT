    "content": "The committee system in Congress plays a crucial role in the legislative process, with committees being the first point of referral for introduced measures. The Select Committee on Homeland Security is tasked with reviewing House rules related to homeland security and recommending changes by September 30, 2004. Critics argue that despite some changes, Congress has not adequately adapted the committee system to address emerging policy areas, leading to concerns about duplication, overlap, and hindrances to policymaking. Advocates of rules changes believe altering committee jurisdictions is necessary to facilitate comprehensive policymaking, reflect contemporary policy issues, and simplify the referral process. Others argue it is unnecessary or unfeasible to change current jurisdictions due to the difficulty of neatly compartmentalizing policy issues. Arguments for changing committee jurisdictions include outdated, fragmented, and overlapping jurisdictions that do not reflect contemporary issues like homeland security. The need for select committees shows current arrangements are inadequate. Arguments against change cite the broad nature of policy issues and the difficulty in neatly defining them, suggesting that jurisdictional arrangements are not the root cause of policymaking problems. Proposals for changing committee jurisdictions in the House include reducing panels and adjusting jurisdictional boundaries. Suggestions range from having numerous committees with narrow jurisdictions to a few committees with broad jurisdictions. Some propose aligning House and Senate committee systems, correlating them with federal agency responsibilities or budget functions, and matching authorizing panels with Appropriations Committee subcommittees. Clarifying Rule X by making terms more explicit has also been suggested. Some suggest clarifying Rule X by making terms more explicit or incorporating new concepts. Others recommend codifying informal precedents and agreements between committees, reflecting programmatic responsibilities, or listing subject responsibilities definitively. The underlying assumption is that institutional change is needed, although not all Members agree on this. Some Members believe that a policy consensus among House Members is more crucial for legislative action than organizational inadequacy. The relationship between jurisdictional realignment and the House bill referral process is debated, with some suggesting that past rules changes could have lessened current referral problems. Various options for altering House committee jurisdictions have been proposed, with arguments for and against each approach noted. Some advocates propose clarifying existing language without shifting jurisdictions to eliminate ambiguity and update terms. However, neater jurisdictions may not address the core problem and limit exploration of different policy approaches. Extensive jurisdictional realignment is also suggested to address policy issues and reduce overlap and competition. Extensive jurisdictional realignment proposed to consolidate key areas like homeland security, equalize jurisdictions, and balance workload. Narrowly focused panels could provide more in-depth attention to policy issues but may exacerbate workload concerns. Option to create fewer committees with broad jurisdictions to streamline policymaking process and reduce committee assignments. However, too much consolidation may lead to subcommittee proliferation and decentralize policymaking. The House could reduce the number of committees by aligning jurisdictions based on budget functions, leading to more equal workload distribution and parallel systems with the Senate. Another option is to realign legislative jurisdictions based on the alignment of Appropriations subcommittees. The plan for realigning legislative jurisdictions could incorporate a familiar legislative management structure from appropriations bills. Aligning Appropriations subcommittees with authorizing committees may not be defensible due to combining diverse subjects, making comprehensive legislative initiatives challenging. Retaining \"independent agencies\" in the realignment may also be questioned. Some may question the realignment plan's difficulty in retaining \"independent agencies\" within a committee responsible for HUD. This could lead to a significant reduction in the number of House committees, impacting Members' policy areas. Parallel systems between the House and Senate could aid in inter-chamber coordination during policymaking. The House may need to realign its organization to match the Senate's structure, but the Senate has not made joint efforts recently. Matching committees with executive entities could improve inter-branch relations and oversight, but determining which entities to include may be challenging. The executive branch's organizational problems could be mirrored in a committee system, potentially hindering oversight. A more focused approach could involve creating a new Committee on Homeland Security and reallocating related jurisdiction from existing House committees. Consolidating smaller committees into larger panels may also be considered. The creation of a new Homeland Security Committee could lead to a reduction in the number of House committees, potentially resolving jurisdictional issues. This realignment may impact various policy interests across different committees, particularly in the realm of homeland security legislation. Declarations of jurisdictional primacy could be revised to assign primary policy responsibility to specific committees. The House could assign primary policy responsibility to a committee for a specific subject without removing related policy areas from other committees, similar to the 1980 reform for energy policy. This approach could be applied to homeland security jurisdiction to address complex policy issues without a comprehensive restructuring. Supporters of the \"1980 type changes\" argue that comprehensive energy legislation would have been difficult to enact regardless of House committee restructuring. The Senate, with unified energy jurisdiction, was not significantly more productive than the House. House members favor restructuring committee processes, but support wanes when concrete changes are proposed. Support for reorganization in the House committee system decreases when specific reforms are proposed and their benefits and drawbacks are evaluated. Recent substantial revisions to the system include the abolition of select committees in 1993, standing committees in 1995, rule recodification in 1997, jurisdiction realignment in 2001, and ad hoc arrangements for homeland security in 2002 and 2003. Some argue that the Speaker already has sufficient authority to address committee issues without major rule changes. The Speaker's power to make bill referrals can drive legislative action, and the House can establish ad hoc committees as needed. The House can establish ad hoc committees for homeland security to drive legislative action and develop comprehensive policy solutions, even using informal processes like leadership task forces."
