    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of child health, the need for pharmaceutical products, and the unique considerations for drug testing and approval for children. Many drugs on the market have not been approved for pediatric use, leading to potential risks and untested forms being used. The Act aims to encourage research on safe pediatric drug use, labeling, and formulation. The National Institutes of Health's Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit Network is conducting research on unapproved drugs for children with public and private funding. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act will provide private contractual opportunities for the PPRU Network to work with industry on research involving drugs protected by patents or exclusivity. Additionally, the PPRU Network will continue to use public and private funds to conduct research on drugs for pediatric use, including those not protected by patents or exclusivity. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act aims to enhance the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceutical use in children, ultimately benefiting the health of the nation's children. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act introduces a new section, SEC. 505A, which focuses on pediatric studies of drugs. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act introduces SEC. 505A, which grants market exclusivity for new drugs if pediatric studies are completed within a specified time frame. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act grants market exclusivity for new drugs if pediatric studies are completed within a specified time frame, adjusting the period of exclusivity to three years and six months for certain listed patents. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act grants market exclusivity for new drugs if pediatric studies are completed within a specified time frame, adjusting the period of exclusivity to three years and six months for certain listed patents. In cases where a listed patent is submitted under specific sections, the approval period for drug applications may be extended by six months after the patent expires, or if the patent is found valid and infringed in litigation, the approval period may also be extended. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act grants market exclusivity for new drugs if pediatric studies are completed within a specified time frame. The Secretary will develop a list of approved drugs for which additional pediatric information may be beneficial, consulting with experts in pediatric research. Annual updates to the list will be made. The Secretary requests pediatric studies for specific drugs from approved application holders. If completed within the specified time frame, market exclusivity period extends to five years and six months. The market exclusivity period for drugs can be extended to four and a half years, fifty-four months, and eight years. If a drug is subject to a listed patent with pediatric studies submitted before patent expiration, the exclusivity period can be three years and six months. The exclusivity period for drugs can be extended by six months after patent expiration if a patent infringement litigation determines the patent is valid and would be infringed. The Secretary may agree with drug sponsors or holders to conduct pediatric studies for a drug, satisfying the studies requirement upon completion of written protocols. The Secretary determines if studies were conducted as requested and notifies the sponsor. If protocols are not agreed upon, completion and acceptance of reports satisfy the studies requirement. The Secretary reviews completed studies and notifies the sponsor within 90 days. The decision is based on whether the studies meet the requested criteria, scientific principles, and reporting standards. The Secretary will delay drug approval until pediatric study requirements are met, not exceeding 90 days. A notice will be published when the requirements are satisfied. The FDA will delay drug approval until pediatric study requirements are fulfilled within 90 days. Pediatric studies involve at least one clinical investigation in pediatric age-groups where the drug is expected to be used. Market exclusivity for a new drug can be extended by six months under certain conditions. No exclusivity will be granted based on studies initiated after January 1, 2004. The Secretary will conduct a study and report to Congress by January 1, 2003 on the effectiveness, adequacy of incentives, economic impact, and suggestions for modification of the pediatric drug program initiated after January 1, 2004."
