The addition of assets over $1,000 in a taxable year is treated as a separate asset. The inflation adjustment for non-indexed assets is reduced. Distributions with respect to stock that are not dividends are treated as dispositions. The taxpayer shall be treated as having a long-term capital loss equal to the amount of the ordinary loss. If subsection (a)(1) has been previously applied to an asset, the acquisition date by the taxpayer shall be treated as not earlier than the most recent application.
