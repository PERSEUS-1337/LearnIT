The Internet is a significant platform for commerce in the US, with billions in retail sales annually. Consumer confidence is crucial for online commerce growth. The aggressive sales tactics used by many companies have harmed consumer confidence and the American economy. The Committee found that reputable online retailers shared customers' billing information with third party sellers through \"data pass\", leading to millions of consumers being charged for unwanted membership clubs. Third party sellers used misleading tactics to offer these clubs during initial transactions on various websites, deceiving consumers into thinking it was part of their original purchase. Third party sellers charged consumers for membership clubs without their direct billing information, using a \"data pass\" process that deceived consumers. They enrolled members through free trials and continued charging them without their knowledge. The company deceived consumers by charging them for membership clubs without their direct billing information, using tactics like \"free-to-pay conversion\" and \"negative option\" sales. This took advantage of consumers' expectations to accept or reject the offer at the end of the trial period. SEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS AGAINST CERTAIN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE INTERNET SALES PRACTICES. Requirements for Certain Internet-Based Sales: It is illegal for post-transaction third party sellers to charge consumers without clearly disclosing all transaction terms, including goods/services description and non-affiliation with the initial merchant. Requirements for post-transaction third party sellers include clearly differentiating themselves from the initial merchant, disclosing the cost of goods/services, obtaining express consent from the consumer, and requiring additional affirmative action for charges. Affirmative action is required for consumer consent in Internet sales transactions. Prohibition on disclosing financial information to post-transaction third party sellers. Limitations on charging consumers through negative option features in online transactions. In online transactions, sellers must disclose all material terms before obtaining consumer consent, including entity name, goods/services description, cost, billing start date, trial period length, and steps to avoid charges. In online transactions, sellers must disclose all material terms before obtaining consumer consent, including entity name, goods/services description, cost, billing start date, trial period length, and steps to avoid charges. Sellers must also obtain express informed consent from the consumer before charging them on a recurring basis and provide a simple process for consumers to stop recurring charges via the Internet and email. This Act does not supersede other legal requirements. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act and regulations are not affected by this section. Definitions include \"initial merchant,\" \"negative option feature,\" and \"post-transaction third party seller.\" The section pertains to online transactions where a third party seller solicits purchases on the internet after a consumer has initiated a transaction with the initial merchant, and the third party seller is not affiliated with the initial merchant. The Federal Trade Commission enforces regulations related to online transactions involving third-party sellers not affiliated with the initial merchant. The Federal Trade Commission enforces regulations related to online transactions involving third-party sellers not affiliated with the initial merchant. Violation of this Act or any regulation prescribed under it will be treated as a violation of a rule under the Federal Trade Commission Act regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Commission may promulgate necessary regulations under this Act, and penalties will apply to those who violate it. The Act grants privileges and immunities under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission's authority is not limited by this section. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL. State attorneys general have the right to bring actions in federal court to enforce the Act, seek injunctions, compel compliance, and obtain damages on behalf of residents. Prior notice to the Federal Trade Commission is required before initiating civil action. State attorneys general can bring civil actions in federal court to enforce the Act, seeking injunctions, compliance, and damages for residents. Prior notice to the Federal Trade Commission is necessary, and the Commission can intervene in the action and file petitions for appeal. This does not limit the powers of state attorneys general under state laws. The Act allows State attorneys general to bring civil actions in federal court for violations, but prohibits them from proceeding in State or Federal court based on alleged violations of State statutes. During a Federal Trade Commission action, no State civil action can be initiated against the same defendant for the same violation."
