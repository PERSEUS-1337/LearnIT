    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act\" or the \"PATH Act\". Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial Drugs is established. Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to establish a Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial Drugs, allowing the approval of antibacterial drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs in a specific population. The Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial Drugs requires sponsors to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for intended use, approved only upon sponsor request. Considerations include benefit-risk profile assessment. The Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial Drugs requires the Secretary to determine safety and effectiveness based on the benefit-risk profile in the intended limited population, considering infection severity, rarity, prevalence, and availability of alternative treatments. Approval cannot be denied due to lack of evidence in other populations. The Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial Drugs requires the Secretary to consider a broader benefit-risk profile beyond the intended limited population when approving a drug. This includes relying on various types of evidence, such as traditional and alternate endpoints, small clinical data sets, and supplemental data like preclinical evidence. The Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial Drugs requires the Secretary to consider various types of evidence, such as pharmacologic or pathophysiologic evidence, nonclinical susceptibility, and pharmacokinetic data, when approving a drug. The Secretary also mandates specific labeling and submission requirements for drugs approved through this pathway. The Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial Drugs requires sponsors to submit promotional materials for review before dissemination. Sponsors can also seek approval through other pathways. The Secretary will issue guidance on demonstrating safety and effectiveness for limited population antibacterial drugs. The Secretary may approve antibacterial drugs through a limited population pathway for postapproval monitoring programs to study drug usage and bacterial resistance. The Secretary will provide prompt advice to drug sponsors seeking approval through this pathway. The limited population pathway for antibacterial drugs allows sponsors to plan a development program for drug approval. After approval, the Secretary may remove postmarketing conditions for broader indications. The limited population pathway for antibacterial drugs allows sponsors to plan a development program for drug approval, including postapproval monitoring. Rules of construction clarify that standards of evidence and the Secretary's authority remain unchanged. Beginning on October 1, 2016, the limited population pathway for antibiotic drugs may be expanded to include approval of other drugs for serious or life-threatening illnesses, subject to specified considerations and requirements. The limited population pathway for antibiotic drugs may be expanded to include approval of other drugs for serious or life-threatening illnesses, but this pathway should not be used for other therapeutic areas in addition to antibacterial infections."
