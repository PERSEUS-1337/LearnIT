    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 67386 of the Education Code is amended to require educational institutions to adopt a policy on sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving students on and off campus to receive state funds for student financial assistance. An affirmative consent standard is required for determining consent in sexual activity. It must be affirmative, conscious, and ongoing throughout the activity, and lack of protest or past relationships should not be assumed as consent. In any disciplinary process, lack of affirmative consent cannot be excused if the accused believed the complainant consented due to their own intoxication or recklessness, or if they did not take reasonable steps to ensure consent. The standard for determining guilt is based on the preponderance of evidence. In the evaluation of complaints in the disciplinary process, it is not a valid excuse if the accused believed the complainant consented to sexual activity under certain circumstances. State funds for student financial assistance are contingent on compliance with these policies. The independent postsecondary institutions must adopt victim-centered policies and protocols for sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving students. These policies should include privacy protections, initial response procedures, and specific guidelines for different types of assaults. The independent postsecondary institutions must adopt victim-centered policies and protocols for sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving students. This includes developing victim interview protocols, interviewing the accused, identifying witnesses, providing resources to victims, involving victim advocates, and investigating incidents involving alcohol or drugs. (9) Investigating allegations of alcohol or drug involvement in incidents.\n(10) Complainants or witnesses in sexual assault cases will not face disciplinary sanctions unless the violation was egregious.\n(11) Supervision of institutional staff.\n(12) Training program for campus officials handling sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking cases.\n(13) Procedures for confidential reporting by victims and third parties. (13) Procedures for confidential reporting by victims and third parties. Institutions must collaborate with on-campus and community organizations to provide counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, and legal assistance to students, including resources for the accused. To receive state funds for student financial assistance, governing boards of community college districts, California State University Trustees, University of California Regents, and independent postsecondary institutions must comply. Independent postsecondary institutions must implement comprehensive prevention and outreach programs addressing sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. These programs should include empowerment programming, awareness campaigns, bystander intervention, and risk reduction strategies. Outreach efforts should inform students about the institution's policies and rights regarding these issues. Outreach programming is a mandatory part of new student orientation at independent postsecondary institutions to address sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking."
