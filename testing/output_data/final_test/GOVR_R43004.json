    "content": "This report explores public mass shootings over the last three decades, focusing on policy implications in law enforcement, public health, and education. Efforts for prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery are discussed in relation to mass shootings in public settings, particularly in the education realm. Recovery involves helping institutions, communities, and individuals cope with the aftermath of a shooting. The report focuses on public mass shootings and does not discuss gun control policies or specific federal programs in these areas. The report defines public mass shootings as incidents in relatively public places involving four or more deaths, with gunmen selecting victims somewhat indiscriminately. The violence is not driven by motives like robbery or terrorism. The report defines public mass shootings as incidents in relatively public places involving four or more deaths, with gunmen selecting victims somewhat indiscriminately. The threshold for mass shootings is based on a definition of mass murder offered by the FBI, but it may not capture the full scope of incidents that educators, public health professionals, and law enforcement need to address. Gunmen often injure more victims than they kill, making them mass murderers. In public mass shootings, gunmen may target victims somewhat indiscriminately, driven by revenge or power. The report excludes cases of domestic violence involving only family members. Police and rescue personnel respond to shootings without knowing the exact number of injuries or fatalities. The report focuses on public mass shootings where gunmen select victims somewhat indiscriminately. The shooters in these incidents do not have broad socio-political objectives or terrorist affiliations. Shootings motivated by criminal profit are also not included in the report. In December 2012, Dwayne Moore was convicted of home invasion, armed robbery, and four counts of first-degree murder in Massachusetts. He gunned down four victims, including a child, in a drug-related incident in Boston. Wade Michael Page shot six people at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in a hate-motivated incident in August 2012. U.S. Army Major Nidal Hasan was charged in a shooting at Fort Hood in November 2009, killing 13 and injuring over 40 others. The incident killed 13 and injured over 40 others in a public mass shooting event. The incidents were identified through various sources, but the list may not be exhaustive. The report's definition of public mass shootings should not be directly tied to specific federal policy responses, as the policy measures discussed may also apply to events with fewer deaths or specific ideologies and targets. The report defines mass shootings as incidents with fewer than four deaths or shooters with specific ideologies and targets. It aims to illustrate the threat that lacks a clear definition among experts, highlighting extreme cases over the last three decades. Mass shootings have been a topic of interest for various experts and journalists for many years, with examples like the case of gunman Howard B. Unruh in 1949, who killed 13 people in what was reported as the largest mass murder in U.S. history. Mass shootings are difficult to categorize, with terms like single, double, or triple murder used for different scenarios. Defining and understanding murder becomes more complex when the number of victims rises or complicating circumstances are involved. Scholarly sources suggest that mass shootings are rare violent crimes. Public mass shootings, described as rare violent crimes, are part of the broader issue of multiple murder. A lexicon has emerged to categorize instances of multiple murder, including serial or mass killings. Mass murders involve four or more people killed in less than one day, excluding the shooter(s). Mass murders involve four or more people killed in less than one day by the same offender or offenders. Public mass shootings, a rare form of violent crime, are a subcategory of mass murder. Among the 78 public mass shootings since 1983, workplace shootings are the most common, followed by shootings at places of education. Examples include Michael McDermott shooting seven coworkers at Edgewater Technology Inc. in 2000 and Charles Roberts killing five students at an Amish schoolhouse in 2006. In Lancaster County, PA, a mass shooter killed five students and injured five others. Public mass shootings involve a high level of localization, with shooters targeting individuals in specific locations. Examples include Michael Hayes randomly shooting people in Winston Salem, NC, and Michael McLendon killing 10 people in Samson, GA and Geneva. Experts note the lack of a detailed profile for mass shooters. Among public mass shooting incidents, the gunmen typically act alone, are usually white males, and often die during the incident. The average age of the shooters is 33.5 years. Rarely are there multiple perpetrators involved. Three incidents since 1983 involved more than one perpetrator, including the 1999 Columbine High School shooting by Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. Over half of the identified shooters were white, and they were almost always male. In public mass shooting incidents, over half of the shooters were white males. Only one incident involved a female assailant. The shooters ranged in age from 11 to 66 years old, with most being in their 20s, 30s, or 40s. Forty-one of the shooters killed themselves, while law enforcement officers killed the gunmen in 10 instances. Law enforcement response to public mass shootings involves rapid reaction, investigation, and potential prosecutions. Police focus on prevention and preparedness, with federal influence through grants like the Homeland Security Grant Program. Recovery efforts are not typically handled by law enforcement. The Department of Justice grants can address issues related to mass shootings, such as planning, organization, equipment purchase, training, exercises, and management. Questions arise about federal influence on state law enforcement through grant funding, including enhancing interagency coordination, increasing funding for school resource officer training, and deploying metal detectors in academic settings. The Obama Administration's report, \"Now Is the Time,\" committed to reducing gun violence and protecting communities. The President's Plan to reduce gun violence includes using the COPS program to hire more school resource officers and develop best practices for their use. Grants may impact first responder training and law enforcement protocols for mass shootings. Some policymakers may want to establish tactical EMS teams to support law enforcement during such events. Policy makers may debate the effectiveness of tactical EMS teams in the civilian domain and whether federal law enforcement has sufficient authority and resources to assist state and local entities in preparing for mass shootings. The President's Plan includes additional funding for training law enforcement and hiring school resource officers. The President's Plan includes additional funding for training law enforcement, school officials, and others to respond to scenarios involving shooters. Proactive law enforcement efforts have been on the rise, focusing on preventing crimes rather than just reacting to them. The effectiveness of these techniques in preventing public mass shootings is uncertain. Various policing philosophies like community policing and intelligence-led policing aim at preventing crime rather than solely responding to it. Community policing promotes organizational strategies to address public safety issues like crime, social disorder, and fear of crime through partnerships and problem-solving techniques. The federal government incentivizes community policing efforts, but there is limited research on its effectiveness in addressing mass shootings specifically. Policymakers may question its utility in targeting mass shootings in public places. Intelligence-led policing, based on community policing and problem-solving, has become a framework for modern police activity. It involves information input, two-way communication with the public, data analysis, and problem-solving. The long-term impact of intelligence-led policing is still unknown due to a lack of comprehensive studies on fully implemented initiatives. Research on intelligence-led policing and its effectiveness in addressing mass shootings is lacking. Mass shooters often act alone, making it difficult for law enforcement to infiltrate their plans. There is no established geographic pattern for mass shootings, making it challenging for law enforcement to prevent them. Developing a profile of a mass shooter to identify at-risk individuals before an incident occurs is also a challenge. One researcher notes the difficulty in creating a mass shooter profile due to the common predictors and rarity of mass murder. Mass murderers are usually male, but there are few reliable characteristics for creating a general profile. Criminal profiling is typically used after a crime, not as a preventive tool. Investigative analysis is generally used after a crime, not as a preventive tool. It can be proactive in narrowing down potential offenders in serial crimes, but for mass shooters who are usually killed or captured after the incident, it is mainly used to understand how the shooting happened. Federal law enforcement agencies are working to reduce the risk of mass casualty shootings. Federal law enforcement is focusing on threat assessment to prevent mass casualty shootings. The National Threat Assessment Center provides research and training to front-line professionals to evaluate and prevent potential shooters from harming others. The National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC), part of the U.S. Secret Service, conducts research on threat assessment and targeted violence. Their approach, developed to protect officials, can be adapted for other forms of targeted violence. The assessment does not rely on profiles or stated threats, but collects information on facts, the subject, attack-related behaviors, and possible motives. The National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) conducts research on threat assessment and targeted violence, focusing on the subject, attack-related behaviors, possible motives, and potential targets. Law enforcement and other professionals may use this framework to prevent incidents like mass shootings. Policy makers may consider modifying the threat assessment framework to better serve law enforcement in identifying potential mass shooters. One option could be creating a criminal watchlist. One potential option is to create a criminal watchlist similar to the Terrorist Screening Database for background checks on firearms and other purposes. Criteria for adding potential mass shooters to this list and collaboration with mental health professionals and community leaders may be key issues. Law enforcement agencies have also participated in specialized trainings for mass shooting preparedness. Some law enforcement agencies have engaged in tailored trainings sponsored by DHS, including preparedness courses for shootings, webinars, and workshops. The California Highway Patrol conducted 18 active shooter trainings in Northern California between August 2012 and January 2013. These trainings involve simulated scenarios to train officers in responding to and controlling shooters to ensure building occupants' safety. Mass shootings are typically localized incidents involving lone gunmen, making them a local concern, but federal law enforcement, such as the FBI, has historically provided assistance when requested by states. Federal law enforcement, particularly the FBI, has historically assisted state and local law enforcement in investigating crimes outside federal jurisdiction. Concerns about jurisdictional delays in federal response have been raised, but in practice, federal agencies like the FBI routinely support local law enforcement. The FBI's Office of Law Enforcement Coordination serves as a liaison, providing various forms of assistance such as criminal justice information, background checks, disaster response teams, and security clearances. Legislation passed by the 112th Congress formalized this collaboration (P.L. 112-265). The 112th Congress passed legislation (P.L. 112-265) authorizing the Attorney General to provide investigative assistance to states in cases of violent crimes in public venues, including mass killings. The definition of a mass shooting varies across different sectors, raising questions about who qualifies as a victim. The definition of a mass shooting varies, leading to questions about who qualifies as a victim in cases of violent crimes in public venues. Victim circumstances can vary, impacting the investigation and prosecution process. Law enforcement response to mass shootings may not hinge on the exact number of victims, but victim details become crucial post-incident for investigators and prosecutors. The shooter's motives can influence charges brought against them, impacting the length of sentence if convicted. Motives can lead to hate crime or terrorism-related investigations and charges. Specific groups targeted in shootings can be considered hate crimes and prosecuted accordingly. Public mass shootings are ideologically motivated, leading to terrorism-related investigations and charges. Law enforcement faces concerns about the shooter's intentions, including the possibility of self-inflicted suicide or \"suicide-by-cop.\" These incidents are considered mass casualty events, causing both injury and death, requiring preparation and response from the health sector. The health sector addresses mass shootings through prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. Prevention focuses on perpetrators, while the other components focus on victims. Public health options to prevent mass shootings are limited, with unclear effectiveness in preventive efforts. More evidence is needed to understand what stops potential shooters. Proven approaches exist for preparedness, response, and recovery, but policymakers may need to evaluate new or existing policies to fill knowledge gaps. Proven approaches exist for preparedness, response, and recovery in addressing mass shootings. Policy makers should consider variations in capacities across geographic areas and populations, as well as the flexibility of funding structures for effective deployment of resources. Public health interventions for mass shootings are limited by the rarity of such events and the challenge of accurately identifying potential perpetrators. Traditional public health approaches may not fully address the prevention of mass shootings. Public health professionals use a three-step process to prevent injury and death, including data collection, research on risk factors, and developing interventions. These efforts focus on reducing risk factors and enhancing protective factors to address public mass shootings. Public health efforts traditionally focus on victims, but in the case of public mass shootings, prevention focuses on the gunmen. Surveillance for public mass shootings is not specifically conducted by the public health system, limiting research into prevention. Data collection on shootings mainly focuses on victims rather than assailants, hindering prevention efforts. The NVDRS is operational in fewer than half the states and the President's Plan proposes expanding it to all 50 states at a cost of $20 million. Health research into risk factors for public mass shootings is hindered by a small data pool, with gun violence overall providing more information for research. The President's Plan aims to address risk and protective factors related to gun violence, including mental illness, substance abuse, exposure to violence, and easy access to guns. It emphasizes the importance of research into the causes of gun violence and rejects the notion that such research is advocacy for gun control. The President's Plan emphasizes research into the causes of gun violence to prevent public mass shootings. Interventions should target potential perpetrators based on well-tested risk factors. Addressing gunmen involved in such incidents as violent offenders may be more feasible. Preventive interventions may target populations, at-risk subgroups, or high-risk individuals, but their effectiveness within the broader context of gun violence remains uncertain. The President's Plan includes population-wide interventions like finalizing mental health parity regulations and ensuring Medicaid compliance. Targeted interventions involve allowing doctors to discuss gun safety with patients and providing mental health services for students exposed to violence. High-risk individual interventions permit health professionals to report violent threats to law enforcement. Additionally, the HHS Office of Civil Rights clarified federal regulations for healthcare providers on January 15, 2013. The HHS Office of Civil Rights clarified that health care providers can disclose necessary information about a patient to law enforcement or family members if they believe the patient poses a serious danger. The federal government has supported mass casualty incident preparedness efforts in large cities and all states since 1997, through grants to public health agencies. The federal government provides grants and contracts to support interdisciplinary communications and exercises for key responders to prepare for incidents like terrorism and mass shootings. Concerns exist about the dispersion of these programs in rural areas. The capacity and proximity of critical health care facilities can impact survival rates in mass shootings. EMS and hospital-based emergency services play a crucial role in MCI readiness. Emergency medical services (EMS) and hospital-based emergency departments (EDs) are essential components of mass casualty incident (MCI) readiness. EMS includes 911 call centers, on-scene medical care, victim transportation, and treatment en route to hospitals. EMS systems vary by locality, leading to differences in response times, quality, and preparedness. Federal responsibility for EMS is shared among the Department of Transportation, DHS, and HHS, raising concerns about coordination. A grant program administered by HRSA supports efforts to ensure appropriate emergency medical services for children. Hospital-based emergency departments (ED) vary by locality, with some not functioning optimally on a day-to-day basis due to overcrowding, patient boarding, and ambulance diversions. The federal government supports EDs through various mechanisms, including hospital preparedness grants and payments to hospitals for care provided to uninsured patients. These payments, known as disproportionate share payments, are crucial for ED financial support. Trauma centers, classified into four levels, provide specialized care beyond typical ED capabilities. Some areas lack patient volume to support a trauma center, impacting response to Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs). Federal funding for trauma centers is inconsistent, with CDC research emphasizing the importance of trauma care access in severe injury survival. MCI medical response involves triage and limited victim treatment. The medical response to Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs) involves triage and limited treatment on-site, with victims transferred to appropriate healthcare facilities for definitive treatment. Federal funding aims to ensure effective coordination among medical responders, law enforcement, and other sectors during MCIs. Local authorities and health systems are primarily responsible during the initial phases of response, but the federal government can provide support through mobile medical teams, field hospitals, supplies, and evacuation assistance. In the event of a public mass shooting or other Mass Casualty Incident (MCI), timely medical treatment is crucial. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) ensures that hospitals must screen and stabilize patients with emergency medical conditions, regardless of their ability to pay. Severe injuries may require transfer to a trauma center by EMS or local Emergency Departments. Trauma centers are required to accept transfers when specialized services are needed. Ongoing services for affected individuals may include medical care, counseling, and public announcements to normalize experiences and reduce anxiety. The federal government plays a role in funding public health interventions and supporting healthcare services for victims and responders of mass shootings. Financial support is crucial for long-term recovery, especially for individuals without insurance. Schools have a unique mission and importance in society. Schools play a crucial role in keeping children safe and educating them to become responsible citizens. Recent public mass shootings in academic settings, including the tragic incident at Sandy Hook Elementary School, have raised concerns about school security. Policy makers are exploring ways to enhance school security, especially in light of incidents involving high school or middle school students as assailants. The federal government is supporting efforts to prevent such tragedies. The federal government supports efforts to prevent gun violence in schools, including anti-bullying programs. The Department of Education administers relevant federal programs for school safety in the event of a public mass shooting. Funding for these provisions may not be sufficient for all schools, posing challenges for policymakers in improving student safety with limited resources. Policy makers face tough decisions on allocating limited funds for school safety programs. Research on effectiveness is lacking, leading to debates on funding for research versus existing programs. Continuity of funds is crucial for local program success, as uncertainty hinders planning and implementation. In recent years, funding for school safety programs from the Department of Education has been reduced, with some programs cut due to perceived ineffectiveness. The Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act program saw a significant decrease in funding. The crisis management process for schools is divided into prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery phases. This report focuses on emergency planning at the elementary and secondary school level. The Department of Education emphasizes the importance of prevention in crisis management at schools, including efforts to reduce the need to respond to crises like mass shootings. This stage is crucial for ensuring students feel safe and can focus on learning. Activities in this stage include connecting with community responders, reviewing school safety audits, determining responsibility for violence prevention, soliciting staff input on crisis plans, reviewing incident data, identifying major crime and violence issues, and assessing existing threat impacts. Improving school climate is crucial for preventing crises like mass shootings, with a positive school climate characterized by caring relationships, opportunities for participation, and shared values. School connectedness, where students feel cared for by adults and peers, is key to a positive school climate. The Department of Education funds a Technical Assistance Center on Positive Behavioral. The Office of Special Education Programs funds a Technical Assistance Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, providing assistance to schools implementing School-wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS). SWPBIS is a prevention-based approach used in over 9,000 schools across 40 states, leading to reductions in student suspensions and office discipline referrals. Bullying prevention is also a focus, with the federal government increasingly involved in initiatives. The impact of bullying on victims can lead to psychological, physical, academic, and behavioral issues. School resource officers work to educate students on crime prevention, develop community justice initiatives, and train students in conflict resolution. The President's Plan aims to address these issues. The President's Plan aims to address issues of justice, crime, and illegal drug use awareness by providing funding for school resource officers, school psychologists, and school safety equipment. This includes hiring new officers, purchasing safety equipment, and training crisis intervention teams for responding to student crises. Public support for armed security in schools is at 64%, but concerns have been raised by researchers and civil rights organizations. Some researchers and civil rights organizations are concerned about the increasing presence of school resource officers in schools, fearing it may negatively impact the learning environment and lead to more school suspensions and juvenile justice referrals. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing on \"Ending the School-to-Prison Pipeline,\" addressing the issue of zero tolerance policies in schools that are depriving children of their right to education. Preparedness for crises, including shooting incidents, is crucial. Preparedness for crises, including shooting incidents, involves confirming the school's emergency plan, acquiring necessary equipment, accounting for all students, communicating with stakeholders, ensuring staff familiarity with safety features, and conducting practice drills. The President's Plan proposes $30 million in grants for emergency management plans, while the REMS program offers competitive grants to improve crisis plans. The Department of Education provides resources and training materials online to help schools develop emergency plans for various crises, not just school shootings. School safety measures have increased over the years, with more schools implementing security guards, police officers, and security cameras. The school safety measures have increased over the years, with a significant rise in the use of security cameras, locking doors, and faculty wearing badges. The President's Plan aims to establish emergency management plans for schools, houses of worship, and higher education institutions. Despite the effectiveness of emergency planning in minimizing casualties during school shootings, federal legislation does not regulate the quality or content of these plans. During a crisis, schools should have emergency management plans in place, including identifying the type of crisis, activating incident management systems, implementing response procedures, communicating important information, and providing emergency first aid. School shootings can be brief, making teachers and staff immediate responders. During a crisis, teachers and school staff are often the immediate responders, sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect students. Community first responders like law enforcement must subdue the shooter and coordinate emergency services. Recovery efforts focus on restoring school facilities, providing support services, and allowing time for healing and commemoration. The Department of Education offers Project SERV grants to assist schools in recovery after a crisis, providing services like mental health assessments, school security enhancements, and staff training. School counselors also play a crucial role in helping students cope and heal following a traumatic event. The President's Plan includes provisions to increase student access to mental health services, seeking funding for a new Comprehensive Safety Grants program, training additional mental health professionals, and providing services for trauma and violence prevention in schools. Additionally, it includes funding for Project AWARE to train teachers and adults to recognize and assist youth with mental illness. Policy makers face challenges in determining the effectiveness of existing preventive programs and allocating limited resources to address public mass shootings. Traditional preventive measures in law enforcement and public health may not be sufficient to combat this specific threat. Policy makers must allocate resources effectively to address public mass shootings. Preventive efforts in education, such as fostering a positive school climate and utilizing school resource officers, are crucial. Decisions must be made on prioritizing prevention over response and supporting programs with multiple uses. The difficulty in crafting policies to address mass shootings lies in the lack of clear baseline metrics to gauge effectiveness. This includes the absence of a widely agreed-upon definition of mass shootings, leading to uncertainties in identifying the number of incidents and their impact. Key questions arise regarding victimization, costs to the federal government, and measuring the effectiveness of prevention, preparedness, and response efforts. To determine the effectiveness of policies addressing mass shootings, it is crucial to establish clear measurements for success or failure in combating this issue."
