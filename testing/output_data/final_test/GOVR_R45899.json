    "content": "Article III, Section I of the Constitution gives Congress the power to determine the size and structure of the federal judiciary, including the number of U.S. circuit and district court judgeships. The Judicial Conference of the United States provides biennial recommendations to Congress for additional judgeships based on workload needs. The Judicial Conference recommends new U.S. circuit and district court judgeships based on workload needs. U.S. circuit courts hear appeals from district courts and review administrative agency decisions. Cases are typically heard by three-judge panels, with 179 judgeships across 13 circuits currently in place. The U.S. circuit courts have 179 judgeships across 13 circuits, with the Ninth Circuit having the most judgeships at 29 and the First Circuit having the fewest at 6. U.S. district courts are federal trial courts that determine facts and apply legal principles to resolve disputes, with each state having at least one district court. The U.S. district courts are divided into judicial districts, with each district having one district court. There are 91 U.S. district courts with a total of 673 authorized judgeships. Congress determines the number of judgeships for each district court, with the Eastern District of Oklahoma having the fewest at 1 and the Southern District of New York and Central District of California having the most at 28 each. Congress first established the federal judiciary's size and structure with the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized 19 judgeships, with Congress expanding the judiciary over time. By 2000, there were 179 circuit court judgeships and 661 district court judgeships. The number of U.S. circuit court judgeships has increased to 179, while the number of district court judgeships has risen to 673. The largest increase in circuit court judgeships occurred in 1978, with a total of 35 new judgeships authorized. The number of circuit court judgeships increased to 179 in 1990 during the 101st Congress and has remained at that number to the present day, marking the longest period without any new authorizations. The largest increase in district court judgeships was in 1978, with 117 new judgeships authorized. The number of authorized district court judgeships has remained at 663 since 2003, the longest period without any new authorizations. The ratio of district court judgeships to circuit court judgeships has varied over time, with a median ratio of 3.5 from 1891 to 2018. In recent years, there have been 3.8 district court judgeships for every circuit court judgeship authorized by Congress. Temporary judgeships are sometimes preferred if a court is dealing with a temporary workload increase or if the workload increase is uncertain. Congress may extend the existence of a temporary judgeship beyond its original date. Congress can extend or convert temporary judgeships, specifying the duration of their existence. If not extended or made permanent, a temporary judgeship will lapse, leaving the court with the original number of judgeships authorized by Congress. Currently, there are 179 permanent U.S. circuit court judgeships and 663 permanent U.S. district court judgeships, with no temporary circuit court judgeships and 10 temporary district court judgeships. Congress has the authority to establish new U.S. circuit and district court judgeships through legislation, which must pass both the House and Senate. This legislation can be included in an omnibus judgeships bill, either as a stand-alone bill or part of a larger one. The appropriations process has also been used to provide additional district court judgeships. Since 1977, Congress has enacted three omnibus judgeship bills, with the most recent in 1990. Each bill was introduced in the House and passed with varying levels of support in both the House and Senate. The bills were passed in different political contexts. Since 1990, there has been divided party control in Congress, with Republicans controlling the presidency and Democrats holding majorities in the Senate and House. Filings in U.S. courts of appeals increased by 15%, while filings in U.S. district courts increased by 39% from 1990 to FY2018. Civil cases increased by 34%, and cases involving criminal felony defendants increased by 60% during the same period. The greatest growth in civil cases was related to personal injury liability, often part of multidistrict litigation actions involving pharmaceutical cases. Congress has created new judgeships through appropriations and authorization bills, with 34 new district court judgeships created between 1999 and 2003. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2000, District of Columbia Appropriations Act of 2001, and 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act were passed with bipartisan support during periods of divided party control. Congress has also extended temporary district court judgeships through appropriations bills and created new judgeships between 1999 and 2003. Congress has the authority to establish new judgeships, convert temporary ones to permanent, and restructure the federal judiciary. The creation of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 1982 is an example of Congress restructuring the judiciary by merging courts and authorizing new judgeships. The judiciary can also recommend legislation that affects the size and structure of the federal court system. The Judicial Conference of the United States recommends new judgeships to Congress biennially, which can be permanent or temporary, and may involve extending or converting temporary judgeships. Recommendations are typically made in March or April at the start of a new Congress. The Judicial Conference reviews judgeship needs for U.S. circuit and district courts biennially through a formal survey process to determine if additional judges are required for effective administration of justice. The process involves courts justifying the need for more judgeships to the Subcommittee on Judicial Statistics, which then evaluates the requests and makes recommendations. The Judicial Conference reviews judgeship needs for U.S. circuit and district courts biennially through a formal survey process. The process involves courts justifying the need for more judgeships to the Subcommittee on Judicial Statistics, which evaluates the requests and makes recommendations. The circuit judicial council reviews the new judgeship request and makes a recommendation to the subcommittee, which then prepares a final judgeship recommendation for approval by the Committee on Judicial Resources. The recommendation is then provided to the Judicial Conference for final approval before being transmitted to Congress. The Judicial Conference evaluates judgeship needs for U.S. circuit and district courts based on caseload levels. The specific measures examined are adjusted filings per panel for circuit courts and weighted filings per authorized judgeship for district courts. The starting point for evaluating judgeship requests is 500 adjusted filings per panel for circuit courts. The Judicial Conference evaluates judgeship needs based on caseload levels, using 430 weighted filings per authorized judgeship as a standard. For smaller district courts with fewer than 5 judgeships, the standard is current weighted filings above 500 per judgeship. Other court-specific factors are also considered in determining judgeship needs. The Judicial Conference evaluates judgeship needs based on caseload levels, using 430 weighted filings per authorized judgeship as a standard. Factors such as availability of senior judges, geographic factors, and caseload activity are considered. In March 2019, the Conference recommended 5 new circuit court judgeships and 65 new permanent district court judgeships. The Judicial Conference recommended additional judgeships for the Ninth Circuit due to its high caseload. This would increase the total number of circuit court judgeships nationally. The Conference also recommended new judgeships for 27 judicial districts and converting temporary positions to permanent ones. The Judicial Conference recommended the creation of more than one new judgeship in 15 districts, with the Central District of California receiving the most at 10. A total of 73 new district court judgeships were recommended, with 45 allocated to the most populous states of California, Texas, and Florida. Additionally, 10 new judgeships were recommended for district courts in four southwestern states. During the Judicial Conference's March 2011 proceedings, 73 new district court judgeships were recommended, with many courts in populous cities like Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and New York City among others. The Judicial Conference authorized pursuing separate legislation for additional judgeships in district courts with high workloads. Six district courts were identified as urgently needing new judgeships, including the Western District of Texas, Eastern District of California, and Southern District of Florida. The Conference emphasized the need for immediate action in these districts. The Conference urged Congress to establish new judgeships in six district courts with high workloads, emphasizing the need for immediate action. The recommendations were based on caseload statistics from September 2017 to June 2018. The Conference recommended establishing new judgeships in six district courts with high workloads based on caseload statistics from September 2017 to June 2018. In the Western District of Texas, criminal filings increased by 28% due to a rise in immigration cases, offset by declines in drug and fraud prosecutions. Civil case filings decreased by three percent, with a drop in prisoner petitions and private contract litigation. In the Eastern District of California, supervised release hearings declined by 11% but remain above the national average. The Eastern District of California has a high number of civil cases filed, exceeding 700 per judgeship, with a significant increase in cases related to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and prisoner petitions. Criminal felony filings rose by 12 percent, with the largest increase in firearms prosecutions. In contrast, criminal filings in the district remain below the national average at 99 per judgeship. The Southern District of Florida saw a two percent increase in overall filings, driven by moderate increases in both civil and criminal cases. The Southern District of Indiana experienced a two percent increase in filings, with civil cases rising three percent and criminal felony filings increasing two percent. The court's pending caseload remains below the national average. Additionally, an influx of over 2,200 personal injury product liability filings related to a multidistrict litigation action occurred since September 2017. The Southern District of Indiana saw a two percent increase in filings, with civil cases rising three percent and criminal felony filings increasing two percent. The court's pending caseload remains below the national average. In addition, over 2,200 personal injury product liability filings related to a multidistrict litigation action occurred since September 2017. Overall filings in the District of New Jersey rose 10 percent, driven by increases in both civil and criminal felony filings. The number of civil cases filed also increased by 10 percent primarily due to rises in copyright cases. The number of civil cases filed rose 10 percent, driven by increases in copyright litigation, civil rights actions, ERISA filings, land condemnation cases, and social security appeals. Criminal filings increased by 27 percent, mainly due to higher numbers of firearms, drug, fraud, and immigration prosecutions. The pending caseload nearly doubled, with a significant influx of personal injury product liability cases. Despite the rise, criminal filings are among the lowest in the nation at 36 per judgeship. The District of Delaware experienced a seven percent increase in overall filings, primarily driven by a rise in civil filings, with a significant increase in patent litigation. The court has the highest number of patent filings in the nation. The number of civil cases filed has risen substantially since the Supreme Court's decision in TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, with civil filings now well above the national average at 518 per judgeship. Criminal felony filings have declined, remaining relatively stable, with the District of Delaware having the 2nd lowest criminal filings in the nation at 21 per judgeship. The Judicial Conference uses the number of weighted filings per authorized judgeship to compare caseloads across U.S. district courts, with the national average being 521 weighted filings. The Judicial Conference recommends additional judgeships for 27 district courts with weighted filings averaging 646 per authorized judgeship. Among these courts, 5 have caseloads below 500 filings, 6 have 500-599 filings, 8 have 600-699 filings, 4 have 700-799 filings, 1 has 800 filings, and 3 have over 1,000 filings. The districts with the highest number of filings are in urgent need of additional judgeships.

Among these courts, 5 have caseloads below 500 filings, 6 have 500-599 filings, 8 have 600-699 filings, 4 have 700-799 filings, 1 has 800 filings, and 3 have over 1,000 filings. The districts with the highest number of filings are in urgent need of additional judgeships, with the Southern District of Florida having the most urgent need. Several courts listed have weighted filings below the national average, but caseload is not the only factor considered in evaluating judgeship needs. The Judicial Conference recommends additional judgeships for districts with low weighted filings, citing reasons such as decline in senior judge assistance, workload imbalances, high pending caseloads, and above-average criminal filings. Congressional authorization is required to create more U.S. circuit and district court judgeships. Congressional authorization is needed to create additional U.S. circuit and district court judgeships. This can be done through omnibus judgeships bills or including it in appropriations bills. Congress has the option to adopt recommendations from the Judicial Conference for creating more judgeships. The Judicial Conference recommends creating new permanent circuit and district court judgeships for courts in urgent need. Congress may also consider converting temporary judgeships to permanent status. Some judgeships are set to expire in 2020 if not extended. Congress may also authorize new judgeships for courts not recommended by the Judicial Conference. Congress may authorize new judgeships for circuit courts based on their own review, even if the Judicial Conference does not recommend it. This includes creating new judgeships for courts identified as needing them by the Conference, as well as for other courts not included in the Conference's recommendations."
