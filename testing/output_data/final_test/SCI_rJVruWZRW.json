    "content": "The dense RNN proposed has fully connected hidden states to multiple preceding hidden states, increasing gradient flow paths. An attention gate controls gradient flow amounts to address vanishing and exploding gradient problems. Experiments on language modeling show improved performance with dense connections and attention gate. Choosing the right model, like RNN, is crucial for analyzing sequential data. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is used for sequential data like natural language processing, machine translation, and speech recognition. Key issues for RNN performance are vanishing/exploding gradient problems and regularization. Solutions include gate functions like LSTM and GRU to prevent gradient vanishing. LSTM has additional gate functions and memory cells, while GRU has similar performance with fewer gate functions. Hierarchical structures in sequential data require models to capture multiple levels. In hierarchical structures, models need to capture multiple timescales. HM-RNN and clockwork RNN use different operations to handle hierarchy. MANN utilizes memory to remember and retrieve previous states. Increasing feedforward and recurrent depth helps prevent vanishing gradient problem. Increasing feedforward and recurrent depth in stacked RNNs helps capture fast and slow changing components in sequential data. The lower layers capture short-term dependencies, while higher layers abstract aggregated information. As the depth increases, the capacity to model long-term dependencies also increases. The number of nonlinearities is proportional to the number of unfolded time steps, making simple RNNs and stacked RNNs behave similarly in the long run. Additionally, increasing recurrent depth enhances the capability to capture long-term dependencies in the data. The hidden state in vanilla RNN has connections to previous time steps, but adding connections to multiple previous time steps can create shortcut paths to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. Models like NARX, HO-RNN, and RHN incorporate direct connections to multiple previous states to address this issue. Vanilla RNN's single path makes it challenging to apply standard dropout techniques for regularization in training long-term sequences. The paper proposes a dense RNN with both feedforward and recurrent depths, increasing complexity. It combines models with orthogonal feedforward and recurrent depths, along with gated feedback connections. The attention gate controls the three features jointly. The paper introduces a dense RNN model with feedforward and recurrent depths, incorporating an attention gate to enhance performance. It extends variational dropout to the dense RNN and discusses methods to improve RNN performance through layer stacking and regularization techniques like dropout. The simple recurrent layer involves the hidden state at time t being a function of input x t and the preceding hidden state h t\u22121. The stacked recurrent neural network can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data by modeling multiple timescales and abstracting information as it travels through layers. Increasing recurrent depth by connecting hidden states at different timesteps is another way to capture long-term dependency. The model with shortcut paths enables access to preceding hidden states further away, capturing multiple timescales for long-term dependency. Feedback connections from preceding hidden states at different layers adaptively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. The model with shortcut paths captures multiple timescales for long-term dependency by enabling access to preceding hidden states. Gated feedback functions are applied to control information flows between hidden states in LSTM, with gates for input, forget, output, and memory cell defined accordingly. Compared to conventional LSTM, gated feedback LSTM includes a gated feedback function in the memory cell gate. The gated feedback LSTM incorporates a gated feedback function in the memory cell gate, allowing for control of information flow between hidden states. To prevent overfitting, dropout is recommended to be applied only to feedforward connections, not recurrent connections, as it can make memorizing long sequences difficult. Efficient application of dropout to recurrent connections involves using the same dropout mask for all time steps during training. The use of dropout in recurrent connections during training is discussed, with a focus on applying the same dropout mask at all time steps. Additionally, the concept of skip connections in deep neural networks is explored, specifically applying them to recurrent connections in this paper. The dense RNN and dense LSTM models incorporate shortcut paths through time using attention gates, allowing for connections between different layers at different timesteps. Unlike gated feedback LSTM, the attention gate is applied to all gates and memory cell states, providing advantages in model performance. The dense RNN and dense LSTM models utilize attention gates for connections between different layers at different timesteps. The dense model predicts the next word by directly referring to recent preceding words, enabling more abstract representations in higher layers of the neural network. The higher layers in a neural network have more abstract hidden states in language modeling. The conventional RNN connects preceding words, sentences, and paragraphs to determine next words, sentences, and paragraphs. Feedback connections reflect this relationship, where preceding words, sentences, and paragraphs affect next words, sentences, and paragraphs with the same scale. However, preceding words do not evenly affect next word prediction. The relevance of words in language modeling is determined by gated attention, which considers the relationship between words based on their features. Attention is influenced by the preceding word and input, affecting the prediction of the next word. This helps address issues like vanishing and exploding gradient problems in sequential data. The vanishing and exploding gradient problems in sequential data occur due to long-term dependencies during backpropagation through time. The critical term related to these issues is \u2202h j \u03c4 /\u2202h j \u03c4 \u22121, which determines if the gradient with respect to the recurrent weight matrix U j will explode or vanish. In dense recurrent networks, the gradient flow is improved due to more paths available for gradients to propagate. The recurrent network addresses the vanishing gradient problem by using attention gates to control the gradient magnitude. The dense RNN with attention gates is expressed as y = \u03c6(g(U g x) \u00b7 U x + \u03b8), where the gradient of y with respect to x is scaled with g. The effect of attention gates in the recurrent highway network can be interpreted using the Ger\u0161gorin circle theorem. The vanishing gradient problem occurs when \u03b3\u03c1 max is less than 1, while the exploding gradient problem happens when A is greater than 1. The Jacobian matrix is formulated for the recurrent connection in the proposed model. The exploding gradient problem in dense RNNs is addressed by evaluating the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix A, where the upper bound is kept below 1 using the attention gate g to prevent overfitting. To prevent overfitting in dense RNN models, variational dropout is applied using random masks at every time step for feedforward and recurrent connections. This concept is extended to dense connections in experiments using the Penn Tree corpus for language modeling. In this paper, a regularization method for RNN called BID21 is proposed to predict the next word based on previous words. The baseline models have fixed hidden sizes of 200, 650, and 1500, referred to as small, medium, and large networks. The hidden size is fixed at 200 for all hidden layers, with varying feedforward depth from 2 to 3 and recurrent depth from 1 to 5. Word embedding weights are tied with word prediction weights. The proposed dense model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with an initial learning rate of 20, decayed by 1.1 after 12 epochs, and training is stopped at 120 epochs to prevent exploding gradients. The paper proposes a regularization method for RNN called BID21 to predict the next word. The dense RNN model has fully connected hidden states with attention gates. The best model has a recurrent depth of 2, with a perplexity of 83.28 on the valid set and 78.82 on the test set using Penn Treebank corpus. The dense connections with attention gates in the RNN model reduced perplexity compared to conventional RNN models when varying recurrent depth using the Penn Treebank corpus."
