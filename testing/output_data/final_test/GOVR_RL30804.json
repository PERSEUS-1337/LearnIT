The method of electing the chief executive was debated at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, with some delegates supporting direct election while others favored indirect methods. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 debated various methods for electing the President and Vice President. Delegates were hesitant to establish national voting standards, leading to the compromise of the electoral college system. This system appoints electors from each state to vote for the nation's chief executives, preserving the federal principle and allowing indirect voting by the people. The Constitution allowed for indirect voting for the President through the electoral college system. States began to allow direct popular choice of electors in the late 18th Century. By 1836, all states except South Carolina chose electors through popular vote. Initially, each elector cast two votes for President, with the winner becoming President and the runner-up becoming Vice President. The electoral college system for electing the President and Vice President faced challenges with the rise of political parties in the new republic. This led to competing candidacies in the elections of 1796 and 1800, where electors had to cast votes strategically to avoid ties for the presidency. The 1800 election resulted in a tie between Jefferson and Burr, leading to a constitutional crisis. After 35 deadlocked ballots, Jefferson was elected president. This event prompted the proposal and ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804, changing the electoral college system to prevent such ties in the future. The 12th Amendment changed the electoral college system, where a majority of electoral votes elect the President and Vice President. The total number of electors is 538, allocated based on congressional representation and three electors for the District of Columbia. The allocation may change after each census. The current allocation of electoral votes by state for the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections is as follows: 538 electoral college votes, with 270 votes needed for a majority. Each state appoints electors as directed by its legislature, as mandated by the Constitution. The District of Columbia has three electors, while other territories like Puerto Rico and Guam are not entitled to electors. Congress determines the date for selecting electors, with the general election date set for the Tuesday after the first Monday in November in every presidential election year. The general election date for the choice of electors is the first Monday in November in every presidential election year. After the electors meet on December 13 in 2004 to cast their votes for President and Vice President, the certified results are transmitted to Congress and other designated authorities. After the electors meet on December 13 in 2004 to cast their votes for President and Vice President, the certified results are transmitted to Congress. Following the election, Congress convenes in a joint session to count the electoral votes, with objections allowed by Members of Congress if signed by one Senator and one Representative. If a valid objection is raised, the session recesses for separate deliberation by the two houses. Debate is limited to two hours, with each Member having five minutes to speak. If both houses vote to sustain an objection, the electoral votes in question are not counted. In a contingent election, the House chooses the President and the Senate chooses the Vice President if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes. The 12th Amendment requires a majority of votes in multi-member state House delegations and a majority of votes in the Senate to elect the President and Vice President. Reform advocates point out flaws in the electoral college system. If no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the House chooses the President and the Senate chooses the Vice President in a contingent election. The House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams as President in 1825, and the Senate elected Richard Mentor Johnson as Vice President in 1837. Critics claimed the 1825 election created a \"constitutional crisis\" due to allegations of a political deal between Adams and Henry Clay. Critics argue that the contingent election system removes the choice of President and Vice President from the voters by allowing House and Senate members to vote freely without considering popular vote results. Supporters point out that the 1825 House contingent election led to a political backlash that helped Andrew Jackson win four years later. The system's equal state voting fails to consider population differences. The contingent election system channels voter dissatisfaction into political action. Evaluating the process involves assessing how often it occurs. Critics warn that viable third-party candidates could lead to contingent elections. In 1968, George C. Wallace won 46 electoral college votes in six southern states as a third-party candidate. A close presidential election, like in 2000, could also lead to a contingent election determining the presidency. The 12th Amendment does not include the District of Columbia in a contingent election, despite having three electoral college votes. Critics argue that the current electoral college system can result in controversial outcomes. The current electoral college system has led to the election of \"minority\" presidents who won the majority of electoral votes but lost the popular vote. Examples include John Quincy Adams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, and Benjamin Harrison in 1888. These outcomes have sparked controversy and criticism. The electoral college system has resulted in \"minority\" presidents winning the majority of electoral votes but losing the popular vote. This has been a source of controversy and criticism, with examples including John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Benjamin Harrison. In the 2000 election, the President and Vice President received more electoral votes but fewer popular votes than the runners-up, leading to debates about the system's consistency with the \"one person, one vote\" principle. The electoral college composition is based on state representation in Congress, ensuring less populous states a minimum of three electoral votes. The electoral college system appears to favor small states due to the weighted distribution of electoral votes. Smaller states have an advantage in electoral vote allocation relative to their populations, as voters in these states cast more electoral votes per voter compared to larger states. This distribution of electoral votes among states has led to debates about the fairness of the system. Some observers argue that the most populous states have a \"voting power\" advantage in the electoral college system, as voters in these states can influence a larger bloc of electoral votes compared to voters in smaller states. This theory suggests that the system benefits the six most populous states, such as California and Texas, due to the winner-take-all method of allocating electoral votes. The electoral college system benefits populous states like California and Texas, giving them an advantage in influencing electoral votes. Minority voters in these states, such as Blacks, Hispanics, and Jews, are able to exert greater influence due to their concentration in these states. This concentration allows them to support candidates who align with their interests, helping to secure electoral votes for favored candidates. The electoral college system benefits populous states like California and Texas, giving them an advantage in influencing electoral votes. Minority voters, such as Blacks, Hispanics, and Jews, support the system as it allows them to exert greater influence due to their concentration in these states. The Supreme Court has ruled that state legislatures have the exclusive power to direct the appointment of presidential and vice presidential electors. The winner-take-all method is used by 48 states and the District of Columbia for allocating electors, while Maine and Nebraska use the congressional district method. In the winner-take-all system, the slate of electors representing the winning presidential ticket in a state cast all of the state's electoral ballots. Maine and Nebraska allocate electors based on both statewide and congressional district voting. The district system for electing the President and Vice President involves voters casting a single vote that is counted twice - once on a statewide basis and once in each district. The elector candidates winning the most votes in each district are elected. This system aims to accurately reflect support across different parts of a state and adjust the number of electors based on each state's population after each census. The allocation of electoral votes in the 2000 election was based on 1990 population distribution among states, leading to over-representation for some and under-representation for others. The reallocation of electoral votes only took effect in the 2004 presidential election, four years out of date, and will be even less reflective of state population trends in the 2008 election. In the 2008 election, 26 states and the District of Columbia attempt to bind their electors by requiring an oath, pledge, or vote for the candidates of the political party they represent, under penalty of law. Some state political parties also require elector candidates to pledge support for the party nominees. The Supreme Court ruled in 1952 that it is constitutional for political parties to require elector candidates to pledge support. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of requiring elector candidates to pledge support for the party's nominees as a legitimate method to secure candidates aligned with the party's philosophy. This exercise of state-delegated authority was deemed valid under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution and did not violate the 12th Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court did not address the constitutionality of laws binding electors in the case of Ray v. Blair. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of requiring elector candidates to pledge support for the party's nominees. However, the Court did not rule on the constitutionality of state laws binding electors, leaving unsettled the enforceability of elector pledges. Some argue that electors are free agents who can vote for any candidate, potentially diminishing democratic involvement in the election process. While most electors historically vote as pledged, \"faithless electors\" have occasionally voted for different candidates. In the election of 2000, a \"faithless elector\" cast a blank ballot, and there have been instances of electors voting for candidates other than those to whom they were pledged in various presidential election years.

Contingencies could occur during the presidential election process, leading to calls for statutory or constitutional reforms to clarify rules of succession and avoid disputes. Contingencies could occur during the presidential election process, leading to calls for reforms to clarify rules of succession and avoid disputes. For example, political parties have rules to fill nominee vacancies if a candidate dies or resigns before the election. If a candidate dies after election day but before the electors meet in December, there is unsettled debate on how to proceed. Some commentators speculate on the process of filling presidential and vice presidential vacancies if a candidate dies before the election. There are concerns about electors voting for a substitute nominee or the decedent, leading to calls for federal statutes to clarify the process. Some legal scholars discuss the uncertainty surrounding the succession process if a presidential or vice presidential nominee were to die after the electors cast their votes in December but before Congress counts the electoral votes in January. The 20th Amendment provides rules of succession, stating that if the \"President elect shall have died\" before the presidential term begins on January 20, the Vice President-elect shall become President. The 20th Amendment addresses the question of when a President-elect exists, stating that the person becomes President-elect as soon as the votes are cast, regardless of whether they have been counted. Some are uncertain if an official President and Vice President-elect exist before the electoral votes are counted and announced by Congress on January 6. The 20th and 25th Amendments address the scenario of a President or Vice President-elect dying before inauguration. The 20th Amendment states that if the President-elect dies after certification, the Vice President-elect becomes President-elect. The 25th Amendment outlines the process for filling the resulting vacancy in the Vice Presidency. The electoral college system generally favors major political parties over independent and third-party candidates. Independent candidates must demonstrate popular support to access the November general election ballots. Non-major party candidates face complex nominating petition requirements in 51 jurisdictions. Historically, no independent, minor party, or third-party presidential candidate has ever won the presidency, although some have won electoral college votes in past elections. Federal court decisions have made it easier for minor party and independent candidates to gain ballot access in the last 35 years. The Ohio election law required new political parties to gather petitions signed by qualified electors totaling 15% of the ballots cast in the last gubernatorial election and file them in early February of the presidential election year. The Court found these laws discriminatory against minor party candidates, violating the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. In the 1976 presidential election, independent candidate Eugene J. McCarthy challenged state statutes on ballot access for independent candidates, many of which were invalidated by federal courts for being discriminatory. During the 1980 election, independent presidential candidate John B. Anderson successfully challenged state election laws in seven states, making it easier for independent and third party candidates to gain ballot access. This has allowed them to compete more effectively against major party candidates. Arguments for the electoral college and direct popular election are fundamentally different, as illustrated by Isaiah Berlin's quote about the fox and the hedgehog. The electoral college's defenders use various arguments like original intent, tradition, federalism, and minority voting power. Proponents of direct election focus on the democratic principle of majority rule. The debate over the electoral college has been ongoing since the Constitution's adoption, with the 12th Amendment being a significant development in 1804. The 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804, is the only major reform of the electoral college. Numerous proposed constitutional amendments for electoral college reform have been introduced in Congress, with approximately 595 amendments proposed between 1889 and 2004. Despite some legislative activity, none have garnered enough support for approval. The closest attempt to reform the electoral college occurred after the 1968 presidential election. In the 1968 presidential election, George Wallace won 46 electoral votes, sparking concerns about contingent elections and electoral vote trading. A resolution in the 91st Congress proposed abolishing the electoral college for direct popular elections, passing the House but failing in the Senate in 1970. Interest in reform increased after the close 1976 election where Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford. In the 1976 election, Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford by a 50.1% popular vote margin and 297 electoral votes to Ford's 48.0% of the popular vote and 240 electoral votes. A proposal for direct popular election in the 96th Congress failed to pass, leading to no further electoral college reform proposals in Congress since then. Recent proposals for reform focus on either eliminating the electoral college system entirely or addressing perceived defects in the current arrangement. The most widely offered proposal for reforming the election of the President and Vice President is the direct election plan, which would abolish the electoral college and have them elected by popular vote. Some variations of the plan require winning candidates to receive at least 40% of the votes, with a runoff election if necessary. Others suggest a simple plurality would suffice, or have Congress decide in a joint session if the threshold is not met. Proponents of direct election argue that it is a simple and democratic way to elect the President and Vice President, ensuring that the candidates with the most popular votes always win. They believe this would eliminate the possibility of a \"minority\" President and Vice President and prevent distortion of the public will. Direct election would also give every vote equal weight, regardless of the state in which it was cast, and reduce complications in the election process. The direct election plan aims to simplify the election process by ensuring the winning candidates become President and Vice President-elect as soon as results are certified. Opponents argue that this plan could weaken the two-party system and lead to the growth of minor parties, impacting the stability enjoyed under the current system. Opponents of the direct election plan argue that it could lead to the growth of minor parties, potentially weakening the two-party system and impacting the stability of the current system. They also raise concerns about the potential divisive effect on national politics and the elimination of states' influence in favor of a single nationwide count under direct presidential election. Additionally, they question the 40% runoff requirement included in most direct election proposals. Critics of direct election argue that the concept of a \"plurality\" President may not be justifiable if the aim is to elect a President with a majority of votes. They believe the electoral college system is a vital component of federalism, providing for a federal election of the President as intended by the Constitution. They claim that direct popular election would undermine federalism and point to the 2000 election as an example of the potential impact of close results in a single state. The three proposals in this section aim to retain the electoral college system but address perceived flaws by awarding electoral votes directly to candidates, eliminating the role of electors. This change is believed to prevent issues like faithless electors and potential post-election disputes, which could harm political comity and stability in the nation. The district plan proposed in these reform plans aims to eliminate faithless electors by changing how electoral votes are allocated. Instead of a winner-take-all system, one elector would be chosen per congressional district, with two additional electors chosen by voters at large. This method, currently used by Maine and Nebraska, preserves the electoral college system while addressing perceived flaws. The district plan, currently used by Maine and Nebraska, aims to elect presidential candidates based on a simple majority of electoral votes. In case of a tie, the candidate with the most district electoral votes nationwide would win. If no winner is determined, the Senate and House of Representatives would vote on the top three candidates with the most electoral votes. The district plan, used by Maine and Nebraska, aims to elect presidential candidates based on a simple majority of electoral votes. In 2000, under this system, Bush and Cheney would have received eight electoral votes in Missouri compared to all 11 under the general ticket system. In the 2000 election, the district plan in Missouri allocated electoral votes based on popular vote results, with Gore and Lieberman winning three electoral votes. Proponents argue that this method would better reflect popular vote results for presidential candidates and maintain advantages for small states. Proponents of the district plan argue that it could increase voter participation, invigorate the two-party system, and reflect political diversity within states. However, opponents believe it doesn't address the issue of unequal voting weights between small and populous states, and could still result in \"minority\" Presidents and Vice Presidents winning the electoral vote while losing the popular vote. Some opponents of the district plan argue that it may fragment the electoral vote among marginal candidates, weakening the two-party system. The proportional plan awards electoral votes based on the percentage of votes received in each state, with variations like the strict proportional plan dividing votes into thousandths. The proportional plan awards electoral votes based on the percentage of votes received in each state. If candidates fail to receive a majority, the Senate and House of Representatives would vote to choose the President and Vice President. In the 2000 election, a strict proportional plan would have allocated electoral votes to Bush/Cheney and Gore/Lieberman. A proportional plan for allocating electoral votes in Missouri would have awarded votes to Bush/Cheney, Gore/Lieberman, Nader/LaDuke, and other candidates. Proponents argue that this plan is the closest to electing the President by popular vote while preserving each state's electoral college strength and reducing the likelihood of \"minority\" presidents being elected. Opponents of the proportional plan argue that it could undermine the two-party system by making it easier for minor parties and independent candidates to compete in presidential elections. They believe it would reduce the importance of states as units and lead to more close elections. Opponents of the proportional plan argue that it could lead to more frequent instances of electoral vote deadlock and question the 40% plurality threshold. They suggest that the winning candidate should be required to gain a majority of electoral votes. The automatic plan would abolish the office of presidential elector and allocate state electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. Most versions of the automatic plan include a contingent election in Congress if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes. The automatic plan for reforming the electoral college would result in minimal changes to the current system. It aims to maintain the balance between national and state powers, eliminate the possibility of \"faithless electors,\" and preserve the two-party system. In the 2000 election, the only change would have been the elimination of a blank vote, resulting in a slight shift in electoral votes. The winner-take-all method of allotting electoral votes has hindered minor parties, new parties, and independent candidates in presidential elections. Opponents of the automatic plan argue that it perpetuates inequities in the current electoral college system and could still result in a \"minority\" President and Vice President. There is concern that Congress, not the people, could still decide the presidency and vice presidency under the automatic plan. In the 2000 presidential election, the electoral college system led to a President and Vice President winning more electoral votes but fewer popular votes than the runners-up, sparking calls for reform. Despite proposals introduced in Congress, no action was taken on electoral college reform, with attention shifting to election administration reform instead. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) was passed in 2002, expanding federal involvement in election administration by setting new requirements for voting systems and providing grants to states. The electoral college system has endured since 1789, evolving through constitutional amendments and changing political practices. It has delivered the presidency to the popular and electoral vote winners in 46 out of 51 elections since 1804. The electoral college system has been in place since 1804, delivering legitimate results even in cases of \"misfires.\" Interest in changing or abolishing it has varied over the years, with proposals for reform emerging after close elections in 1960, 1968, and 1976. Amendments for direct popular election were considered during these periods of heightened interest. During periods of interest in electoral college reform, a direct popular election amendment was approved in the House in 1969 and debated in the Senate in 1979. However, these proposals did not gain enough momentum to overcome the challenge of approval by two-thirds of both chambers and three-fourths of the states. The electoral college continued to function as expected in presidential elections, with little push for change until the contested election of 2000. The bitterly contested presidential election of 2000, seen as an electoral college \"misfire,\" did not lead to support for direct popular election or electoral college reform. Anger was mainly directed at voting system failures in Florida and nationwide, leading to uncertainty for over a month. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 aimed to address these issues. The difficulty of amending the Constitution, particularly Article V, is a significant factor in electoral college reform discussions. The process of amending the Constitution requires super majorities in Congress and state approval, often with a seven-year deadline. Successful amendments are usually spurred by significant events or long-standing public support, with a widespread consensus on the need for reform. The 12th Amendment to the Constitution was prompted by the presidential election crisis of 1800, showing that public awareness and the need for reform have historically influenced constitutional revisions. Congress acted swiftly to propose the amendment, which was ratified by the states in 1804. The 25th Amendment, prompted by the events following President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, revamped presidential succession procedures due to the vacant vice presidency for 14 months. This led to a broad national consensus for change in Congress and among the public. The 26th Amendment, setting 18 as the voting age in the United States, was proposed in 1965 and ratified in 1967. The amendment was influenced by the political involvement of young people during the 1960s, including the Vietnam War and cultural upheaval. The 26th Amendment, ratified in 1967, lowered the voting age to 18 in response to youth political involvement during the 1960s. The 25th and 26th Amendments were supported by key congressional leaders for successful passage. Efforts to reform the electoral college have lacked similar champions since Senator Bayh's direct election proposal. Efforts to reform the electoral college system have not had strong advocates since Senator Bayh proposed direct election in 1979. The system is likely to remain unless there is overwhelming support for its reform or abolition."
