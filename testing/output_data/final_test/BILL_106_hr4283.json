    "content": "The Act titled \"Great Lakes Protection and Restoration Act of 2000\" includes a grant program for sediment remediation, known as the \"Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2000.\" Grants are provided for the remediation of sediment contamination at areas of concern. Section 118(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow grants for remediation of sediment contamination at areas of concern in the United States. Qualified projects can receive funding from the Administrator through the Great Lakes National Program Office. The Administrator gives priority to applicants proposing projects that remediate contaminated sediment in areas of concern within the United States. The Administrator prioritizes projects that remediate contaminated sediment in areas of concern within the United States. Grants may not be awarded for projects in areas likely to suffer further contamination or with negative short and long-term impacts. The Administrator prioritizes projects for remediation of contaminated sediment in areas of concern within the United States. Projects with a greater adverse impact on human health and the environment than other remedial measures require a non-Federal share of at least 35% of the project cost. The non-Federal share of the cost of operation and maintenance for projects assisted under this paragraph must be 100 percent. No grant can be made for a project unless the grantee agrees to certain conditions. The Administrator may require agreements from grantees to maintain expenditures for remediation programs at or above average levels. Applicants must demonstrate careful consideration of risks, benefits, impacts, implementation, and cost for each remedial action. When making grants for remediation programs, the Administrator considers risks, benefits, impacts, implementation likelihood, and costs. Coordination with the Secretary of the Army and Governors of States is also ensured for effective use of Federal and State assistance in areas of concern. Authorization of appropriations for remediation programs is set at $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2005, with funds remaining available until expended. TITLE II--MORATORIUM ON EXPORTS OF BULK FRESH WATER\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS. The Congress recognizes the importance of the Great Lakes Basin as a valuable public resource governed by the Great Lakes States and Canadian provinces. Authority over the Great Lakes is given to the Governors of the Great Lakes States. The Great Lakes Charter of 1985 outlines procedures for consultation on water withdrawals. Governors and premiers have authority under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. The premiers of Canadian provinces and Governors of Great Lakes States make decisions on water proposals based on conservation efforts. Bulk water exports present a challenge due to growing global demand for clean water, with unknown ecological effects. SEC. 202. MORATORIUM ON EXPORTS OF BULK FRESH WATER. No bulk fresh water from the Great Lakes Basin may be exported from the United States. The moratorium will be lifted on December 31, 2001, or upon approval of an agreement among the Great Lakes States for a common conservation standard. SEC. 203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) \"bulk fresh water\" means fresh water extracted for transportation without further processing;\n(2) \"Great Lakes Basin\" includes Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario, St. Clair, and Superior, interconnecting waterways, tributaries, and surrounding watershed;\n(3) \"Great Lakes State\" refers to Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin."
