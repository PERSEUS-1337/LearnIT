A physician must certify that the individual meets these requirements within a specified timeframe. Individuals aged 18 or older who are unable to perform certain daily activities without assistance due to functional limitations or cognitive impairment may qualify for long-term care assistance. Individuals aged 6 to 18 who are unable to perform at least 3 activities of daily living without substantial assistance may qualify for long-term care assistance. Individuals with severe cognitive impairment who are unable to perform at least 1 activity of daily living or engage in age-appropriate activities may qualify for long-term care assistance. The individual must meet specific criteria, including being at least 2 but not 6 years old, having a loss of functional capacity in activities like eating or mobility, and having a complex medical condition requiring care coordination. The individual under 2 years of age requires specific durable medical equipment due to a severe health condition or needs a skilled practitioner for care. The individual may qualify for specialized care if they have a severe health condition, complex medical condition, or 5 or more chronic conditions. An eligible caregiver is defined as a taxpayer who can provide substantial assistance to individuals with chronic conditions lasting at least 6 months. This assistance is required for performing daily activities due to a loss of functional capacity. The caregiver can be the taxpayer or their spouse. An eligible caregiver is someone who can provide substantial assistance to individuals with chronic conditions for at least 6 months.

In order to qualify for certain tax benefits, an individual must meet residency requirements by having their principal place of abode at the taxpayer's home if they are an ancestor or descendant of the taxpayer or their spouse. The taxpayer's spouse or another individual must be a member of the taxpayer's household for over half the taxable year or the entire taxable year to qualify as an eligible caregiver. If multiple individuals are eligible caregivers for the same person, the taxpayer will be considered the eligible caregiver if each individual (other than the taxpayer) files a written statement. If multiple individuals are eligible caregivers for the same person, the individual with the highest income will be treated as the eligible caregiver if others do not file a written declaration. Married individuals filing separately will have a specific determination process. The identification requirements for claiming a tax credit under Section 24(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 state that the taxpayer must include the name, taxpayer identification number, and physician identification number of the applicable individual. The amendments made by this section include changes to the identification requirements for claiming a tax credit under Section 24(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, such as inserting \"or physician identification\" after \"correct TIN\" and changing \"child tax\" to \"family care.\" Additionally, there are modifications to Section 213(e) regarding the exclusion of amounts allowed for care of certain dependents, with a denial of double benefit and a conforming amendment to the heading of the section. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2003, or the enactment date of this Act."
