    "content": "The Flexibility Incentive Grant Pilot Program is outlined in Section 1. The Flexibility Incentive Grant Pilot Program under Section 1 of Chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, aims to provide incentives for States to generate new revenue for transit projects and services and increase flexibility in transportation fund usage. The Secretary of Transportation will establish the pilot program, with a selection process for States to participate. The Secretary will select States for a pilot program to increase State funds for transit projects. States must show an increase in funding from the second fiscal year before September 1 to the first fiscal year before September 1. Grants will be given to States with a 10% or more increase. The Secretary will grant funds to States with a 10% or more increase in transit project expenditures. The grant amount will be based on the increase in State funds spent on transit projects from the second preceding fiscal year to the first preceding fiscal year. For fiscal years 2006 through 2010, the Secretary will grant $10,000,000 to states with a 1% or more increase in transit project expenditures, as long as the total expenditures were over $1,000,000,000 in the preceding fiscal year. States creating flexible transportation funds can receive grants based on new revenue sources. For fiscal years 2004 through 2010, the Secretary will grant $10,000,000 to states that implement a new dedicated source of revenue for transit projects, resulting in a 10% increase in state funds available for such projects within 2 years. The term 'dedicated source of revenue' includes various sources such as State motor fuels tax, sales tax, interest on existing highway funds, motor vehicle excise tax, tolls, and loans from highway funds. The Secretary will grant $10,000,000 to states that allow funds restricted for highways to be used for transit projects and services as well. The Secretary may only grant funds to a State eligible for multiple grants under different subsections for the greatest amount. States can use the funds for any project eligible under title 23 or chapter 53, subject to specific grant requirements for transit and highway projects. The Federal share of the cost of a project funded under this section is 100 percent. Authorizations of appropriations are set at $80,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 through 2010. A program evaluation study must be conducted within 5 years of enactment. The program funded under this section has a Federal share of 100 percent. An evaluation study must be conducted within 5 years of enactment, with a report submitted to relevant committees. A conforming amendment is made to the analysis chapter.
