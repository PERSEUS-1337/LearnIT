    "title": "SB 277",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. In enacting this chapter, the Legislature aims to achieve total immunization of appropriate age groups against various childhood diseases, as recommended by health authorities. The legislation aims to achieve total immunization of appropriate age groups against childhood diseases by allowing individuals to choose where to get immunized, providing exemptions for medical reasons, keeping records of immunizations, and incentivizing public health authorities to promote timely immunization. Section 120335 of the Health and Safety Code requires all pupils in schools and childcare centers to be fully immunized against specified diseases before admission. The governing authority of each institution is responsible for ensuring compliance with immunization requirements. The Health and Safety Code mandates full immunization against specified diseases for pupils in schools and childcare centers. The governing authority must ensure compliance with immunization requirements, including for diseases like poliomyelitis, rubella, tetanus, hepatitis B, and varicella. Additionally, pupils must be fully immunized against pertussis before advancing to the 7th grade. The department specifies immunizing agents and administration methods. Exemptions apply to home-based private school and independent study program pupils. Pupils with immunization beliefs prior to 2016 can enroll until next grade span. Section 120338 of the Health and Safety Code mandates immunization for pupils in specific grade spans, prohibiting admission or advancement without required immunizations. However, pupils with individualized education programs are exempt from this requirement. Section 120338 of the Health and Safety Code mandates immunizations for pupils before admission to schools or child care centers, with exemptions allowed for medical reasons and personal beliefs. Sections 120365 and 120370 are either repealed or amended accordingly. Section 120370 of the Health and Safety Code allows exemptions from immunization requirements for children if a licensed physician provides a written statement indicating that immunization is not safe due to the child's medical condition or circumstances. If a child is believed to have been exposed to a disease they are not immunized against, they may be temporarily excluded from school until the local health officer confirms they are no longer at risk. The governing authority of schools must require proof of immunization for all new entrants and maintain records of their immunization status. New entrants admitted conditionally must be fully immunized within specified time periods, with any additional immunizations added to their record. The governing authority of schools must prohibit pupils admitted conditionally from further attendance if they fail to obtain required immunizations within specified time limits, unless exempted, until fully immunized against all listed diseases. The governing authority must report new entrants' immunization status to the department and local health department. The local health department can access complete health information to identify immunization deficiencies. The governing authority must cooperate with the county health officer for immunization programs for school admissions. School districts can use funds, property, and personnel for this purpose. Licensed physicians or qualified nurses can administer immunizing agents to school entrants."
