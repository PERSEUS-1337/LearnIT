    "content": "The Act titled \"Student Loan Simplification and Opportunity Act of 2011\" allows for temporary student loan debt conversion authority. The Student Loan Simplification and Opportunity Act of 2011 repeals Section 459A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and makes conforming amendments to Part D of the Act. The Student Loan Simplification and Opportunity Act of 2011 amends Part D of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow eligible parents to support students pursuing higher education. It also addresses student loan debt conversion. The Student Loan Simplification and Opportunity Act of 2011 allows eligible parents to support students pursuing higher education and addresses student loan debt conversion through temporary authority. The Secretary has the authority to convert eligible student loan debt into a Federal debt by paying off the outstanding balance. This conversion is available for eligible borrowers who apply between January 1, 2012, and October 1, 2012. A borrower whose student loan debt is repaid by the Secretary and converted to a Federal debt is referred to as a 'FFEL Debt Conversion Loan'. Eligibility for this loan includes having an outstanding loan made under this part or purchased by the Secretary before June 30, 2010. The eligible student loan debt must have been made, insured, or guaranteed under part B. A FFEL Debt Conversion Loan must meet certain criteria: the loan must not be in default or delinquent for 270 days or more before June 30, 2010. The terms and conditions of the loan are the same as the original student loan, including grace periods and deferments. The loan will count towards the borrower's aggregate loan limit. The FFEL Debt Conversion Loan retains the terms of the original student loan, including grace periods and deferments. Borrower benefits specific to FFEL loans or Direct loans are not available with a FFEL Debt Conversion Loan. The Secretary does not impose any fees on borrowers for origination or other charges. The borrower shall not be charged any origination or other fees for a FFEL Debt Conversion Loan. The holder of an eligible student loan is also prohibited from charging any fees for converting the loan to a FFEL Debt Conversion Loan. The Secretary may offer benefits to borrowers of FFEL Debt Conversion Loans, not exceeding 2 percent of the loan amount advanced. The Secretary may offer benefits to borrowers of FFEL Debt Conversion Loans, such as payments, reductions in outstanding principal and interest, or other established benefits. Holders of eligible student loans must provide necessary information for conversion. Eligible borrowers will be notified of their eligibility and the application timeframe. The Higher Education Act is amended to include provisions for borrowers obtaining FFEL Debt Conversion Loans. Borrowers will be considered as having entered repayment on the date they entered repayment on the eligible student loan debt that was converted to a Federal debt. Additionally, contracts related to these loans will have specific language inserted to reflect the conversion process. The Higher Education Act is amended to include provisions for borrowers obtaining FFEL Debt Conversion Loans. The amendments involve inserting \"or converted\" after \"made\" in federal consolidation loans and inserting \"converted,\" after \"made,\" in income-based repayment sections. Sections 482(c) and 492 are exempt from the amendments made by this section. The amendments made by this section include regulations under those amendments. The Secretary of Education must provide annual cost estimates as required by the Higher Education Act of 1965. Proceeds from student loan debt conversion will fund Federal Pell Grants."
