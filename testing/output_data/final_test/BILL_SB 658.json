    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1714.21 of the Civil Code in California is amended to include definitions for AED and CPR. Good Samaritans who use an AED in an emergency situation are not liable for civil damages. Those who provide CPR and AED training are also protected from liability for the actions of those they trained. (d) A person or entity acquiring an AED for emergency use is not liable for civil damages if they comply with specified regulations. Healthcare professionals involved in AED selection are also protected. However, these protections do not apply in cases of gross negligence or misconduct during emergency care with an AED. Section 1797.196 of the Health and Safety Code amends regulations regarding the acquisition and maintenance of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). Those acquiring an AED must comply with placement regulations, notify the local EMS agency, maintain and test the AED according to manufacturer guidelines, and test it biannually and after each use. Liability protections are provided for those acquiring AEDs for emergency use, with exceptions for cases of gross negligence or misconduct during emergency care. The regulations for AED maintenance require testing at least biannually and after each use, inspections every 90 days, and record-keeping. Building owners must notify tenants annually about AED locations and offer CPR training information. Building owners must offer a demonstration on how to use an AED annually and post instructions next to the AED. A medical director is not required for AED acquisition or placement. (c) (1) Principals in K-12 schools must ensure that school staff receive annual information on sudden cardiac arrest, emergency response plans, and AED use. Instructions on AED use must be posted next to each AED in 14-point type, and employees must be notified annually of AED locations on campus. (2) School employees and others are allowed to use AEDs. (d) AED suppliers must provide all necessary information on AED use, installation, operation, training, and maintenance to the acquirer. (e) Violations of this section are not subject to penalties. (g) \"Local EMS agency\" is defined as an agency established under Section 1797.200. (h) This section does not apply to facilities licensed under Section 1250."
