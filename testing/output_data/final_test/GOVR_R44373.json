    "content": "The child nutrition programs and WIC were last reauthorized in 2010, with some authorities expiring in 2015. Efforts to reauthorize during the 114th Congress did not advance, but issues and proposals may still influence policymaking in the new Congress. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals may remain of interest as regulations and initiatives from the Obama Administration play a significant role in current law. The transition to a Trump Administration could impact how the 115th Congress proposes changes to these laws. The report provides background on the 2010 reauthorization, the current status of program operations, and an overview of the 114th Congress Senate and House committees' proposals. For more information on program operations and the 2010 reauthorization, refer to CRS products. The report tracks reauthorization activity in the 115th Congress for child nutrition programs like the National School Lunch Program and WIC, authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. Last reauthorized in 2010, proposals for changes may be influenced by the transition to a Trump Administration. For more details, refer to CRS products listed. The child nutrition and WIC programs, last reauthorized in 2010, have not been reauthorized by Congress as of the date of the report. Funding has been provided through appropriations laws, with operations continuing under various laws including the FY2017 omnibus appropriations law. Despite the lack of reauthorization, most programs' authorities to operate are permanent. Most child nutrition programs have permanent authorities to operate, with some programs having permanent authorizations of appropriations. However, a few pilot programs or temporary activities may expire if the authorizing law is not amended. Some programs' authorizations of appropriations have ended, while others have been extended under the FY2017 omnibus appropriations law. The SFSP pilot has been discontinued along with other programs' authorizations of appropriations after September 30, 2015. Funding allows programs with expired authorizations to continue operating. The FY2016 appropriations law and FY2017 CRs enabled these programs to continue. The 114th Congress committee proposals for child nutrition reauthorization bills were marked up during the 114th Congress. The Senate and House Committees completed reauthorization legislation for child nutrition and WIC programs. The Senate Committee approved the Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act of 2016, while the House Committee introduced a similar proposal. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce introduced the Improving Child Nutrition and Education Act of 2016 (H.R. 5003) to reauthorize WIC and child nutrition programs. The committee approved the bill, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing the changes. Chairman Kline submitted committee report H.Rept. 114-852. The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry ended reauthorization negotiations before the end of the 114th Congress. The Senate and House committees' proposals for reauthorizing WIC and child nutrition programs are discussed thematically. The Senate committee's legislation (S. 3136) would extend authorizations of appropriations for various programs through FY2020. The House committee's legislation (H.R. 5003) was approved with Republican support and includes changes to WIC and child nutrition programs. The Senate and House committees proposed extending authorizations for various programs like WIC and child nutrition through FY2020 and FY2021 respectively. The proposals included continuing some authorizing provisions but did not extend preappropriated funding for a National Hunger Clearinghouse. Funding for child nutrition programs is currently open-ended and mandatory. The child nutrition programs' funding is not capped and fluctuates based on reimbursement rates and participation. The House committee proposed a demonstration project for block grants in place of open-ended funding. The House committee proposed a demonstration project for block grants in place of open-ended funding for child nutrition programs. Up to three states would receive fixed funding for flexible purposes, not bound by national standards for nutrition requirements or eligibility rules. The House committee proposed a demonstration project for block grants in child nutrition programs, allowing states to set their own rules instead of following national standards. States applying for funding would need to ensure access to affordable meals for all school-aged children and provide an implementation plan with specified parameters. The proposal included limitations on federal interference in defining implementation details. The House committee proposed a demonstration project for block grants in child nutrition programs, allowing states to set their own rules instead of following national standards. The proposal included limitations on federal interference in defining implementation details. During the House committee's markup, an amendment to block grant the NSLP and SBP nationwide was defeated. Debates on the next child nutrition reauthorization have focused on updated nutrition standards for school meals programs. The Senate committee's proposal aimed to change whole grains and sodium meal standards by reducing the whole-grain requirement to 80% and delaying the Target 2 sodium requirements for two years. It also included a provision for a study of sodium limits in meals. The proposal required USDA to contract with an independent entity to review sodium standards in meal regulations and establish advisory groups for nutrition standards. It also included a provision for fluid milk requirements. The proposal included requirements for USDA to review school-age children's milk consumption and availability in schools to align with dietary guidelines. It also mandated a triennial review of school meals nutrition standards by the Secretary. The proposal required the Secretary to conduct a triennial review of school meals nutrition standards, focusing on sodium and whole grain requirements. Any proposed sodium reductions had to meet high research and health standards before taking effect. The House committee's proposal included provisions for family meal days, flexibility for substitutions, and changes to nutrition standards for competitive foods. The House committee's proposal included exemptions for fundraisers by student groups and changes to nutrition standards for competitive foods. It also introduced a School Nutrition Advisory Council and addressed fluid milk standards. Additionally, the proposal made changes to school meals programs income eligibility rules and reimbursement rates. The House committee's proposal would make changes to the Community Eligibility Provision, reducing the number of schools eligible for free meals. Eligibility for CEP is based on a school's \"identified student percentage\" (ISP), determined through direct certification. The House committee's proposal would raise the ISP threshold for the Community Eligibility Provision from 40% to 60% and allow a grace period for schools no longer eligible. It would also increase School Breakfast Program reimbursements. The proposal aims to increase School Breakfast Program reimbursements starting in School Year 2018-2019. The base rate would have increased by two cents per breakfast for SY2018-2019, followed by inflation adjustments for subsequent years. Additionally, the reimbursement rate for breakfasts served through CACFP would have changed. Schools would still be required to verify data on household applications for free and reduced-price meals. The proposed changes in the verification process for free and reduced-price school meals include increasing the sample size to 10,000 or 10% of applications, with a focus on error-prone applications. Both Senate and House committees' proposals aim to revise the verification process, with some differences in details. Schools may use direct verification or contact households for verification if data cannot be matched with other low-income programs. The Senate and House committees proposed changes to the verification process for free and reduced-price school meals, aiming to reduce the sample size to 3,000 or 3% and 2,500 or 2.5% respectively. The focus would be on various categories of applications, including those with error patterns or fraud indicators. The Senate and House committees proposed changes to the verification process for free and reduced-price school meals, aiming to reduce the sample size to 3,000 or 3% and 2,500 or 2.5% respectively. The proposals included using random sampling for certain low-income programs and implementing error reduction plans for high-error schools. The committees differed in the specific ratio of application types in the sample and the requirements for the error reduction plan. The House committee's proposal aimed to increase the sample size for error reduction plans in LEAs, with no cap on the number of LEAs affected. The HHFKA set pricing requirements for full-price lunches and non-program foods to prevent federal subsidies from supporting non-needy children. The Senate committee proposed replacing these requirements with a \"non-federal revenue target\" for schools. The Senate committee proposed a \"non-federal revenue target\" for schools, requiring them to contribute nonfederal funds, potentially from household payments or other state/local sources. The proposal also included grants for kitchen equipment and infrastructure improvements, along with USDA loan guarantees. The House committee's proposal included discretionary funding for loan guarantees and grants, with less funding for discretionary grants compared to the Senate committee's proposal. It also aimed to provide access to potable water for children during meal service for up to 90 days under certain conditions. The SFSP and NSLP's Seamless Summer Option (SSO) are programs for feeding low-income children during summer and afterschool. Organizations need to participate in SFSP and CACFP At-risk Afterschool programs, except for schools using SSO. Senate and House committees proposed piloting or expanding alternatives for summer feeding, with differences in SFSP provisions. Both proposals authorized eligible institutions to operate SFSP and CACFP At-risk Afterschool sites. The Senate committee's proposal would have allowed eligible institutions to operate SFSP and CACFP At-risk Afterschool sites under one application, with reimbursement at SFSP rates. Up to seven states could have participated in FY2018, with additional states added in subsequent years. States with low SFSP participation and those not using EBT for WIC would have been prioritized. Eligible institutions would have had to provide meals for at least 20 summer days to participate. Under the House committee's proposal, participating institutions would have been reimbursed at CACFP At-Risk Afterschool rates. Up to five states would have been selected for participation based on their capacity to reduce paperwork and administrative burdens while maintaining program integrity. Additional states could have been added in subsequent years, with the Secretary providing technical assistance and collecting best practices from the states. The Senate committee's proposal aimed to provide benefits via EBT to children eligible for free and reduced-price school meals over the summer months. It included a special election for states to issue $30 per summer month, per eligible child, on a WIC EBT card, funded by mandatory funding. The number of children served under this election would be limited each fiscal year. The proposal includes a special election for states to issue $30 per summer month, per eligible child, on a WIC EBT card, funded by mandatory funding. The number of children served would be limited each fiscal year, with additional funding of up to $50 million authorized for extra children. The criteria for eligibility include living in poor rural areas without congregate feeding sites, limited access to SFSP, or areas with less than 50% of households eligible for free school meals. Additionally, resources would be authorized to continue the Summer EBT demonstrations with up to $10 million in appropriations for each of FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020. The Senate committee's proposal for FY2017 included funding for states with existing SEBTC programs, offering $15 to $30 per month for participating children. States could determine benefit amounts based on community factors. An amendment allowed states to use SNAP or WIC for benefits instead of WIC EBT. Another proposal allowed SFSP meals to be consumed off-site for children in rural areas. The House committee's proposal for off-site meal elections in rural and high-need areas was similar to the Senate committee's proposal but with some differences. It required the state to define rural areas and allowed off-site meal consumption only in areas eligible for SFSP but not currently served. The proposal would have required USDA to grant a state's request for off-site consumption in cases of extreme weather, violence, or other emergencies. The Senate committee's proposal included discretionary funding for up to six state agencies to pilot three meals per day, not in the House committee's proposal. The House committee's proposal included a Business Partnership Demonstration Project for improving SFSP service delivery through competitive grants. The Senate and House committees proposed changes to the CACFP policy, allowing new institutions to participate and providing an additional snack for children in care for longer hours. Both proposals aimed to expand meal and snack reimbursement eligibility, with the Senate proposal offering more comprehensive changes. The Senate committee's proposal aimed to provide additional food for longer-duration child care by allowing child care institutions to claim reimbursement for an extra snack for children in care for nine hours or more per day. Additionally, the proposal included increasing reimbursement rates for breakfasts served through CACFP and boosting funding for the Farm to School Grant Program. The proposal aimed to authorize up to $10 million in discretionary appropriations annually for implementing agricultural literacy and nutrition education. It also sought to make improving procurement and distribution a goal of grant making. Maximum grants would have been $150,000 under the House committee's proposal, without additional discretionary funds. Changes were proposed to allow for a \"hardship exemption\" criteria and a process for schools to serve fruit and vegetable snacks. The proposal included a \"hardship exemption\" criteria for schools to serve frozen, dried, or canned fruits and vegetables instead of fresh items in the snack program. Schools with limited access or facilities could participate in the program, gradually transitioning from 100% non-fresh offerings to 100% fresh offerings over four years. The House committee's proposal allowed schools to serve all forms of fruits and vegetables, renaming the program to \"Fruit and Vegetable.\" The proposal aimed to expand the Fruit and Vegetable Program to include tree nut snacks, with USDA guidance on nutrition standards. Differences in WIC funding caps were noted between the Senate and House committees' proposals. The Senate committee's proposal included changes to child eligibility and infant certification periods in the WIC program, allowing for extended benefits. The House committee's proposal focused on changes to income eligibility calculations. The WIC program determines income eligibility by excluding certain Department of Defense payments and child support amounts. The supplemental food package is regulated by federal and state policies to provide foods lacking in nutrients for pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, infants, and children. The WIC program allows state agencies to substitute foods for cultural eating patterns with approval from the Secretary of Agriculture. Both Senate and House committees proposed changes to the list of supplemental foods, including considerations for commercial availability and participant demand. The House committee also proposed a limit to ensure children's overall fruit intake is not restricted. The House committee proposed changes to the WIC program, including a limit on restricting children's fruit intake. Both Senate and House committees suggested measures for benefit redemption integrity and accurate invoicing of WIC infant formula purchases. The House committee proposed changes to the WIC program, including notification requirements for states regarding vendor moratoriums and reimbursement levels. They also suggested reviewing states' vendor authorization processes and making changes to competitive bidding for infant formula and foods. The House committee proposed changes to the WIC program, including notification requirements for states on vendor moratoriums and reimbursement levels. They also suggested reviewing states' vendor authorization processes and making changes to competitive bidding for infant formula and foods. Additionally, the proposal included transitioning to EBT by October 1, 2020, with discretionary funding for EBT implementation. The House committee proposed changes to the WIC program, including notification requirements for states on vendor moratoriums and reimbursement levels. They also suggested reviewing states' vendor authorization processes and making changes to competitive bidding for infant formula and foods. The proposal included transitioning to EBT by October 1, 2020, with discretionary funding for implementation. CBO's cost estimates for the committees' child nutrition reauthorization proposals were published on March 11, 2016, and June 30, 2016, respectively. The House committee's proposal for changes to the WIC program was cost estimated by CBO, showing an increase in the deficit over 5 and 10 years. The cost estimates were based on different budget windows and baselines, limiting direct comparisons. More details can be found in CBO's cost estimates. CBO estimated that changes to various child nutrition programs would impact direct spending over 10 years, with reductions in some areas and increases in others. These changes include modifications to school meals' application verification requirements, discretionary funding for school meals equipment grants, summer meals provision, Farm to School Grant Program funding, and CACFP adjustments, totaling approximately $1.1 billion over FY2016-FY2025. The proposed changes to child nutrition programs, including adjustments to CACFP, were estimated to increase direct spending by $445 million. Committee leadership aimed to make the proposal cost-neutral. CBO projected a deficit reduction of $131 million over 5 years and $67 million over 10 years. Certain policies like the block grant demonstration project were not expected to impact direct spending. Increases to the CEP participation threshold would result in fewer schools and students participating in the program. The House committee's proposal includes changes to school meals' application verification requirements, discretionary funding for school meals equipment grants, and the provision of summer meals. These changes would result in a reduction of direct spending by $261 million, an increase in participation in school meals programs by $42 million, and an increase in direct spending by $929 million, respectively. Additionally, increases to the Farm to School Grant Program's mandatory funding would also increase direct spending. The House committee's proposal would increase direct spending by $49 million for the Farm to School Grant Program and reduce direct spending by $33 million for changes to CACFP. For discretionary programs, the proposal would cost $29.8 billion over five years, mainly due to the reauthorization of WIC and WIC FMNP programs."
