    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Emergency China Trade Act of 2010\" and includes findings related to the trade relationship with China. Congress finds that the US and China are major economies with significant trade imbalances due to China's trade policy violations. China's failure to comply with international trade obligations threatens global economic stability. The People's Republic of China has failed to comply with international trade obligations by maintaining control over Chinese enterprises, facilitating unfair coproduction agreements, and undervaluing its currency by up to 40 percent. Congress believes that the persistent trade deficit with China is harmful to the US economy and should be corrected through negotiations to eliminate the deficit within 4 years. Additionally, there is a call for the withdrawal of normal trade relations treatment from China. Upon the expiration of the 6-month period after the enactment of this Act, normal trade relations treatment will not apply to products from China, and the column 2 rate of duty under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States will apply to Chinese products. This is in line with the goal of achieving balanced trade relations with China. Upon enactment of this Act, the President must negotiate a trade relationship with China to achieve balanced trade within four years. Subsequently, implementing legislation must be submitted to Congress for expedited consideration. Upon enactment of this Act, implementing legislation submitted to Congress for expedited consideration. In the House of Representatives, a motion to proceed to the consideration of such legislation is highly privileged. In the Senate, the legislation shall be considered in accordance with specific provisions. Upon enactment of implementing legislation, a certain section shall cease to be effective. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term ``balanced trade'' in this Act refers to equal value of goods exported from the United States to China and imported from China to the United States."
