    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Child Labor Elimination Act of 1996\". The Congress recognizes the right of children to be protected from economic exploitation and hazardous work, as stated in international conventions. The Minimum Age Convention sets the minimum age for employment at completion of compulsory schooling or 15 years. The Forced Labor Convention prohibits forced or compulsory labor. The Forced Labor Convention prohibits most forms of forced labor, including that of individuals under 18 years old. Child labor is a widespread issue, with an estimated 100-200 million child workers globally, mostly in developing countries. In 1995, around 13.2% of 10-14 year olds were economically active, and there are significant numbers of child workers under 10 years old. Reliable statistics on child labor are scarce due to reluctance from governments in documenting these activities. Many children in developing countries are forced into debt-bonded and slave labor in hazardous industries, violating international standards and domestic laws. Tens of millions of child slaves are involved in various exploitative industries such as agriculture, domestic labor, the sex industry, and brick making. Child labor is a complex issue tied to poverty, education, and culture. It often denies children basic education and adults gainful employment. The most abusive forms violate human rights and must be eradicated. Identification of foreign countries and industries that use child labor in producing goods. The Secretary of Labor will identify countries and industries that allow child labor or do not effectively enforce laws against it. Sanctions will be imposed on these countries and industries as per sections 4 and 5. Exemption from import and financing prohibitions can be granted to a business entity if it can prove to the Secretary of Labor that none of its goods are produced using child labor. SEC. 4 prohibits the entry of manufactured articles from industries identified under section 3(a), with exceptions for certain cases. SEC. 5 prohibits assistance to foreign countries using child labor in producing goods. The President is prohibited from providing US assistance to foreign countries or industries identified by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of the Treasury must oppose any financial institution loans to these entities. However, assistance may be given if it is deemed vital to the national interest. The President must certify that providing assistance to a foreign country or industry is in the vital national interest of the United States. This certification must include a description of the national interest at risk if assistance is not provided and a comparison of the risks involved. SEC. 6. PENALTIES. Any unlawful act related to entering prohibited manufactured articles or violating regulations prescribed under specific sections incurs civil and criminal penalties. Civil penalties can reach $25,000, while intentional unlawful acts can lead to fines between $10,000 and $35,000, imprisonment up to 1 year, or both. These violations are treated as customs law violations under the Tariff Act of 1930. The Tariff Act of 1930 includes enforcement provisions such as search, seizure, forfeiture, penalties for entry by fraud, negligence, and compensation to informers. The President will issue regulations to implement the Act. $10,000,000 is authorized for U.S. support to the International Labor Organization for child labor elimination from 1997 to 2001. Definitions are provided. Child labor, as defined in this Act, includes services performed by individuals below the age of compulsory schooling or 15, and services by those under 18 that could harm their health, safety, or moral character, in exchange for remuneration or goods. The term \"business entity\" refers to any entity involved in the production of manufactured goods. Foreign country refers to any foreign country, possession, or territory administered separately for customs purposes. International financial institution includes various organizations like the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a \"manufactured article\" and \"United States assistance\" within the context of international financial institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The curr_chunk defines \"United States assistance\" as aid under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, excluding disaster relief, food or medicine provision, and refugee assistance, as well as sales or financing under the Arms Export Control Act and the provision of agricultural commodities. The term \"United States assistance to a foreign country\" includes aid, sales, financing, or other assistance for programs, projects, business ventures, or activities in the foreign country, excluding disaster relief, food or medicine provision, and refugee assistance."
