It is the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths, covering nearly all workers and employers in the US. Each state (except Texas) has a mandatory workers' compensation system, with over 135 million workers covered in 2015. Covered workers receive full medical coverage, cash benefits for lost wages, and benefits for surviving family members. Employers are responsible for providing these benefits. Workers' compensation provides benefits to workers for injuries, illnesses, and deaths without fault. Employers are responsible for providing these benefits, and most states have mandatory workers' compensation systems. There is no federal mandate for states to have workers' compensation, and it is often seen as a compromise between workers and employers. Employees are prohibited from suing employers for workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths, with workers' compensation as the exclusive remedy. Employers must pay defined benefits regardless of fault, liability, or defense, and can purchase insurance for financial risks. Before workers' compensation laws, civil courts were the only avenue for disputes over employment-related injuries, with the burden of proof on the employee to show employer negligence. The burden of proof in negligence cases falls on the employee to show employer negligence in failing to provide due care to prevent workplace injuries. Employers demonstrate due care by hiring suitable workers, enforcing safety rules, providing a safe workplace and equipment, and giving warnings about potential dangers. Employers only need to show due care if the costs are less than expected accident costs, calculated using the Hand Formula. The Hand Formula, named after Judge Learned Hand, states that employers have a duty to prevent accidents only if the costs of prevention are less than the expected costs of the accident. This contrasts with the OSH Act's general duty clause, which requires employers to provide a safe workplace regardless of costs. Workers' compensation holds employers responsible for compensating injured workers regardless of fault. Under workers' compensation, the employer is always responsible for providing compensation to the injured worker, regardless of fault or circumstance. Prior to workers' compensation, employees had to overcome three defenses under common law: assumption of risk, fellow-servant, and contributory negligence. The workers' compensation system was created to provide compensation to injured workers, regardless of fault. It was driven by a consensus among employers, workers, and insurers to reduce uncertainty and limit employer defenses in work-accident cases. This system allowed employers to predict costs through the purchase of workers' compensation insurance. The creation of workers' compensation allowed employers to predict costs and shift some expenses to employees. For workers, it eliminated the need to navigate common law for compensation, providing a social safety net for those without private disability insurance or other protections. The enactment of workers' compensation laws in the early 20th century provided a safety net for workers who were not covered by unemployment insurance or Social Security Disability Insurance. This mandatory insurance system shifted costs from employers to employees, resulting in increased customers and total premiums for insurers. The system was preferred by employers, workers, and insurers over the previous tort system. The grand bargain of workers' compensation required legislation instead of voluntary contracts between employers and workers. Before workers' compensation, some employers offered ex post contracts where workers could accept benefits from a relief fund in exchange for giving up future claims against the employer for a work injury. However, these contracts were not an effective substitute for the tort system as workers could still refuse relief fund payments and pursue civil litigation against their employers. Before workers' compensation, employers offered ex post contracts where workers could accept benefits in exchange for giving up future claims. However, these contracts were ineffective, leading to the prohibition of ex ante contracts in many states by 1909. Workers and unions lobbied for workers' compensation laws, believing it would give them more leverage in negotiating benefits. The first workers' compensation law in the US, enacted in 1882, covered selected federal employees. The 1882 federal workers' compensation law in the United States provided up to two years of salary to disabled members of the United States Life Saving Service and their survivors in case of a line of duty death. In 1908, a more comprehensive workers' compensation law was passed for federal employees in hazardous occupations, offering up to one year of salary for disability and death benefits. However, these laws did not cover all federal employees, with only about one-fourth of the workforce being included in the 1908 law. President Theodore Roosevelt recognized the limitations of the 1908 federal workers' compensation law, which only covered a small portion of the workforce in hazardous jobs. He called for a comprehensive bill to cover all government employees, stating the lack of such a law was a national embarrassment. The 1882 and 1908 laws did not provide medical benefits for disabled workers, and the 1908 law only applied to injuries, not illnesses. Maryland enacted the first limited state workers' compensation law in 1902, covering miners, steam and street railway workers. In 1902, Maryland passed a workers' compensation law that covered miners, steam and street railway workers, and workers on municipal public works projects. However, the law was later deemed unconstitutional. New York then enacted the first comprehensive state workers' compensation laws in 1910, offering both elective and compulsory systems for employers. The compulsory system was challenged in court and ultimately led to an amendment to the state constitution allowing for a compulsory workers' compensation law. In 1913, a compulsory workers' compensation law was enacted, leading to all states having a workers' compensation system by 1948. Except for Texas, every state implemented a compulsory system after early laws allowed for a mix of elective and compulsory systems. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld compulsory state workers' compensation laws in 1917, and the federal government has since left jurisdiction over workers' compensation policy to the states. Today, the federal government administers two comprehensive workers' compensation programs and two limited benefit programs for selected industries. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) into law on September 7, 1916, extending workers' compensation benefits to federal civilian employees and certain other groups. The Department of Labor administers the program, with each beneficiary's host agency covering benefit costs. Administrative costs are funded by general revenue. The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) was enacted in 1927 to provide federal workers' compensation for maritime workers. It was preceded by a Supreme Court ruling in 1917 that state workers' compensation for maritime workers was unconstitutional. The LHWCA has been extended to cover other private-sector workers. The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) was enacted in 1927 to provide federal workers' compensation for maritime workers. Coverage was extended to various groups over the years, including employees of the District of Columbia, overseas military and public works contractors, civilian employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities of the Armed Forces, and workers on the Outer Continental Shelf. Covered employers must purchase workers' compensation insurance or self-insure, and provide benefits according to the LHWCA statute and regulations. Black lung benefits, established in 1969 under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, provide cash and medical benefits to coal miners disabled by Black Lung Disease. Claims filed before 1972 are paid by the federal government, while other claims are covered by coal operators or the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. States can opt out if they offer equivalent benefits, but currently, no state has done so. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) provides cash and medical benefits to workers involved in atomic weapons development. Administered by DOL, costs are covered by general revenue. Part B offers benefits to DOE employees, atomic weapons industry workers with specified cancers, beryllium workers, and uranium miners under RECA. Part D initially authorized DOE assistance. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) replaced Part D of EEOICPA in 2004, providing cash and medical benefits to former DOE contractor employees with illnesses caused by occupational exposure to toxic substances. Workers' compensation systems in the US vary by state and federal programs, with common elements but caution needed when making generalizations. Workers' compensation is the exclusive remedy for workers and their families for covered injuries, illnesses, and deaths. They cannot sue their employers for additional costs or punitive damages. However, they can sue third parties responsible for their injuries, with the employer having a right of subrogation. Some cases can be appealed to state courts, and some workers may still sue their employers for injuries caused by them. Some workers sue employers for intentional torts exempt from workers' compensation. Railroad workers are covered by FELA, ship crew by the Jones Act. Employers finance workers' comp through insurance premiums regulated by states. Premiums are affected by risk. Premiums for workers' compensation insurance are regulated by states and are influenced by the risk associated with the job and the employer's past claims history. Experience rating can incentivize employers to prioritize safety practices. Four types of insurance arrangements are used, including state funds and private insurance. Twenty-two states have state insurance funds for workers' compensation. In states with exclusive state funds, only state workers' compensation insurance is available. In competitive state fund states, employers can choose between state funds and private insurers. In states without state funds, workers' compensation is provided by private insurers regulated by the states. Private insurers can refuse coverage to high-risk employers. In states where private insurers consider an employer too risky, they may be denied coverage, leading to potential difficulties in obtaining workers' compensation insurance. States may assign high-risk employers to insurers based on market share or provide coverage through a state-managed assigned-risk pool. Most states allow financially stable employers to self-insure for workers' compensation, where they set aside funds to cover benefits. Self-insured employers must meet state approval and may need to post bonds for future benefit payments. In states with workers' compensation, the market is not truly open as benefits and premiums are regulated by the state. Exclusive state funds in some states create a monopoly position, potentially offering cost savings due to their nonprofit status. Exclusive state funds in some states have a monopoly position due to their nonprofit status, resulting in potential cost savings. Employers may choose insurers based on additional services offered, such as worker-safety programs. Second injury funds (SIFs) pay the difference between partial and total disability benefits for workers partially disabled before employment, funded through assessments on insurers and self-insured employers. The goal of SIFs is to reduce workers' compensation risk for hiring persons with disabilities. The workers' compensation risk associated with hiring persons with disabilities can be reduced by second injury funds (SIFs), which pay total disability benefits for workers with pre-existing disabilities. Some states have abolished their SIFs, with New York establishing the first SIF in 1916. The Nease decision led to controversy over total disability benefits for workers with pre-existing disabilities. SIFs gained attention post-World War II to encourage hiring veterans with disabilities. Some argue SIFs are no longer necessary due to the ADA. The curr_chunk discusses the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the arguments against Second Injury Funds (SIFs) in workers' compensation systems. It highlights the entitlement of covered workers to medical care, disability benefits, and survivor benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses. Exceptions exist for cases involving employee intoxication. Workers' compensation systems have statutes of limitations for filing claims after an injury, illness, or death. This can complicate benefit applications for occupational illnesses, especially if the statute of limitation starts at the time of exposure. Injured workers are entitled to medical benefits under workers' compensation laws for covered injuries. Workers' compensation provides medical coverage for covered injuries or illnesses without any cost sharing for workers. Employers and insurers face challenges in controlling costs and ensuring medically necessary care. One strategy is to allow greater control over who provides medical care to beneficiaries. Systems differ in how medical care is provided to covered workers. Workers' compensation systems vary in how medical care is provided to covered workers. Some systems give workers control over choosing medical providers, while others give employers more influence in selecting providers. State workers' compensation systems may use pharmacy benefit managers to control prescription drug costs. Workers' compensation is the primary payer for work-related medical expenses, not private health insurance or government programs like Medicaid or Medicare. In workers' compensation settlements, a portion may need to be set aside for future medical expenses reimbursable to Medicare. Rising prescription drug prices have been a significant factor in driving up medical costs in workers' compensation systems. Compound drug use has notably increased costs for programs like the USPS FECA, with compound drugs accounting for a significant portion of prescriptions and costs. In 2015, compound drugs accounted for 34% of USPS FECA prescriptions and 53% of prescription costs. Factors driving prescription drug utilization include physician dispensing, drug repacking, and opioid painkiller prevalence. States are controlling costs by contracting with PBMs, regulating physician dispensing, using formularies, requiring pre-authorization, and capping reimbursements. Workers' compensation provides cash benefits for workplace injuries and illnesses, replacing a portion of lost wages. Cash benefits in workers' compensation are designed to replace a portion of lost wages for disabled or deceased workers. These benefits are not considered taxable income and serve as a deterrent for workers to replace work with benefits. There is usually a waiting period before benefits start, which helps filter out minor injuries from the system. Benefits for this waiting period are retroactively paid for long-term disabilities. Disability benefits under workers' compensation are paid for long-term or permanent disabilities when a covered worker is unable to work at full capacity due to an employment-related injury or illness. Total disability benefits are typically two-thirds of the employee's pre-disability wage, subject to minimum and maximum levels based on state average wages. Partial disability benefits are paid as a percentage of the total disability rate corresponding to the worker's partial earning capacity. If a worker is injured and can only work half-time, their benefit would be one-third of their pre-disability wage. The assessment of work capacity is done using the AMA Guides. Permanent disability benefits are paid when the worker's condition won't improve enough to return to full earning capacity. Temporary benefits are paid until permanence is determined. Scheduled Awards are given for certain permanent partial disabilities, like limb loss, based on a set schedule of benefits. Under FECA, permanent disability benefits are paid based on a schedule of benefits established by statute or regulation. Scheduled benefits for permanent partial disabilities are generally paid regardless of the beneficiary's ability to work at full capacity. ProPublica's 2015 report on workers' compensation highlighted significant differences in maximum benefits for permanent partial disabilities across states, with the national average maximum benefit for the loss of an arm being $169,878 in 2015. The national average maximum benefit for the loss of an arm in 2015 was $169,878, with maximum scheduled benefits ranging from $48,840 in Alabama to $859,634 in Nevada. The differences in benefits are due to the decentralized nature of workers' compensation systems run by states without federal mandates. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama proposed changing permanent-partial benefits under the FECA program to lump-sum payments for all workers regardless of pre-disability wages. Workers may receive disability benefits from both workers' compensation and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), but the total amount cannot exceed 80% of the worker's pre-disability wage. States with approved reverse offset plans can offset workers' compensation benefits to reach the 80% threshold, while in other states and federal programs, SSDI benefits are offset when total benefits exceed the threshold. A reduction in workers' compensation benefits could lead to an increase in SSDI benefits in states that offset SSDI. This shift in costs from workers' compensation to Social Security may occur due to policy changes making it harder to receive workers' compensation benefits or less attractive for injured workers. This could result in workers turning to other social programs like Unemployment Insurance, SSDI, SSI, Medicare, or Medicaid for income replacement. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that workers' compensation only covers 21% of workplace injury costs, with federal programs like SSDI covering 11%. However, a study cited by OSHA only looked at cases from 2007 and did not consider cost-shifting due to changes in workers' compensation benefits and policies. Workers' compensation does not cover indirect costs associated with work injuries, such as home production activities. Benefit duration varies among states, with some capping benefits by age or total amount received. Proponents of limiting benefits argue that the system is meant to replace lost wages, not support retirement. Some argue that workers' compensation benefits should not be limited as workers may not have other sources of income in retirement. Presidents Bush and Obama proposed reducing benefits at retirement age to encourage older beneficiaries to opt for federal pension benefits. Compromise and release settlements are not allowed under FECA, unlike state workers' compensation systems. Compromise and release settlements in workers' compensation involve the insurer providing a lump-sum payment or structured series of payments to the beneficiary in exchange for forfeiting any future claims. Once approved, the worker is no longer entitled to benefits, even if their condition changes. These settlements can resolve disputed claims outside of the adjudication process or courts, similar to settling civil tort cases out of court. Compromise and release settlements in workers' compensation involve insurers providing a lump-sum payment or structured payments to beneficiaries in exchange for forfeiting future claims. This resolves disputes outside of the adjudication process, similar to civil tort cases settling out of court. Insurers may have an advantage in negotiations, potentially leaving workers worse off than if they continued with the normal claims process. Administrative challenges can arise with SSDI offsets and Medicare set-asides. The SSA prorates lump-sum settlements for workers' compensation and SSDI benefits based on pre-disability wages. Medicare is the secondary payer for work-related medical expenses, but workers may improperly use it if future medical expenses are not accounted for in a compromise and release settlement. CMS recommends establishing a Workers' Compensation Medicare Set-aside Arrangement (WCMSA) to allocate funds for future medical costs. Workers' compensation benefits are available to survivors if a worker dies due to a work-related injury or illness. These benefits are meant to replace the worker's lost income and are generally paid to the spouse and dependent children. Benefits cease if the spouse remarries or children reach adulthood. If there are no surviving dependents, benefits are not paid out. Workers' compensation systems provide a burial benefit for covered deaths, which is a lump-sum payment to help with funeral expenses. This benefit is paid regardless of whether the worker has dependents. The goal of workers' compensation is to return the worker to employment, so vocational rehabilitation services are offered to assist with this transition. Participation in vocational rehabilitation is voluntary, but returning to work, even at a reduced capacity, may be required if the worker's condition allows. Partial disability benefits are provided if the worker can only partially return to work. Employers are not obligated to keep a job open during workers' compensation, but FMLA and ADA protections may apply. Employers are generally responsible for the direct costs of workers' compensation benefits. Employers, not workers or the government, are responsible for workers' compensation benefits. Workers do not directly pay for their benefits, but may indirectly through lower wages. Employers may have deductibles before benefits are paid. Workers with long-term disabilities may face lost opportunities for wage growth or promotions. In 2015, workers' compensation costs for employers were $94.8 billion, significantly lower than in 1980. The federal government has no formal oversight of state workers' compensation programs. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 established OSHA within the Department of Labor to enforce safety standards. The general duty clause requires employers to provide a safe workplace free from recognized hazards. This reinforces the idea that employers are responsible for their employees' injuries, illnesses, and deaths. The OSH Act holds employers accountable for their employees' injuries, illnesses, and deaths. It established the National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws to assess state workers' compensation systems. Congress justified this by emphasizing the importance of workers' economic security and the need for a fair and effective compensation system. The National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws was established to evaluate the fairness and adequacy of current workers' compensation laws in light of economic growth, changes in the labor force, medical advancements, new technology risks, and wage increases. The Commission consisted of 15 members appointed by the President from various sectors. It focused on assessing state workers' compensation systems, including benefit levels, medical benefits, rehabilitation, and administrative provisions. The final report was submitted to the President and Congress on July 31, 1972. The National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws submitted its final report to the President and Congress on July 31, 1972, with 84 recommendations for modern workers' compensation systems. Eight essential recommendations included compulsory coverage, no exemptions, full coverage of occupational illnesses, and comprehensive medical care and rehabilitation services. The final report by the National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws in 1972 included recommendations for modern workers' compensation systems, such as compulsory coverage, full coverage of occupational illnesses, and comprehensive medical care and rehabilitation services. Additionally, it proposed temporary total disability benefits, survivors benefits, and permanent total disability benefits for workers with permanent impairments. The National Commission recommended modern workers' compensation systems with temporary total disability benefits, survivors benefits, and permanent total disability benefits for workers with impairments. It called for federal legislation mandating minimum standards for state workers' compensation and enforcement through lawsuits against non-compliant employers. In 1973, bills introduced by Senators and Representatives aimed to establish minimum standards for state workers' compensation systems, giving the federal government authority to regulate non-compliant states. The standards included compulsory coverage for all employees and coverage for occupational illnesses. The proposed standards for state workers' compensation systems include coverage equivalent to federal black lung benefits, no limits on disability or medical benefits, disability benefits at two-thirds of pre-disability wage, survivors benefits for spouses and children, a short waiting period for benefits, maintenance of a SIF, reconsideration of benefit denials, and the right for workers to choose their initial benefits. The proposed federal standards for state workers' compensation systems include worker's right to choose initial treating physician, three-year statute of limitation on claims, state regulation of attorney's fees, approval of compromise settlements by state agency, evaluation of state compliance every three years, and measures to ensure benefit payment in case of insolvency. The Williams-Javits legislation proposed federal standards for state workers' compensation systems. States would be evaluated for compliance, with the Department of Labor overseeing non-compliant states. The bill included grants for compliance assistance and the creation of a federal advisory board. Despite the legislation not becoming law, states were free to decide on adopting policy changes to align with National Commission recommendations, leading to expanded state workers' compensation programs. The Council on State Governments proposed a model workers' compensation act based on the National Commission's recommendations. State compliance with the recommendations increased over the years, with average cash benefits exceeding 50% of the model act by 1979. By that year, 28 states had adopted the recommendation for the maximum weekly benefit for temporary total disability to be at least 100% of the state's average weekly wage. In 1979, 28 states had adopted the recommendation for the maximum weekly benefit for temporary total disability to be at least 100% of the state's average weekly wage. Some workers' compensation benefits were later reduced in the 1990s as part of state reform efforts, including benefit levels, eligibility, and the implementation of managed care systems. In 2015, a group of Democratic and Independent Senators and Representatives raised concerns about state workers' compensation systems. The Senate and House committees urged the Department of Labor to increase oversight of state workers' compensation programs, citing the agency's decision to stop publishing state laws on workers' compensation. This decision was made in 2006 due to budget constraints, leaving no official government compilation of state laws. The Monthly Labor Review used to publish a summary of changes to state workers' compensation laws annually until 2005. Workers' compensation is compulsory for employers in all states except Texas, where it is noncompulsory. Self-insurance for workers' compensation is part of most states' systems, except for North Dakota and Wyoming. Employers in Texas have the option to opt-out of workers' compensation. In Texas, employers can opt-out of the workers' compensation system, becoming \"nonsubscribers.\" About 22% of Texas employers are nonsubscribers, covering 18% of employees. Nonsubscribers can create their own benefit plans instead of workers' compensation, with 23% having such plans covering 72% of employees. However, nonsubscribers lose protection from lawsuits for work-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths. Oklahoma also enacted a new workers' compensation statute in 2013. The Employee Injury Benefit Act in Oklahoma allowed employers to opt-out of the state workers' compensation system by providing an approved alternative benefit plan, retaining protection from lawsuits for work-related injuries. Proponents argued that this system provided flexibility for employers to create tailored benefit plans, with workers having a role in negotiating these plans. Before the development of workers' compensation, contracts were signed between employers and workers, but these were generally rejected in favor of legislation by workers and unions. Advocates believed that competition and flexibility would lead to cost savings in Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in Vasquez v. Dillard's that the Employee Injury Benefit Act violated the state's constitution. Lawmakers introduced noncompulsory workers' compensation systems in South Carolina and Tennessee in 2015, but these bills have not been enacted. Prior to the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling in Vasquez, an employee covered by an alternative benefit plan in Oklahoma could appeal to the plan's review committee. If dissatisfied, the employee could appeal to the Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Commission or the U.S. District Court. ERISA exempts plans maintained for workmen's compensation laws or unemployment. No legislation similar to SB1062 has been enacted in any state. It has been argued that alternative benefit plans established under the Oklahoma Employee Injury Benefit Act may not be exempt from ERISA jurisdiction. ERISA allows civil actions by plan participants to recover benefits, with the possibility of cases being moved from state to federal courts. This could result in appeals of benefit denials being heard in federal court rather than before the Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Commission. Appeals of benefit denials under alternative benefit plans established in Oklahoma may be moved to federal court instead of the Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Commission. Concerns have been raised about the limited scope of ERISA appeals in federal court, which may bring uncertainty to workers' compensation appeals. The employer's alternative benefit plan was ruled to be governed by ERISA, but this does not allow employers to bypass state law. Workers' compensation has been a longstanding system in the US, providing no-fault benefits to workers. However, challenges arise from the conflicting interests of employers and workers. Some in Congress are concerned about the lack of federal oversight leading to negative changes in state policies affecting workers. In 2013, Oklahoma allowed employers to opt out of workers' compensation by offering alternative benefit plans. Advocates believe this brings flexibility and empowers workers, while critics fear it may not adequately protect workers' rights. The state's Supreme Court deemed the legislation unconstitutional. The Oklahoma legislation allowing employers to opt out of workers' compensation was ruled unconstitutional by the state's Supreme Court. Efforts to adopt similar changes in other states have been unsuccessful, making compulsory coverage a key issue as workers' compensation progresses into its second century."
