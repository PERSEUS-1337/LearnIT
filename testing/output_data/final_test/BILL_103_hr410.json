The Act establishes procedures to ensure that the Federal Government covers the additional direct costs incurred by State and local governments in complying with intergovernmental regulations. The \"Intergovernmental Mandate Relief Act of 1993\" addresses federal regulations on State and local governments, ensuring the Federal Government covers additional costs incurred by them in complying with regulations. The Act defines terms such as \"additional direct costs,\" \"Director,\" and \"Federal agency\" for clarity and consistency in implementing regulations on State and local governments. The Act defines terms related to federal assistance, intergovernmental regulation, and executive agencies. The Act defines terms related to federal assistance, intergovernmental regulation, and executive agencies. It specifies that \"significant law\" refers to any Federal law likely to result in total additional direct costs of $25,000,000 or more to all State and local governments in a fiscal year. It also defines \"State\" to include several entities such as the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. The Act defines terms related to federal assistance and intergovernmental regulation, including compensation of state and local governments for additional direct costs. Sec. 4 prohibits Federal agencies or US courts from mandating State or local governments to comply with new intergovernmental regulations unless funds are provided to cover the additional costs. However, under certain circumstances, State and local governments may still be required to comply with such regulations. Intergovernmental regulations can be in effect during a fiscal year if a joint resolution is enacted by a two-thirds vote of Congress. The resolution waives the requirement for funds to reimburse State and local governments for additional costs incurred in complying with the regulation. For intergovernmental regulations, the total additional direct costs incurred by State and local governments in complying with the regulation for a fiscal year will be the estimated amount reported by the Director in the required annual report. The report by the director contains the estimated amount of additional direct costs incurred by State and local governments in complying with intergovernmental regulations for a fiscal year. The Director prepares and transmits a report to the President and Congress for each fiscal year with estimates of additional direct costs incurred by State and local governments in complying with intergovernmental regulations. The Director prepares and transmits a report to the President and Congress each fiscal year with estimates of additional direct costs incurred by State and local governments in complying with intergovernmental regulations. The report includes the total amount of additional direct costs incurred by all local governments in a State compared to the government of that State in complying with regulations. The Director must submit each report by September 1 of the fiscal year preceding it. Legislative action required. Sec. 6 requires the chairman of relevant committees to propose funding amendments to reimburse State and local governments for costs incurred due to intergovernmental regulations. This does not apply if a joint resolution has been enacted. The chairman of relevant committees proposes funding amendments for reimbursement of State and local governments for costs incurred due to intergovernmental regulations. Sec. 7 of the proposed legislation requires Federal agencies to reimburse State and local governments for additional direct costs incurred in complying with intergovernmental regulations. State governments receiving payments must in turn reimburse local governments for their costs. The total reimbursement amount to be paid to a State for additional direct costs incurred by the government and local governments in complying with intergovernmental regulations in a fiscal year is determined based on the ratio of total costs incurred by all State and local governments to the total costs specified in the report submitted by the Director. The total reimbursement amount paid by a State government to local governments for additional direct costs incurred in complying with intergovernmental regulations is determined based on the ratio specified by the Director in the report submitted for that fiscal year. The State government reimburses local governments for direct costs incurred in complying with intergovernmental regulations based on a ratio determined by the Director in the report for that fiscal year. The State government reimburses local governments for direct costs incurred in complying with intergovernmental regulations. The estimation of additional direct costs by each local government must be reasonably related to the actual costs incurred. This section does not apply if a joint resolution has been enacted for the intergovernmental regulation in effect during a fiscal year. Sec 8 states that no law enacted after this Act can override it unless specifically stated. Sec 9 amends a section of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974."
