Developers receive credits through a competitive process, reducing their financing costs and expanding affordable housing supply. LIHTC costs the government around $9.9 billion annually, with 9% credits for new construction and 4% credits for rehabilitation projects. The low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) was established in 1986 to incentivize affordable rental housing development. Developers receive credits through a competitive process, reducing their financing costs and expanding affordable housing supply. The 4% credit is typically used for rehabilitation projects and new construction financed with tax-exempt bonds, while the 9% credit is for new construction. The credit rates fluctuate based on market interest movements, delivering a subsidy equal to 30% of the project's qualified basis for the 4% credit and 70% for the 9% credit. The subsidy levels are explicitly specified in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), not the credit rates. The 4% rate has ranged between 3.15% and 3.97% since 1986, and the 9% credit between 7.35% and 9.27% since 2008, with a floor under the 9% credit. Since 2008, there has been a floor under the 9% credit for new construction in the LIHTC program. This subsidy is intended to incentivize affordable housing development by providing a stream of tax credits equal to 70% of the project's qualified basis. The subsidy aims to make affordable housing financially feasible and attractive compared to other investments. The LIHTC program provides a subsidy for affordable housing development through tax credits. Developers can receive $40,000 per year for 10 years, totaling $400,000. The allocation process is complex, starting at the federal level and ending with developers selling credits to investors for equity. States receive an annual LIHTC allocation based on population. The LIHTC program provides a subsidy for affordable housing development through tax credits. States received an increased LIHTC allocation in 2019 due to the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. State Housing Finance Agencies allocate credits to developers based on Qualified Allocation Plans. Priority is given to projects serving low-income households and remaining affordable for a long period. The LIHTC program provides tax credits to developers for affordable housing projects. Developers apply for credits through state agencies, with various types of developers eligible. An allocation does not guarantee all credits will be claimed, and developers have time to complete their projects. Unused credits are added to a national pool and redistributed to states. States must allocate all previous credits to be eligible for excess credit allocation. To be eligible for an excess credit allocation, a state must have allocated its entire previous allotment of tax credits, giving states an incentive to allocate all credits to developers. Properties seeking LIHTC allocation must meet tests restricting rent and tenant income. Project owners must choose between a 20-50 test or a 40-60 test for income levels, with specific requirements for occupancy based on income percentages. The 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act added an income averaging option for low-income housing projects, allowing owners to average the income of tenants. This option requires at least 40% of units to be occupied by tenants with an average income of no greater than 60% of the area's median gross income, with no individual tenant exceeding 80% of AMI. Additionally, projects must meet a \"gross rents test\" to ensure rents do not exceed 30% of the elected 50% or 60% of area median gross income. Eligibility for LIHTC is based on meeting these income and rent requirements. The LIHTC program offers tax credits for eligible projects like apartment buildings, single-family dwellings, and townhouses. Projects can serve families or special needs populations, with enhanced credits available for difficult development areas. HERA allows HFAs to classify certain projects as difficult to develop, increasing available credits by up to 30%. The LIHTC program offers tax credits for eligible projects like apartment buildings, single-family dwellings, and townhouses. HFAs can classify projects as difficult to develop, making them eligible for enhanced credits. Developers exchange tax credits for equity, with for-profit developers using them for financing or selling them to investors. Nonprofit developers sell tax credits, which are claimed by investors after the real estate development is complete. Trading or selling tax credits involves exchanging them for equity investment in real estate projects. Investors provide equity for real estate projects in exchange for tax credits. The developer acts as the general partner with minimal ownership but manages the project, while investors act as limited partners with a passive role. Syndicators oversee transactions and charge fees. Investors rely on tax credits to offset income tax liabilities rather than expecting income from the project. Investors rely on tax credits to offset income tax liabilities. The return on investment is determined by the market price of the tax credits, which typically range from the mid-$0.80s to low-$0.90s per $1.00 tax credit. The larger the difference between the market price and face value, the higher the return. Tax benefits can also be received from tax losses generated through operating costs, interest on debt, and deductions like depreciation. The type of tax credit investor has evolved over time, with public partnerships initially dominating but diminishing profit margins driving some syndicators out of the retail investment market. Profit margins have driven some syndicators out of the retail investment market. The majority of tax credit investors come from corporations, motivated by different reasons such as the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) or seeking a rate of return on investment. Tax sheltering is also a common purpose for investing in tax credits. LIHTC finances part of project costs and must be combined with other resources like conventional mortgage loans. The LIHTC program can be used with conventional mortgage loans, alternative financing, and grants from public or private sources. States also provide financing, including state tax credits. Some LIHTC projects may have tenants receiving government subsidies. Recent changes in the federal tax system have raised concerns about a potential decrease in demand for LIHTCs. The 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act made two changes to the LIHTC program. The 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 115-141) made two key changes to the LIHTC program. It allowed for income averaging across tenants and increased the annual credits available to states by 12.5% for 2018-2021. These changes aimed to address concerns about the impact of the 2017 tax revision on LIHTC development. However, the long-term effects on affordable housing supply remain uncertain."
