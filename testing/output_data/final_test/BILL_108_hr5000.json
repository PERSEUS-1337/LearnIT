    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Radioprotectant Procurement Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to radioprotectants. Congress finds that the threat of a radiological or nuclear attack on the American people is significant due to the potential for mass casualties, injuries, and economic devastation. The proliferation of nuclear weapons technology worldwide poses a grave threat to the United States and its allies. Even a basic radiological weapon could cause death, radiation sickness, panic, and economic hardship if detonated in a populated area. A nuclear weapon detonated in a large urban center would cause widespread death, sickness, and economic damage. For example, a 12.5 kiloton nuclear bomb in New York City would result in 50,000 immediate deaths, 200,000 short-term deaths from radiation, and 700,000 cases of radiation sickness. There are 103 nuclear power plants in the United States, each with the potential for high radiation exposure in case of an attack. To effectively treat those exposed to radiation, a large procurement of radioprotectants is needed in various regions of the country to quickly treat hundreds of thousands or potentially millions of Americans. Federal procurement of an effective radioprotectant should be comparable to stockpiles of other supplies. Effective radioprotectants are crucial for treating radiation exposure, as current options like potassium iodide only protect against thyroid cancer. Medical countermeasures for both acute and long-term radiation exposure are being developed, with promising compounds showing efficacy in preventing radiation sickness. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 emphasizes the need for resources to develop and procure effective radioprotectants to prevent radiation sickness and death from acute exposure. Congress intends for the development of radiological and nuclear countermeasures to receive full consideration and resources. SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002. Section 304 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to include a subsection for the development and procurement of radiation medical countermeasures. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Defense are authorized to use necessary funds for this purpose, including those appropriated by Congress under specific headings related to public health and biodefense. SEC. 4. REPORT REGARDING EFFECTIVE RADIOPROTECTANTS; DEVELOPMENT AND PROCUREMENT. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other departments, must submit a report to Congress within 120 days regarding the threat of a nuclear or radiological attack and the availability of radioprotectant medical countermeasures. If effective radioprotectants are identified, they must be developed and procured within 90 days of the report submission. The Secretary must enter into agreements with private companies for the development and procurement of radioprotectants within 90 days of submitting a report to Congress on the threat of a nuclear or radiological attack. The agreements must ensure adequate protection for the people of the United States, including response to a multi-location attack scenario if deemed plausible. The Secretary can use specific authorities for development and procurement of radioprotectants in agreements with private companies. Additional conditions may be included as deemed appropriate. The Secretary can use specific authorities for development and procurement of radioprotectants in agreements with private companies, with conditions such as FDA approval and assumption of development costs by the producing companies."
