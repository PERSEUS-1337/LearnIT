    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Native Contract and Rate Expenditure Act of 2014\" or the \"Native CARE Act of 2014\". Congress finds that federal health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives are necessary due to the government's historical relationship and trust responsibility. The health needs of these populations are severe, with life expectancy 4.2 years lower than the general population. The Indian Health Service and tribal programs provide primary and specialty care services. Purchased/Referred Care programs buy healthcare services from private providers when not available at Indian Health Service or Tribal facilities. Insufficient funds lead to rationed care, delays in treatment, and the need for more costly services. Congress mandated Medicare-participating hospitals to accept patients from these programs at Medicare rates. The Medicare-like rate cap only applies to hospital services, not other Medicare-participating providers. Indian Health Service and Tribal Purchased/Referred Care programs pay full billed charges for non-hospital services, leading to limited treatment options and undesirable health outcomes for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The report found that capping Purchased/Referred Care reimbursement at Medicare-like rates for nonhospital services could double physician services, adding 253,000 patient visits annually. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CHARGES FOR CERTAIN CONTRACT HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED TO INDIANS BY MEDICARE PROVIDERS. The amendment to the Social Security Act applies to all providers of services and suppliers, with regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The effective date for the amendment is 90 days after the enactment of the Act.
