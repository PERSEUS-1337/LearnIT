    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Digital TV Transition Fairness Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The \"Digital TV Transition Fairness Act\" defines key terms such as Assistant Secretary, Commission, digital-to-analog converter box, local market, and multichannel video programming distributor. The term \"television broadcast station\" is defined in the Communications Act of 1934. SEC. 3. DIGITAL VIEWERSHIP COUPON PROGRAM. The Assistant Secretary, in coordination with the Commission, will implement a program for households or individuals in the US to obtain coupons for digital TV equipment installation and reception. This includes converter boxes, antennas, and other necessary equipment for basic broadcast television service. Eligibility is open to any household or individual. Eligibility for the coupon program includes households or individuals who were eligible for a digital-to-analog converter box coupon under the previous program. The Assistant Secretary will establish minimum standards for eligible companies within 30 days. The coupon program eligibility criteria must be met within 30 days of the Act's enactment. No household or individual can participate if they were receiving purchased broadcast television from a multichannel video programming distributor before the Act or if they purchase television broadcasts (excluding basic broadcast TV) from a distributor after the Act. The coupon program allows households or individuals to request coupons with a value not exceeding $80. The coupons expire 90 days after the program ends, and the Assistant Secretary determines their value based on the purpose and costs. The program established under this section will terminate 18 months after the first coupon is issued. The Assistant Secretary will develop an Internet website and a toll-free hotline to assist consumers with digital television reception issues after the transition to digital television on February 17, 2009. The website and hotline will provide information on using antennas to improve reception and available options for consumers. The Assistant Secretary will develop anti-fraud measures for coupon issuance and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration will report coupon requests and issuances publicly. The requirement for reporting on issued coupons includes the amount, types of costs, redemption numbers, and remaining funds. This requirement will end 3 months after the last coupon is issued. SEC. 4. BASIC BROADCAST TELEVISION SERVICE. The Commission must create rules for multichannel video distributors to provide basic broadcast television service to eligible consumers in local markets, without facing prohibitions or civil liability. The distributor is immune from civil liability for fulfilling requirements under paragraph (1). The Commission requires television broadcast stations to grant consent for signal retransmission and waive fees for fulfilling requirements under paragraph (1). The rule for basic broadcast television service ensures that it includes the transmission of nonsubscription television broadcast stations within the local market. An eligible consumer is defined as someone whose primary residence is in a local market where a television broadcast station has reported signal loss due to the transition to digital television. The rule allows eligible consumers without a multichannel video service to purchase basic broadcast television for $10 per month. If they buy additional channel service, they lose eligibility for the basic service. The cost limit is adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index increase determines the monthly fee for basic broadcast television service. Multichannel video distributors cannot charge excessive installation costs. The Commission will implement anti-fraud measures to ensure eligibility for the service. The Commission will report to Congress every 12 months on the number of eligible consumers purchasing basic broadcast television service, issues faced by consumers and distributors, and any other relevant information. The reports will be made publicly available on the Commission's website. The section requires information to be made available on the website in a searchable format. Termination can only occur through an Act of Congress. SEC. 5. OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. The Commission, in collaboration with various agencies and organizations, will conduct an education and outreach campaign to inform consumers about the programs established under this Act. The campaign will utilize various media channels and begin immediately upon enactment of the Act. The Act requires agencies to maintain program information on their websites and educate vulnerable consumers about the transition to digital television, including senior citizens, rural residents, non-English speakers, individuals with disabilities, and low-income consumers. The transition to digital television on February 17, 2009, is predicted to occur. The Commission may provide funds to various organizations for an education and outreach campaign. Each Federal agency must ensure the operation of a single website for information related to the Act and its programs. SEC. 6. FUNDING. Authorization of Appropriations: $700,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. $600,000,000 is for the digital viewership coupon program, and $100,000,000 is for the Commission to fulfill certain requirements. Any remaining funds in the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund will be transferred after the expiration of a specific program. The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 authorizes $700,000,000 for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, with $600,000,000 allocated for the digital viewership coupon program and $100,000,000 for fulfilling certain requirements. Any remaining funds in the fund will be transferred after a specific program expires."
