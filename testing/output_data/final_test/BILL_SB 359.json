    "title": "SB 359",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of pupil achievement in mathematics for college and career readiness, particularly in STEM fields. Proper placement in math courses during middle and high school is crucial, with 9th grade placement being a key factor for future educational success. Misplacement can hinder college admissions opportunities at California universities. Mathematics misplacement disproportionately affects successful pupils of color, hindering their advancement in the recommended course sequence. This has negative impacts on confidence, knowledge of mathematical concepts, and future college opportunities. Research shows that pupils of color are less likely to reach calculus by grade 12 compared to their white and Asian peers. It is crucial for all pupils to have an equal chance to advance in mathematics, regardless of their background. The California Mathematics Placement Act of 2015 emphasizes the importance of accurate mathematics course placement for all pupils to meet Common Core State Standards and address the looming shortage of college-educated workers. It aims to ensure a fair process for mathematics placement to provide equal opportunities for all students. The California Mathematics Placement Act of 2015 requires local educational agencies to develop a fair, objective, and transparent mathematics placement policy for grade 9 students before the 2016-17 school year. The California Mathematics Placement Act of 2015 mandates a fair and transparent mathematics placement policy for 9th-grade students. The policy includes using multiple academic measures like statewide assessments, placement tests, classroom assignments, and report cards. It also requires a placement checkpoint within the first month of the school year for accurate placement and progress evaluation. The California Mathematics Placement Act of 2015 ensures fair placement in math courses for 9th-grade students. It requires annual examination of placement data to prevent disproportionate holding back based on race, ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic background. The policy also provides recourse for questioning placement and addresses consistency in placement policies between elementary and high school districts. The California Mathematics Placement Act of 2015 allows local educational agencies to develop and implement a mathematics placement policy for students transitioning between elementary and middle school. The policy must be posted on the agency's website. If the act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided."
