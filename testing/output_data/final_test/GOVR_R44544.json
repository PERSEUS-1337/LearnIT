The U.S. government has been involved in their development, but U.S. firms face tough competition from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and China. Global semiconductor production is shifting away from the U.S. due to subsidies and customer proximity. Semiconductors, essential for data processing, are key components in electronic products manufacturing. In July 2015, a Semiconductor Caucus was formed by Members of Congress to support increased federal funding for semiconductor research. Semiconductors, made of materials like silicon and germanium, enable precise control of electrical current flow and are vital for computers to run software applications and store data. Semiconductors are crucial for various electronic products, providing memory, data communication, and processing capabilities. They are used in a wide range of products, from cell phones to military equipment. The invention of semiconductors was primarily driven by military applications, replacing the need for thousands of vacuum tubes and other components in early computers. Premium-class automobiles can contain close to 100 million lines of software code controlled by semiconductors. The invention of the transistor and integrated circuit revolutionized the semiconductor industry. The federal government played a key role in funding research and commercializing the technology for military, space, and civilian applications. Moore's Law, proposed by Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore, describes the rapid product development cycle in the semiconductor industry. Moore's Law, coined by Gordon Moore, observes the rapid advancement and cost reduction in chip speeds, with the number of transistors doubling every 18 months to two years. This leads to smaller, faster, and cheaper semiconductors, resulting in short product life-cycles and high research investments by manufacturers. The industry faces challenges with quickly obsolete technology and the question of reaching physical limits in transistor packing on silicon devices economically. The semiconductor industry is exploring new computing approaches like quantum, optical, and neuromorphic computing to overcome limitations in transistor packing on silicon devices. U.S.-based firms dominate the global market, with large fluctuations in supply and demand tied to the global economy. Intel, Qualcomm, Micron, and Texas are among the top semiconductor companies by revenue. The top semiconductor firms by revenue in 2015, including Intel, Qualcomm, Micron, and Texas Instruments, are mainly headquartered in the United States. Other leading companies are based in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Europe. Most companies operate as either integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) with their own fabrication facilities or as fabless firms that design and market semiconductors while outsourcing production to foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Fabless semiconductor firms generally have higher and more stable profit margins compared to integrated manufacturers. Global semiconductor sales reached $335 billion in 2015, with U.S.-based companies accounting for about half of the market share. Sales of U.S.-headquartered firms totaled $166 billion, but experienced a contraction that year. The industry has seen a compounded annual growth rate of 9.5% over the past 20 years. The global semiconductor industry sales reached $335 billion in 2015, with U.S.-based companies holding about 50% market share. Sales of U.S. firms totaled $166 billion, but experienced a contraction. WSTS forecasts a 4% increase in industry sales to $347 billion in 2017. Integrated circuits account for 82% of industry sales, with optoelectronics, sensors, and discretes making up the remaining 18%. The integrated circuit market in 2015 was dominated by four main segments: Logic Devices (27% of sales), Memory Devices (23% of sales), Microprocessors (18% of sales), and Analog Devices. Logic devices are used for data manipulation, memory devices store information, microprocessors execute software instructions, and analog devices involve analog signal processing technologies. Analog Devices, such as data converters and amplifiers, convert analog signals to digital. They account for 13% of semiconductor industry sales. Manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron dominate the global DRAM market. Intel relies heavily on supplying microprocessors to the PC industry. Intel, a major player in the computer industry, is impacted by weakening global demand for personal computers. Multicomponent semiconductors (MCOs) are a fast-growing segment, combining two semiconductors into a single unit for smaller, lighter, and faster devices. MCOs are commonly used in smartphones, tablets, and automotive systems. Demand for MCOs is expected to increase in the future. Semiconductor companies like Intel, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, and Broadcom use MCOs to create smaller, lighter, and faster devices with lower power consumption. Some companies, like Kokomo Semiconductors, specialize in producing custom integrated circuits for specific buyers. Small semiconductor firms can compete with larger ones by focusing on specialized chips for niche markets or developing new applications. The production of semiconductors is complex and requires high levels of automation as they become smaller and more densely packed with transistors. The semiconductor production process involves design, front-end fabrication in fabs, and back-end testing, assembly, and packaging. Design work is mainly done in the United States, with the fabrication process taking about 2 months. Most advanced fab capacity is located outside the US. Back-end production involves assembling chips into finished semiconductor components. Back-end production involves assembling chips into finished semiconductor components and testing for defects, often done in countries with lower labor costs. The U.S. semiconductor industry contributed $27.2 billion to the economy in 2014, facing challenges from declining chip prices. The semiconductor industry faces challenges from declining chip prices, with prices falling by 46% between 2005 and 2015. To maintain revenue, chip producers must find new markets. Semiconductor manufacturers invest heavily in R&D, with industry-wide investment rates ranging between 15-20% of sales. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers devoted 19.4% of their domestic sales to R&D in 2012, higher than other large industrial sectors. The semiconductor industry invests heavily in R&D, with a 3.6% R&D intensity for all manufacturing industries in 2012. The industry saw a resolution to a long-standing tax issue in December 2015 with the permanent establishment of the R&D tax credit. This move is expected to encourage sustained R&D efforts by semiconductor companies and other manufacturers. The U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry employed 180,700 workers in 2015, earning an average wage of $138,100. In 2015, the semiconductor manufacturing industry in the United States had an average wage of $138,100 for workers, which was more than double the average for all U.S. manufacturing workers. California had nearly one-quarter of all domestic semiconductor manufacturing jobs, with other significant states including Texas, Oregon, Arizona, Massachusetts, Idaho, and New York. Semiconductor manufacturing requires heavy capital investment for new facilities and equipment to produce each new generation of chips. The semiconductor industry in the United States requires heavy capital investment for new facilities and equipment. Between 2011 and 2014, domestic expenditures for new plants and equipment ranged from $17 billion to $22 billion. In 2015, most of the world's 300mm semiconductor fabrication capacity was in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and China, while North America accounted for only 13% of production capacity. The share of total worldwide fabrication capacity located in the United States dropped from 42% in 1980 to 16% in 2007, due to the rapid expansion of Asian semiconductor companies. The semiconductor industry in the United States has seen a decline in production capacity, with Asian companies rapidly expanding. U.S.-based semiconductor fabrication companies conduct over half of their operations in the country. Factors influencing site selection decisions include tax advantages, talent supply, water supply quality, utilities reliability, environmental regulations, cost of living, and intellectual property protection. Intel conducts 70% of its wafer fabrication in the U.S., while Micron and Texas Instruments also have manufacturing facilities in the country. The semiconductor industry in the United States has seen a decline in production capacity, with Asian companies rapidly expanding. U.S.-based semiconductor fabrication companies conduct over half of their operations in the country. Texas Instruments has manufacturing facilities in Maine and Texas. Global Foundries, controlled by the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, has acquired U.S. fabs formerly owned by Advanced Micro Devices and IBM Corporation. Most new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located outside the United States, with foreign markets accounting for 83% of semiconductor sales by U.S.-headquartered firms in 2015. According to SEMI, of the 36 new fab projects planned worldwide between 2015 and 2017, only five were planned for the United States. In 2015, U.S. semiconductor exports totaled $41.8 billion, a 2% decrease from the previous year. The strong U.S. dollar made American goods more expensive in international markets, leading to a loss in market share. Top export markets for U.S. semiconductors included Mexico, China, Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan, all major producers of consumer electronics and telecommunications equipment. Semiconductors were the top U.S. high-tech export by value in 2015. In 2015, semiconductors were the top U.S. high-tech export by value and the fourth-largest overall export, behind civilian aircraft, petroleum products, and automobiles. Imports of semiconductors totaled $41.7 billion, with Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea as the top import sources. Malaysia was the largest contributor, accounting for over 30% of all imported semiconductors. China's share of U.S. semiconductor imports increased from 9% in 2009 to 13% in 2015. About one-third of U.S. semiconductor imports are reexported due to complex international supply chains. The semiconductor industry supports international trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). A recent success was the expansion of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Information Technology Agreement (ITA) to eliminate tariffs on 201 new technology products, including next-generation multicomponent semiconductors (MCOs). Next-generation multicomponent semiconductors (MCOs) are used in various electronics and face global tariff rates ranging from 2.5% to 25.0%. Major semiconductor producers like Qualcomm, Intel, and Broadcom are top U.S. patent recipients. ITA participants plan to reconvene in 2018 to update the agreement and address non-tariff barriers in the information technology sector. The semiconductor industry supported the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2015, which creates a federal private right to action for trade secret misappropriations. Congress has also addressed the importation of counterfeit products through the Foreign Counterfeit Merchandise Prevention Act. The semiconductor industry is concerned about the infringement of intellectual property rights (IPR) on critical goods, including semiconductors, through imports. They believe that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has not adequately protected their IPR from counterfeit goods. In the past, American companies dominated semiconductor production until the 1970s, but Japan's capture of the global DRAM market in the 1980s raised concerns about market protection practices. Since the 1980s, Japan's protection of its domestic market hindered U.S. semiconductor sales, leading to the 1986 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement and the formation of SEMATECH in 1987. Japan's global semiconductor market share has declined since the early 1990s, with several Japanese fabs closing and some producers going bankrupt. In 2015, only Toshiba, Renesas Electronics, and Sony were among the top 20 chipmakers worldwide by revenue. In 2015, Renesas Electronics, Sony, and Toshiba were among the top 20 chipmakers globally by revenue. Japanese companies' market positions have declined, with South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix now ranking second and third in the semiconductor industry. Samsung held 46.4% of the global DRAM market, followed by SK Hynix at 27.9%. South Korea's semiconductor industry growth is supported by government funding and chaebols. Taiwan leads in semiconductor foundry manufacturing. Taiwan's semiconductor foundry industry is dominated by TSMC and UMC, established and funded by the government in the 1980s. China is a major consumer but imports up to 80% of semiconductors. China's semiconductor industry includes indigenous and multinational firms. In 2014, manufacturers in China accounted for 13.4% of the global semiconductor industry revenue, which increased from 12.0% in 2013 and 11.6% in 2012. China's semiconductor industry revenue reached $77.3 billion in 2014, up from $40.5 billion in 2013 and $34.2 billion in 2012. Non-Chinese semiconductor companies currently dominate the Chinese market, with China's domestic manufacturing technology lagging behind its IC design capabilities. China's wafer fabrication plants use older technology and equipment, focusing on LED and other applications that do not require cutting-edge semiconductors. The Chinese integrated circuit market is dominated by low-end chips, with only a few advanced wafer fabrication plants in China. Foreign companies like Intel, Samsung, and SK Hynix own some of these plants, while TSMC plans to build one in China. China aims to become a world-leading semiconductor industry by 2030, with a goal of meeting 70% of its semiconductor demand domestically by 2025. McKinsey & Company suggests reducing dependence on imported chips. China plans to invest $100-150 billion in its semiconductor industry by 2025 to reduce dependence on imported chips. Efforts include developing local chip manufacturers like SMIC, HMLC, and XMC to compete globally. However, barriers such as export controls and policy restrictions hinder China's advancement in semiconductor production. In 2015, the United States blocked the sale of advanced microprocessors to China due to concerns about their use in Chinese supercomputers. Chinese companies have pursued acquisitions of foreign companies to advance their integrated circuit development plan. Tsinghua Unigroup, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, proposed to acquire Micron Technologies for $23 billion, raising national security and economic concerns among Members of Congress. In 2016, Chinese investors abandoned bids to acquire Fairchild Semiconductor and Western Digital. It is unclear if these transactions faced objections from CFIUS, which reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses for national security concerns. Europe's semiconductor industry includes companies like STMicroelectronics. European-headquartered semiconductor companies like STMicroelectronics, Infineon Technologies, and NXP Semiconductors specialize in niche markets such as automotive and industrial electronics. Europe accounted for 3.0% of worldwide semiconductor production in 2015 and is strong in manufacturing electronics for energy applications. The European semiconductor industry aims to increase its global market share to 20% by 2020 through a $11 billion initiative for R&D funding, hoping to attract $113 billion in industry investment. This includes easier access to financing, pooling subsidies for larger projects, and improving manufacturing capabilities. The federal government has supported the U.S. semiconductor industry since the late 1940s, with roles evolving over time from research funding to creating a market through defense and space-related acquisitions. Recent focus includes extending current technologies and developing revolutionary successors. In the late 1940s, developments in computers and transistors laid the foundation for the semiconductor and computing industries. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, funded by the Army Ballistic Research Laboratory. Bell Labs invented the transistor in 1947, a semiconductor device that regulates electricity flow. In the late 1940s, Bell Labs invented the transistor, a semiconductor device that regulates electricity flow. Engineers sought to improve computer performance by addressing the \"tyranny of numbers,\" the need for hand-soldering connections between components. The Army Signal Corps funded a program to standardize components for easier circuit assembly. In 1958, Texas Instruments developed the integrated circuit (IC), incorporating resistors, capacitors, and transistors on a single germanium sliver. Fairchild Semiconductor developed a silicon-based IC with metal layers for mass production, initially supported by government purchases. The U.S. semiconductor industry grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, maintaining a significant global production share. Japan's semiconductor industry's rise in the early 1980s posed a challenge. In the late 1980s, the U.S. semiconductor industry's global sales share dropped below 40%, raising concerns about losing manufacturing and technological leadership to foreign competitors, particularly Japan. The Defense Science Board's Task Force on Semiconductor Dependency highlighted the erosion of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing capacity and technological leadership, impacting related upstream industries as well. The Defense Science Board's Task Force recommended the formation of an industry-government consortium to advance semiconductor technology. In 1987, 14 U.S. semiconductor firms founded SEMATECH in Austin, TX, with federal support totaling $870 million from FY1988 to FY1996. SEMATECH, funded with $870 million from DARPA and industry contributions, had a significant impact on U.S. semiconductor manufacturing in the 1990s. A government-industry R&D consortium, SEMATECH improved U.S. industry's technological position. However, its success and replicability in other cases remain uncertain. CEO T.J. Rodgers criticized SEMATECH's federal funding as a subsidy. T.J. Rodgers criticized SEMATECH's federal funding as a subsidy to large companies, stating that smaller firms were excluded due to high dues. SEMATECH used resources to create a competitive advantage and kept technology secrets from competitors. The consortium stopped accepting federal funding in 1996, operated on industry funding, and allowed foreign companies to join. After Intel and Samsung left in 2015, SEMATECH was absorbed by the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute in Albany, NY. The federal government has supported semiconductor research activities, focusing on developing new technologies beyond CMOS. Research has led to advancements in chip components, making semiconductors more powerful and energy-efficient. Concerns about quantum effects limiting further miniaturization have prompted additional federal efforts. President Obama issued an executive order in 2015 to establish the National Strategic Computing. In July 2015, President Obama established the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) to maximize the benefits of high performance computing (HPC) for the United States. The initiative aims to create a strategic vision for future HPC systems beyond current semiconductor technology limits. Lead agencies include the U.S. Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, and Department of Defense, with additional support from agencies like STARnet for semiconductor research. The curr_chunk discusses collaborative research efforts focused on advancing semiconductor technology, including STARnet, SaTC: STARSS, and Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond under the National Nanotechnology Initiative. These initiatives aim to address fundamental physical limits in microelectronics, enhance semiconductor resilience to tampering, and explore novel nanoscale fabrication processes. The Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond initiative, funded by Congress with approximately $530 million since FY2011, aims to develop revolutionary materials and devices through novel nanoscale fabrication processes. Specific projects include the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative and the Energy-Efficient Computing: from Devices to Architectures (E2CDA) initiative, which focuses on reducing energy consumption in data manipulation. Maintaining a domestic manufacturing capability for advanced semiconductor products is seen as crucial for national security due to concerns about dependence on foreign suppliers. The military's reliance on semiconductors for weapons and defense systems necessitates a domestic production capability, despite the high costs involved. In 2003, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz emphasized the need for trusted commercial suppliers for critical integrated circuits in defense systems, leading to the implementation of a trusted supplier program by the Department of Defense in 2004. The Department of Defense relies on U.S. companies for critical components for national defense. IBM's fabrication facilities supplied semiconductors to DOD as the sole contractor, but in 2014, GlobalFoundries acquired these facilities. CFIUS approved the acquisition, and GlobalFoundries became a trusted DOD supplier. A seven-year agreement was reached in 2016 for GlobalFoundries to supply microchips. In 2015, a hearing was held to assess the DOD trusted supplier program's long-term viability. The DOD trusted supplier program is being evaluated for long-term viability due to the shrinking number of domestic microelectronics manufacturers. Policy options include identifying more U.S.-based trusted foundries, exploring alternative manufacturing approaches, or establishing a government-owned fabrication facility. Despite national security concerns, DOD heavily relies on the commercial supply chain for electronic hardware. The trusted supplier program is used for only a small fraction of chips in defense systems. The DOD trusted supplier program is being evaluated for long-term viability as the number of domestic microelectronics manufacturers shrinks. In summer 2015, DOD's Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy started a study on the microelectronics industrial base to increase DOD's access to trusted manufacturers."
