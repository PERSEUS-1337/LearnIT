    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 53075.5 of the Government Code is amended to require cities and counties in California to adopt ordinances or resolutions for regulating taxicab transportation services within their jurisdiction. This includes policies for entering the taxicab business and ensuring public health, safety, and welfare. Employment as a taxicab driver is a condition for obtaining a driver's permit, which becomes void upon termination. The permit must state the employer's name, and the employer must notify the city or county of any termination. The driver must return the permit upon termination. Additionally, there are requirements for establishing rates and a mandatory substance and alcohol testing program for drivers. Drivers must test negative for controlled substances and alcohol before employment and permit renewal, as mandated by federal regulations. A negative alcohol test is defined as a breath alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 percent. The driver must show a valid California driver's license at the time and place of testing, following procedures similar to federal regulations. Rehabilitation, return-to-duty, and follow-up testing requirements are also in line with federal regulations. (iii) A negative test result in one jurisdiction is valid for one year for permit renewal or periodic testing in any jurisdiction, as long as the driver has not tested positive since. However, previous negative results cannot be used for pre-employment testing. \n(iv) For self-employed drivers, positive test results are reported to the city or county, while for other drivers, results are reported to the transportation operator who may inform the city or county of positive results. All test results are confidential and require driver consent for release, except as mandated by law. Self-employed drivers are responsible for program compliance and costs, while transportation operators are responsible for their employees. Operators may require positive-testing employees to cover rehabilitation and follow-up testing costs. Drivers can request a list of certified testing consortia from the city or county. (B) Positive test results from the program cannot be used in criminal drug cases. Cities or counties can charge fees to cover costs of regulating taxicab services. Additional requirements can be set by local governments for taxicab operations. \"Employment\" in this context includes self-employment as an independent driver. Section 53075.71 of the Government Code states that taxicab transportation services and drivers are subject to city or county regulations as of July 1, 2016, with exceptions. Self-employment as an independent driver is included in the definition of \"employment.\" This section does not apply to cities or counties outside of San Francisco once transportation duties are reorganized. Service charges, fees, or assessments on taxicab companies cannot exceed July 1, 2016 levels. No new charges can be added. Taxi driver permit fees capped at $75 annually. Prearranged trips cannot be limited. Cities or counties can restrict taxi companies or vehicles in certain areas. Maximum fare structure can be set, but must not be lower than July 1, 2016 fares. Taxi services can still offer lower fares. Taxicab companies are not restricted in the type of fare calculation device used. Fares must be disclosed to customers before accepting a ride. Local regulations ensuring service levels and accessibility for individuals with disabilities remain in effect. This applies to charter cities and counties, excluding San Francisco. The Legislature intends to modernize taxicab regulation to enhance competition with other transportation services. This includes consolidating regulation under one state agency and establishing duties and responsibilities within that agency. The Governor will propose budget and statutory changes for this transition. Conforming changes will be made to relevant codes. The legislation aims to modernize taxicab regulation by consolidating it under one state agency to enhance competition with other transportation services. This will involve making conforming changes to relevant codes and ensuring that city or county regulations do not conflict with state requirements. The regulation of taxicab transportation services is deemed a matter of statewide concern, applying to charter cities and counties. The legislation aims to modernize taxicab regulation by consolidating it under one state agency to enhance competition with other transportation services. A special law is deemed necessary for the unique medallion system in San Francisco. If state-mandated costs are determined, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made."
