The Congress acknowledges the significant contributions of the top-secret units, the 23d Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company, during World War II in Europe. These units played a crucial role in Allied victories by engaging in deceptive activities that reduced American casualties. The Ghost Army, comprised of citizen-soldiers from various creative professions, played a crucial role in Allied victories in Europe during World War II. Their secret deception operations, led by the 23d Headquarters Special Troops, had a significant impact on major military campaigns. Force Mason, a 17-man detachment of the 23d led by First Lieutenant Bernard Mason, conducted Operation ELEPHANT at Omaha Beach from 1 to 4 July 1944 to protect the 980th Field Artillery Battalion as part of the Normandy Campaign. The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, utilized tactical deceptions like inflatable tanks, aircraft, and radio trickery to create illusions of American forces and divert enemy attention away from Allied troops. During World War II, the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops engaged in deceptive tactics such as impersonating larger Army units, creating counterfeit radio traffic, and setting up fake headquarters to mislead Axis spies. This included efforts during the Battle of the Bulge to mask General George Patton's Third Army movements to aid the besieged town of Bastogne. During World War II, the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops engaged in deceptive tactics like impersonating larger Army units to mislead Axis spies. In Operation VIERSEN, the Ghost Army, with 1,100 men, impersonated 40,000 men using fabricated radio networks and inflatable vehicles, aiding the Ninth Army in crossing the Rhine into Germany. This tactical deception drew German units away from the Ninth Army, assisting in deceiving the enemy about the real dispositions and intentions of the Army. The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company conducted deceptive operations during World War II, including using sonic deception to misrepresent troop locations along the Gothic Line in Italy. Their activities remained highly classified. The 3133d Signal Service Company's accomplishments during World War II remained classified for over forty years. The unit's innovative tactics saved lives and contributed significantly to defeating the Axis powers, deserving belated official recognition. The 3133d Signal Service Company's accomplishments during World War II remained classified for over forty years, deserving belated official recognition with a Congressional Gold Medal. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for a gold medal to be awarded to the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, known as the \"Ghost Army\", for their exceptional service during World War II. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal, which will then be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. The Congress recommends that the Smithsonian Institution display the gold medal awarded to the Ghost Army at appropriate locations affiliated with the institution. The Secretary is authorized to produce and sell bronze duplicates of the gold medal at a price covering production costs. The gold medal created under this Act is considered a national medal."
