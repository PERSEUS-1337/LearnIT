    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Safety Enhancements for Communities Using Reasonable and Effective Firearm Storage Act\" or the \"SECURE Firearm Storage Act.\" It includes security requirements for federally licensed firearms importers, manufacturers, and dealers. The \"SECURE Firearm Storage Act\" amends Section 923 of title 18, United States Code, to require licensed firearms importers, manufacturers, and dealers to securely store all firearms in their business inventory on the licensed premises. Firearms must be secured with a hardened steel rod and lock when the premises are closed. Licensed firearms importers, manufacturers, and dealers must securely store firearms on the premises using a locked fireproof safe, gun cabinet with a steel rod, or locked vault. Paper records must also be stored securely when the premises are closed. Licensed firearms importers, manufacturers, and dealers must securely store firearms on the premises in a locked fireproof safe or vault. The Attorney General can impose additional security requirements such as alarm systems and site hardening to reduce theft risks. Penalties for noncompliance with these security requirements are outlined in Section 924 of the title. The Attorney General can impose penalties for violations of firearms storage regulations, including civil penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for the first violation, license suspension for the second violation until the violation is corrected, and potential additional civil penalties. The Attorney General can impose penalties for violations of firearms storage regulations, including civil penalties and license revocation for repeat violations. Review of the Attorney General's actions can only be done as provided under section 923(f), and administrative remedies are still available despite civil penalties or license revocation. Amendment to Section 923 of the title requires applicants to describe how they will comply with subsection (m) in their application. The Attorney General must approve the compliance plan for it to be implemented. Effective dates and regulations for firearm storage requirements are also outlined. The enactment of the Act establishes initial firearm and paper records storage requirements, with different effective dates. The Attorney General is required to issue additional security regulations within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The regulations, as specified in subsection (a) of this section, will come into effect 1 year after issuance."
