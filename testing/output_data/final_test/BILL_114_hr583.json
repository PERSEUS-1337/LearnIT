    "content": "The \"Timely Repatriation Act\" is the short title of the Act. It focuses on timely repatriation procedures. The \"Timely Repatriation Act\" requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to publish a report every 6 months listing countries that have delayed repatriation of their nationals or have a high repatriation failure rate. Sanctions will be imposed on countries included in the report. Sanctions will be imposed on countries listed for delayed repatriation or high repatriation failure rates, including visa restrictions for officials and employees and their families. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for visa number reductions for countries with high repatriation failure rates, with a minimum level set at 20 percent of the baseline visa number. The Secretary of State can waive sanctions for national security reasons, with a minimum threshold of 80 percent of the baseline visa number. The Secretary of State can waive sanctions for temporary exigent circumstances, allowing a waiver of reductions below 80 percent of the baseline visa number. The Secretary of Homeland Security cannot delegate this authority. Countries with less than 10 nonrepatriations in the preceding 3-year period may be exempted. Any visa issued in violation of this section will be void. If an alien's repatriation is refused or unreasonably delayed, they must be released from detention by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Notice must be provided to state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as crime victims and their immediate family members, especially in cases of violent crime. A country is considered to have refused or unreasonably delayed repatriation if they do not respond within 90 days of a request from the United States. The term \"excessive repatriation failure rate\" refers to a failure rate greater than 10 percent for a period of the 3 full fiscal years preceding the date of publication of the report. The term \"number of non-repatriations outstanding\" refers to the unique aliens whose repatriation a country has refused or unreasonably delayed for a period. The term \"baseline visa number\" represents the average number of visas issued each fiscal year to nationals of a country for the 3 full fiscal years preceding the first report where that country is included. The GAO Report requires the Comptroller General to submit a report to Congress on the progress of implementing repatriation requests by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State."
