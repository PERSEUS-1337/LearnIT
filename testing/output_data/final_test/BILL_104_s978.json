Charitable gift annuities, unlike commercial annuities, are not issued for profit by charities and are not subject to antitrust laws. AMENDMENT TO THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940.

(b) Treatment of Charitable Organizations.--Charitable organizations and their personnel are not required to register as dealers, brokers, agents, or investment advisers solely for trading securities on their own behalf. The section allows capacity as trustee or administrator for charitable organizations, funds exempt under section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, or trusts with assets that can be invested in such funds. States can enact laws that do not preempt this section for 3 years. Definitions are provided for clarity. Definitions for this section include \"charitable organization\" as described in specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code, \"security\" as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and \"State\" referring to various regions within the United States. TITLE II--CLARIFICATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS\n\nSEC. 201. EXEMPTION FROM ANTITRUST LAWS. Charitable organizations are exempt from antitrust laws regarding charitable gift annuities. Antitrust laws include the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, and similar State laws. Charitable organizations are defined as those described in specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code.

The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States. States have the option to enact laws that do not preempt this section for a 3-year period after the enactment of this Act. The exemption in section 201 of the Act applies to any legal action before or after the enactment date, serving as a defense against antitrust law claims related to charitable gift annuities."
