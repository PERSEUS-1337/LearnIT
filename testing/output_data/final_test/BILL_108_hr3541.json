    "content": "The Act titled \"Implements of Torture Export Control Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. Findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that the United States ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1994, defining torture as deliberate acts causing extreme physical or psychological suffering. Torture has long-term consequences on survivors and their relationships, with over 117 countries engaging in or condoning torture according to Amnesty International. Over 500,000 victims of foreign governmental torture live in the United States, with mechanical restraints like handcuffs widely used as implements of torture. Equipment meant for law enforcement can be misused to suppress freedom and commit human rights violations, especially in countries where authorities monitor and harass activists and political figures. Devices like electro-shock discharge devices are also susceptible to abuse as implements of torture. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, major non-NATO allies are countries designated as such under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The term \"act of torture\" refers to intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain by a person in custody. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House and Senate. The curr_chunk is about the international relations of the House and the Senate committees on Foreign Relations and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. SEC. 4. LICENSING OF CRIME CONTROL EQUIPMENT. Crime control equipment requires individual export licenses, except for exports to NATO countries or major non-NATO allies. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON EXPORTS. The Secretary cannot approve the export of certain items to countries where the government or supported groups have engaged in torture. The Secretary of State must determine that the country has not repeatedly engaged in torture before allowing the export of these items. The Secretary, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, may approve the export of items if the end user has not engaged in acts of torture. The Secretary of State must report determinations to congressional committees and notify them of approved export licenses. The Secretary of State must notify congressional committees of the end-user's identity and the determination made regarding the end user within 5 days of granting an export license. Prohibition on export of specific items such as leg irons, handcuffs, saps, electroshock stun belts, and batons with spikes. Items designed for torture are also prohibited.

SEC. 8. EXPORT LICENSE REVIEW.\n\nThe Secretary, in consultation with appropriate agencies, must review individual export license applications under section 4. The Secretary of State plays a key role in approving or denying export licenses for crime control instruments, in concurrence with recommendations from the Secretary of State. The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor within the Department of State is involved in reviewing these licenses."
