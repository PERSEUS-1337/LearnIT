Unauthorized employment is seen as a key factor in illegal immigration, with efforts to address this issue through legislation such as the E-Verify program. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that the unauthorized resident population in the United States was 12.4 million in March 2007 and 11.9 million in March 2008. The Department of Homeland Security's estimate was slightly lower at 11.8 million unauthorized aliens in January 2007. About 7.2 million unauthorized workers were in the U.S. civilian labor force in March 2005, representing 65% of the total unauthorized population and 5% of the labor force at that time. Unauthorized aliens made up about 65% of the total unauthorized population and 5% of the labor force. In certain industries, their presence was even higher, with about one in five workers in private households being unauthorized. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it illegal for employers to hire unauthorized workers under \u00a7274A provisions. Employers must participate in the I-9 system to verify new hires' work eligibility. Document fraud and identity fraud undermine the process. Violating INA prohibitions on unauthorized employment can lead to civil and criminal penalties. ICE enforces penalties for violations related to unauthorized employment under the INA. Concerns about discrimination led to the addition of \u00a7274B to address hiring practices based on national origin. Employers with four or more employees must comply with unfair immigration-related employment practices. Under INA \u00a7274B, employers with four or more employees are prohibited from discriminating against U.S. citizens or work-authorized aliens based on national origin or immigration status. The Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices enforces these provisions, and violators may face civil penalties. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office issues annual reports on the implementation and enforcement of these provisions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issues reports on the implementation of INA \u00a7274A to determine if there is discrimination in employment based on national origin. GAO found that the law has reduced illegal immigration, is not burdensome on employers, and has not led to frivolous complaints. However, GAO also found widespread discrimination as a result of the law, but Congress did not take action on these findings. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 established an employment verification system, including the Basic Pilot program (now E-Verify) for confirming new hires' eligibility. E-Verify allows employers to access SSA and DHS databases to verify employment eligibility. The program began in 1997 in states with high unauthorized alien populations and has been extended multiple times. The E-Verify program, initially set to end in 2001, has been extended multiple times, most recently by P.L. 110-329. The program saw significant growth in employer participation from 2006 to 2009, with about 103,000 employers registered in January 2009. E-Verify is a voluntary program but has provisions for violators of employment laws. The Bush Administration mandated certain employers to participate in E-Verify, with federal departments and agencies required to verify new hires starting in October 2007. Additionally, in June 2008, President Bush issued an executive order for federal contractors to conduct electronic employment eligibility verification. The Bush Administration mandated E-Verify for certain employers in October 2007. President Bush's executive order in June 2008 required federal contractors to use E-Verify for employment eligibility verification. The Secretary of Homeland Security designated E-Verify as the required system for contractors, with a final rule published in November 2008. The E-Verify rule for federal contractors, mandating verification of employees' authorization to work in the US, had its effective and applicability dates changed to January 19, 2009, and May 21, 2009, respectively, to allow the new Administration time to review the rule. Contracting officers were instructed not to include the E-Verify clause in contracts before May 21, 2009. ICE has been responsible for enforcing immigration laws since March 2003, with a focus on worksite enforcement related to critical infrastructure and national security. Worksite enforcement investigations often uncover criminal violations by employers, including alien smuggling, document fraud, and worker exploitation. The ICE Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers (IMAGE) program, initiated in 2007, is a voluntary program aimed at addressing these issues. The ICE initiated the IMAGE program in 2007 to assist employers in developing a secure workforce and enhancing fraudulent document awareness. Employers must agree to I-9 audits, verify Social Security numbers, and adhere to best hiring practices, including E-Verify and reporting violations to ICE. Various options have been proposed to address unauthorized employment practices. One proposed approach to tackle unauthorized employment is to make E-Verify mandatory for all employers in the United States. This would require employers to verify the identity and employment eligibility of all new hires. The Bush Administration supported this idea and took steps to implement it for Federal agencies and contractors. Concerns have been raised about making electronic employment eligibility verification mandatory, including discrimination, employer noncompliance, and privacy issues. There are also concerns about E-Verify's inability to detect identity fraud. Options to address unauthorized employment include increasing penalties for violators, with proposals differing on which penalties to increase and by how much. Former DHS Secretary Chertoff has urged Congress to increase penalties for repeat offenders and establish substantial criminal penalties and injunction procedures. Options to address unauthorized employment include increasing penalties for violators, such as establishing substantial criminal penalties and injunction procedures for repeat offenders. Another proposal is to increase fines for engaging in unfair immigration-related employment practices. Additionally, there is a suggestion to establish new penalties for unauthorized employees, like fines or imprisonment for falsely representing work authorization. Another set of options involves providing additional resources to ICE for worksite enforcement. ICE may receive additional resources for worksite enforcement, including personnel and funding. Questions arise on how to best utilize these resources, such as whether to focus on criminal employer cases or make changes to the current strategy. Another option is to allocate resources for investigating document and identity fraud cases. Data sharing among SSA, DHS, and employers is suggested to reduce unauthorized employment and identity fraud. Proposals include increasing information sharing to identify cases of multiple social security number use. The SSA may need to share data with DHS and employers to address unauthorized employment and identity fraud. This could involve informing DHS of cases where a single social security number is used with multiple names. Former DHS Secretary Chertoff supported this data sharing in 2007. Another approach is to streamline the types of documents accepted for identity and employment verification. The Bush Administration sought to reduce the number of acceptable documents for I-9 verification to enhance security. An interim rule in 2008 proposed not accepting expired documents for employment eligibility verification. Implementation was delayed until April 2009 for further consideration and public input. The Bush Administration aimed to enhance security by reducing the number of acceptable documents for I-9 verification. Proposals included adding security features to Social Security cards, such as an encrypted strip and digitized photograph, or incorporating biometrics. This could replace the current requirement for employers to examine employee-provided documents. Proposals to require new hires to show a single document with various information have raised concerns about privacy, identity theft, and costs. The Social Security card is not meant for personal identification but for reporting earnings. All options discussed aim to enhance the current employer-based verification system. In a November 2005 paper, [author name scrubbed] proposed a centralized screening system for verifying work eligibility. Under this system, professional screeners would verify eligibility at the point of document issuance, with proof of eligibility on a worker's identity card. Employers would only need to keep a record of new hires and register them in a job holder database. Eventually, this registration could be done by swiping a machine-readable card, reducing employer responsibility and potential penalties. The proposed system for verifying work eligibility involves professional screeners verifying eligibility at document issuance and using a machine-readable card for registration. Enforcement agents would ensure document integrity and analyze employer records for unauthorized employment. Concerns include privacy, identity theft, and the potential for a national identification card. The option of shifting enforcement focus from ICE to DOL for minimum wage and health/safety laws is proposed as more effective in protecting U.S. workers. This includes increased DOL enforcement coupled with repealing current INA prohibitions on unauthorized employment, as advocated by law professor Jennifer Gordon in 2005. In June 2005, Jennifer Gordon recommended replacing the current system with a two-pronged approach to protect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers. This approach includes a statement from Congress that workplace protections apply to all workers regardless of immigration status, along with intensive government enforcement of minimum wage and health and safety laws in industries with high concentrations of undocumented workers. Some experts recommend replacing the current system with a two-pronged approach to protect workers, while others, like Carl W. Hampe, oppose repealing employer sanctions as it may worsen the unauthorized immigration problem. Multiple bills related to unauthorized employment have been introduced in the 111th Congress, including the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (H.R. 1105) which includes a provision to extend E-Verify. The House passed a provision to extend E-Verify until September 30, 2009, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This provision required employers to participate in E-Verify to receive funds under the act. However, the Senate did not include these provisions in the final bill. E-Verify is a program where employers submit information about new hires for employment eligibility verification. The employment eligibility verification (I-9) form is compared with the SSA's database NUMIDENT for new hires. If the information matches, work authorization is verified. If not, a tentative nonconfirmation finding is issued. Noncitizens' information is sent to USCIS for work authorization verification. When the USCIS electronic check confirms work authorization, the employer is notified. If not confirmed, an Immigration Status Verifier at USCIS checks additional databases. If still unable to confirm, the employer is notified of a tentative nonconfirmation finding. Employees must be informed of any nonconfirmation findings and can contest them with SSA or USCIS. If not contested successfully, a final nonconfirmation is issued."
