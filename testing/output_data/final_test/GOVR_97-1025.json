    "content": "The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, protects federal computers, bank computers, and those used in interstate commerce from trespassing, threats, damage, espionage, and fraud. It complements other state and federal laws by addressing gaps in protection. Congress has continuously amended and supplemented the CFAA over the last three decades to enhance coverage of federal criminal statutes related to computer crimes. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, protects federal computers, bank computers, and those used in interstate commerce from trespassing, threats, damage, espionage, and fraud. The act includes laws outlawing various forms of computer trespassing, damaging government or bank computers, committing fraud involving unauthorized access to computers, and threatening to damage computers. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, criminalizes various cyber offenses such as damaging government or bank computers, trafficking in passwords, and committing espionage. Penalties range from one year to life imprisonment, with the Secret Service retaining investigative authority. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, criminalizes cyber offenses like damaging government or bank computers, trafficking in passwords, and committing espionage. Subsection 1030(g) allows civil action for victims. Subsection 1030(h) expired and required annual reports on investigations. Subsections 1030(i) and (j) authorize property confiscation related to offenses under subsection 1030(a) or (b). The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, criminalizes cyber offenses like unauthorized intrusion into federal government computers. Paragraph 1030(a)(3) prohibits accessing government computers without authorization, whether used exclusively by the government or shared with others. Attempted intrusions and conspiracies are also outlawed under subsection 1030(b). Unauthorized access is only considered a crime if it affects the government's use of the computer. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, criminalizes unauthorized access to government computers, whether used exclusively by the federal government or shared with others. The legislation prohibits attempted intrusions and conspiracies related to unauthorized access, with a focus on unauthorized entry without the need for further actions on the accessed information. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act criminalizes unauthorized access to government computers, focusing on intentional trespassing by persons without authorized access. Congress accepted a certain degree of trespassing by government employees to protect against unauthorized entry. The Committee was willing to accept some trespassing by government employees to protect whistleblowers, balancing the need to prosecute unauthorized access while also safeguarding government computers from abuse by outsiders. The Committee believes that administrative sanctions are more appropriate than criminal punishment for cases where an employee exceeds authorized access to department computers. They aim to prevent prosecution for minor unauthorized access instances. The Committee distinguishes between unauthorized access within a department and trespasses into computers of another department. The amended version of the offense aims to prevent prosecution for minor unauthorized access instances. The Committee limits liability under 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(3) to cases where the offender is completely outside the Government or engages in interdepartmental trespass. Unauthorized access within a department is not precluded from prosecution. The Committee acknowledges that unauthorized access within a department is not precluded from prosecution, but trespassing on governmental computer space is prohibited only when it affects government use. Serious intradepartmental trespass may be subject to other criminal penalties under trade secrets laws or 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(1), (a)(4), (a)(5), or (a)(6). The Department of Justice is concerned that the language in the current subsection regarding unauthorized access to government computers could be misinterpreted. Section 2(b) clarifies that the offender's conduct only needs to affect the operation of the specific government computer in question. Reports do not provide clear explanations on which computers are protected from trespassing, possibly because paragraph 1030(a)(3) only protects government computers. The statute on unauthorized access to government computers clarifies that it applies to computers owned or leased by the federal government, including those used for non-governmental purposes. The statute on unauthorized access to government computers covers government computers available to nongovernment users, with restrictions on shared access. Definitions for \"department of the United States\" and \"agency of the United States\" are provided. The jurisdictional aspect of paragraph 1030(a)(3) regarding hacking initiated or occurring overseas is unclear. Federal laws generally apply within the United States, but in some cases, Congress explicitly includes overseas conduct. If a criminal statute is silent on jurisdiction, courts may infer that it applies to overseas misconduct based on the nature of the offense and circumstances. The Supreme Court has ruled on the application of federal statutes to crimes committed abroad, such as fraud against the United States by Americans or conspiracy to violate federal law in overseas activities. In a cybercrime case, a court found that unauthorized computer access to defraud under paragraph 1030(a)(4) applied to a hacker in Russia accessing protected computers in the US. Congress amended the definition of \"protected computers\" to include those used in foreign commerce or communications, influencing the court's decision. Congress further expanded the definition of \"protected computer\" to include those located outside the US used in interstate or foreign commerce. This amendment granted extraterritorial jurisdiction over computer-related offenses like fraud and damage, but did not explicitly cover simple trafficking offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(3). The penalties for conspiracy to violate, or for violations of, paragraph 1030(a)(3) include imprisonment and fines. Other paragraphs may trigger additional legal consequences, but they are not relevant to simple trespassing offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(3). The forfeiture provisions of subsections 1030(i) and (j) authorize the confiscation of a cyber trespasser's computer and property. Federal authorities historically did not prosecute juvenile offenders for computer hacking, as most federal crimes are also crimes under state laws. Juveniles violating federal law are typically turned over to state juvenile authorities unless certain conditions apply. Prosecutions under paragraph 1030(a)(3) have been relatively few, possibly due to its similarity to paragraph 1030(a)(2). The explanation for the limited prosecutions under paragraph 1030(a)(3) is that it closely mirrors paragraph 1030(a)(2), which is reserved for more serious cases warranting felony sanctions. Attempting to hack a federal computer under 1030(a)(3) is punishable as a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. 1030(b), which covers attempts to violate any subsection of 1030(a). This subsection has no specific legislative history commentary, but Congress has chosen to penalize attempts to commit various federal crimes. In federal crimes, to convict a defendant of attempt, the government must prove intent and a substantial step towards the offense. Conspiracy to violate federal law is a separate crime, where agreement and affirmative action lead to guilt. The general conspiracy statute applies to individuals who take affirmative action to carry out a plan, making them guilty of conspiracy even if the scheme fails. If conspirators hack into a government computer, they can be prosecuted under subsection 1030(a)(3). Subsection 1030(b) states that conspiracy to commit any 1030(a) offense will be punished accordingly. Unlike general conspiracy prosecutions, subsection 1030(b) conspiracy cases do not require proof of an overt act. Section 371 punishes conspiracy to commit any federal felony with imprisonment for not more than 5 years, regardless of the maximum term of imprisonment for the underlying offense. Subsection 1030(b) seems to punish conspiracy and the underlying violation of subsection 1030(a) similarly. Anyone involved in counseling, commanding, aiding, or abetting a federal crime is liable as a principal. An accomplice who embraces criminal objectives and acts to bring them about is liable as a principal for the completed offense. Liability as a principal for aiding or abetting a crime that never succeeds beyond the attempt phase is possible. The simple trespassing crime in paragraph 1030(a)(3) is the least likely of the seven crimes in subsection 1030(a) to overlap with other laws. Hacking into government computers without causing damage, injury, or gain implicates only a few other laws. Computer trespassing is an element of most offenses in 18 U.S.C. 1030, and hacking into someone's e-mail stored in a government system may violate 18 U.S.C. 2701. Hackers who misidentify themselves to access a federal computer may be guilty. Hackers who misidentify themselves to access a federal computer may be guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 18 U.S.C. 912. The Supreme Court has suggested that \u00a71001 should be narrowly construed, and the courts have consistently held that the false statement must adversely impact a governmental agency to trigger coverage. The difficulty with using the impersonation statute, 18 U.S.C. 912, is that it requires a showing of an official act or fraud, unlike paragraph 1030(a)(3). Simple computer trespassing is a crime under anti-hacking laws in most states. Unauthorized access to a computer to obtain information from financial records, government departments, or protected computers is punishable under \u00a7912 and paragraph 1030(a)(4). Simple computer trespassing is a crime under anti-hacking laws in most states, punishable under \u00a7912 and paragraph 1030(a)(4). Attempting to commit an offense under subsection (a) of this section results in punishment as provided in subsection (c). Acquiring protected information through intentional unauthorized computer access goes beyond simple hacking. It can be challenging to differentiate between violations of simple trespass proscriptions and trespassing-with-information-acquisition prohibitions, especially in cases involving government computers. The history of trespass provisions aims to exclude whistleblowers and federal employees from being prosecuted for simple trespassing within their own agency, which is why there is no \"exceeds-authorized-access\" provision in paragraph 1030(a)(3). The trespass-and-be-exposed-to-information provisions of paragraph 1030(a)(2) include an \"exceeds-authorized-access\" clause, potentially applicable to whistleblowers. Courts may need to interpret how this provision interacts with the simple trespassing provisions of paragraph 1030(a)(3). To convict under paragraph 1030(a)(2), the Government must prove intentional unauthorized access to a protected computer resulting in information acquisition. The intent requirement is similar to that of simple trespassing, requiring intentional access. In cases of simple trespassing, the intent element can be satisfied by anyone purposefully gaining access to a computer covered by the paragraph. The government does not need to prove the trespass was committed to defraud. Courts have had difficulty applying the terms \"without authorization\" and \"exceeds authorized access\" in 18 U.S.C. 1030, even though there is a specific definition for \"exceeds authorized access.\" Some have applied these terms to unauthorized use by authorized employees or outsiders with access subject to reservations. Some courts struggle with interpreting the terms \"without authorization\" and \"exceeds authorized access\" in 18 U.S.C. 1030. One court found that breaching a website's terms of service could potentially constitute unauthorized access to a computer. However, this interpretation was deemed unconstitutionally vague as it could give too much discretion to law enforcement. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) covers a wider range of computers than paragraph 1030(a)(3) and includes information from government, financial, and protected computers. The protection for financial information was among the first adjustments made to the legislation. The scope of protection for financial information under 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2) is intended to safeguard computerized credit records and information related to customers' relationships with financial institutions. The current statute limits coverage to individuals or partnerships with five or fewer partners, but the Committee aims to extend privacy protections to all customers of financial institutions, including individuals, partnerships, and corporations. The Department of Justice has raised concerns about the term 'obtains information' in this subsection potentially broadening the offense beyond unauthorized access. The Committee aims to extend privacy protections to all customers of financial institutions under 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2), including individuals, partnerships, and corporations. The language in paragraph 1030(a)(2) does not require physical removal of data to establish a violation, as 'obtaining information' includes mere observation of the data. The scope of protection also covers information obtained from federal computers and information secured by interstate or overseas cyberspace trespassing. The term 'obtaining information' in 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2) includes merely reading it, without the need for copying or transporting. This interpretation is crucial in the electronic environment where information can be 'stolen' without physical removal. The proposed subsection aims to protect against the theft of electronically stored information, which cannot be charged under traditional criminal statutes. The proposed subsection in 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2)(C) aims to prohibit the theft of intangible information through unauthorized computer use, similar to theft of physical items. The offense focuses on abusing a computer to obtain information, with implications for copyright laws. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008 expanded the scope by removing the interstate communication requirement and broadening the definition of \"protected computer\" to include those affecting interstate commerce. This change allows authorities to address computer hacking crimes within the same state. The expansion of computer hacking crimes now includes computers with at least a de minimis impact on commerce, including those accessing the Internet. The USA PATRIOT Act amendment confirms Congress's intent to prohibit unauthorized access to protected computers, potentially extending to unauthorized access to federal computers overseas. The simple trespass offenses in paragraph 1030(a)(3) are also condemned. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) offenses carry criminal penalties and a three-tier sentencing structure. Simple violations result in misdemeanors with imprisonment for up to one year and/or a fine of up to $100,000 ($200,000 for organizations). The second tier includes penalties of imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations) for offenses committed for commercial advantage, criminal acts, or violating laws. The second level of Paragraph 1030(a)(2) offenses, added in 1996, includes penalties for violations exceeding $5,000. The terms 'for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain' and 'for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act' are borrowed from copyright and wiretap laws, suggesting a criminal or financially advantageous purpose beyond computer trespassing. The third tier of penalties for Paragraph 1030(a)(2) offenses involves increased punishment for repeat offenders, with imprisonment up to 10 years and/or a fine up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). Federal law is not favorable towards prosecuting juveniles for intrusion and information acquisition offenses under this paragraph. The Sentencing Guidelines aim to eliminate sentencing disparity for federal crimes by assigning each crime to a guideline with a base offense level. This level is adjusted based on aggravating or mitigating circumstances to determine the sentencing range in months of imprisonment. Federal proceedings are only pursued if the state is unable or unwilling to prosecute the offense. The Sentencing Guidelines establish sentencing ranges for federal crimes based on offense levels and aggravating factors. In a specific case, the District Court applied enhancements to Mr. Willis's base offense level, resulting in an advisory Guideline range of 33 to 41 months of imprisonment. The District Court sentenced Mr. Willis to 41 months' imprisonment for a violation involving a critical infrastructure computer and personal information. Section 1030 allows for confiscation of property derived from the offense, including real and personal property used to facilitate the violation. Restitution is also authorized under the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008. Restitution is victim compensation for loss or damage associated with the offense. Federal courts must order a convicted defendant to pay restitution in certain cases, such as federal crimes of violence, fraud, property damage, or crimes involving physical injury or pecuniary loss. Restitution is not mandatory for acquisition offenses under Paragraph 1030(a)(2) as they are not crimes of violence. However, restitution may still be ordered at the court's discretion for other federal crimes. The court may order restitution in cases of plea bargains or when restitution is ordered as a condition of probation or supervised release. Restitution is required when the victim of a computer security breach suffers a pecuniary loss related to the investigation. Subsection 1030(g) allows for compensatory damages and injunctive relief for victims of \u00a71030 violations resulting in specified losses or damages. The violation of paragraph 1030(a)(5) can result in various types of loss or damage, including physical injury, threats to public health or safety, and damage to government computer systems. It is not necessary to prove a violation of this specific paragraph, as any violation of the paragraphs will suffice. Victims may combine their losses to meet the $5,000 threshold for restitution. The term \"person\" in subsection 1030(g) was previously undefined, leading to uncertainty over the range of victims entitled to relief. Congress used \"person\" to mean only individuals in paragraph 1030(a)(7)(extortionate threats), suggesting a similar interpretation for other subsections. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified the definition of \"person\" in subsection 1030(g) to include various entities. It also expanded the definition of \"loss\" to cover costs incurred by victims, benefiting those affected by intrusion offenses. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the definition of \"loss\" to cover costs incurred by victims in intrusion offenses. Subsection 1030(g) suits must be filed within two years. Attempt, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting in violating paragraph 1030(a)(2) have similar penalties as the substantive offense. Conspirators are liable for foreseeable crimes in furtherance of the scheme. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) of the USA PATRIOT Act does not require larcenous intent like other federal conversion statutes. It provides prosecutors with a more serious charge against hackers who breach governmental systems, giving the government an alternative charge against hackers who steal information from protected computers. This allows victims similar latitude in civil litigation under subsection 1030(g). Paragraph 1030(a)(2) of the USA PATRIOT Act allows victims similar latitude in civil litigation under subsection 1030(g) and overlaps with various false statement and false identification statutes. It may also intersect with communication protection provisions when unauthorized computer access intrudes upon ongoing or stored wire or electronic communications. The USA PATRIOT Act, specifically paragraph 1030(a)(3), protects federal computers, while paragraph 1030(a)(2) extends protection to \"protected computers\" used in interstate and foreign commerce. Internet communications can involve interstate commerce even if parties are in the same state. The impact on commerce for a computer to be protected is minimal. The USA PATRIOT Act amendment includes overseas computers if they involve foreign commerce or US communications. Hacking violations depend on whether federal theft statutes cover intangible property. The theft of information stored in a computer may be prosecuted under specific statutes only if there is a physical connection between the stolen items and those transported across state lines. Prosecuting computer intrusions under theft statutes depends on whether the stolen goods were physically transported. Theft of government property can be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. 641, which requires proof of stealing something of value belonging to the United States. This statute has been applied to property without necessary physical features. Additionally, unauthorized access to trade secrets can overlap with the Economic Espionage Act. The Economic Espionage Act criminalizes unauthorized access to trade secrets, making it a federal crime to steal or receive stolen trade secrets with knowledge of their origin. Information must have a commerce nexus, be secret, and have trade value to be protected under this law. The Economic Espionage Act protects various forms of trade secret information, including financial, business, scientific, and technical data. Violations can result in imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine. Downloading information after unauthorized access to a protected computer may result in a fine of up to $250,000 or $5 million for organizations. This action may also violate copyright law, which prohibits copying protected material without consent. Willful copyright infringement includes infringement for financial gain, reproduction or distribution of works worth over $1,000, and distribution of works intended for commercial distribution on a computer network. Infringement for profit or commercial advantage carries prison terms of 1 to 10 years under 18 U.S.C. 2319. Maximum penalties for infringement on works worth over $1,000 range from 1 to 6 years, while infringement involving works in preparation for distribution can lead to 3 to 10 years of imprisonment. Fines can reach up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Money laundering statutes 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 prohibit financial activities involving proceeds from federal crimes. Money laundering statutes under 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 prohibit domestic and international laundering of proceeds from specified unlawful activities. Offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1030 are considered money laundering predicate offenses, with different paragraphs carrying varying levels of risk for generating proceeds. The statute prohibits causing damage to a protected computer without authorization or accessing a protected computer intentionally without authorization. Paragraph 1030(a)(5) of the statute establishes three computer damage offenses based on the offender's intent to intrude and cause damage: intentionally causing damage without authorization, recklessly causing damage through unauthorized access, and causing damage and loss through unauthorized access. This section addresses intentional unauthorized access to a protected computer resulting in damage and loss. The intentional unauthorized access to a protected computer can result in damage and loss, punishable regardless of intent. The transmission element of intentional damage offense requires proof of the person sending the transmission, which can include installing a destructive program. The intentional transmission of a destructive program must be done knowingly and with the conscious purpose of causing damage. Unauthorized access may involve \"exceeding authorized access\" for outsiders, while damage is a common element in all offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(5). The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act expanded the scope of damage offenses to include cases involving serious harm caused intentionally or recklessly. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act now treats intentionally or recklessly causing serious computer damage as a felony, and less serious damage as a misdemeanor. Simple damage is considered a misdemeanor, requiring proof of both damage and loss. Damage is defined as any impairment to data, a program, system, or information, including diminished availability. Loss includes reasonable costs to victims. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act now categorizes computer damage as either felony or misdemeanor based on severity. Damage is defined as impairment to data, program, system, or information, with loss including costs to victims. Paragraph 1030(a)(5) outlines crimes without an \"exceeds authorization\" element, focusing on unauthorized transmission causing damage or loss. Unauthorized access leading to damage is only a federal crime if involving a \"protected computer.\" The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act categorizes computer damage as felony or misdemeanor based on severity. Damage is defined as impairment to data, program, system, or information, with loss including costs to victims. Crimes without an \"exceeds authorization\" element focus on unauthorized transmission causing damage or loss. Unauthorized access leading to damage is a federal crime if involving a \"protected computer.\" The definition of a \"computer used in interstate or foreign commerce or communications\" refers to damage that may affect interstate or foreign commerce or communications. The 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act aimed to address jurisdictional issues regarding hackers attacking computers in their own state. The change recognized the interstate nature of the Internet, allowing for federal regulation of computers affecting interstate or foreign commerce, even without an Internet connection. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act aims to regulate computers impacting interstate or foreign commerce, even without an Internet connection. The scope of protection for federal computers is unclear, as terms like \"United States Government\" are not defined. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act aims to regulate computers impacting interstate or foreign commerce, even without an Internet connection. The definition of financial institutions protected differs slightly from Title 18. Congress's intent regarding overseas application of jurisdiction remains unclear. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act punishes causing serious damage recklessly or intentionally inflicted more severely than causing damage without necessarily intending to do so. Repeat offenders are also punished more severely. The punishment for violations includes imprisonment for any term of years or for life and/or fines, depending on the severity of the damage caused. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act imposes penalties for various offenses, including imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for organizations) for certain violations. Repeat offenders face harsher penalties, with imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for organizations) for causing significant loss or harm. Lesser violations may result in imprisonment for up to 1 year and/or a fine of up to $100,000 (or $200,000 for organizations). The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act imposes penalties for various offenses, including imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for organizations) for certain violations. Repeat offenders face harsher penalties, with imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for organizations) for causing significant loss or harm. Lesser violations may result in imprisonment for up to 1 year and/or a fine of up to $100,000 (or $200,000 for organizations). Additional penalties apply for specific circumstances such as intentional access causing damage, modifying medical services, causing physical injury, threatening public health or safety, affecting national defense or security entities, or impacting multiple protected computers. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act imposes penalties for various offenses, including imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for organizations) for certain violations. Repeat offenders face harsher penalties, with imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for organizations) for causing significant loss or harm. Lesser violations may result in imprisonment for up to 1 year and/or a fine of up to $100,000 (or $200,000 for organizations). The punishment for intentional access that causes damage and loss is imprisonment for not more than 10 years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for an organization), with variations based on prior convictions. The legislative history sheds light on the damage thresholds set in the Act. The 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act aimed to restrict federal felony prosecutions to more serious cases by increasing the dollar limitation for damages. However, the definition of 'damage' is not always clear, as intruders can cause economic harm without physically damaging the computer or its information. For example, altering log-on programs to steal user passwords may not physically damage the system but still requires resources to secure and causes harm. The 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act aimed to restrict federal felony prosecutions to more serious cases by increasing the dollar limitation for damages. The bill defines 'damage' in new subsection 1030(e)(8) with a focus on preventing harm, requiring significant financial losses to be considered. The presence of a separate hacker prohibition with less severe penalties may impact the threshold for more severe penalties. The report language suggests that the cost of resecuring the system can be considered damage when passwords are stolen. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified the definition of \"loss\" in cases of system damage, including costs for responding to an offense and restoring data. It also addressed a potential issue with the $5,000 damage threshold by specifying that losses incurred by a contractor managing a damaged system can be included. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified the definition of \"loss\" in cases of system damage, including costs for responding to an offense and restoring data. It also addressed the $5,000 damage threshold issue by specifying that losses incurred by a contractor managing a damaged system can be included. The term \"persons\" was changed to include individuals and any legal or other entity, aiming to limit damages and losses to human beings. The inclusion of computer tampering causing physical injuries or threats to public health is a new addition since the 1996 amendments. The 1996 amendments aimed to address general threats as the NII and other network infrastructures grow. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act made it a felony to use spyware or keyloggers to damage 10 or more computers. This ensures that the most egregious identity thieves will face appropriate punishment under Federal cyber crime laws. The Sentencing Guidelines play a significant role in cases involving damage offenses under paragraph 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5). Offenses committed by juveniles are more likely to be handled at the state level rather than federal. Enhancements in the guidelines apply to intentional damage and cases with multiple victims. The Sentencing Guidelines play a significant role in cases involving damage offenses under paragraph 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5), with enhancements applying to intentional damage and cases with multiple victims. Property used to inflict damage in violation of paragraph 1030(a)(5) is subject to confiscation, and restitution is mandatory for fraud or property damage offenses. Offenders may also face civil liability for serious damage caused. Victims of violations under 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5) can seek damages and equitable relief within two years. Damages for medical records, physical injury, endangering public safety, or government computer damage may result in compensatory damages. Recovery is limited to economic damages if harm exceeds $5,000. The term \"person\" in this context was initially undefined. The term \"person\" in 18 U.S.C. 1030 was initially undefined, leading to uncertainty about its meaning. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified that \"person\" includes individuals, firms, corporations, educational institutions, governmental entities, and other legal entities. This definition resolved ambiguity and provided clarity on who could be considered a \"person\" under the statute. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified that \"person\" in 18 U.S.C. 1030 includes individuals, firms, corporations, educational institutions, governmental entities, and other legal entities. It defined the kinds of losses that might give rise to civil liability and specified that subsection 1030(g) does not create a cause of action for loss or damage due to negligent design or manufacture of computer hardware, software, or firmware. Designation of an offense as a federal crime of terrorism has several consequences. Designation as a federal crime of terrorism triggers the application of several substantive and procedural criminal statutes. Federal crimes of terrorism have an 8-year statute of limitations and a maximum term of supervised release of life. Bail is unlikely for individuals charged with a federal crime of terrorism. Aggravated identity theft in relation to a federal crime of terrorism carries a maximum 5-year imprisonment term. Designation as a federal crime of terrorism triggers the application of several substantive and procedural criminal statutes. Federal crimes of terrorism have an 8-year statute of limitations and a maximum term of supervised release of life. Bail is unlikely for individuals charged with a federal crime of terrorism. Aggravated identity theft in relation to a federal crime of terrorism carries a maximum 5-year imprisonment term. It is a separate federal crime punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life to knowingly provide maritime transportation to an individual intending to commit, or in flight from the commission of, a federal crime of terrorism. Offenders face imprisonment for up to 20 years, as well as the prospect of civil liability. Any RICO predicate offense is in turn a money laundering predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. 1956. The federal statutes apply to attempt, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting in violating various paragraphs. Damage or destruction of federal property, financial institutions, or property used in commerce may implicate other federal statutes. Uncertainty exists regarding the application of general statutes to protect intangible property like computer-stored information. The federal statutes prohibit the destruction of government records, including electronic files. Section 2071 makes it a federal crime to unlawfully conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy any record filed with a federal officer. Destruction of computer-stored government records falls under this statute if specific criteria are met. The federal statute \u00a72071 prohibits the destruction of government records, including electronic files. The section covers actions like unlawfully concealing, removing, mutilating, obliterating, or destroying any record filed with a federal officer. It is interpreted to include electronic destruction and any action that deprives the government of the use of its documents. The phrase \"any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with\" is broad and covers any item that can be filed or deposited. Section 2071 of the federal statute prohibits the destruction of government records, including electronic files. It covers actions like concealing, removing, mutilating, obliterating, or destroying any record filed with a federal officer. Violations are punishable by imprisonment and/or a fine. Section 1361 makes it a federal crime to willfully injure or commit any depredation against any property of the United States, with prosecution possible even if the offender did not know the property belonged to the government. The federal courts have allowed prosecution under \u00a71361 for destroying a federal computer using a hammer and drill. There are no reported cases of using \u00a71361 for electronic computer abuse, but an earlier version of the statute was used for such cases. Damage to federal property can result in up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Willful interference with US communications systems is also prohibited. The destruction of federal property, including computer abuse aimed at federal communications facilities, is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of $250,000 under \u00a71362. Section 1030 is the only statute specifically protecting financial institutions from property damage. Federal statutes related to transportation also cover computerized damage or destruction in interstate commerce. The provisions related to air, motor, rail, and sea transportation cover damage or destruction of computer systems within those facilities. Penalties apply for endangering the safety of aircraft or maritime navigation facilities. The focus is on protecting the operational integrity of these systems. Attacks on transportation facilities that endanger safe navigation are punishable by imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Federal jurisdiction applies if the offense occurs in American territorial waters, involves American vessels, or is committed by an American. Attacks on mass transit carry similar penalties. Computer abuse targeting rail traffic control is likely covered under these laws. Computer abuse targeting ticket control is not covered under federal law, but damaging or destroying motor traffic control systems in a way that threatens human safety falls under Section 33 of the law. Other federal crimes may also be implicated by damaging computer systems used in interstate or foreign commerce, such as those covering damage to energy facilities or interference with communications or weather operations. Most states outlaw damaging computer equipment, software, or systems, with federal crimes of terrorism including damaging a protected computer to impair medical care, cause physical injury, or threaten public health. These offenses are considered RICO predicate offenses, punishable by forfeiture of property acquired through a violation, imprisonment up to 20 years, or life if a predicate offense carries such a penalty, and/or a fine. RICO also prohibits conducting business through the patterned commission of predicate offenses. The RICO violations carry penalties of imprisonment up to 20 years, or life for certain offenses, and/or fines up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). Offenders may also face civil liability, including treble damages, costs, attorneys' fees, and injunctions. Money laundering statutes prohibit various financial activities involving proceeds from federal crimes, with penalties for domestic and international laundering, promoting further offenses, or spending over $10,000 of the proceeds. Money laundering statutes prohibit financial activities involving proceeds from federal crimes, with penalties for spending over $10,000 of the proceeds. Offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1030 are all money laundering predicate offenses, with paragraph 1030(a)(4) outlawing unauthorized access to a protected computer to further fraud. Penalties include imprisonment and fines. Paragraph 1030(a)(4) prohibits fraud through computer intrusion by accessing a protected computer without authorization, furthering fraud, and obtaining anything of value. The statute applies to computers used in interstate or foreign commerce, by the United States Government, or financial institutions. Penalties for violations include imprisonment and fines. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was amended to include computers affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The definition of protected computer was expanded to include computers located outside the United States used in a way that affects commerce. There is uncertainty regarding whether \"United States Government\" computers include all branches or just the executive branch. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act's definition of protected computer includes those used in interstate or foreign commerce. There is ambiguity in the law regarding the scope of \"United States Government\" computers, with differing interpretations of \"without authorization\" and \"exceeds authorized access.\" The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act's definition of protected computer includes authorized employees using access in unauthorized ways. Paragraph 1030(a)(4) was added in 1986 with intent to defraud being a key element, similar to credit card fraud laws. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act's paragraph 1030(a)(4) focuses on cases where a computer is central to a criminal scheme, ensuring that the value of converted property exceeds $5,000 to prevent minor offenses from being prosecuted as fraud. Case law, like United States v. Czubinski, shows the challenges in prosecuting repeated trespassers under this provision. The Court of Appeals overturned a conviction on four counts of violating paragraph 1030(a)(4) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act because the government failed to prove fraud or deprivation of value. Violations can result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. The sentencing guidelines cover both fraud and damage under paragraph 1030(a)(4), with escalators based on the amount of loss inflicted. Attempt, conspiracy, and complicity provisions apply to these offenses. Paragraph 1030(a)(4) offense entails victim restitution, potential confiscation of offense proceeds, and allows victims to seek compensatory damages. It prohibits unauthorized use of government, bank, or interstate commerce computers for fraud. Wire fraud statute 18 U.S.C. 1343 does not specify \"things of value\" but encompasses both tangible and intangible items. The wire fraud statute 18 U.S.C. 1343 condemns the use of interstate or foreign wire communications to defraud another of money or property, which may include confidential information. Section 1029 (credit card fraud) and Section 1030 (computer fraud) share a common history and have undergone fine-tuning since their initial passage in 1984. Section 1029 of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 prohibits the deception of commercial computer systems using access devices to acquire cash, credit, merchandise, or services. An access device includes various identifiers and can be used to obtain money or initiate fund transfers. The level of intent for each crime under this section varies. Section 1029 of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 establishes three types of crimes related to access devices: misuse of access devices, conduct in anticipation of misuse, and attempts or conspiracies. It requires offenders to know that their actions may deprive others of something valuable and intend for that deprivation to occur. Misuse crimes include using counterfeit or unauthorized access devices resulting in a loss or gain of over $1,000 in a year. The offenses under Section 1029 of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 involve misuse of access devices, including unauthorized access devices obtained with intent to defraud, resulting in a loss or gain of over $1,000 in a year. The preparation offenses extend to misconduct affecting interstate or foreign commerce, such as possession of counterfeit or unauthorized access devices, device-making equipment, and offering access devices without authorization. The offenses under Section 1029 of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 involve misuse of access devices, including unauthorized access devices obtained with intent to defraud. This includes illegal wiretapping equipment, possession of computer equipment to avoid telecommunications charges, and causing another to present credit card slips for payment with intent to defraud. Attempting or conspiring to commit these offenses is also punishable. Conspiracy to commit offenses under Section 1029 of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 is punishable by imprisonment for not more than half the maximum terms applicable to the underlying offense. The maximum penalties for these offenses include imprisonment for not more than 10 years for first-time offenses involving the use of counterfeit access devices, unauthorized access devices, possession of 15 or more counterfeit or unauthorized access devices, unauthorized sale of an access device, possession of a device designed to avoid telephone charges, or fraudulently causing another to present credit card slips for payment. Conspiracy to defraud the United States is a federal crime punishable by imprisonment for up to 15 years for various offenses involving possession of counterfeiting equipment, use of another's access device to defraud, possession of a scanner, or possession of equipment designed to avoid communications service charges. Unlike other fraud statutes, this statute does not require proof of seeking to deprive the government of money or property, but rather aims to impair, obstruct, or defeat the lawful function of any government department. The government can charge individuals with conspiracy to defraud the United States by showing they entered into an agreement to obstruct a lawful government function through deceitful means. Various federal statutes cover fraud, including unauthorized manipulation of federal computers as part of a scheme to defraud. These statutes include false statement and conspiracy to defraud the United States laws. Several federal criminal statutes outlaw defrauding financial institutions, including the general bank fraud provision, 18 U.S.C. 1344. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, 18 U.S.C. 1037, offers protection to all \"protected computers\" and broadens coverage provided by other laws. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (18 U.S.C. 1037) broadens coverage for protected computers and allows prosecution of hackers who use email for fraudulent purposes. It prohibits accessing a protected computer to send multiple deceptive commercial emails, altering email headers, using false identification for multiple email accounts or domain names, and using false identification for multiple IP addresses to send commercial emails. Offenders face prosecution. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (18 U.S.C. 1037) prohibits various fraudulent email activities, including sending deceptive commercial emails, altering email headers, and using false identification for email accounts. Offenders can face imprisonment for up to 5 years and fines of up to $250,000. Money laundering related to federal crimes is also outlawed under federal statutes 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957, with confiscation of property used in the offense. Money laundering involves domestic and international activities to conceal proceeds from illegal acts, promote further crimes, or spend over $10,000 of illicit funds. Offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1030 are considered money laundering predicate offenses, including credit card fraud and wire fraud. Financial transactions are broadly defined for money laundering purposes, covering any wealth transfer affecting interstate or foreign commerce or involving a financial institution. The jurisdictional element for money laundering under 18 U.S.C. 1030 is characterized as \"de minimis\" and requires only minimal proof of involvement in interstate or foreign commerce. To establish \"promotion,\" the government must show that the transaction furthers an illicit scheme. To convict someone of violating \u00a71957, the government must prove engagement in a monetary transaction with criminally derived property worth at least $10,000, knowledge of its unlawful origin, and that it was derived from specified unlawful activity. The definition of monetary transaction in money laundering closely tracks that of a financial transaction in \u00a71956, with the jurisdiction component requiring only minimal proof of involvement in interstate or foreign commerce. Most states have explicit statutory prohibitions against computer fraud, with elements varying considerably. Congress enacted subparagraph 1030(a)(7)(A) in 1996 to address unauthorized access to protected computers and extortion related to damage caused by such access. The law aims to protect computer operations, data, and programs from malicious activities. The enactment of subparagraphs 1030(a)(7)(B) and (C) in 2008 expanded the scope of the law to cover situations where criminals threaten to disclose stolen information unless paid off or cause damage by accessing a computer without authority and encrypting data. The law requires a threat or demand transmitted in interstate or foreign commerce for prosecution and conviction. The law on extortion involving protected computers requires the threat to be directed against a computer used in interstate or foreign commerce, by the federal government, or by a financial institution. Congress clarified in 2001 that this includes computers located outside the US affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The law prohibits threats to cause computer \"damage\" and covers interstate or international transmission of threats against computers, networks, and data. Unlawful threats could interfere with normal computer operation by denying access, erasing data, slowing down operation, or encrypting data for ransom. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the definition of damage under the law to include any impairment to data, programs, systems, or information. Threat statutes can provide insight into what constitutes a threat. A threat is still a threat even if it is contingent, not intended to be carried out, not directly communicated, or cryptic. The determination of whether a communication constitutes a threat depends on how a reasonable person would interpret it in context. The communication must be considered a threat by a reasonable person, regardless of the defendant's knowledge of interstate transmission. Subparagraphs 1030(a)(7)(B) and (C) address threats to breach data confidentiality and fail to undo damage unless extortionate demands are met. Intent to extort is required for violations under paragraph 1030(a)(7), different from fraud provisions. Paragraph 1030(a)(7) requires crimes to be committed with the intent to extort, anticipating the offender's intent to threaten the victim. Violations can result in imprisonment for up to five years (or up to 10 years for subsequent offenses) and/or fines up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for organizations). Victims can seek damages under subsection 1030(g) for cases involving over $5,000 in damage. The U.S.S.G. \u00a72B1.1 sentencing guideline applies, and property related to extortion offenses can be confiscated. Offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(7) can lead to confiscation and restitution orders. Attempt, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting are also punishable. Attempting or aiding in the violation carries the same penalties as committing the offense. Circumstances determine if a violation of 1030(a)(7) could be prosecuted under the Hobbs Act, which prohibits extortion affecting commerce. The Hobbs Act prohibits extortion affecting commerce, with minimal impact needed to satisfy jurisdiction. Extortion involves obtaining property through force, violence, or fear of economic harm. Paragraph 1030(a)(7) is a specific version of the Hobbs Act, leading to confiscation and restitution orders for offenses. Attempt, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting are also punishable under this law. The Hobbs Act prohibits extortion affecting commerce, with minimal impact needed to satisfy jurisdiction. Paragraph 1030(a)(7) specifically prohibits extortionate acquisition of property through threats to damage computer systems or data. Other federal statutes also prohibit threats against property made with extortionate intent, including 18 U.S.C. 875, 876, 877, and 880. Each statute prohibits communication of a threat to injure property with extortionate intent. The federal statutes prohibit threats to injure property with extortionate intent, aiming to obtain \"money or other thing of value.\" The term \"thing of value\" is broadly interpreted in federal criminal law, with courts sometimes divided on what intangibles constitute \"property.\" Section 1030 of federal statutes deals with computer-related extortion as a money laundering predicate offense, supporting prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1956 or 1957. Violating paragraph 1030(a)(7) could also lead to RICO prosecution under related statutes like the Hobbs Act or the Travel Act. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) of federal statutes prohibits trafficking in password or similar information to access a computer without authorization, especially if it affects interstate commerce or involves government computers. This provision was enacted to address hackers posting passwords on electronic bulletin boards. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) prohibits trafficking in computer passwords or similar information with intent to defraud, providing a basis for private enforcement through civil liability provisions. This offense is a lesser included offense to \u00a71029, offering plea bargaining opportunities and a means to deter unauthorized access to computer systems. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) prohibits trafficking in computer passwords or similar information with intent to defraud, providing a basis for private enforcement through civil liability provisions. Federal jurisdiction exists where the traffic affects interstate or foreign commerce, or where the password or key is to a computer used by or for the Government of the United States. The protection of paragraph 1030(a)(6) may extend to legislative and judicial branch computers, but it is unclear. The intent element for offenses affecting commerce under subparagraph 1030(e)(2) is the same as that used in paragraph 1030(a)(4)(fraud) and credit card fraud proscriptions. Offenders must act knowingly and with the intent to defraud. The punishment for the first offense is imprisonment for up to one year and/or a fine of up to $100,000 ($200,000 for organizations), while subsequent offenses can lead to imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). The general theft/damage sentencing guideline for violations of paragraph 1030(a)(6) includes imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). Proceeds and property from trafficking offenses are subject to confiscation, and defendants must pay restitution. Victims can sue for damages exceeding $5,000, including lost revenues and costs of damage assessment. Attempt, conspiracy, and complicity provisions apply to paragraph 1030(a)(6) cases. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) offenses are money laundering predicate offenses and may trigger a RICO prosecution if proceeds are laundered or if they also violate access device provisions or wire fraud. Brokering computer passwords alone may not lead to a criminal enterprise, but combined with other crimes, it could be part of a pattern. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) offenses, along with other crimes, could be part of a pattern of criminal activity used to operate an enterprise. This involves knowingly accessing a computer without authorization to obtain sensitive information that could harm the United States or benefit a foreign nation. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) of federal law prohibits the disclosure of information harmful to U.S. national defense, merging elements of espionage and computer abuse. Offenders can be punished for delivering or retaining such information improperly. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) of federal law prohibits the disclosure of classified information related to national defense, foreign relations, or atomic energy, obtained through unauthorized computer access. The validity of federal criminal laws depends on a clear connection to powers granted by the Constitution to the national government. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) of federal law prohibits the disclosure of classified information related to national defense and foreign relations, regardless of interstate or foreign commerce ties. Offenders must purposefully transmit or retain unauthorized information obtained through computer access, facing imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or fines up to $250,000. The general espionage sentencing guideline applies to violations of paragraph 1030(a)(1) of federal law, with a base sentencing level of 30 or 35 depending on the involvement of top secret information. Offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(1) are federal crimes of terrorism, with a minimum sentencing level of 32 and a sentencing range beginning at 17.5 years' imprisonment. The statute of limitations for these offenses is 8 years, pretrial detention is presumed, and conviction carries the prospect of life-time imprisonment. A violation of paragraph 1030(a)(1) is a federal crime of terrorism with severe consequences. Conviction can lead to life-time supervision by probation authorities, sentencing enhancements, and confiscation of proceeds and property used in the offense. Restitution and potential civil actions for damages or injunctive relief may also be imposed. Attempting to violate paragraph 1030(a)(7) is a separate crime. Conviction under paragraph 1030(a)(1) can result in severe consequences, including life-time supervision, sentencing enhancements, and confiscation of proceeds and property. Attempting to violate paragraph 1030(a)(7) is also a separate crime, with penalties for those who aid or conspire in the offense. Espionage prosecutions are rare, with potential overlap between paragraph 1030(a)(1) and espionage laws. The espionage statutes, including 18 U.S.C. 793, 794, and 798, outlaw gathering and disseminating defense information. Section 793 has six distinct offenses, including intruding upon military facilities to gather national defense information. Prosecutions under paragraph 1030(a)(1) and espionage laws may overlap. The espionage statutes, such as 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794, prohibit various offenses related to national defense information, including gathering, copying, and disseminating such information. Violations can result in imprisonment for up to 10 years, fines, and criminal forfeiture. Section 794 imposes harsher penalties for offenses involving gathering defense information for a foreign nation or to harm the United States, especially during wartime. The espionage statutes, such as 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794, prohibit offenses related to national defense information. Conspirators face penalties, including imprisonment and forfeiture of property. Section 798 protects military and diplomatic codes. Violations can result in imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. The economic espionage prohibition, 18 U.S.C. 1831, outlaws stealing trade secrets for a foreign entity, with offenders facing imprisonment for up to 15 years and fines up to $5,000,000. The curr_chunk discusses unauthorized access to a computer to obtain sensitive information that could harm the United States or benefit a foreign nation, with penalties of up to $5,000,000 or $10 million for organizations.

The penalties for unauthorized access to protected computers include fines, imprisonment up to 20 years, or both, for subsequent offenses or attempts. This applies to offenses causing harm specified in subparagraphs (I) through (VI) of subparagraph (A)(i), or attempts to commit punishable offenses. The penalties for unauthorized access to protected computers include fines, imprisonment up to 20 years, or both, for subsequent offenses or attempts. The United States Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have authority to investigate offenses under this section. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has primary authority to investigate offenses involving espionage, foreign counterintelligence, and information protected for national defense. This authority is exercised in accordance with an agreement between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General. The term \"computer\" is defined as a high-speed data processing device.
