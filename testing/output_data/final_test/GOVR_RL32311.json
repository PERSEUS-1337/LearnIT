    "content": "The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 8, 2004, provides $19.64 billion for Foreign Operations, which is $1.68 billion below the President's request. This amount is higher than the House and Senate's earlier proposals. The total appropriation is about $2.3 billion more than FY2004 levels, but significantly less than the previous year's total due to Iraq reconstruction funding. The core development and child survival accounts receive $4.36 billion, an increase from FY2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 8, 2004, provides $19.64 billion for Foreign Operations, which is $1.68 billion below the President's request. Within this total, H.R. 4818 allocates $2.28 billion for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), $80 million higher than the request. Additionally, bilateral assistance for family planning and reproductive health is set at $441 million, with $34 million designated for the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) subject to conditions. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides funding for relief and peace and security activities in Sudan, Haiti, and Afghanistan. The Millennium Challenge Account sees a significant reduction in funding, with the final level set at $250 million. The Act also reduces funding for the Export-Import. The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill, influenced by strong pressure from the White House, reduces funding for various programs including the Export-Import Bank, debt reduction, and the Peace Corps. This legislation is crucial for reviewing and voting on the U.S. foreign assistance budget, funding bilateral development assistance programs, and supporting initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds various humanitarian aid activities, security assistance programs for Israel and Egypt, and reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also includes aid programs for the former Soviet Union and Central/Eastern Europe, managed by USAID and the State Department. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds humanitarian aid activities, security assistance programs for Israel and Egypt, and reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also includes aid programs for the former Soviet Union and Central/Eastern Europe, managed by USAID and the State Department. Additionally, the bill covers U.S. contributions to the World Bank and other regional multilateral development banks, voluntary payments to international organizations, and appropriations for export promotion agencies. Congress uses this legislation for oversight of foreign affairs and policy-making, as there has been no comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985. Foreign Operations spending measures have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played a major role in shaping foreign aid and policy initiatives. The United States has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities through these appropriations since the end of the Cold War. The legislation has been used to utilize foreign aid in the global war on terrorism and for Afghan and Iraqi reconstruction operations. Congress applies restrictions and conditions on foreign assistance management through this appropriations measure, leading to clashes over presidential prerogatives. President Bush submitted his FY2005 federal budget request to Congress, including funding proposals for Foreign Operations Appropriations programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees held hearings and marked up draft legislation. H.R. 4818 passed the House and the Senate passed it after substituting the text of S. 2812. Conferees reached agreement on the Foreign Operations measure in November 19. H.R. 4818, originally the Foreign Operations measure, became the omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, signed by the President on December 8. The rationale for foreign aid post-World War II was to combat communism, promote economic development, and provide security assistance to allies. With the end of the Cold War, the United States launched expansive aid programs in Russia and many eastern-bloc states. However, no broad consensus developed over the new overarching rationale for U.S. aid programs. Policymakers explored alternative strategic frameworks for foreign assistance in the 1990s. During the 1990s, policymakers failed to establish a consensus on a new foreign assistance policy rationale. The Clinton Administration focused on \"sustainable development\" as the main strategy for USAID, supporting goals such as economic growth, democratic systems, population stabilization, environmental management, education, and humanitarian aid. The Bush Administration later modified these goals into three \"strategic pillars\" including economic growth, agriculture, and trade. The USAID foreign aid policy was modified around three strategic pillars: economic growth, agriculture, and trade; global health; and democracy, conflict prevention, and humanitarian assistance. A USAID White Paper identified five core operational goals: promoting transformational development, strengthening fragile states, providing humanitarian assistance, supporting U.S. geostrategic interests, and mitigating global ills like HIV/AIDS. The policy shifted after 9/11 to focus on contributing to the global war on terrorism. In 2002, President Bush established global development as a key pillar of U.S. national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign aid budget priorities began to focus on combating terrorism, with significant assistance to \"front-line\" states. Reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq also aimed to combat terrorism through foreign aid. The Bush Administration introduced initiatives to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and combat HIV/AIDS. The Millennium Challenge Corporation was established in 2004 to provide aid to countries committed to reforms. $5 billion was allocated to support development performers and address global health issues. In recent years, health problems have become a core U.S. aid objective. Congress created a separate account for Child Survival and Health activities in the mid-1990s, increased funding for international HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease programs, and President Bush announced a five-year, $15 billion effort to combat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis in 2003. Other prominent objectives since the early 1990s include supporting peace in the Middle East, fostering democratization and stability in crisis countries, facilitating democratization and free market economies in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, and suppressing international narcotics production. Foreign Operations funding levels have fluctuated widely over the past 29 years, peaking at over $34 billion in FY1985 and declining to a low-point of $14.1 billion in FY1997. This decline has been argued to seriously undermine U.S. foreign policy interests and limit the ability of American officials to influence global affairs. Foreign aid spending increased slightly in FY1998, and Foreign Operations appropriations have trended upward since then due to resources allocated for special foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives. Supplemental spending for special activities like Central American hurricane relief, Kosovo emergency assistance, Middle East peace accord support, counternarcotics initiatives in Colombia and the Andean region, and aid to front line states in the war on terror also contributed to the rise in funding. Foreign aid appropriations saw significant growth in FY2003 and FY2004, reaching unprecedented levels in the past 40 years. Aid to front line states in the war on terrorism and Iraq-war related assistance were the main drivers of this increase. Supplemental spending for Afghanistan, Iraq reconstruction, and emergency relief for Darfur further pushed spending upward, totaling $39.4 billion in FY2004. The FY2004 appropriations for foreign aid reached $39.4 billion, the highest level in real terms since the early 1960s. In FY2005, the enacted level of $19.74 billion is the largest Foreign Operations appropriation in over a decade. Supplemental funding for tsunami disaster relief and Iraq reconstruction may further increase the FY2005 total. Foreign aid and defense resources are crucial for responding to rapidly changing overseas events in the U.S. national interest. Foreign aid and defense resources often lead to supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle. Supplementals have funded major foreign policy events such as the Camp David accords, Central America conflicts, Africa famine, Panama and Nicaragua government transitions, the Gulf War, and Bosnia relief. In recent years, Congress has approved Foreign Operations supplementals exceeding $1 billion annually. Notable allocations include relief for Hurricane Mitch victims, Kosovo refugees, and embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. In recent years, Congress has approved Foreign Operations supplementals exceeding $1 billion annually. The $7.5 billion Iraq War supplemental for FY2003 represented nearly one-third of the FY2003 Foreign Operations budget. FY2004 supplemental appropriations more than doubled the Foreign Operations budget for the year. The Appropriations Committees allocate funds for Foreign Operations within the International Affairs budget function, representing about 65% of the total. The committees decide how to distribute the funds among their subcommittees, staying within the budget resolution guidelines. The Appropriations Committees allocate funds for Foreign Operations within the International Affairs budget function, representing about 65% of the total budget. The decisions on how to distribute the funds among the subcommittees are reserved for the Appropriations Committees. The budget resolution ceilings can impact the budget limitations for the House and Senate Foreign Operations subcommittees when they mark up their annual appropriation bills. In May 2004, House and Senate conferees agreed on a budget framework for FY2005 that included $821 billion in discretionary budget authority. The discretionary budget authority target for the International Affairs function was $29.28 billion, $2.2 billion less than the President's request. If the conference recommendations were followed during the appropriation process, it was likely that the funding for Foreign Operations programs would be affected. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees can allocate $29.28 billion among subcommittees differently than the President proposed for Foreign Operations. Final allocations may vary due to competing priorities and unresolved budget resolution disagreements. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated $29.28 billion among subcommittees differently than the President proposed for Foreign Operations. The resolution remained pending in the Senate due to disagreements on deficit size, budget enforcement, and tax cuts, unrelated to international affairs funding. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $19.39 billion for Foreign Operations, 9.1% less than the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the same amount for Foreign Operations as the House panel. The final total amount for Foreign Operations in H.R. 4818 exceeds the previous allocation, largely due to additional funds for the Millennium Challenge Account and $93 million in \"emergency\" funding for activities in Sudan's Darfur region. The regular Foreign Operations measure provides $19.64 billion, compared to the earlier allocation of $19.39 billion. President Bush had requested $21.32 billion for FY2005, which was 10.6% higher than the previous year's appropriations. The FY2005 budget proposal for Foreign Operations was $2.05 billion, 10.6% higher than FY2004, with a focus on anti-terrorism programs and funding increases for initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The FY2005 Foreign Operations budget proposal included significant funding increases for key initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, PEPFAR, Peace Corps, and debt reduction for the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The total funding for these elements totaled $5.23 billion, a 75% increase from FY2004. Additionally, a $100 million proposal for a Complex Foreign Crises contingency fund was included. The FY2005 Foreign Operations budget prioritized fighting terrorism with $5.3 billion, slightly less than FY2004. Approximately $40.74 billion was appropriated in FY2002-FY2004 for key coalition countries and global counter-terrorism efforts. Operations activities were $183 million less than FY2004. The FY2005 Foreign Operations budget focused on fighting terrorism with $5.3 billion, slightly less than FY2004. The largest funding increase for FY2005 was for the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), with a request of $2.5 billion and a promise to grow to $5 billion by FY2006. Congress appropriated $994 million for the MCC in FY2004. The Administration announced additional MCC funding for FY2004 and FY2005, separate from existing U.S. economic aid. Concerns exist about potential trade-offs between regular economic programs and the MCC due to budget constraints. President Bush pledged increased financial assistance for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, with $15 billion over five years, including $10 billion in additional funding. The President requested $2.8 billion for the international HIV/AIDS initiative in FY2005, with $2.2 billion in Foreign Operations. Concerns were raised about the funding falling short of the anticipated $3 billion per year. Congress increased the President's request for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS to $550 million in FY2004. The $401 million request for the Peace Corps in FY2005 aimed to maintain the President's goal of having 14,000 volunteers by FY2007. Congress has not fully funded the expansion in the past two years. The Administration proposed a $100 million contingency fund for peace and humanitarian intervention in conflict situations. The Administration proposed a $150 million Complex Crisis Fund in FY2003, but Congress deferred consideration until FY2004, where funding was denied. In FY2004, Congress approved $105 million for debt reduction in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and $75 million for the HIPC Trust Fund. In FY2004, Congress approved funding for debt relief activities, including increases in resources for the Export-Import Bank and Foreign Military Financing. Contributions to international financial institutions also saw a significant increase. In FY2004, Congress approved funding for debt relief activities and increased resources for the Export-Import Bank and Foreign Military Financing. In FY2005, U.S. payments to multilateral development banks were scheduled, clearing $59 million of U.S. arrears. FY2005 requests were affected by FY2004 supplemental spending, with some accounts showing lower requests than FY2004 totals but higher than regular Foreign Operations bill levels. Economic Support Fund was set at $2.5 billion for FY2005, 18% less than FY2004 but 19% higher than the regular Foreign Operations measure. International Narcotics and Law Enforcement spending proposed for FY2005 was 13% less than FY2004 but nearly 50% more than the regular. The FY2005 foreign operations budget request included reductions in assistance to former Soviet states and Eastern Europe, with a focus on Central Asian states and a shift away from Russia and Ukraine. The request also included a new \"core\" development aid account for international HIV/AIDS funding, complicating assessments of bilateral development and health assistance. The FY2005 foreign operations budget request included increases in core bilateral development aid accounts, with a focus on Child Survival/Health and the Global AIDS Initiative. Overall development aid spending, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation, rose by about 43% under the FY2005 request, but the impact on specific development programs was uncertain due to MCC allocations. In FY2005, nations named as HIV/AIDS focus countries or selected for MCC support would receive increased bilateral development assistance from the United States. Uganda and Zambia, as focus countries, were projected to receive double and triple the U.S. aid provided in FY2003. Mozambique, also a focus country, could see U.S. aid triple between FY2003 and FY2005. However, over 40 other bilateral aid recipients would see mostly unchanged or declining levels of assistance. Iraq is the largest current recipient of U.S. aid, while Israel and Egypt remain the largest regular recipients. In FY2005, foreign aid allocations changed significantly due to events like the September 11 attacks, the war in Iraq, and the initiation of PEPFAR. The largest regular recipients of U.S. aid are Israel and Egypt, with Iraq being the largest current recipient. Several PEPFAR countries have joined the list of top aid recipients, receiving over $100 million on average from the United States. The Administration has used economic and military assistance to maintain international coalitions for the war on terrorism. Since lifting aid sanctions in October 2001, the United States has transferred over $1.9 billion to Pakistan, along with other key coalition partners like Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, the Philippines, and India. The Andean region also receives significant aid for counternarcotics initiatives. The United States has allocated significant aid to countries like Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia, South Africa, and Nigeria through the President's international HIV/AIDS initiative. However, countries in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union, as well as Turkey, have seen a decline in aid levels in recent years. The House approved a $19.39 billion foreign aid budget request for FY2005, which was $1.93 billion below the President's request. The bill (H.R. 4818) was passed on July 15 with a $2 billion increase from FY2004 regular Foreign Operations spending. The House approved a $19.39 billion foreign aid budget for FY2005, $1.93 billion below the President's request. H.R. 4818 fully funded the $2.2 billion request for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), including $400 million for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The bill allocated $100 million for the Global ATM Fund in the Labor/HHS/Education appropriation. It reversed a proposal to reduce malaria and tuberculosis programs, providing $4.34 billion for core bilateral development aid accounts, increased basic education programs to $400 million, restored funding for vulnerable children programs to $28 million, and set trade capacity building funds at $517 million. The bill directed the Administration to restore proposed development assistance cuts to countries in Africa and set bilateral family planning assistance at $432 million. Funding for the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) was set at $25 million with restrictions. An amendment to provide $25 million for UNFPA programs in specific countries was defeated. The State Department found UNFPA to be... The State Department found UNFPA in violation of the \"Kemp-Kasten\" provision in the Foreign Operations spending bill in 2004. The House proposal included increased funding for UNDP and UNICEF, with specific funding amounts for various countries, including Israel, Egypt, Afghanistan, Jordan, Cyprus, Turkey, Lebanon, East Timor, and Indonesia. The House proposal included funding for various countries, such as Indonesia, Sudan, Pakistan, Cuba, Haiti, and Iraq reconstruction funds. The House bill proposed using Iraq reconstruction funds to cover outstanding debt and reconstituted the Coalition Provisional Authority Inspector's General office. It recommended placing the Iraq reconstruction IG in the Department of State under the Secretary of State's oversight. Additionally, the bill cut the President's request for the Millennium Challenge Corporation by half to $1.25 billion. The House bill proposed reducing funding for various accounts, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) by half to $1.25 billion. Other accounts like Peace Corps, International Narcotics/Law Enforcement, Non-Proliferation/Anti-Terrorism, Debt reduction, and World Bank/International Development Association were also reduced in funding compared to the President's request. The House debated amendments, including one to shift $570 million in military aid for Egypt to economic assistance. Secretary of State Powell strongly opposed this, citing the importance of U.S. military support for Egypt in regional peace and counterterrorism efforts. The reduction of U.S. military grants for Egypt may lead to the cancellation of prior defense contracts. The House approved amendments including banning U.S. officials from requesting UN assessment of U.S. elections, prohibiting Export-Import Bank support for entities in certain countries, and blocking Economic Support Fund assistance to ICC member countries without an Article 98 agreement with the U.S. The House approved amendments including banning U.S. officials from requesting UN assessment of U.S. elections, prohibiting Export-Import Bank support for entities in certain countries, and blocking Economic Support Fund assistance to ICC member countries without an Article 98 agreement with the U.S. Additionally, prohibited funds in the bill for assistance to Saudi Arabia and barred the use of funds to send more than 50 U.S. government employees to a conference outside the United States. The House rejected proposals to cut funding to the World Bank's International Development Association and transfer funds to other programs, including USAID child survival and maternal health programs, Millennium Challenge Corporation, and Global AIDS Initiative. Additionally, they added $5 million in funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its Foreign Operations bill (S. 2812) on September 15, 2004, with a total of $19.6 billion, $1.7 billion below the President's request for FY2005. The bill included $19.39 billion in discretionary budget authority and $225 million in \"emergency\" appropriations for global HIV/AIDS programs and African Union peacekeeping in Darfur, Sudan. The Senate bill (H.R. 4818) for Foreign Operations in FY2005 allocated $2.2 billion more than the FY2004 regular spending, excluding Iraq reconstruction funds. It included $2.42 billion for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), $220 million above the request. Additionally, funding for international HIV/AIDS totaled over $3.1 billion. The Senate bill for Foreign Operations in FY2005 allocated over $3.1 billion for international HIV/AIDS, including $400 million for the Global Fund. Other key funding levels included $4.46 billion for bilateral development aid accounts and $335 million for basic education programs. Funding for vulnerable children programs was restored to $30 million. The Senate bill for Foreign Operations in FY2005 allocated increased funds for infectious diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis, above the request. It earmarked $200 million for other infectious diseases and $75 million for malaria control programs. Additionally, bilateral family planning assistance was set at $450 million, with $34 million for the U.N. Population Fund. The bill modified controversial provisions related to family planning funding. The Senate bill for Foreign Operations in FY2005 allocated increased funds for infectious diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis, above the request. It earmarked $200 million for other infectious diseases and $75 million for malaria control programs. Additionally, bilateral family planning assistance was set at $450 million, with $34 million for the U.N. Population Fund. The bill modified controversial provisions related to family planning funding by narrowing the grounds for finding organizations in violation of restrictions and revising the President's \"Mexico City\" policy on abortion. The Senate bill for Foreign Operations in FY2005 allocated increased funds for infectious diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis, above the request. It earmarked $200 million for other infectious diseases and $75 million for malaria control programs. Additionally, bilateral family planning assistance was set at $450 million, with $34 million for the U.N. Population Fund. The bill modified controversial provisions related to family planning funding by narrowing the grounds for finding organizations in violation of restrictions and revising the President's \"Mexico City\" policy on abortion. The provision (Sec. 599C of S. 2812) allowed foreign NGOs to use non-U.S. government funds for services as long as they did not violate laws in the country where the services were provided or U.S. law. It also authorized the use of $360 million from previously appropriated Iraq reconstruction funds to cancel about $4 billion of debt owed by Iraq to the United States. The Administration sought changes in existing transfer authorities to re-allocate funds for various projects in Iraq, including security, law enforcement, oil production, employment generation, and election support. The Senate bill increased the re-allocation limit from 10% to 20%, but the White House proposed transferring nearly 45% of the original funds for water and sewage. H.R. 4818 provided over $615 million for humanitarian and relief assistance. The Senate bill allocated over $615 million for humanitarian and relief assistance to the Darfur region of Sudan, with an additional $75 million for the African Union's peacekeeping mission. This funding was in addition to previous emergency Sudan funding and included authority to transfer funds from unspent Iraq reconstruction funds. In P.L. 108-287, the Defense Department appropriation bill for FY2005, S. 2812 provided funding for various countries as requested: Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, Russia, East Timor, and Indonesia. Military training funds for Indonesia were contingent on cooperation in an FBI investigation. The State Department determined Indonesia's cooperation in the FBI investigation of the 2002 murders. Various countries endorsed funding requests, including Mongolia, Philippines, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kenya, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, and Haiti. Notable increases in funding were provided for military financing, anti-corruption programs, rebuilding military, and economic aid for debt cancellation. The Senate recommended significant reductions in funding for various accounts compared to the President's request. This included cuts to the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Export-Import Bank, USAID operating expenses, Peace Corps, Emergency fund for Complex Crisis, International Narcotics/Law Enforcement, and debt reduction. Notable reductions were seen in funding for Sudan and Haiti, with Haiti receiving $92.5 million, $65.5 million higher than the request. Congress approved the Foreign Operations conference report (Division D of H.R. 4818) on November 18, 2004, with the President signing the measure into law on December 8 (P.L. 108-447). The act provides $19.64 billion after adjustments, which is $1.68 billion below the President's request but increases amounts passed earlier by the House and Senate. Additional funds were allocated for the Millennium Challenge Account and $93 million for relief and peacekeeping support in the Darfur region of Sudan, designated as an \"emergency\" appropriation. The enacted level of emergency funds for Foreign Operations in FY2005 is about $2.3 billion more than the regular allocation, but significantly less than the total appropriation in FY2004. The Foreign Operations portion of P.L. 108-447 provides $2.28 billion for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) after applying a rescission. The enacted level of emergency funds for Foreign Operations in FY2005 is roughly $80 million higher than the request and the House-passed level, but $139 million less than passed by the Senate. The total U.S. contribution to the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in FY2005 will be $487.8 million, supplemented with carry-forward appropriations from FY2004 and the Labor/HHS/Ed appropriation measure. In FY2004, appropriations could not be transferred to the Global Fund due to a limit on U.S. support. In FY2005, $87.8 million would have been available for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs. P.L. 108-447 provides increased funding for core bilateral development aid accounts, basic education programs, vulnerable children programs, and other infectious diseases. The enacted measure increases funds for other infectious diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis, above the request. H.R. 4818 provides $90 million for malaria programs, 50% higher than requested. Bilateral family planning aid assistance is set at $441 million. $34 million is allocated for the U.N. Population Fund subject to conditions. Senate language amending policy restrictions on family planning assistance was dropped. The enacted agreement provides $404 million for relief and peace activities in Sudan, including Darfur, falling between House and Senate-passed bills. It deletes the Senate proposal for $75 million in emergency funding for the African Union's peacekeeping mission in Darfur but intends for $75 million to support African Union operations. Previous emergency funding for Sudan was approved in P.L. 108-287. The agreement sets specific country assistance levels. The agreement specifies country allocations for economic and military aid accounts, mostly matching the President's request with some modifications. Funding for Africa from Development and Child Survival accounts should be restored to FY2004 levels. Selected country aid levels include Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. Lebanon receives $35 million in economic aid, $3 million above the request. Saudi Arabia bans aid unless cooperation in combating terrorism is certified. Armenia receives $86 million, $19 million above the request. Cyprus gets $13.5 million as requested. Georgia receives $110 million, $2 million more than proposed. Russia receives $90 million in economic aid, $10.5 million higher than requested. Turkey sees a deletion of $50 million in requested military aid. East Timor receives $22 million in economic aid, up from $13.5 million proposed. Indonesia gets $138 million estimated available in economic and military aid, a reduction of about $14 million from the request. Conferees dropped $10 million for police training in Indonesia and conditioned the transfer of military aid on a Secretary of State certification regarding the Indonesian military. The US provides military aid to Indonesia based on counter-terrorism support and human rights issues. Funding for Philippines, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Haiti remains consistent with proposals. The Millennium Challenge Account sees a significant reduction from the President's request, but final funding levels are higher than earlier recommendations after pressure from the White House. The enacted measure includes cuts in various accounts compared to the President's request, such as the Export-Import Bank, USAID operating expenses, Peace Corps, and others. The Millennium Challenge Account faces a $1 billion cut, impacting operations in 17 potentially eligible countries in FY2004 and FY2005. Other reductions include funding for the World Bank, International Development Association, African Development Fund, and more. The approved legislation retains similar text as passed by the House barring ESF assistance to countries that have not signed an Article 98 agreement with the United States. The conference measure adds waiver authorities exempting NATO members, major non-NATO allies, Jordan, and Taiwan. Critics were concerned about Jordan's status, a key Arab state receiving ESF assistance but not ratifying an Article 98 agreement. The restriction does not affect a country's eligibility for Millennium Challenge Account funding. Bolivia, Lesotho, and Mali are potential MCA recipients but lack a ratified Article 98 agreement. Countries like Cyprus, Ecuador, and Peru may face ESF aid suspension due to this provision. The Continuing Resolution, operating until November 20, approved reallocating $3.46 billion from the Iraq reconstruction aid package. The Continuing Resolution approved reallocating $3.46 billion from the Iraq reconstruction aid package, including additional funds for security, debt relief, and governance programs. The Administration's full request was approved, with some reductions in the electrical and water sectors. The Continuing Resolution approved reallocating funds for Iraq reconstruction, including debt relief authorization and increased USAID operating expenses. It also authorized Overseas Private Investment Corporation operations in Iraq and extended assistance through the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill can cover various foreign policy issues, with FY2005 focusing on post-9/11 policy and spending debates. Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, combating global terrorism has become a top priority of American foreign assistance. Secretary of State Powell emphasizes that fighting terrorism is the most important objective of the Foreign Operations budget requests. Foreign aid can indirectly address factors that terrorists use in recruiting individuals for their cause by promoting jobs, education, and stability in conflict-prone nations. Assistance can be programmed in various ways to contribute to the war on terrorism. The United States has provided over $19.4 billion in assistance to \"front-line\" states in the global war on terrorism since 9/11. This aid includes military equipment, training, and support for health, education, and employment opportunities. The United States has allocated over $40 billion for bilateral terrorism-related country assistance since FY2003 and FY2004. This is more than half of the $79 billion approved for worldwide Foreign Operations spending post-9/11. The FY2005 request was $5.45 billion for \"front-line\" states, slightly reduced due to cuts in aid to Turkey. This is a significant increase from the $3.4 billion provided to these states before the attacks. The proposal for increased foreign aid post-9/11 was 60% higher than before. Countries like Jordan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, the Philippines, and others received economic and military assistance. Congress supported aid for countering terrorism, but caution is advised due to concerns about human rights and corruption in aid-receiving governments. The Administration sought waivers for aid programs to \"front-line\" states, with Congress approving specific waivers for obstacles such as missile proliferation and military coups. Additionally, the Foreign Operations appropriation bill funds global anti-terrorism programs. The State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) program, established in FY1984, aims to enhance global anti-terrorism efforts through training, equipment transfers, and advice for foreign law enforcement and security officials. Over 23,000 officials from 112 countries have participated in ATA projects. Funding for the program increased significantly after September 11, from $38 million in FY2001 to $96 million in regular FY2004 funding, with additional appropriations for expansion in Afghanistan. In FY2005, the State Department requested $128.3 million for the ATA program. The State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) program requested $128.3 million for FY2005, with most of the funding going towards training programs in \"front-line\" states, Afghan Presidential Protection, and special programs in Pakistan and Indonesia. New programs were proposed for Colombia, Malaysia, Kenya, the Philippines, and the tri-border region of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. Additionally, the State Department launched the Transnational Impact Program (TIP) in response to the 1998 bombings of American embassies in East Africa, aiming to strengthen border security systems in vulnerable countries. The State Department's Transnational Impact Program (TIP) aims to strengthen border security systems in vulnerable countries by expanding access to international criminal information. The TIP budget doubled post-9/11 but decreased in the following years. Workshops and conferences were conducted in multiple countries to better respond to terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. The State Department conducted workshops and regional conferences in 18 countries to address terrorist financing threats. An interagency review group identified 19 countries with significant threats and launched a training program with allocated funds. State Department and Treasury Department allocated funds for counterterrorism financing efforts. The FY2005 request includes significant expansion of counterterrorism financing activities, with funding proposed from the State Department's NADR budget and Treasury's Technical Assistance program. Annual Foreign Operations spending bills typically include provisions prohibiting U.S. assistance to countries supporting terrorist activities. Sec. 527 and Sec. 543 in the FY2004 funding measure imposed restrictions on aid to countries providing sanctuary to terrorists or supplying lethal military equipment. Sec. 543 prohibited U.S. aid to a government providing lethal military equipment to a terrorist supporting country. The President could waive the requirement for national interests. Certain humanitarian assistance can override terrorism restrictions. Congress supported funding levels for fighting terrorism. The conference agreement on H.R. 4818 itemizes aid amounts for front-line programs. The conference agreement on H.R. 4818 itemizes aid amounts for front-line states, with reductions in economic aid for Turkey and Pakistan. Pakistan's direct FMF funding was cut from $300 million to $150 million, with the authority to transfer an additional $150 million from prior year funds. These decisions align with recommendations in the House-passed version of the bill. The Senate plan proposed increased military aid for East Asia and Pacific \"front-line\" states, with the Philippines set to receive $55 million in FMF assistance compared to the proposed $30 million. Indonesia would have received $6 million under certain conditions, but the conference agreement reduced it to $1 million. The conference agreement also adjusted funding for terrorism-specific programs, with Anti-Terrorism Assistance set at $120 million and the Treasury Department budget for combating terrorist financing increased to $10 million. The conference agreement for FY2005 includes provisions banning U.S. assistance to countries that support terrorism or provide sanctuary to terrorists. It also prohibits aid to governments supplying lethal military equipment to terrorist-supporting countries. Additionally, the agreement includes restrictions on Economic Support Fund assistance to countries that are party to the International Criminal Court. The FY2005 conference agreement bans U.S. assistance to countries supporting terrorism or providing sanctuary to terrorists. It also prohibits aid to governments supplying lethal military equipment to terrorist-supporting countries. Restrictions on Economic Support Fund assistance apply to countries party to the International Criminal Court. The Nethercutt amendment did not include waivers for ESF aid cut-offs, but the conference measure inserts waivers for NATO members, major non-NATO allies, including Jordan, and Taiwan. Critics were concerned about Jordan's status as a key Arab state receiving ESF assistance without ratifying an Article 98 agreement. The conference agreement includes provisions on ESF assistance and Article 98 agreements. Countries like Bolivia, Lesotho, and Mali may receive MCA funding without ratifying Article 98. However, countries like Cyprus, Ecuador, and Peru could face ESF aid suspension. Aid to Saudi Arabia is contingent on cooperation in combating terrorism. H.R. 4818 includes $25,000 in military training funds for Saudi Arabia. The United States provided training funds for Saudi Arabia under the International Military Education and Training program. There was a debate over cutting off foreign aid to Saudi Arabia due to concerns about their reliability in the war on terrorism. President Bush proposed increasing foreign economic assistance through the Millennium Challenge Account. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is managed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and provides assistance to developing nations through a competitive selection process. The initiative focuses on promoting good governance, healthcare, education, and entrepreneurship. If fully implemented, it would be one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in decades, signaling a significant shift in how the United States delivers economic assistance. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) managed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) aims to change the way the US invests in economic assistance. It focuses on linking economic development to free market principles and democratic policies, with a $5 billion commitment and a competitive process based on performance indicators. This new initiative, authorized by Congress in 2004, emphasizes good governance and involvement of civil society in program proposals. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) managed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) aims to change the way the US invests in economic assistance by focusing on linking economic development to free market principles and democratic policies. The MCC participation criteria are based on performance indicators related to good governance, economic freedom, and investing in people, with a focus on fighting corruption. Country selection is competitive and includes lower-middle income countries with per capita incomes below roughly $3,035. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) managed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) focuses on linking economic development to free market principles and democratic policies. Country selection is competitive and based on performance indicators related to good governance, economic freedom, and fighting corruption. If a country falls below the median on the corruption indicator, it may be disqualified unless recent trends suggest otherwise. Administration officials consider missing or old data, general trends, and recent government steps when making annual decisions. Selected countries must submit program proposals developed through national discussions, but eligibility does not guarantee an aid grant. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) evaluates program submissions from countries based on economic growth and poverty reduction goals. Only Compacts meeting MCC criteria will be funded, supporting programs lasting 3-5 years with significant U.S. economic assistance. The MCC, an independent entity, manages the initiative separate from other government departments. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is funded by the Treasury and USAID, with plans for a staff of 200 led by a Senate-confirmed CEO. A Board of Directors oversees operations and country selections. The budget for FY2004 was reduced to $994 million from the requested $1.3 billion, with proposed budgets of $2.5 billion for FY2005 and a commitment to a $5 billion program in FY2006. Legislation authorizing and funding the MCC was passed on January 23, 2004. The MCC was authorized and funded in January 2004, leading to a 90-day period for the Corporation to form, consult with Congress, and select participant countries. The Board of Directors quickly established the program, identified candidate countries, and selected 16 countries for the first year of operations. Additionally, 13 countries were named as threshold nations. The MCC was authorized and funded in January 2004, leading to the selection of 16 countries for the first year of operations. Threshold nations, which just missed qualifying, will also be supported. The Board of Directors approved Under-Secretary of State Larson as interim CEO, followed by the confirmation of Paul Applegarth as the permanent CEO by the Senate on May 5. CEO Applegarth has extensive experience in international development and the private sector. The MCC Board issued a list of 63 \"candidate\" countries for possible selection as MCA participants in FY2004. These countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible for assistance, and the Corporation sent an overview of the criteria and methodology to Congress on March 5, 2004. The MCC Board identified 63 candidate countries for MCA participation in FY2004. The eligibility criteria remained largely unchanged from the previous outline, with 16 performance indicators utilized. Data sources shifted to national governments in some cases. Additional criteria from Congress were addressed using supplemental data and qualitative information. The MCC Board identified 63 candidate countries for MCA participation in FY2004, with eligibility criteria remaining largely unchanged. The criteria include recognizing rights of people with disabilities, sustainable natural resource management, worker rights, and social investments in women and girls. Despite suggestions for changes, the Corporation did not propose significant revisions to the criteria and methodology, leading to questions about the seriousness of considering alternative approaches and future revisions. The MCC announced revised performance indicators for FY2005 selection process, including lowering the inflation rate threshold to 15%. A new indicator for girls' primary education completion rates will be used. Congress added requirements to measure country performance on women and girls issues. Further changes for FY2006 are being considered, such as lowering the inflation level to 10% and adding a measurement for natural resource management. The MCC has created a working group to study possibilities for a measurement related to natural resource management. They are also reviewing indicators to better measure trade barriers linked with economic growth and developing a more comprehensive indicator for government commitment to entrepreneurship. Additionally, they are considering gender-related indicators. The MCC Board of Directors determined 16 countries eligible for FY2004 MCA funding and invited program proposals, raising questions and concerns during the selection process. The MCC Board of Directors applied discretion in selecting countries for funding based on performance trends, recent policy actions, and other factors. Ten countries met the criteria, while ten others required Board discretion. Countries had to perform above the median on indicators in three policy clusters and on corruption. Some countries, like Cape Verde, Lesotho, and Sri Lanka, met the criteria but fell below average on certain indicators. The MCC Board selected countries based on performance trends and recent policy actions. Some countries, like Lesotho and Sri Lanka, fell below average on certain indicators but were chosen due to positive trends. Others, such as Bolivia, Georgia, and Mozambique, were selected despite not meeting all criteria because of corrective actions. Countries like Bhutan, Mauritania, and Vietnam passed the corruption hurdle but scored low on Political Rights and Civil Liberties indicators. Guyana was not selected for MCC despite passing hurdles, scoring low on Fiscal Policy. Disagreements expected in final country list announcement. Representative Lowey argued for East Timor's selection, CEO Applegarth cited lack of data and premature judgment on its performance. The selection process for MCC eligibility considered various countries like East Timor, Kenya, Albania, Malawi, and Moldova. Some countries narrowly missed out due to corruption scores. Small island states like Kiribati, Sao Tome, and Tonga were not selected, possibly due to data limitations. Despite some questions over eligibility, the process addressed concerns raised in the past year. The MCC Board of Directors selected eight African nations as part of the FY2005 eligible countries, addressing concerns about under-representation. The selection process aimed to avoid geostrategic considerations and focus on policy performance, with Indonesia being a potential candidate if not for corruption issues. The MCC Board of Directors selected Morocco as a new country for FY2005, while 15 out of 16 nations from FY2004 remained eligible. Cape Verde was excluded due to exceeding the GNI ceiling but remains eligible for MCA support using FY2004 funds. The Board's selections showed continuity from FY2004 decisions but also applied discretionary authority differently for FY2005. The selected countries for MCC showed a strong commitment to economic, governance, and social policy reforms. It was expected that these countries would score well in performance comparisons with their income peers. Policy performance changes may not be immediately reflected in data updates. Selection dates for FY2004 and FY2005 were close together, leading to less noticeable changes in data. Between May and November, data sources for performance indicators did not update, leading to countries being reviewed based on similar data as the previous year. The addition of new countries in FY2005 lowered the median for comparisons, making it likely that countries scoring well in FY2004 would score the same or better in FY2005. For example, Bolivia's corruption score improved compared to the median due to the addition of new countries. In FY2005, the addition of new countries affected the median for comparisons, with Bolivia scoring above the median despite no change in corruption score. The core set of low-income countries competing for MCA selection is unlikely to change significantly, reducing the impact on the median. The MCC Board departed from previous rounds by not selecting countries that met MCA performance criteria, leading to questions about the selection process in FY2005. The MCC Board did not select 10 countries for FY2005, including some that met the criteria but were still excluded. The reasons for these exclusions have not been clearly explained. The MCC Board did not select 10 countries for FY2005, including some that met the criteria but were still excluded. Reasons for exclusion were not clearly explained, but scoring \"substantially below\" has become a de-facto criteria. For example, the Philippines did not qualify due to low scores in health expenditures and fiscal policy. Other nations not chosen also had scores in the 25th percentile. Funding reductions may have also played a role in limiting qualifying countries. The Administration's requested appropriations for FY2004/FY2005 may be reduced by 25%-30% due to congressional debate on the budget. This could result in fewer countries receiving assistance or smaller grants. Three countries - Burkina Faso, Guyana, and the Philippines - have been invited to participate in the Threshold Program to strengthen their qualifications for future assistance. The Board of Directors avoided using discretionary authority to qualify countries that did not meet performance indicators, selecting Bolivia, Georgia, and Mozambique for assistance in FY2005. In May, the Board selected Bolivia, Georgia, and Mozambique for assistance despite not meeting the corruption criteria. Five nations passed performance indicators but not corruption, including Malawi, Moldova, Paraguay, Tanzania, and Ukraine. The United States will help non-qualifying countries improve weak areas to be competitive for future MCA funding. Congress limited the use of MCA appropriations for this purpose to 10%. The MCC allocated $40 million for countries that narrowly missed qualifying for FY2004 funding, with an additional amount to be announced for FY2005. Threshold Countries selected for assistance include Albania, East Timor, Kenya, Sao Tome and Principe, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, Burkina Faso, Guyana, Malawi, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Zambia. The Threshold Program aims to help countries implement policy reforms and institutional changes to meet MCA performance criteria. The Threshold Program aims to assist countries in implementing policy reforms and institutional changes to meet MCA performance criteria. If the concept paper shows sufficient commitment to reform and promise of success, a Threshold Country Plan will be prepared with a program schedule, progress measurement means, and financing requirements. USAID oversees the implementation of Threshold Country Plans and collaborates with countries to identify implementing partners. Funding for the Threshold Program is not guaranteed and is based on the quality of the Country Plan. The MCC requires close coordination between the Corporation's CEO and USAID, with USAID supporting MCC programs in eligible countries. USAID may need to adjust its own programs in MCA countries to align with MCC goals, as MCC programs are expected to be larger in scale. USAID spending in MCA countries will fall below MCC Compacts amounts. In Mongolia, U.S. aid totals $10-$12 million annually, making the U.S. the fourth largest donor in 2002. In Ghana, Senegal, and Sri Lanka, USAID maintains larger programs but spends less than other countries. USAID Administrator Natsios stated that the Agency will not withdraw or cut programs in MCA countries but will not increase spending either. Congress appropriated $994 million for FY2004 MCC programs and considered a $2.5 billion request for FY2005. The Administration sought a $2.5 billion request for FY2005 MCC programs, the largest increase in the Foreign Operations appropriations proposal. Concerns were raised about the availability of sufficient funds to support MCC programs in all selected countries, especially if more countries qualify than meet the strict criteria. Representative Kolbe speculated that by 2006, as many as 40 countries might qualify, which could not be fully supported with likely funding levels and might raise unrealistic expectations. The MCC may not be able to fund all eligible countries due to budget constraints, even with a $2.5 billion request for FY2005. The GAO estimated that 8-13 Compacts could be adequately funded with $3.5 billion, suggesting that not all approved countries may receive funding. If Congress reduces the funding, the MCC may struggle to support programs that have a meaningful impact on economic growth and poverty reduction goals. This could lead to further scrutiny of the Board's selection process. The House and Senate passed Foreign Operations bills (H.R. 4818) with substantial reductions to the President's MCC request for FY2005. The House cut the MCC proposal by half to address budget constraints and other priorities, leading to disappointment from the executive branch. An amendment to eliminate all MCC appropriations was defeated in the House. The House defeated an amendment to eliminate all MCC appropriations (41-379). The House Committee expressed concern over Corporation plans to enter into multi-year Compacts without total funding commitment in the signing year. The bill now requires complete funding availability for Compacts from existing appropriations. The House Committee recommended limiting Compacts to a 3-4 year period instead of the MCC's envisioned 3-5 years. The Senate proposed a significant cut to the President's MCC request to $1.12 billion, but still expressed strong support for the program. The Senate panel requested a report on how the MCC will monitor and evaluate program Compacts, recommended using funds to measure country performance with respect to people with disabilities, urged the MCC to utilize expertise of higher education institutions, and eliminate elements with adverse environmental impact from Compact proposals. The Senate Committee also emphasized rural electrification as a significant part of a country's rural development goal. Conferees settled on $1.5 billion for the MCC in FY2005, requiring full funding for multi-year compacts selected in FY2004 and FY2005. The measure further amends MCA authorizing legislation with a more specific definition. The measure amends MCA legislation to define performance criteria for \"investing in people\" related to government policies promoting health, education, and well-being. Reduced funding may limit program support initially. Disagreement exists on allocating $3 billion for USAID development assistance. Congressional priorities include child survival, education, and HIV/AIDS programs. The Administration has supported child survival, basic education, and efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Officials object to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities at the expense of other development sectors. Congressional disagreements have led to reduced resources for economic growth and the environment in past budget cycles. In recent years, development aid funding fell significantly, but Congress increased assistance for FY2003 and FY2004 to fund program priorities. The Bush Administration introduced USAID core goals focused on Global Health, Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Conflict Prevention. They also launched the Global Development Alliance to expand public/private partnerships in development programs. Administration officials argue that congressional practices limit their flexibility in resource allocation. The Global Development Alliance (GDA) by USAID aims to coordinate and integrate development efforts with private foundations, NGOs, universities, and for-profit organizations. Despite initial ambitious funding requests, the GDA has received modest allocations, with a peak of $20 million in FY2002. USAID seeks $10 million for FY2005. The debate over funding allocations highlights the importance of foreign economic assistance as a tool of U.S. foreign policy. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. has used foreign economic assistance as a key tool in its foreign policy. Congress approved initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Account and PEPFAR, increasing funding for development programs. The President's National Security Strategy in 2002 established global development as a crucial aspect of national security. In FY2005, the President proposed a significant increase in development assistance, with resources concentrated in activities benefiting around 30 countries. The Administration's foreign aid budgets have raised questions about resource concentration and a broad-based development strategy. While some countries will see significant growth in aid, others may experience flat or lower levels. Critics argue that budget cuts violate pledges to maintain \"core\" programs. The FY2004 and FY2005 budget requests violated pledges to maintain \"core\" programs, raising concerns about the coordination of foreign aid activities among multiple agencies. Policy making and implementation responsibilities have shifted from USAID to new State Department office and Millennium Challenge Corporation. The FY2004 and FY2005 budget requests proposed a $2.75 billion budget for \"core\" development assistance, a 14% reduction from FY2004. However, when including funds for the State Department's Global AIDS Initiative office and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the total development aid request for FY2005 was $6.7 billion, a 43% increase from FY2004. The FY2005 budget proposal includes a $6.7 billion total development aid request, a 43% increase from FY2004. Funding for agriculture, environment, basic education, and global health programs would see reductions in FY2005. In FY2005, the Global Health category saw mixed funding changes. HIV/AIDS funding was reduced by over $300 million, but a $1.45 billion proposal for the State Department's Global AIDS Initiative offset this cut. The U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria was reduced from $400 million in FY2004 to $100 million in FY2005. Other programs under Global Health also experienced reductions, including vulnerable children activities, malaria, tuberculosis, family planning, and reproductive health. In FY2005, the Bush Administration proposed reduced funding levels for various Foreign Operations accounts, including family planning activities. However, there was a significant increase in resources requested for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs. The total funds requested for HIV/AIDS in FY2005, including malaria and tuberculosis, amounted to $2.2 billion, a 37% increase from the previous year. Additionally, the Administration sought an additional $623 million for international HIV/AIDS from non-Foreign Operations accounts. The FY2005 funding proposal included $2.82 billion across all appropriation measures. A contentious issue was the President's proposal for a $200 million annual contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Congress increased the U.S. contribution to $350 million for FY2003 and authorized up to $1 billion for FY2004. The FY2004 appropriation for the Global Fund was $550 million, while the President proposed $200 million for FY2005. The FY2005 Foreign Operations bill conference agreement on H.R. 4818 increases funding for HIV/AIDS programs beyond the President's request, but sharply reduces the proposed Millennium Challenge Account budget. Overall, the final measure cuts the President's $6.7 billion request by about $850 million, with the majority of the cut coming from the MCA appropriation. However, there are increases for Child Survival/Health and Development Assistance accounts. The Global AIDS Initiative funding managed by the State Department's Special Coordinators Office falls by $75 million from the request, but is offset by increases in other accounts. The conference agreement for the FY2005 Foreign Operations bill increases funding for HIV/AIDS programs, providing $2.28 billion for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The allocation of funds differs from the Administration's request, with attention focused on the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Senate's approved amount of $2.42 billion included $150 million in \"emergency\" appropriations that were not adopted by conferees. The conference agreement for the FY2005 Foreign Operations bill increased funding for HIV/AIDS programs, providing $2.28 billion for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The Global ATM Fund was allocated $435 million, sourced from various sources including carry-over funds from FY2004. Congress set a cap on the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund, limiting it to $459 million for FY2004. Another aspect of the PEPFAR initiative is support for bilateral malaria and tuberculosis programs. The conference agreement on H.R. 4818 increased funding for bilateral malaria and tuberculosis programs under the PEPFAR initiative from $155 million to $170 million in FY2005. Total funding for all PEPFAR components in FY2005 is $2.92 billion, 24% higher than last year. The House and Senate measures provide funding for bilateral development assistance, with a focus on economic growth as USAID's main long-term goal. The House Appropriations Committee addressed concerns about earmarks in health and education programs, encouraging USAID to increase funds for economic growth activities. U.S. population assistance and family planning programs overseas have been a topic of debate for nearly two decades, with the Administration requesting $399.2 million for international reproductive health and family planning in FY2005. The FY2005 budget requested $399.2 million for international reproductive health and family planning programs, with a proposed $25 million for the UNFPA subject to certain conditions. Congressional debates have focused on whether the US should fund UNFPA due to concerns about coercive family planning in China and abortion-related issues. The US has a history of concerns over coercive family planning, particularly regarding abortion restrictions in bilateral USAID population aid grants. The issue of funding UNFPA has been contentious, with past concerns about forced abortion and sterilization in China leading to funding restrictions. The Kemp-Kasten amendment bars US funds to organizations involved in coercive abortion or sterilization programs. In 1993, President Clinton determined that UNFPA, despite its presence in China, was not involved in coercive programs. Congress appropriated about $25 million for UNFPA, with a directive to reduce the amount by what UNFPA spent in China. The U.S. contribution fluctuated between $21.5 million and $25 million. In FY2002, President George W. Bush requested $25 million for UNFPA, but Congress provided \"not more than\" $34 million. The White House placed a hold on UNFPA funds in January 2002 due to concerns about coercive practices in China. The White House placed a hold on UNFPA funds in January 2002 due to concerns about coercive practices in Chinese counties where UNFPA concentrates its programs. An investigation team in September 2001 found evidence of forced abortions and sterilizations in UNFPA counties, while a review team commissioned by UNFPA in October 2001 found no evidence of support for coercive practices in China. The State Department sent an investigative team to China to review UNFPA programs in May 2002. The team found no evidence of UNFPA supporting coercive practices, but noted that China maintains coercive elements in its population programs. Chinese leaders prioritize population control. The United States should release no more than $34 million to UNFPA, but withhold funds until China stops coercion in population programs. Secretary of State Powell decided to redirect funds to other family planning activities despite UNFPA's lack of direct involvement in coercive practices. The State Department found that UNFPA's involvement in China's family planning program enables coercive abortion practices by the Chinese government, triggering restrictions on U.S. funds. The Chinese government imposes fines on families exceeding approved child limits, coercing women into abortions. (Source: State Department's analysis at http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/other/12128.htm) Critics opposed the Administration's decision to withhold funding for UNFPA due to concerns about access to family planning programs in 140 countries and the potential impact on other international organizations operating in China. Despite legislative attempts to reverse the decision, Congress approved no funding for UNFPA in FY2003. In FY2003, Congress approved $34 million for UNFPA in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, with the condition that the President certifies UNFPA is not involved in coercive family planning. The Administration transferred $59 million to USAID from FY2002 and FY2003 appropriations meant for UNFPA to fund USAID's family planning programs. The State Department's justification in a September 2003 letter to Congress stated that UNFPA still supports coercive abortion programs. In FY2003, Congress approved $34 million for UNFPA with the condition that the President certifies UNFPA is not involved in coercive family planning. Section 572 of the FY2003 Foreign Operations Appropriations required the President to issue a statement before restoring U.S. funding to UNFPA. The FY2004 Foreign Operations bill earmarked $34 million for UNFPA subject to Kemp-Kasten conditions. Congress directed how previously withheld funds would be disbursed, resolving a dispute over their allocation. The FY2004 appropriation specified that $34 million withheld in FY2002 would be used for family planning programs in twelve countries. The $25 million in FY2003 funds earmarked for UNFPA would be redirected to assist vulnerable children and a new initiative within the Child Survival and Health account. The State Department announced on July 16, 2004, that UNFPA was found in violation of the Kemp-Kasten amendment, leading to the withholding of the $34 million designated in the FY2004 appropriation measure. The State Department found no key changes in UNFPA's programs to allow U.S. funding to resume under the Kemp-Kasten provision. The debate on international family planning and abortion policy dates back to 1973, with restrictions on U.S. funds for abortion-related activities and coercive family planning programs. The \"Mexico City\" policy in the mid-1980s restricted funds for NGOs involved in abortion-related activities. The Mexico City policy restricted U.S. funding for family planning organizations involved in abortion-related work. President Clinton reversed this policy in 1993, allowing funding as long as no U.S. money was used for abortions. Congress debated overturning the prohibition in subsequent years, but White House vetoes kept the policy in place. The House and Senate had opposing positions on the issue between 1996 and 2000, causing delays in enacting Foreign Operations spending measures. The Mexico City policy restricting U.S. aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or lobbying to change abortion laws was reinstated. The Senate rejected House provisions on the policy, leading to interim arrangements that did not resolve the controversy but allowed the Foreign Operations measure to move forward. The annual compromise removed Mexico City restrictions but reduced population assistance to $385 million and metered the availability of funds. In FY2000, the issue became linked with paying U.S. arrears owed to the United States. In FY2000, the Mexico City policy was linked with paying U.S. arrears owed to the United Nations. President Clinton reluctantly agreed to modified abortion restrictions, which were included in legislation signed by the President. The restrictions could be waived for $15 million in grants, with no major impact on USAID family planning programs. Congress allowed the new President to set policy in FY2001, with none of the $425 million appropriation being restricted. President Bush issued a Memorandum on January 22, 2001, directing the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, stating taxpayer funds should not be used for abortions. He maintained the $425 million funding level for population assistance, emphasizing the importance of voluntary family planning services. The press secretary emphasized that restrictions on family planning services should not limit organizations from providing post-abortion care. USAID issued policy language to implement the President's directive on February 15, 2001. Critics fear that the certification requirement may lead to cutbacks in services, resulting in more unwanted pregnancies and abortions. Opponents argue that the new conditions on USAID funding undermine relations with foreign NGOs and multilateral groups, imposing a \"gag\" order on promoting changes to abortion laws. Critics note that this would be unconstitutional if applied to American groups. Supporters of the certification requirement believe that money is fungible, allowing organizations to use USAID resources for permitted activities while diverting other funds for abortions or lobbying efforts. Since the reinstatement of the Mexico City policy in 2001, there have been efforts to reverse the policy through various bills, with only one including language in the Senate FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriations bill. The approved amount for bilateral family planning/reproductive health programs in FY2005 is $441 million, with $34 million earmarked for UNFPA. The $34 million earmarked for UNFPA is subject to Kemp-Kasten restrictions. If UNFPA is deemed ineligible, $25 million will be transferred to USAID-managed family planning programs. Previously, $25 million and $34 million were allocated for UNFPA in the House- and Senate-passed Foreign Operations bills. The Senate measure allocated $34 million for UNFPA, with $25 million withheld for FY2004 available for USAID family planning activities. A floor amendment specified that if UNFPA is ineligible for funds in FY2005, the $34 million earmark may not be used for any other purpose without subsequent legislation. The House rejected a proposal to limit UNFPA funds to specific countries, and conferees rejected two Senate provisions opposed by the Administration. The Senate passed provisions amending the Kemp-Kasten language to narrow grounds for finding UNFPA in violation. The amendments included specifying that organizations must directly support coercive abortions or sterilizations to be denied U.S. support, and that funding cannot be denied solely based on a country's coercive practices. This was seen as targeting China. Another amendment aimed to revise the President's \"Mexico City\" policy on foreign NGOs. The Senate passed provisions amending the Kemp-Kasten language to narrow grounds for finding UNFPA in violation, targeting China. The amendments specified that organizations must directly support coercive abortions or sterilizations to be denied U.S. support. Another amendment aimed to revise the President's \"Mexico City\" policy on foreign NGOs, allowing them to conduct health services with non-U.S. government funds as long as they comply with local laws. The reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan face challenges due to security concerns, infrastructure destruction, and humanitarian needs. International aid and resources are being provided, but long-term commitment and significant funding of $15-$30 billion over the next decade are required for a stable, democratic Afghanistan. The international community has shown strong willingness to assist in the restoration of Afghanistan since 2002. The 9/11 Commission Report emphasizes the need for a sustained, long-term commitment by the United States and the international community to Afghanistan's stability and security, with recommendations for greater security, robust counternarcotics activities, and increased flexibility in relief and reconstruction funding. Key developments since 9/11 include security plans, military operations, the presence of ISAF, and training efforts in Afghanistan. The key developments in Afghanistan post-9/11 include the establishment of ISAF, training of Afghan National Army and police, demobilization of militias, and formation of reconstruction teams. The political framework was established through conferences, loya jirgas, and elections. Reconstruction efforts began with the Tokyo Conference in 2002. Challenges remain with security and narcotics trafficking. The challenges facing Afghanistan today include lack of security and growing narcotics trafficking. Insurgency by remnants of the Taliban has created insecurity, hindering reconstruction efforts. Former commanders maintain control over their areas, making it difficult for the national government to extend control, provide aid, and progress on reconstruction. Afghanistan's economy heavily relies on drug trafficking, raising concerns of becoming a \"narco state.\" The US has 17,000 troops under Operation Enduring Freedom, while ISAF has 9,000 troops from 26 nations. NATO-led ISAF forces increased troop levels to secure the 2004 elections in Afghanistan, with additional troops from Spain and Italy. NATO assumed command in 2003, with the Kabul Multinational Brigade led by \"Eurocorps.\" Calls for ISAF expansion outside Kabul led to UN Security Council Resolution 1510. US forces are training the Afghan National Army for future security. The Afghan National Army aims to reach a size of 70,000 troops to maintain security and allow foreign forces to leave Afghanistan. Currently, they have 15,000 troops deployed in 16 provinces. Efforts to demobilize and integrate private militiamen have been slow, with estimates varying on the number of fighters to be disarmed. The United States and Germany are also training a national police force, with about 28,000 trained so far. The United States and Germany are training a national police force in Afghanistan, with about 28,000 trained nationwide. The Pentagon has initiated the establishment of \"provincial reconstruction teams\" (PRTs) composed of U.S. military personnel to promote stability and reconstruction in the country. Germany and other coalition countries have established Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in various provinces of Afghanistan, with plans for NATO to take over more PRTs in the North and Northeast regions. The UK has set up new ISAF PRTs in Meymaneh and plans for another in Baghlan, while Germany has set up an ISAF PRT in Faizabad. Additionally, the UK-led PRT in Mazar has added satellites in Sari Pol, Samangan, and Shebergan. Several new ISAF/NATO PRTs have been established in Afghanistan, with additional personnel and equipment. However, there are shortages in personnel and equipment that hinder the organization's ability to expand its presence. The United States is focusing on PRTs in the South and East, with plans for up to 34 Coalition or ISAF PRTs in each province. The concept of PRTs has received mixed reviews from the aid community. The PRT concept in Afghanistan has mixed reviews from the aid community. Some see positive impacts on security and reconstruction activities, while others have concerns about the civil-military relationship. Factional fighting and criminal activity have disrupted relief efforts, leading to temporary suspensions of aid operations in targeted areas. The Afghan Nongovernmental Organization Security Office (ANSO) maintains a database to track security incidents for better information sharing. The central government's strength is crucial for international aid success in Afghanistan. A political transition roadmap was established in a UN conference in Bonn in 2001. The transitional government is stable, but tensions exist within factions and with provincial leaders. A new constitution was adopted in 2004, and national elections were held to validate Karzai's leadership. Northern Alliance leaders pushed for simultaneous parliamentary elections for checks and balances. Leaders pushed for simultaneous parliamentary elections to serve as a check on presidential authority, in line with the Bonn agreement. The presidential election took place in October 2004, with parliamentary elections expected in April 2005. The Afghan-United Nations Committee registered 10.5 million voters, with 42% being women. Insecurity initially affected registration rates, but they later increased sharply, raising concerns. President Karzai endorsed the major election law for the 2004 elections, with 18 candidates certified to run. Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran were also registered. Election security was a key concern due to fears of violence and voter intimidation. The vote on October 9, 2004, was conducted under tight security and observed by international monitors. The 2004 Afghan election, monitored by the International Republican Institute, saw minor insurgent attacks and heavy turnout. Some candidates boycotted due to alleged fraud, but most objections were dropped after investigation. Karzai won with 55.4% of the vote, avoiding a runoff. In Afghanistan, the 2004 election was won by Karzai with 55.4% of the vote, avoiding a runoff. Progress on reconstruction includes the return of 3 million refugees, enrollment of 2.9 million children in school, and some women participating in the workforce and politics. Challenges include collapsed infrastructure, rugged terrain, and extreme weather affecting access to aid and healthcare. The international recovery and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan involves various stakeholders and aims to achieve political stability, access to basic services, economic growth, and independence from foreign aid. Significant aid and resources have been provided by the international community, with Italy contributing to judicial reform. The international community, including Italy, the United States, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, is involved in reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. Discussions are ongoing about assessing progress, pace, and effectiveness, as well as the availability of sufficient aid. Concerns exist about absorption capacity and the allocation of additional funds. The United States has provided significant financial support, with Kabul being a major recipient. At a conference in Tokyo in 2002, the U.S. pledged $297 million for reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. In January 2002, the U.S. pledged $297 million for Afghanistan reconstruction efforts at a conference in Tokyo. The international community pledged $4.5 billion, with Congress approving about $3 billion for Afghanistan through various appropriation bills. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 authorized $3.3 billion over four years for U.S. reconstruction efforts. The legislation included $2 billion for humanitarian, reconstruction, and enterprise fund assistance through FY2006, $300 million for military drawdowns, and a call for an expanded International Security Assistance Force with an additional $1 billion over two years. The Administration requested $929 million for Afghanistan in FY2005, covering development programs targeting agriculture, private sector growth, environment, education, health, and democracy. The Administration requested $929 million for Afghanistan in FY2005, including funds for economic support, counter-narcotics, anti-terrorism/demining, and military assistance. These funds would support various programs such as infrastructure repair, strengthening governmental institutions, training police forces, improving the judicial sector, and removing landmines. The conference agreement on H.R. 4818 provides a total of $980 million for Afghanistan in FY2005, including $401 million for military assistance to train and equip the Afghan National Army. Peacekeeping funds of $24 million would pay ANA soldiers' salaries during training and after graduation. Other provisions include $2 million for the Independent Human Rights Commission, $2 million for reforestation activities, $50 million for Afghan women and girls, and $2 million for medical and reconstruction aid to Afghan communities. The House and Senate are considering amendments to the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act (P.L. 107-327) approved in 2002, including a requirement for a five-year strategy report on development and security needs in Afghanistan. Additionally, there are provisions for vetting members of the Afghan National Army for involvement in terrorism, human rights violations, and drug trafficking. The House bill also includes a new title on counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan. The bill authorizes $2.4 billion for Afghanistan, including development aid, security-related economic support, military assistance, counter-narcotics, and anti-terrorism funding, and peacekeeping purposes. These amounts are more than two and a half times greater than the approved FY2005 appropriation for Afghanistan. The United States and the international community agreed in 2003 to introduce economic reform and democratic government to post-war Iraq. The estimated cost of Iraq reconstruction is provided in a World Bank and U.N. Development Group needs assessment. The World Bank/U.N. assessment estimated the cost of reconstruction for 14 sectors in Iraq at $36 billion over four years, with an additional $19.4 billion for security, oil, and other sectors. Total projected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion, funded by U.S. foreign aid, international donors, and Iraqi oil export profits. Iraqi funds, mainly from oil export profits, are used for government operating costs and reconstruction. The FY2003 Emergency Supplemental allocated $2.48 billion for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund for various sectors. The President has control over the Fund, with transfers to specific departments. The FY2004 Emergency Supplemental (P.L. 108-106) added $18.4 billion to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF), allowing funds to go directly to the CPA. The appropriation focused on addressing security and infrastructure concerns, providing grants instead of loans. An Inspector General office was established to monitor fund usage, with extensive reporting requirements. Additionally, $983 million was allocated for CPA operating expenses. The FY2004 Emergency Supplemental added $18.4 billion to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) for security and infrastructure. $983 million was allocated for CPA operating expenses. Congress approved a $3.46 billion re-allocation proposal by the Administration in September 2004. The FY2004 Emergency Supplemental added $18.4 billion to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) for security and infrastructure, with $983 million allocated for CPA operating expenses. Department of Defense appropriations covered FY2003 operational expenses of the CPA and contributed to repair of Iraq's oil infrastructure, training of the Iraqi army, and the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP). USAID also used its own funds for humanitarian programs in Iraq. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was dissolved in June 2004 as Iraq regained sovereignty, with the United States continuing to provide assistance programs. The United States is providing assistance to the Iraqi government through its U.S. embassy under Ambassador John Negroponte. The embassy is expected to employ about 1,000 U.S. and 700 Iraqi staff. A temporary Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) has been created within the U.S. embassy to supplant CPA assistance efforts. The CPA's Program Management Office (PMO) has changed its name to the Project and Contracting Office (PCO) and remains responsible for program management and contracts. The U.S. military activity in Iraq is managed by General George Casey, Jr., with support from Charles Hess. The State Department, led by Robin Raphel, is responsible for assistance after the dissolution of the CPA. Stuart Bowen, Jr. serves as the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR), currently Stuart Bowen, Jr., oversees a team of 83 employees examining contracting competition, contract management practices, and criminal misconduct. The SIGIR's authority was extended by the DOD Authorization for FY2005 (P.L. 108-375) until 10 months after 80% of reconstruction funds are obligated. The SIGIR reports to both the Secretary of Defense and State, with a focus on economic and political reconstruction in Iraq. Ongoing discussions revolve around the strategy and effectiveness of reconstruction aid funds. The dissolution of the CPA has shifted U.S. influence in post-occupation Iraq towards persuasion by Ambassador Negroponte, backed by U.S. military support and reconstruction aid. U.S. advisers now act as consultants to Iraqi ministries, with about 150 Americans still attached. Reconstruction priorities have evolved over time, with 22% of funds in FY2004 focused on improving Iraq. In 2003, 22% of funds were allocated to enhancing Iraqi security capabilities, while 67% were directed towards infrastructure improvements such as electricity, oil production, and transportation. The remaining 10% was used for technical assistance in areas like democratization and health. Plans were revised in January 2004 due to the hand-over of sovereignty to Iraqis, with cuts in emergency supply efforts in the oil sector. While supply efforts were reduced by nearly $200 million, the broad categories of assistance remained largely unaffected. Significant funding changes were made within sectors, including increases in democratization efforts, border enforcement, and civil defense corps. A third of the total appropriation was extended to FY2005 for electric power and water rehabilitation. By April 2004, the CPA revised its allocations, adding funds for administrative expenses and estimating a more rapid spending plan for FY2005. The September 14, 2004 Administration-proposed re-allocation of resources, approved by Congress on September 29 in P.L. 108-309, reflects a review conducted by the Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office and the U.S. Embassy country team after the State Department took charge of Iraq non-military policy on June 28. Security increases by $1.8 billion, while efforts to increase oil production capacity gains $450 million. The re-allocation of resources approved by Congress in P.L. 108-309 includes increases in security by $1.8 billion, oil production capacity by $450 million, employment creation by $280 million, democracy programs by $180 million, and general development programs by $380 million. Additionally, $360 million is used to subsidize U.S. forgiveness of up to $4 billion in bilateral Iraqi debt. The re-allocation of funds approved by Congress in P.L. 108-309 includes increases in security, oil production capacity, employment creation, democracy programs, and general development programs. The State Department's reconstruction aid priorities in Iraq have shifted, with more funds now allocated to security, democratization, and economic infrastructure. Reconstruction projects in Iraq have faced challenges, including security issues. Despite the poor security situation, efforts in Iraq have led to some progress. The government is functioning, health facilities are being rehabilitated, schools are being renovated, economic reforms are underway, and grassroots projects are being conducted. Positive claims have been made about the success of reconstruction programs in the past 20 months. Reports of slow and ineffective implementation have countered positive claims for the success of reconstruction programs in Iraq over the past 20 months. Few of the identified construction projects have been completed, critical sector objectives like oil production and electric power generation have not been met, and most Iraqi police remain untrained. Despite a successful health program, reports indicate a rise in acute malnutrition among children. The reconstruction program in Iraq, funded with $18.4 billion, has faced slow progress with only $2.2 billion obligated by March 2004. Security concerns have been a major factor in delaying reconstruction efforts. The Accelerated Iraqi Reconstruction Program (AIRP) was initiated to speed up reconstruction using Iraqi DFI funds. Ambassador Negroponte advocated for more flexibility in federal acquisition regulations for the CERP program. Some controversial economic and political reforms imposed by the CPA stirred controversy in Iraq. In September 2003, Ambassador Bremer approved new laws abolishing curbs on foreign direct investment in Iraq, which were unpopular among Iraqi businessmen and unions. These laws could face resistance and reversal under the new sovereign government. The accelerated agreement to transfer sovereignty in Iraq delayed controversial decisions favored by Ambassador Bremer, such as privatization and ending the Oil for Food program. Iraqi officials preferred the CPA to make destabilizing decisions. Reconstruction efforts in areas like Fallujah are crucial for long-term government control, but progress has been criticized in Najaf. In Fallujah, humanitarian supplies were pre-positioned and assessments made for restoring essential services like electric power and water before the military operation. A combined Iraqi-U.S. aid effort of $100 million is estimated for reconstruction, funded by seized assets, oil profits, and operational funds. The CERP provides funds for U.S. military civil affairs officers in Iraq. The CERP received $300 million in additional funds for FY2005, bringing the total available funds to $685 million. Over 34,512 projects totaling $578 million have been implemented, supporting reconstruction activities at the village level. Commanders identify local needs and distribute aid without bureaucratic hurdles, credited with enhancing security missions and meeting development needs. The State Department reallocated $86 million to stimulate employment, with participation from U.S. and international companies and NGOs. The CERP received $86 million in funding for reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The Project and Contracting Office (PCO) coordinates infrastructure construction and monitors expenditures in various sectors. The PCO has taken over the responsibility of implementing reconstruction programs funded in FY2004. The FY2004-funded programs are implemented by the Army Corps of Engineers, Department of State, and USAID. USAID has awarded contracts and grants for various development programs, including construction projects. USAID will continue to oversee social services, civil society, and policy reform despite security concerns in Iraq. Continuing security concerns in Iraq impact firms involved in reconstruction work, with a focus on security plans for contract awards and costs. Legal immunity for contractors was provided pre-sovereignty turnover. Efforts were made to involve Iraqi businesses in contracts through online solicitations and business liaison representatives. The U.S. government has been awarding new contracts based on the extent to which firms plan to use Iraqi services. Most Iraqi business involvement has been through subcontracts, with over 315 Iraqi firms and 73,000 Iraqis currently employed on U.S.-funded reconstruction projects. In 2003, competitive bidding requirements were waived for specific companies with preexisting qualifications for Iraq reconstruction. Time and security clearances were critical factors in the selection process. Iraq reconstruction contracts funded in FY2004 are being competitively solicited, with a provision requiring notification to Congress of any waiver of competitive rules. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz limited prime contract eligibility to U.S. firms and those of 62 countries, including Iraq and coalition partners, citing essential security interests of the United States. Other countries could still participate as sub-contractors. In mid-2004, the limitation on country eligibility for Iraq reconstruction contracts was reversed to gain greater international cooperation. Concerns arose over closed bidding, lack of transparency, and possible misuse of funds. An Inspector General for the CPA was established in the FY2004 supplemental, conducting audits and investigations, including a controversial sole-source contract for oil well repair to KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton. The media focused on KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton, for favoritism in Iraq war contracts. KBR conducted $2.5 billion repair work for the Army Corps of Engineers. Despite plans for competitive bidding, KBR received two new contracts worth up to $2.0 billion in January 2004. KBR faced scrutiny in DOD audits for logistics support and fuel importation in Iraq. KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton, is suspected of overcharging by $61 million in fuel imports for Iraq under the RIO project. Former KBR staff have accused the company of wasteful spending. State Department documents suggest U.S. diplomats pressured KBR to use a more expensive Kuwaiti contractor. Numerous reports and articles have criticized the progress of reconstruction aid in Iraq, highlighting mistakes made during the occupation. The report criticizes the failures in Iraq's reconstruction efforts, emphasizing privatization policy, organizational incompetence, shifting deadlines, and inadequate utilization of Iraqis in decision-making. Recommendations include utilizing staff with expertise in post-conflict situations, involving Iraqis in project design, emphasizing the development of the Iraqi private sector, and requiring prime contractors to employ Iraqis. The Center for Strategic and International Studies report on Iraqi reconstruction highlights security as the main concern, with governance issues and lack of economic opportunities contributing to social unrest. The healthcare system is deteriorating, and recommendations include improving training for security forces and providing more direct assistance to Iraqis. The House passed H.R. 4818 on July 15, which did not include additional Iraq reconstruction funding but addressed various issues such as canceling Iraq's debt and utilizing the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund for this purpose. The House passed H.R. 4818 on July 15, addressing issues like canceling Iraq's debt and reconstituting the Coalition Provisional Authority Inspector's General office within the State Department. It transferred oversight responsibilities to the State Department and expressed disappointment over the slow pace of World Bank project disbursement in Iraq. The Administration expressed concerns about Iraq reconstruction provisions in H.R. 4818, opposing the placement of the CPA IG responsibility under the Secretary of State. They also noted that the House language did not align with the agreement reached by various departments for effective oversight of reconstruction funds. Additionally, the Administration was disappointed that their proposal for greater flexibility in fund usage was not included in the bill. The Senate measure, S. 2812, approved the use of $360 million to cancel 90% of Iraqi debt owed to the United States. H.J.Res. 107, a Continuing Resolution for FY2005, enacted some elements proposed by the Administration for sector funding re-allocations. The Administration proposed authorizing $360 million to cancel $4 billion in Iraqi debt owed to the United States. Responsibility for quarterly reports on Iraq reconstruction funds was transferred from OMB to the Department of State. Congress extended CPA-IG as the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction in the Defense Department Authorization bill for FY2005.
