    "content": "Multivariate time series with missing values are common in healthcare and finance. Deep learning methodologies are being explored to outperform classical data imputation methods. A new deep sequential latent variable model is proposed for dimensionality reduction and data imputation, using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. This approach outperforms classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data. The text discusses improving data imputation methods for high-dimensional data in computer vision and healthcare. It highlights the importance of considering temporal correlations within each channel and across channels for accurate imputations. The ideal model should offer a probabilistic interpretation for uncertainty estimation, which current approaches lack. The text proposes a new architecture for data imputation in high-dimensional data, focusing on temporal correlations within and across channels. It addresses the limitations of existing statistical methods and introduces a deep variational approach. The paper introduces a new architecture combining deep variational autoencoders with Gaussian processes for modeling latent dynamics in multivariate time series imputation. It utilizes structured variational approximations for efficient inference and benchmarks against traditional and deep learning methods on real-world data. The paper proposes a novel architecture for missing value imputation in medical time series by combining ideas from VAEs, GPs, Cauchy kernels, structured variational distributions, and a special ELBO for missing data. The model performs amortized approximate inference on a latent Gaussian process model, overcoming the problem of defining a suitable GP kernel in the data space with missing observations. The paper introduces a novel approach for imputing missing values in medical time series using a latent space GP model within a variational autoencoder. The model utilizes a Cauchy kernel to capture multi-scale time dynamics and decouples filling missing values from capturing temporal correlations. In the study, a deep generative model is used to generate observations from latent time series data. Variational inference is employed to learn the model parameters and infer the latent state efficiently. Amortization is applied to avoid inference over per-datapoint variational parameters, and a structured variational distribution is used to capture temporal correlations in the data. The study utilizes a deep generative model for latent time series data, employing variational inference with a multivariate Gaussian variational distribution to approximate the posterior. The variational family chosen is the multivariate Gaussian distribution in the time domain, with a parameterized precision matrix. Various models such as VAE, HI-VAE, and GP-VAE are compared based on specific metrics. The GP-VAE model proposed in this study allows for efficient generation of samples from q in O(T) time, with a sparse precision matrix and dense covariance matrix capturing long-range dependencies in time. Inference is amortized using an inference network, and model parameters are jointly trained by optimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on observed data features. The GP-VAE model efficiently generates samples from q in O(T) time using a sparse precision matrix and dense covariance matrix. Inference is amortized with an inference network, and model parameters are trained by optimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on observed data features. The ELBO is evaluated only on observed data features, with missing features set to zero. A tradeoff parameter \u03b2 is included to balance the influence between likelihood on observed data features and latent prior. Experiments were conducted on various datasets, comparing the model against conventional imputation methods. The GP-VAE model outperforms baseline methods in imputation quality on BRITS and forward imputation. It produces smoother curves, reduces noise, and has an interpretable posterior uncertainty. Performance on the Physionet dataset is comparable to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed GP-VAE model performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods on three tasks, including medical data imputation. It extends to different missingness mechanisms and uses a downstream classifier to predict mortality based on imputed time series. No ground-truth data exists for the medical time series task, so mean squared error and negative log likelihood cannot be reported. The problem of missing values in time series data has been a long-standing challenge in medicine. Early approaches like mean imputation and forward imputation are still widely used due to their simplicity and efficiency. More advanced methods like expectation-maximization (EM) have been proposed but may require additional modeling. These methods have been evaluated in experiments, showing correlation with ground-truth data in some cases. Bayesian methods, such as Gaussian processes, have advantages over non-Bayesian methods for estimating likelihoods and uncertainties in imputations. Recent work has focused on making these methods more expressive and incorporating prior knowledge from the domain, but scalability and designing robust kernels for missing values remain challenges. Our latent GP prior shows similarities to GP latent variable models but differs in certain aspects. In contrast to Gaussian processes, deep learning techniques like VAEs and GANs have been used for efficient inference. However, these models do not explicitly consider the temporal dynamics of time series data. Deep probabilistic models for time series exist but do not handle missing data explicitly. The HI-VAE model deals with missing data by defining an ELBO that only sums over the observed part of the data. It fills incomplete data with arbitrary values before feeding them into the inference network, introducing bias. Unlike HI-VAE, our approach exploits temporal information for sequential data imputation. Most deep learning approaches for time series imputation do not directly model the temporal dynamics of the data.

The curr_chunk discusses a deep generative model for missing value imputation in time series data, specifically mentioning the GRUI-GAN model as the only one that accounts for the time series nature of the data. The curr_chunk discusses deep learning models for time series imputation, including GRUI-GAN, BRITS, and HI-VAE. It also mentions related models like GPPVAE but highlights differences in their approach to handling missing values in time series data. The GP prior with the Cauchy kernel is reminiscent of previous work, and the structured variational distribution is similar to modeling word embeddings over time. The variational family chosen is multivariate Gaussian distributions in the time domain, parameterized with bidiagonal matrices. This leads to positive definite, symmetric, and tridiagonal precision matrices. Samples from a sparse precision matrix can be generated efficiently in linear time. The variational distribution is computed by an inference network, allowing for joint training of the generative model and inference network through ELBO optimization. The inference network \u03c8 is trained with the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on observed data features only, setting missing features to zero. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for inference, convolving over the time dimension with fixed receptive fields, outputting a tensor of size R T \u00d73k for variable length sequences.

The network predicts the mean vector m t and the diagonal and off-diagonal elements {b j t,t , b j t,t+1 } j=1:k characterizing B at each time step. Experimental details on baseline methods like Forward and mean imputation, as well as Gaussian process in data space, are provided in the appendix. One option to address missingness in multivariate time series is fitting independent Gaussian processes to each channel, ignoring inter-channel correlation. Missing values are imputed by taking the mean of the respective posterior of the GP. Other methods like VAE, HI-VAE, and GRUI-GAN are also used for imputation, each with its own approach. In the medical field, addressing missing values in time series data is crucial. Healing MNIST dataset reflects real medical data properties with short sequences of moving MNIST digits. Each frame represents a patient's health state with missing measurements, showing the non-linear evolution of health. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of different models for imputing missing pixels in time series data from the Healing MNIST dataset. The models were evaluated based on negative log likelihoods and mean squared errors, with qualitative results shown in Figure 1. Additionally, a linear classifier was trained on the imputed MNIST digits to predict digit class performance. The study compared different models for imputing missing pixels in time series data from the Healing MNIST dataset. The GP-VAE approach outperformed baselines in terms of likelihood and MSE, providing more stable reconstructions over time. Performance was measured using AUROC, with results shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. The study compared models for imputing missing pixels in time series data from the Healing MNIST dataset. The GP-VAE approach outperformed baselines in likelihood and MSE, providing stable reconstructions over time. The model also yielded useful imputations for downstream classification, correlating well with test likelihood on ground truth data. It outperformed baselines on different missingness mechanisms and was applied to the SPRITES dataset for more complex data assessment. The dataset consists of 9,000 sequences of animated characters with different attributes, each frame is 64x64 pixels with 8 frames per time series. Results show model outperforms baselines in likelihood and MSE. Model applied to Physionet Challenge dataset with 12,000 patients monitored in ICU for 48 hours with 36 variables measured hourly. The main challenge in comparing our model against others is the absence of ground truth data for missing values, which makes it difficult to assess imputation quality. To address this, a downstream task like mortality prediction is used as a proxy for imputation quality, measured in terms of AUROC. In this study, the performance of different imputation methods was evaluated using AUROC as a measure. A linear support vector machine (SVM) was used for classification, aiming to separate time series data in the input space. The results showed that the model outperformed all baselines, including GRUI-GAN, indicating its effectiveness in handling missing data.
