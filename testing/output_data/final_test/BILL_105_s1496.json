    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Congressional Contractor Health Insurance Equity Act\" and includes definitions. The \"Congressional Contractor Health Insurance Equity Act\" defines a contract as any agreement for items or services exceeding $75,000 per year, or requiring at least 1000 hours of services, between the legislative branch of the Federal Government and an entity with at least 15 full-time employees. An employee is defined as per the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 defines terms related to the legislative branch, including entities like the House of Representatives and the Senate. It also defines a group health plan as one that provides health benefits equivalent to those offered under a specific service benefit plan. The term \"instrumentality of the legislative branch\" includes the General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, and the Library of Congress under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 3. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING CONTRACTS COVERED UNDER THIS ACT. Any contract by a legislative branch entity must include provisions for offering health insurance to employees, with the contractor paying a percentage of premiums equal to the average Government contribution required by law. Employees are responsible for the remaining premiums. A contractor not offering health insurance coverage under a group health plan may obtain a health benefits plan under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, for employees working on a contract. The contractor must make required Government contributions, with employees paying their share of premiums for Federal employees. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management calculates premiums for health benefits plans separately for contractor employees and Federal employees/annuitants. An annual review is conducted to assess potential adverse effects on premiums due to nonapplication of certain provisions, including a study on contractor employees' healthcare utilization and risks. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management conducts an annual review to assess the impact on premiums for health benefits plans for contractor employees. A report is submitted to the President, Speaker of the House, and President pro tempore of the Senate. If certified, certain provisions may not apply to prevent adverse effects on premiums. The Director shall take appropriate actions as required. Personnel Management will assist contractors in obtaining health insurance. The office overseeing health benefits for Federal employees will handle tasks related to plan coverage for contractors. Waivers may be granted upon request. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to contracts from January 1, 1998, to October 1, 2002. Employees pay a portion of the premium for coverage in 2002."
