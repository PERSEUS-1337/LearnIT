    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Nepal Trade Preferences Act\" and outlines eligibility requirements. The President may authorize preferential treatment for articles imported directly from Nepal into the US if Nepal meets specific requirements outlined in the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Trade Act of 1974. Withdrawal, suspension, or limitation of preferential treatment for Nepal will follow the same provisions as stated in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 allows for preferential treatment of articles imported from Nepal into the US, following the same provisions as beneficiary developing countries under title V of the Act. SEC. 3. ELIGIBLE ARTICLES. Certain manufactured and other articles from Nepal may enter the US customs territory duty-free if they meet specific criteria outlined in the Trade Act of 1974. Certain articles from Nepal may enter the US customs territory duty-free if the President determines they are not import-sensitive and if the cost or value of materials produced in Nepal is at least 35 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time of entry. Exclusions for Nepal articles include simple combining or packaging operations, dilution with water or another substance that doesn't alter the article's characteristics. Limitation on US cost requires 35% of materials and processing costs to be from the US customs territory. Textile and apparel articles wholly assembled in Nepal may enter the US customs territory duty-free if they meet specific criteria, regardless of the origin of the yarn or fabric used. The value attributed to the 35% US cost requirement cannot exceed 15% of the appraised value of the article at the time of entry. Imports of textile and apparel articles from Nepal into the US customs territory can be increased to 1.5% of the total imports if they are less than 1% of the total imports in a calendar year. Imports of textile and apparel articles from Nepal into the US customs territory can be increased by up to 1/3 of 1 percent if they account for at least 1 percent of all textile and apparel imports in a calendar year. Imports of textile and apparel articles from Nepal into the US customs territory can be increased by up to 1/3 of 1 percent if they account for at least 1 percent of all textile and apparel imports in a calendar year. The aggregate quantity of these articles imported from Nepal cannot exceed the applicable percentage set forth for that calendar year. Additionally, handloomed, handmade, folklore articles, and ethnic printed fabrics are also included in this provision. Textile and apparel articles imported from Nepal into the US must be handloomed, handmade, folklore articles, or ethnic printed fabrics certified by Nepal's competent authority. Ethnic printed fabric of Nepal must meet specific criteria, including width and classification under certain subheadings in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, as well as containing designs and symbols typical of Nepal. The preferential treatment for ethnic printed fabric of Nepal includes being sold by piece, printed in Nepal, and made from yarns originating in the United States or Nepal. This treatment is extended for a 1-year period starting January 1, 2014, and for 10 succeeding 1-year periods. The applicable percentage for imports of textile and apparel articles from Nepal under this subsection is 1.5 percent for the 1-year period starting January 1, 2014, increasing by equal increments over the next 10 years to a maximum of 3.5 percent by January 1, 2023. The surge mechanism and special eligibility rules from the African Growth and Opportunity Act apply to textile and apparel articles imported from Nepal with preferential treatment, ensuring protections against transshipment. Textile and apparel articles imported from Nepal receive the same preferential treatment as those from beneficiary sub-Saharan countries under section 112. The President must report to Congress annually on the implementation of the Act and U.S. trade policy with Nepal. Preferential treatment under the Act will end on December 31, 2023, and the Act will be effective from January 1, 2014."
