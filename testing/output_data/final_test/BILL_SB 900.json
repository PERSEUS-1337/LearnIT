    "title": "SB 900",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the presence of old human-made structures along the California coastline, remnants of rapid commercial development in the early 1900s. Legacy oil and gas wells, abandoned with little oversight, may seep oil into the surf zone, impacting recreational users and causing environmental harm. The State Lands Commission has primary jurisdiction over sovereign lands along the California coastline for public purposes, including commerce, navigation, fishing, recreation, and habitat preservation. There is a critical need for funding to inventory coastal hazards, including legacy oil and gas wells, to identify and remediate leaking wells. With adequate funding, the State Lands Commission can inventory coastal hazards, including legacy oil and gas wells, determine GPS locations, assess entitlement requirements, prepare engineering requirements, and remove hazards that pose a risk to public health and the environment. Funding will also enable monitoring of oil seepage in state waters and tidelands, and studies to determine seepage locations, rates, impacts, and mitigation measures. Section 6212 of the Public Resources Code mandates the commission to administer a coastal hazard removal and remediation program within two years of receiving funds from the Legislature. This program includes conducting surveys to identify high-priority hazards like legacy oil and gas wells, studying oil seepage in state waters, and beginning the remediation process for abandoned wells at risk of leaking oil. Any remaining funds will be used to address other coastal hazards. The commission may accept gifts to aid in actions under subdivision (a) and work with the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources to abandon hazardous oil and gas wells. They must report annually to the Legislature and prioritize activities based on resources. Definitions apply for this section. Coastal hazards, including legacy oil and gas wells and human-made structures like piers, jetties, and seawalls, pose a threat to public health and safety. Legacy oil and gas wells are old wells drilled near shore with unknown abandonment procedures. Section 6217 of the Public Resources Code is amended to deposit revenue received by the commission in the General Fund for specific purposes such as refunds and expenditures. For the 2017-18 fiscal year, payments from the commission include expenditures in the annual Budget Act, payments to cities and counties as specified in Sections 6817 and 6875, and a $500,000 transfer to the Land Bank Fund for coastal hazard removal and remediation. Starting from the 2018-19 fiscal year, $500,000 will be transferred annually to the Land Bank Fund for the commission's coastal hazard removal and remediation program. This amount will ensure a balance of $500,000 in the fund for this purpose, available upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act."
