    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes the effectiveness of the electronic benefits transfer (EBT) system in California since 2004 for issuing government benefits. Research shows EBT offers convenience, security, and cost savings for recipients and state governments. EBT is also efficient in delivering assistance during natural disasters. The Human Right to Water was established in 2013 by the Legislature and Governor of California, ensuring safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water for all. Despite proactive water policies, residents still face challenges due to the drought, especially disadvantaged communities. Marginalized Californians struggle to access clean water, with over 1 million facing water safety violations in 2014. The drought in California has caused over 2,000 domestic wells to go dry in the Central Valley, impacting tens of thousands of people. Many small communities are facing water quality issues, with almost 400 rural water systems and schools unable to provide safe drinking water. The Governor and Legislature are implementing new emergency drinking water supports to help households in need, utilizing the existing EBT system for efficient delivery of emergency water benefits to disadvantaged households. The State Department of Social Services will convene a workgroup to develop recommendations for providing a water benefit to low-income households with inadequate access to safe drinking water. The benefit will be available through the electronic benefits transfer system and funded from existing emergency drought response resources. The workgroup will include representatives from various state entities. The workgroup, consisting of various state entities, will develop recommendations for a water benefit for low-income households with inadequate access to safe drinking water. Recommendations will include the benefit's design, implementation plan, and eligibility criteria for households in disadvantaged communities, communities eligible for emergency benefits, and households with water supply issues. The State Department of Social Services will submit a report with recommendations to the Legislature and the California Health and Human Services Agency by July 1, 2017. This chapter will become inoperative on July 1, 2021, and repealed as of January 1, 2022, unless extended or deleted by a later statute."
