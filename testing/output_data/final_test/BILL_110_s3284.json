    "content": "There is no information provided in the prev_chunk to assist with summarizing the curr_chunk. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to set the applicable exclusion amount at $3,500,000 for estate tax purposes. This amount will be adjusted for inflation for decedents dying after 2010. The dollar amount in subparagraph (A) will be increased by a cost-of-living adjustment for each calendar year. The maximum estate tax rate will be set at 45 percent under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The estate tax provisions are amended by removing certain dollar amount limitations and conforming amendments are made to section 2102(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The estate tax provisions are amended to reflect differences in unified credit resulting from different tax rates. The credit allowed shall not be less than a proportion of the applicable credit amount based on the value of the decedent's gross estate in the United States. Amendments are made to section 2001(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code to account for these modifications. The estate tax provisions are amended to reflect different tax rates for gift tax payable. Section 2001 of the Internal Revenue Code is modified to use the tax rates at the decedent's death to compute the tax imposed on gifts and the credit allowed against such tax. The estate tax provisions are amended to use different tax rates for gift tax. The applicable credit amount for any calendar year before 1998 is determined based on the dollar amount for that year. The rates of tax in effect for a calendar year are used to calculate the credit amounts for preceding periods. The estate tax provisions are amended to apply to estates of decedents dying, generation-skipping transfers, and gifts made after December 31, 2009. Subtitles A and E of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 are repealed, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is to be applied as if those subtitles had never been enacted. The estate tax provisions are amended to apply to estates of decedents dying, generation-skipping transfers, and gifts made after December 31, 2009. Sections 2011, 2057, and 2604 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are repealed. The table of sections for subchapter A of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended by removing section 2604. The Senate believes that any decrease in Federal revenue from these changes should be fully compensated for."
