    "content": "Insurance companies are a major segment of the U.S. financial services industry, divided into life and health insurance companies and property and casualty insurance companies. In 2013, life and health companies had premiums of $533.8 billion and assets of $6.08 trillion, while property and casualty companies had premiums of $484.4 billion and assets of $1.76 trillion. Life insurance involves longer-term contracts with well-defined risks, while property/casualty insurance typically has shorter-term contracts. Insurance typically involves shorter-term contracts with greater exposure to catastrophic risks. Health insurance has evolved differently, with companies heavily involved in healthcare delivery and a regulatory system influenced by federal government programs. This report focuses on property/casualty and life insurance, which have been regulated by states for the past 150 years. Legal and legislative landmarks have shaped the state-based insurance regulatory system. Since the 1940s, insurance regulation has been shaped by legal landmarks such as the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which preserved states' authority to regulate and tax insurance while granting a federal antitrust exemption to the industry. Despite some federal actions expanding government reach in insurance, states have generally resisted, arguing they are better suited to regulate and address consumer complaints. The states have the authority to regulate insurance and handle consumer complaints. Despite federal legislative overhauls like the GLBA and Dodd-Frank, states remain the primary regulators of insurance. GLBA allowed securities firms, banks, and insurers to coexist under a financial holding company structure overseen by the Federal Reserve or the OTS. The GLBA established functional regulation within holding companies for bank, thrift, securities, and insurance subsidiaries. Insurance company subsidiaries in a bank or thrift holding company were regulated by state insurance authorities with limited federal oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the regulatory structure post-GLBA, giving enhanced systemic risk regulatory authority to the Federal Reserve and FSOC, including oversight over insurers. Holding company oversight was consolidated in the Federal Reserve with added capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced new measures affecting insurance oversight, including the creation of the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and additional capital requirements for insurers. Legislation before the 113th Congress included potential amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act, addressing capital requirements, accounting standards, and regulatory reforms for insurers. Recent insurance legislation in Congress includes bills aimed at harmonizing state regulation of insurance producer licensing and responding to international developments such as Solvency II and IAIS standards. Other proposed legislation includes creating a federal charter for insurance, amending the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and expanding the Liability Risk Retention Act. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2013 (S. 534) was the subject of a House Financial Services Subcommittee hearing on May 20, 2014. Introduced in the Senate by Senator Jon Tester, the bill was amended and reported by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Two identical bills, H.R. 1064 and H.R. 1155, were introduced in the House by Representative Randy Neugebauer. H.R. 1155, with an amendment similar to the Senate committee's, passed under suspension of rules. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, known as \"NARAB II,\" was passed by a vote of 397-6 on September 10, 2013. It would establish a private, nonprofit corporation allowing licensed insurance producers to operate in any state by paying a licensing fee, without needing separate licenses. The NARAB II association, overseen by a board with appointees from the insurance industry and state insurance commissioners, would allow licensed insurance producers to operate in any state by paying a licensing fee. S. 534 and H.R. 1155 are nearly identical bills, with the Senate adding S. 534 to a flood insurance bill, which passed but was not taken up by the House. The NARAB II association, overseen by a board with appointees from the insurance industry and state insurance commissioners, would allow licensed insurance producers to operate in any state by paying a licensing fee. Legislation addressing flood insurance and terrorism risk insurance was enacted in 2014, with the Senate passing a bill including NARAB provisions. The House and Senate adjourned in 2014 without resolving differences in the derivatives legislation included in the bill. H.R. 605, introduced by Representative Bill Posey, was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services. The Insurance Consumer Protection and Solvency Act of 2013 aimed to amend the Dodd-Frank Act to exempt insurance companies from certain regulations. H.R. 2156, introduced by Representative Stephen Fincher, aims to encourage uniformity and reciprocity among states licensing independent insurance claim adjusters. If a state does not adopt laws providing for uniformity within four years, adjusters from other states can operate without licensure but must pay state fees. H.R. 2140, introduced by Representative Gary Miller, aims to create a presumption of compliance with minimum capital standards for insurance companies under Federal Reserve Board supervision if they meet state capital standards. The bill allows the Federal Reserve to override this presumption with defined procedures, standards, and studies. S. 2102, introduced by Senator Susan Collins, aims to clarify Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding capital requirements for financial institutions overseen by the Federal Reserve. The bill specifies that federal banking agencies are not required to apply the same standards to both banks and insurers. The bill S. 2270, introduced by Senator Susan Collins, exempts regulated insurance entities from minimum capital requirements under Section 171. It was passed by the Senate and House, signed into law as P.L. 113-279 on December 18, 2014. H.R. 4510 and H.R. 5461 were also introduced in relation to financial services regulation. H.R. 5461, introduced by Representative Andy Barr, passed by the House Committee on Financial Services on September 16, 2014. The bill clarifies that banks and insurers are not required to have the same capital standards under Section 171. It also prevents the Federal Reserve from mandating insurers to file financial statements according to GAAP if they already do so with state regulators. The amended version of H.R. 4557, introduced by Representative Bill Posey, clarifies that banks and insurers are not required to follow GAAP if they already use SAP with state regulators. It also states that the Federal Reserve can collect information on an entity or group-wide basis. H.R. 4669, introduced by Representative Edward Royce, aims to preempt state laws requiring military members to change auto insurance when moving temporarily. S. 2726 and H.R. 5388, introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy and Representative Peter Welch, are related bills. S. 2726 / H.R. 5388, introduced on July 31, 2014, aims to exclude captive insurers from the definition of a nonadmitted insurer in the Dodd-Frank Act. The bill would amend Title V, Subtitle A of the Act to establish the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury, with the authority to preempt state laws that conflict with international agreements. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) has the authority to preempt state laws that conflict with international agreements, ensuring consumer protection equivalent to state law. FIO's preemption decisions are subject to judicial review, and its monitoring function includes gathering information from public and private sources with subpoena power if necessary. Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) has hired staff and appointed a director, Michael McRaith. FIO has been active in international discussions and has released reports as required by Dodd-Frank, including an annual report and a report on regulatory modernization. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) has been active in international discussions and has released reports as required by Dodd-Frank, including an annual report and a report on regulatory modernization. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for systemic risk provisions affecting the insurance industry through enhanced Federal Reserve oversight and higher prudential standards for banks with over $50 billion in assets. Financial resolution authority is to be undertaken by the FDIC, with designation of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) done by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). FSOC is charged with identifying risks to the financial stability of the United States and promoting market discipline. The Federal Reserve may set higher prudential standards for firms based on risk factors, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk management requirements, and exposure limits. Firms must submit resolution plans and credit exposure reports. Regulated subsidiaries are overseen by their primary regulator, but the Federal Reserve can intervene if necessary. The Federal Reserve conducts stress tests on significant firms to prevent insolvency and financial instability. Regulations are issued for early remediation measures in case of financial decline. Special resolution regime may apply to financial companies causing systemic disruption, excluding insurance subsidiaries. FDIC has backup authority for resolving insurers if state systems fail to act within 60 days. The FDIC imposes assessments on financial firms with over $50 billion in assets to fund the resolution of systemically important firms. H.R. 605 aims to remove insurers from this resolution authority. FSOC has been issuing rules and determinations since its first meeting in 2010. The FSOC has been issuing rules and determinations since its first meeting in 2010. A final rule issued on April 3, 2012, detailed the criteria for judging nonbank financial companies as systemically important. AIG, Prudential Financial, and MetLife have been designated as SIFIs, with some controversy surrounding the designations of Prudential Financial and MetLife. The Dodd-Frank Act consolidated oversight of thrift holding companies and bank holding companies under the Federal Reserve, strengthening capital standards. This includes the \"Collins Amendment\" (Section 171) and Basel III requirements. Large insurers like AIG and State Farm now fall under Federal Reserve oversight, impacting capital and accounting standards. The \"Volcker Rule\" (Section 619) may also affect insurers. The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, may impact insurers with banking subsidiaries by restricting proprietary trading. However, there are exemptions for regulated insurance companies engaged in the business of insurance. Compliance with laws and regulations is required to ensure the safety and soundness of banking entities and the financial stability of the United States. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) released a study on the Volcker Rule as mandated. The FSOC study on the Volcker Rule recommended monitoring fund flows between banking entities and insurance companies to prevent rule manipulation. Federal Reserve officials acknowledge the different asset composition of insurers compared to banks and the need for tailored oversight. Insurers are concerned that proposed capital rules do not consider industry-specific characteristics and are described as \"bank-centric.\" Some insurers are divesting depository subsidiaries to avoid Federal Reserve regulations. Holding companies are divesting depository subsidiaries to avoid Federal Reserve oversight under Dodd-Frank and Basel III rules. MetLife, designated as systemically important by FSOC, has divested its depository subsidiary. The Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act harmonizes regulation of surplus lines insurance, giving sole authority to the \"home state\" of the insured. The Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act gives sole authority to the \"home state\" for regulating surplus lines transactions and collecting taxes. It also preempts state laws on surplus lines eligibility that conflict with NAIC model law, unless states agree on alternative requirements. For reinsurance transactions, the home state of the insurer has authority over the transaction, while the home state of the reinsurer regulates the reinsurer's solvency. NAIC and NCOIL developed interstate agreements for these regulations. The NCOIL and NAIC developed interstate agreements to address surplus lines regulatory issues and tax allocation. NCOIL's SLIMPACT is broader, while NAIC's NIMA is more focused on tax allocation. Most states have not ratified either agreement, leading to a lack of uniformity. Congressional hearings in 2011 discussed blending the two approaches for greater uniformity. The House Financial Services Committee discussed the lack of uniformity in surplus lines insurance regulation between states. The NRAA aims to reduce paperwork, but there is a desire for more consistency. The U.S. has a surplus in financial services trade, except for insurance where there is a deficit. Consolidations in the insurance industry are creating larger international entities with growing market shares, especially in reinsurance. The \"internationalization\" of the financial services industry may make it challenging for governments to reform regulation independently. There is a call for a single federal voice to represent U.S. insurance interests globally, leading to increased federal involvement in insurance regulation. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is responsible for developing federal policy in international insurance matters. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) works to promote consistent supervision of the insurance industry worldwide. The IAIS promotes consistent supervision of the insurance industry globally, coordinating with the Financial Stability Board to address global systemically important insurers and develop capital standards for internationally active insurance groups. Congressional concerns have been raised about the impact on U.S. insurers' competitiveness and regulatory strength. The European Union is implementing Solvency II, a new solvency regime for insurers, to match capital requirements with risks. This overhaul aims to ensure financial soundness and efficiency in managing risks for insurers. The European Parliament passed Solvency II legislation in 2009, with implementation originally set for 2012 but delayed to 2014 and now scheduled for 2016. The EU established the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to develop binding regulations. Concerns exist about potential discrimination against U.S. insurers if their supervision is not deemed equivalent to EU standards. EIOPA has recommended equivalence for Switzerland, Bermuda, and Japan. The EU has recommended equivalence for Switzerland, Bermuda, and Japan but not for the United States. There are concerns about access for European reinsurers to the U.S. market due to regulatory requirements. Non-U.S. reinsurers face challenges with collateral requirements in the U.S. market. Non-U.S. reinsurers have requested a reduction in collateral requirements in the U.S. market, citing disparities with foreign countries and the lack of recognition for risk cessions. The NAIC has hesitated to lower collateral, citing concerns about unpaid claims and difficulties in overseas judgments. In 2010, a proposal was approved to reduce required collateral based on the financial strength of the reinsurer. The NAIC approved a proposal in 2010 to reduce collateral requirements for reinsurers based on their financial strength. This model law and regulation must be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators to take effect. 21 states, representing 60% of primary insurance premiums in the US, have adopted revised statutes or regulations for reinsurance collateral reduction. Nine states have approved 34 reinsurers for reduced collateral requirements. The NAIC's Reinsurance Financial Analysis Working Group has conducted peer reviews for over 30 certifications and developed a streamlined process for certified reinsurers to be approved in multiple states (known as \"passporting\"). The reinsurer's home jurisdiction must also meet requirements to receive reduced collateral. The NAIC approved a proposal in 2010 to reduce collateral requirements for reinsurers based on their financial strength. Several jurisdictions, including Bermuda, Germany, Switzerland, and the UK, were conditionally qualified for reduced collateral requirements. The NAIC is also reviewing jurisdictions such as France, Ireland, and Japan. State insurance regulators modernized regulations in response to criticisms and the changing financial landscape after the passage of GLBA. In early 2000, NAIC members pledged to modernize insurance regulation to meet the new financial services marketplace. New working groups were formed to address issues like state privacy protections and promotion of speed to market for new insurance products. 47 states were certified as reciprocal jurisdictions for producer licensing laws, exceeding GLBA requirements. The insurance industry is facing challenges with the establishment of NARAB II legislation, while also experiencing growth in electronic rate and form filing through SERFF. States are approving the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact to provide regulatory uniformity for certain insurance lines. The NAIC believes states are better suited for regulating the industry than the federal government. The NAIC maintains that states are better positioned than the federal government to serve the interests of U.S. insurance consumers. In 2013, state insurance departments had a total budget of $1.29 billion and handled over 260,000 consumer complaints and 2.1 million inquiries. The NAIC has implemented regulatory changes post-financial crisis, including Holding company oversight reform. The NAIC adopted revisions to model laws and regulations for holding company oversight in response to the financial crisis, focusing on insurer group issues. The revisions included expanded evaluation abilities, enhanced regulator rights, funding expectations for regulator participation, and improvements in corporate governance. 30 states have adopted these changes. Enterprise risk management is emphasized for insurer solvency oversight, with companies assessing and reporting risks. In the United States, companies are required to assess and report their risks through an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). The NAIC has adopted a model law for an annual ORSA, with 18 states passing legislation. Principle-based reserving (PBR) is being implemented to transition life insurance reserving to a more flexible approach. The NAIC has adopted a model law for an annual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) in the United States, with 18 states passing legislation. Principle-based reserving (PBR) is being implemented to transition life insurance reserving to a more flexible approach, with 18 states comprising 28.0% of premiums having enacted PBR legislation. PBR will only become operational once 42 states comprising at least 75% of the U.S. market have approved the law. In 1944, the U.S. v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association case applied federal antitrust laws to interstate insurance activities, causing concern about state regulation. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 was passed to preserve state authority over insurance regulation and taxation, granting the insurance industry a federal antitrust exemption. After 1945, Congress reviewed the jurisdictional stewardship entrusted to states under McCarran-Ferguson for the insurance industry. Some exceptions to the 50-state structure of insurance regulation have been enacted, such as the Liability Risk Retention Act in 1981. Proposals for increased federal involvement in insurance regulation have been opposed by states and the insurance industry, leading to regulatory reform efforts at the state level. In the mid-1980s, efforts to transfer insurance regulatory authority to the federal government were spurred by insolvencies of large insurance companies. Former House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell questioned state regulation's ability to oversee the industry and proposed legislation for a federal insurance regulatory agency. State regulators and the insurance industry opposed this approach and worked together on regulatory reform at the state level. In the late 1980s, state regulators and the insurance industry implemented reforms at the state level and at the NAIC, including a new accreditation program for state solvency regulation. Despite these changes, a breach in the state regulatory system occurred in the late 1990s when Martin Frankel diverted over $200 million from small life insurance companies. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, state insurance guaranty funds were introduced to protect insurance consumers in case of insolvency. These funds function similarly to the FDIC for banks and provide coverage up to certain limits for property/casualty and life insurance policies. Insurers in the state may be assessed to cover any shortfalls in the guaranty fund payments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 overhauled the financial regulatory system in the US due to market convergence. Insurers assessed by guaranty funds can write off assessments on future state taxes, indirectly supporting the funds. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 drove market convergence by removing barriers between financial sectors, leading to increased competition. It reaffirmed state insurance regulators as the primary overseers of insurance products post-GLBA. Some insurance companies feel that state regulation post-GLBA puts them at a competitive disadvantage compared to non-insurer competitors with federally based regulation systems. They argue that state insurance regulation leads to inefficiencies like delays in product approval, making it harder for insurers to compete with banks offering similar products nationwide in a shorter timeframe. After GLBA, industry support for federal intervention in insurance changed, with many backing an optional federal charter for insurance. GLBA also aimed to modernize state laws for insurance agents and brokers, including the creation of NARAB. However, the NARAB provisions never came into effect as enough states enacted necessary legislation for uniformity or reciprocity within three years. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to enhance competition among financial services providers, but the expected convergence of banks, securities firms, and insurers did not occur as anticipated. The major merger between Citibank and Travelers, which led to the passage of GLBA, has been effectively undone. Citigroup, the resulting corporation, has divested itself of most of its assets. Despite the lack of large bank-insurer mergers post-GLBA, there was significant convergence as banks began distributing insurance and insurers created products resembling investment vehicles. Consolidation continued within each sector, with banks merging with banks and insurers with insurers. Congressional interest in insurance regulatory issues persisted, with proposals for federal intervention, but none were advanced. The financial crisis of 2007 reached panic proportions with the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the failure of Lehman Brothers, and the government rescue of AIG in September 2008. This crisis added new issues to the ongoing debate on insurance regulatory reforms in Congress. The financial crisis highlighted failures in the regulatory structure, leading to calls for increased oversight and systemic risk regulation. Insurers, previously seen as low risk, were also affected. Despite the overall good performance of insurers, there were two notable failures in the industry. The financial crisis exposed failures in the insurance industry, with two notable failures - one involving bond insurers and the other a specific company. Bond insurers expanded into mortgage-backed securities, leading to downgrades and unexpected difficulties in the municipal bond markets. The financial crisis exposed failures in the insurance industry, with two notable failures - one involving bond insurers and the other a specific company, American International Group (AIG). AIG sought over $100 billion in assistance from the Federal Reserve to prevent bankruptcy in 2008, resulting in the U.S. government owning 92% of the company. The assistance for AIG has since been repaid, and the U.S. Treasury sold its equity stake in the company. The financial crisis exposed failures in the insurance industry, with notable cases involving bond insurers and American International Group (AIG). AIG, a federally regulated thrift holding company overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision, faced immediate losses from derivatives and securities lending operations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in response to the crisis, highlighting the need for increased federal involvement in insurance regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed failures in the insurance industry during the financial crisis, leading to increased federal involvement in insurance regulation. The 112th Congress focused on insurance regulation follow-up, particularly concerning the Federal Reserve's approach to insurance companies and the designation of insurers as systemically important. Federal regulation of insurance is generally considered constitutional under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled that the business of insurance is considered commerce and can be regulated by the federal government. This authority was not always clear, as seen in the case of Paul v. Virginia where issuing insurance policies was not initially seen as interstate commerce. The insurance industry challenged a Virginia law that made it harder for out-of-state insurance companies to operate within the state, citing violations of the dormant commerce clause. The Supreme Court ruled in Paul v. Virginia that insurance contracts are not considered commerce under the Commerce Clause, as they are personal contracts completed by signature and transfer of consideration, not subjects of trade or commodities. Subsequent decisions affirmed this holding. The Supreme Court's ruling in Paul v. Virginia stated that insurance contracts are not considered commerce under the Commerce Clause. However, in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Associations, the Court held that the business of insurance is commerce and may be subject to federal regulation. This case challenged the power of Congress to directly regulate the insurance industry for the first time. The majority of the Court in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Associations decided that the business of insurance is interstate commerce and subject to federal antitrust laws, contrary to the ruling in Paul v. Virginia. The Court emphasized the significant role of the insurance industry in the U.S. economy and the multi-state operations of many insurance companies. The Supreme Court ruled that the business of insurance is interstate commerce and can be regulated by Congress. Intangible items like insurance contracts are considered items of commerce. The Court endorsed Congress's broad powers to regulate insurance business across state lines. The McCarran Ferguson Act was passed by Congress in response to the Supreme Court decision in South-Eastern Underwriters, affirming state regulatory authority over the business of insurance and preventing federal preemption of state insurance regulations. The McCarran Ferguson Act allows states to regulate the insurance business, but Congress can still directly regulate when necessary. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to do so, as seen in Barnett Bank of Marion County v. Nelson where a federal law allowing national banks to sell insurance preempted a Florida statute prohibiting it. The Supreme Court upheld federal regulation of the business of insurance, affirming it as commerce under the Constitution. Congress's authority to regulate insurance under the Commerce Clause is limited to interstate commerce. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's individual mandate was challenged as unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court agreed with Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. The Supreme Court ruled that the individual mandate in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was not a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. Chief Justice Roberts held that while Congress has broad authority to regulate economic activity, it cannot compel individuals to engage in economic activity. This decision was made because the Commerce Clause does not grant Congress the authority to force individuals to participate in economic activities. The Chief Justice upheld the individual mandate under Congress's power to levy taxes. Legislation in the 112th Congress included the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2011 (H.R. 1112) introduced by Representative Randy Neugebauer. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) would have been a private, nonprofit corporation allowing licensed insurance producers to operate in any state by paying a licensing fee. NARAB would be overseen by a board with appointees from the insurance industry and state insurance commissioners, with the President having authority over the board. This legislation dates back to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The NARAB II legislation, stemming from the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, aimed to streamline state insurance producer licensing. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2011 (H.R. 2126) sought to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws for risk retention groups. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2011 (H.R. 2126) aimed to allow risk retention groups (RRGs) to cover commercial property risks and risk purchasing groups (RPGs) to purchase coverage. It proposed changing the enforcement mechanism for federal preemptions in the LRRA and adding federal corporate governance requirements for RRGs. The bill also included provisions for the director of the Federal Insurance Office to issue determinations on state regulations of RRGs and RPGs. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2011 (H.R. 2126) proposed federal corporate governance standards for RRGs, including independent directors, audit committees, written governance standards, and limited service provider contracts. It also aimed to expand consumer disclosure requirements and impose a fiduciary duty on RRG directors. The Insurance Data Protection Act (H.R. 3559) introduced additional amendments to the LRRA, including a fiduciary duty for RRG directors. The Insurance Data Protection Act (H.R. 3559) was introduced on December 8, 2011, but was not brought before the full committee for consideration. The bill aimed to remove the Federal Insurance Office's authority to issue subpoenas and extend confidentiality requirements for insurance information. Another bill, the Insurance Consumer Protection and Solvency Act (H.R. 6423), was introduced on September 14, 2012, by Representative Bill Posey and referred to the House Committee on Financial Services. H.R. 6423, introduced in September 2012, aimed to amend Dodd-Frank by exempting insurance companies from the resolution regime. It would have removed the FDIC's authority over insurance subsidiaries and excluded them from assessment fees. Several other unenacted bills related to insurance regulation were introduced in the 111th Congress. H.R. 1583, introduced in 2009, aimed to abolish the exemption from federal antitrust laws for the \"business of insurance\" and allow investigations of insurance companies by the Federal Trade Commission. H.R. 1880, introduced in the same year, focused on insurance consumer protection. H.R. 1880 aimed to create a federal charter for the insurance industry, allowing nationally licensed insurers, agencies, and producers to operate nationwide without state law requirements. It also addressed systemic risk by designating a regulator to oversee systemically significant insurers. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 2554) aimed to establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) as a private, nonprofit corporation for insurance producers. Introduced by Representative David Scott, it passed the House but was not acted upon by the Senate. The NARAB member, a private, nonprofit corporation for insurance producers, would operate in any state upon payment of licensing fees. Oversight by a board with industry and state appointees, with the President having authority to dissolve or suspend actions. Introduced as the Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) by Representative Dennis Moore, it aimed to streamline regulations for out-of-state insurance producers. H.R. 4802, introduced by Representative Dennis Moore along with Representatives John Campbell and Suzanne Kosmas on March 10, 2010, aimed to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws for risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups covering commercial property risks. It proposed changes to enforcement mechanisms, adding federal corporate governance requirements, and allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue determinations on state regulations. The bill proposed federal preemption of state insurance laws for risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups, with the Secretary of the Treasury issuing determinations on state regulations. It included corporate governance standards such as independent directors, audit committees, written governance standards, and limited contracts with service providers. Amendments would expand consumer disclosure and impose a fiduciary duty on the board of directors. (H.R. 6529) The Federal License for Reinsurers Act of 2010 (H.R. 6529) proposed creating a federal license for reinsurers under the authority of the FIO. The bill was introduced by Representative Dennis Moore but did not progress in the House Committee on Financial Services. Additionally, the 2008 Treasury Blueprint aimed to modernize the financial regulatory structure, focusing on flexibility and efficiency rather than as a response to the financial crisis. The 2008 Treasury Blueprint proposed a revamped regulatory structure for financial services, including a prudential regulator, business conduct regulator, and market stability regulator. It recommended creating a federal insurance regulator for an optional federal charter and an \"Office of Insurance Oversight\" in the Department of the Treasury as an interim step. The Treasury Department under Secretary Timothy Geithner released a whitepaper outlining President Obama's plan to reform financial regulation in the United States. The plan aimed to introduce systemic risk oversight by the Federal Reserve, consolidate banking regulators, and establish a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency. The Obama administration's plan aimed to consolidate banking regulators, create a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency, and introduce systemic risk oversight by the Federal Reserve. Most insurance products were excluded from the jurisdiction of the new federal consumer protection agency, with states maintaining a primary role in insurance regulation. However, insurance regulation would be impacted through the regulation of large financial companies presenting systemic risk and the establishment of a new Office of National Insurance within the Treasury. The draft legislation proposed the creation of a Financial Services Oversight Council, led by the heads of federal financial regulators, to regulate systemic risk in all US financial companies. Insurers were not explicitly mentioned but could fall under federal jurisdiction. Companies posing a threat to financial stability could be designated Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies, subject to strict solvency standards and enhanced resolution authority. The Federal Reserve would oversee these regulations, with some references to state regulatory agencies. The proposed legislation aimed to regulate systemic risk in financial companies through the creation of a Financial Services Oversight Council. The Federal Reserve would oversee Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies, with some involvement from state regulators. The Office of National Insurance, under President Obama's plan, would serve as a federal overseer for insurance issues, setting policy and representing the US at the federal level. The Office of National Insurance would oversee insurance issues, set federal policy, represent the US internationally, and preempt state laws inconsistent with international agreements."
