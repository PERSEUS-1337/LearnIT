    "content": "The United States has seen an increase in sex offender management policies since the 1990s, with laws imposing post-incarceration controls such as residency restrictions, registration requirements, and civil commitment. Recent judicial decisions, including United States v. Comstock and United States v. Carr, have addressed these controls. Proponents argue that these restrictions are necessary to reduce recidivism and protect potential victims, while opponents question their efficacy and impact on constitutional guarantees. This report examines background and case law related to registration requirements and residency restrictions for tracking offenders. Questions remain about the efficacy and proportionality of these restrictions, especially for crimes committed decades ago and for juveniles. Judicial determinations may inform policy issues, such as whether offenders should be subjected to these restrictions. The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Comstock upheld a federal statute authorizing civil commitment for \"sexually dangerous persons.\" For more information on challenges to the federal civil commitment statute, see CRS Report R40958, United States v. Comstock: Supreme Court Review of Civil. All 50 states and the District of Columbia require sex offenders to register where they live or work, enforced with criminal penalties. Registration continues after serving a sentence, with goals of aiding law enforcement and preventing future crimes. Congress has encouraged states to enact stricter registration requirements. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted as part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. It requires sex offenders to register and maintain their registration in any jurisdiction where they reside, work, study, or were convicted. Failure to comply results in the withholding of 10% of Byrne Justice Assistance Grant funds from states. The Adam Walsh Act established guidelines for sex offender registration systems, dividing offenders into tiers with increasing scrutiny and registration requirements. States were required to implement these guidelines by July 27, 2009, with extensions granted by the Attorney General. Despite financial provisions, some jurisdictions were given additional time until July 27, 2011, to comply. The Adam Walsh Act established guidelines for sex offender registration systems, with states required to comply by July 27, 2011. Some states have faced challenges in implementation due to perceived costs and concerns with federal requirements. Three states are currently in compliance with the guidelines, while the Department of Justice proposed supplemental guidelines to address issues like public notification for minor offenders. SORNA established a federal criminal provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250, penalizing sex offenders who fail to register. It applies to those convicted of federal or state sex offenses who do not register. Penalties include fines and up to 10 years' imprisonment. Federal courts generally interpret \u00a7 2250 as applicable in all states, even those that have not implemented SORNA's guidelines. Federal courts interpret \u00a7 2250 as criminal liability for failure to comply with state registration requirements before SORNA's enactment. States established registration programs in the mid-1990s to comply with federal grant conditions. The statute does not specify that the registry must implement SORNA guidelines. Courts also consider the retroactive application of the criminal provision. The Attorney General promulgated a rule applying registration requirements to sex offenders convicted before SORNA's enactment. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \u00a7 2250 does not apply to persons whose interstate travel predated SORNA's enactment. The defendant, Thomas Carr, was convicted of sexual abuse in Alabama in 2004 and moved to Indiana without registering as a sex offender. He was indicted and convicted in federal court for violating \u00a7 2250 after SORNA's enactment. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \u00a7 2250 does not apply to individuals whose interstate travel occurred before SORNA's enactment. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \u00a7 2250 does not apply to individuals whose interstate travel predates SORNA's enactment. Justice Sotomayor's opinion highlighted the sequence of elements in \u00a7 2250 and the use of present-tense verbs in the statute. Congress's choice of present-tense verb form was deemed consistent with other provisions in the statute. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Carr restricts the application of SORNA's criminal provision (\u00a7 2250) in cases that may implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause and other constitutional guarantees. Various constitutional challenges have been raised against \u00a7 2250 or SORNA's registration requirement, with U.S. courts of appeals mostly upholding the provisions. The U.S. courts of appeals have generally upheld the federal registration provisions and \u00a7 2250, despite some exceptions. The Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits laws that retroactively punish actions, aggravate crimes, increase punishments, or alter evidence rules. While SORNA was intended as a civil regulatory scheme, courts may find it punitive and in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause with clear proof. The Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits retroactively punishing actions or increasing punishments. Some courts have found state registration laws to violate this clause. The Supreme Court has not ruled on SORNA's compliance with the Ex Post Facto Clause. In Smith v. Doe, the Court upheld an Alaska registration statute despite a Ninth Circuit ruling that it violated the clause. The Court considered factors from Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez to determine if a law is punitive. The Supreme Court upheld an Alaska registration statute in Smith v. Doe, despite concerns about its punitive nature. The Court considered various factors to determine if a law is punitive, with a key factor being its connection to a non-punitive purpose. It remains uncertain if the Court's reasoning in Smith will apply to future challenges of SORNA, as the federal statute differs from state laws in ways that may be legally significant. The Alaska statute in Smith was upheld despite concerns about its punitive nature. In contrast, \u00a7 2250 is codified with federal criminal statutes and authorizes penalties of up to one year imprisonment. U.S. courts of appeals have generally upheld SORNA against ex post facto challenges, emphasizing Congress's non-punitive intent. The U.S. courts have generally upheld SORNA against ex post facto challenges, citing Congress's non-punitive intent. However, the Ninth Circuit faced a unique case in United States v. Juvenile Male, where a defendant's juvenile delinquency was a first-time challenge to \u00a7 2250. The court in United States v. Juvenile Male emphasized the distinct impacts of SORNA registration requirements on former juvenile offenders, holding that these requirements create a new stigma in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. The Supreme Court issued a per curiam opinion suggesting the government's appeal may be moot. The Supreme Court's holding in Carr appears to have made ex post facto challenges arguing SORNA's unconstitutionality moot for pre-SORNA interstate travelers. However, ex post facto issues persist in cases like Juvenile Male, potentially reaching the Supreme Court for unique punitive impacts or unclear timelines. Concerns arise if a defendant's failure to register occurred too soon after SORNA's enactment, raising due process and applicability arguments. Some defendants claim SORNA's criminal provision violates their Fifth Amendment due process rights. In a 1957 case, Lambert v. California, the Supreme Court struck down a conviction under a Los Angeles ordinance on lack-of-notice grounds, emphasizing the need for actual notice of the city's ordinance for a conviction to stand in due process claims. In Lambert v. California, the Supreme Court emphasized the need for actual notice of the city's ordinance before a conviction would survive a due process challenge. Federal courts have distinguished Lambert in cases challenging SORNA, noting that individuals convicted of sex offenses would likely already be aware of state requirements. Several U.S. courts of appeals have reached the same conclusion on this issue. The substantive due process argument in challenges to SORNA focuses on the impossibility of violating \u00a7 2250 in states that have not implemented SORNA. Federal courts have generally rejected this argument, stating that knowledge of violating state law is sufficient notice for due process guarantees. Congress relied on the Commerce Clause to enact SORNA, allowing regulation of interstate commerce activities. The criminal provision accompanying SORNA, Section 2250, is limited to persons who travel in interstate commerce. U.S. courts of appeals have interpreted this provision as regulating the channels of interstate commerce. The underlying registration statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913, presents a more challenging case as it must be justified under the third Lopez category of regulating activities related to interstate commerce. The federal registration requirement under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913 is generally upheld by courts as being substantially related to interstate commerce. Different rationales include tracking sex offenders as they travel interstate, preventing evasion of state laws, and its integral link to the criminal provision under \u00a7 2250. Defendants have challenged \u00a7 16913(d), which authorizes the Attorney General to determine registration applicability, based on the non-delegation doctrine. Courts have generally upheld delegations of authority guided by intelligible principles, despite some disagreement. In enacting \u00a7 16913(d), Congress made necessary legislative determinations, leaving the Attorney General with a narrow question guided by \"intelligible principles.\" States and localities have implemented residency restrictions for sex offenders, following the murder of Jessica Lunsford in 1995. These laws vary in scope, often prohibiting offenders from residing near places where children gather. Residency restrictions for sex offenders are implemented by states and localities, prohibiting them from living near places where children congregate, such as schools, churches, parks, and libraries. These restrictions typically range from 1,000 to 2,000 feet from the designated place. Variations exist in the applicability of these restrictions, with some jurisdictions imposing them on all sexual offenders regardless of the type of crime or risk of reoffending. Residency restrictions for sex offenders vary among jurisdictions, with some limited to high-risk offenders or those convicted of serious crimes. Laws in Arkansas, for example, prohibit level three or four offenders from living within 2,000 feet of schools or child care facilities. Some restrictions apply only to offenders on supervised release, while others are lifetime bans. There are debates on the effectiveness and constitutionality of these laws, with proponents arguing for the need to protect communities. Opponents of residency restrictions for sex offenders argue that these laws can have unintended consequences, such as isolating offenders in rural areas, creating homelessness, and hindering law enforcement's ability to track offenders. They believe that these restrictions are overly broad and do not effectively protect residents. Residency restrictions for sex offenders aim to prevent them from residing in certain areas, but can lead to unintended consequences like homelessness. Legislators must balance community safety with offenders' rights. The laws must be carefully examined to determine if they function as civil remedies or criminal penalties, with different legal implications for each. Defendants have challenged residency restrictions on various constitutional grounds, including due process rights, self-incrimination, and cruel and unusual punishment. While courts have mostly rejected these challenges, there have been mixed results regarding the Ex Post Facto Clause. State courts tend to uphold narrowly tailored statutes but strike down those lacking a grandfather clause or being overly broad. On the federal level, challenges have been unsuccessful. The Eighth Circuit upheld Iowa's sex offender residency restriction statute against constitutional challenges brought by convicted offenders with predated convictions for various sexual crimes. The plaintiffs had difficulty finding compliant housing and argued that the statute was facially unconstitutional. The district court agreed, citing violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, Fifth Amendment rights, and due process guarantees, issuing a permanent injunction against enforcement. The Eighth Circuit upheld Iowa's sex offender residency restriction statute against constitutional challenges. The plaintiffs argued that the statute violated procedural due process by not providing individualized dangerousness determinations. The Eighth Circuit upheld Iowa's sex offender residency restriction statute, stating that due process does not entitle a defendant to a hearing for a fact immaterial under the statute. The statute applied equally to all offenders convicted of specific crimes against minors, regardless of individual dangerousness assessments. The court emphasized that unless the legislative classification conflicts with the U.S. Constitution, there is no requirement for exemptions. The plaintiffs claimed the residency restrictions violated substantive due process. The residency restrictions were challenged as a violation of substantive due process, which protects fundamental rights like contraception, abortion, marriage, and education. Government actions must pass strict scrutiny or rational basis review depending on the right involved. The Eighth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the Iowa statute violated fundamental rights, including the right to live and travel freely and have privacy in family matters. The court determined that the statute did not implicate any fundamental rights triggering strict scrutiny, as it did not directly regulate family relationships or restrict family members from living with a sex offender in a compliant residence. The court also dismissed claims that the residency restrictions interfered with the constitutional right to travel. The Eighth Circuit upheld that Iowa's statute did not violate fundamental rights, including the right to travel. The court stated that the residency restrictions did not directly impair interstate movement as offenders could still travel in and out of the state. The Eighth Circuit upheld Iowa's statute, stating that residency restrictions did not violate the right to travel. The court found the statute rationally related to protecting children and not a violation of the Self-Incrimination Clause. The Eighth Circuit upheld Iowa's statute on sex offender residency restrictions, stating that it did not compel offenders to provide incriminating information and was not an ex post facto law. The court found that the statute aimed to protect citizens' safety and was a non-punitive, civil regulation. The court upheld Iowa's sex offender residency restrictions as a non-punitive civil regulation to protect citizens' safety. It relied on factors from Smith v. Doe to determine the statute's intent and effects. The court upheld Iowa's sex offender residency restrictions as non-punitive civil regulations to protect citizens' safety. The majority reasoned that the restrictions did not constitute effective banishment and were less severe as offenders retained access to restricted areas. The law's primary purpose was to reduce reoffending, imposing an affirmative restraint on convicted offenders. The Eighth Circuit upheld Iowa's residency restrictions for sex offenders as a civil regulation to protect minors, despite lack of individualized risk assessment. State challenges have produced mixed results, with Indiana Supreme Court finding punitive effects in some cases. In State v. Pollard, the court found that a statute with punitive effects on sex offenders was unconstitutional. The statute forced offenders to relinquish ownership rights in their residence or face felony charges, without considering individual danger to the public. In Lee v. State, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the sex offender residency restriction statute as non-punitive, citing the purpose of protecting the public from recidivist sex offenders. The court found no punitive purpose or effect in the statute, as it was deemed necessary for public safety. Similarly, the Iowa Supreme Court upheld its residency restriction statute in State v. Seering, following a similar rationale. In State v. Seering, the plaintiff was convicted of lascivious conduct with a minor and faced challenges, including an ex post facto challenge. After being arrested for living near a daycare center, he moved with his family to abandoned farm property. The Iowa Supreme Court ultimately upheld the statute, deeming it civil and designed to protect minors' health and safety. The Supreme Court of Georgia found Georgia's residency restriction statute to be an impermissible taking under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment when applied to a sex offender who was a homeowner forced to move after a child care facility opened within the restricted zone. The statute prohibits registered sex offenders from residing within 1,000 feet of certain facilities. Anthony Mann, a registered sex offender, was notified of violation when a child care facility opened near his parents' home where he resided. Anthony Mann, a registered sex offender, filed two lawsuits (Mann I and Mann II) challenging Georgia's residency restriction statute after being notified of violation when a child care facility opened near his parents' home. The first suit was dismissed as he had only a minimal property interest in the living arrangements. Mann later purchased a home in compliance with the restriction, but faced another violation when a child care facility opened near his new residence. The declaration challenges the constitutionality of section 42-1-15 for authorizing the regulatory taking of property without compensation, violating the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This clause prohibits private property from being taken for public use without just compensation, whether through physical or regulatory takings. Regulatory takings occur when government regulations are so burdensome that they are equivalent to a direct appropriation of property. Both physical and regulatory takings may be compensable. Regulatory takings, whether total or partial, may be compensable under the Fifth Amendment. A \"total regulatory taking\" happens when government regulation deprives an owner of all economically beneficial use of their property. On the other hand, a \"partial regulatory taking\" occurs when the regulation deprives an owner of a substantial, but not total, portion of the property's economic value. In Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York, the Supreme Court provided guidance on determining a partial regulatory taking. In a partial regulatory taking, a court considers factors like economic impact on the landowner, interference with investment-backed expectations, and the character of government action. The purpose is to prevent unfair burdens on individuals. The Mann II court applied the Penn Central test as there was no direct appropriation or physical invasion of Mann's property, allowing him to still sell or rent it. The statute would force Mann to find another residence, impacting his economic situation. The statute's effect on Mann would force him to maintain two residences until the violating house is sold or rented, leading to significant expenses. Georgia's residency restriction had a recurring economic impact on Mann, as there was no safe place for registered sex offenders to live without the risk of being ejected. The court found that Georgia's residency restriction on sex offenders had a significant economic impact on Mann, forcing him to incur ongoing expenses and potentially face never-ending financial burdens. The restriction was deemed to preclude Mann from having any reasonable investment-backed expectation in his property, akin to a physical taking or ouster. The court found that Georgia's residency restriction on sex offenders had a significant economic impact on Mann, forcing him to incur ongoing expenses and potentially face never-ending financial burdens. The effect of the restriction is akin to a physical taking or ouster, mandating Mann's immediate removal from his residence. The court questioned whether the residency restriction serves the purpose of the Takings Clause or unfairly burdens sex offenders alone without requiring third parties to aid in providing protection. The Supreme Court of Georgia found Georgia's residency restriction on sex offenders unconstitutional as it imposed a burden on property rights without compensation. Legal questions persist regarding the retroactive application of post-incarceration controls on individuals convicted of sex offenses. The continuing dilemma in ex post facto and other challenges arises from the dual nature of post-conviction controls, comprising civil and criminal elements. The key issue is determining when a statute's effect is so punitive that it overrides a legislature's non-punitive intent, raising questions about the application of these restrictions."
