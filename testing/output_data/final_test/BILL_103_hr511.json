    "content": "The Public Service Scholarship Act of 1993, also known as the Public Service Scholarship Program, amends the United States Code to establish a scholarship program for public service. The Public Service Scholarship Program, established by the Office of Personnel Management, awards scholarships to outstanding students. Candidates are identified through contracts with non-government organizations. The Public Service Scholarship Program, established by the Office of Personnel Management, awards scholarships to outstanding students based on academic excellence, commitment to public service or a useful field, and geographic diversity. Candidates are selected without consideration of race, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, age, disability, or political affiliation. Scholarship agreements require organizations to allow examination of necessary records by the Office of Personnel Management and the General Accounting Office. The Public Service Scholarship Program awards scholarships to students selected by agencies based on academic excellence. Scholarship agreements include provisions for defraying educational costs for pursuing a degree and maintaining academic requirements. The individual must maintain acceptable academic standing and provide certifications from the educational institution. Upon completing the degree requirements, they must accept a full-time position in the excepted service commensurate with their degree and experience. The individual appointed to a position in the competitive service must serve for 18 months for each academic year funded by a scholarship. They agree to repay the full scholarship amount if they fail to maintain acceptable academic standing. If an individual appointed to a position in the competitive service fails to maintain acceptable academic standing or meet degree requirements, they must repay the scholarship amount. Failure to repay will result in the government recovering the outstanding amount through various methods, including setoff against accrued pay. The head of the agency can waive the right of recovery if it goes against equity or public interest. An agency and individual can modify or terminate an agreement at any time. The agency is not obligated to offer a position to a scholarship recipient, but if they don't within the specified time, the agreement is terminated. The individual may complete their service with another agency. The Office of Personnel Management determines the maximum scholarship amount based on educational costs. Agencies can make scholarship payments from available funds. The Office of Personnel Management can reimburse agencies for scholarship payments under the Public Service Scholarship Program. Regulations for the program will be prescribed by the Office, and an annual report on its operation will be submitted to Congress. The Public Service Scholarship Program allows for reimbursement of scholarship payments by the Office of Personnel Management. Amendments made by this section will be effective as of the enactment date of the Act. Additionally, Section 5379 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to authorize the President to apply certain provisions to specific categories of employees at the request of an agency head."
