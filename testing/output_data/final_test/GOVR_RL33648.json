    "content": "The Office of Infrastructure Protection (OIP) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has developed a National Asset Database containing information on various assets. Critics are concerned about the inclusion of assets perceived as having more local than national importance. DHS clarifies that the Database is not meant to be a list of the nation's most critical assets and is not used inappropriately for resource allocation. The report discusses the National Asset Database, its contents, how it is populated, its purpose, and potential oversight issues. The database originated in 2003 with a list of 160 critical sites selected by the Protective Services Division within the Office of Infrastructure Protection. In 2003, the Department of Homeland Security started collecting information on critical assets for security purposes. The initial list of 160 assets grew to 1,849 and became the Protected Measures Target List. By 2006, the National Asset Database included 77,069 assets of varying types. The National Asset Database contains 77,069 assets, including nuclear power plants, dams, a casket company, and an elevator company. It also includes various locations and events like Times Square in New York City and the Mule Day Parade in Columbia Tennessee. The database categorizes entries by critical infrastructure sectors and specific types of assets, such as malls, racetracks, theme parks, casinos, retail stores, religious meeting places, gas stations, libraries, educational facilities, railroad bridges, and petroleum pipelines. Information for the database is sourced from various sources by the Department of Homeland Security. The National Asset Database contains 77,069 assets sourced from various sources. The DHS IG report focused on data quality from states and localities, highlighting poor guidance given during the first data call in 2003. The DHS IG report criticized the minimal guidance given to states and localities for the National Asset Database. States were told to consider assets that could result in catastrophic loss, leading to inclusion of unexpected assets like petting zoos and local festivals. State officials were surprised by the addition of assets, raising questions about data collection. A second request in 2004 was more organized and specific, resulting in better results. The DHS requested specific information for the National Asset Database, including 17 data fields such as address, owner, and latitude/longitude coordinates. States were asked to identify assets of national significance based on criteria provided by DHS, resulting in the inclusion of questionable assets. Despite the more specific request, states had leeway in what to include, leading to the addition of assets with questionable national significance. The DHS IG report found that the National Asset Database contains assets of questionable national significance and lacks essential assets, leading to an incomplete picture. Entries vary from state to state, with inconsistencies in the types of assets included. Recommendations include reviewing and removing out-of-place assets and providing state homeland security advisers with the opportunity to assess the Database. The National Asset Database should retain assets, allow state homeland security advisers to review and identify relevant assets, provide States with lists of their assets to prevent duplicate submissions, and complete a comprehensive risk assessment of critical infrastructure. The National Strategy for Homeland Security prioritizes high-priority assets, while the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure emphasizes developing a methodology for identifying assets with national-level criticality. The National Asset Database is not a list of critical assets but a comprehensive catalog of the nation's critical infrastructure and key resources. It provides descriptive information for assets and systems, serving as a database for various lists of critical assets. The National Asset Database, described as a 'phonebook' by Robert Stephan, contains 77,000 facilities, assets, and systems for detailed risk analyses. Originally known as the Protected Measures Target List, it includes assets considered critical at the national level. Congressional interest focuses on a prioritized list of critical infrastructure, causing some confusion over the term's definition. The National Asset Database contains 77,000 facilities, assets, and systems for risk analyses. There is confusion over the term \"critical infrastructure\" as it is used to refer to specific assets or entire sectors. The Database's purpose is unclear - is it a list of critical assets or assets within critical sectors? The National Asset Database contains 77,000 facilities, assets, and systems for risk analyses. It is used as a first step in prioritizing risk reduction activities and to provide situational awareness. The Database does not drive funding decisions but helps identify critical assets for further analysis in the risk management process outlined by the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. DHS uses the National Asset Database to identify critical assets for further risk analysis. Assets judged as non-critical do not require additional information. For critical assets, DHS requests more data to assess vulnerability, consequences, and threats, leading to a risk score. Risk reduction initiatives are prioritized based on cost-effectiveness. According to the IG report, DHS officials acknowledge that many assets in the National Asset Database will not be thoroughly analyzed or used to support programs. DHS has identified a prioritized list of high-priority assets based on vulnerability and consequences, excluding non-essential facilities like petting zoos and popcorn factories. Detailed information on individual assets may not be necessary to determine criticality, as seen with gas stations listed in the database. Gas stations are part of the oil and gas infrastructure, located at the end of the distribution chain. The loss of an individual gas station would have minimal impact beyond its immediate vicinity. The National Asset Database contains 127 gas stations, but specific information on these stations is not necessary to determine their criticality. Maintaining specific information on gas stations in the National Asset Database is deemed unnecessary to determine their criticality, as noted by DHS. Undersecretary Foresman highlighted that assets not classified as 'critical' may still be critical depending on circumstances, such as emergent terrorist threats or natural disasters. This information, regardless of criticality level, aids in decision-making for preparedness. The National Asset Database contains critical information to inform decisions on preparedness, response, and recovery for various incidents. Assistant Secretary Stephan emphasized the importance of including a wide range of assets in the database to anticipate potential threats. The Database will provide a Risk/Readiness Dashboard to DHS management, integrating threat streams with infrastructure vulnerability information for better planning and management. The National Asset Database includes infrastructure vulnerability information and consequences, providing a risk profile for critical assets. It allows for real-time knowledge to support rapid decision-making during threats, with access for stakeholders at state and local levels. DHS values the inclusion of non-nationally critical assets to understand their importance to states and localities. The National Asset Database includes infrastructure vulnerability information and consequences, providing a risk profile for critical assets. It allows for real-time knowledge to support rapid decision-making during threats, with access for stakeholders at state and local levels. The statements above raise issues regarding the definition of critical infrastructures and the challenges of setting priorities based on intelligence. DHS is expected to respond to intelligence for counter-terrorism efforts, but this may conflict with the fundamental goal of identifying the most critical assets for national protection. The National Asset Database is incomplete and lacks a comprehensive list of the nation's infrastructure assets. For example, it only includes a small number of gas stations, defense industrial base assets, postal and shipping sites, banking and financial assets, and agriculture and food assets. This limited scope hinders its utility in supporting national protection efforts. The National Asset Database is limited in its utility for situational awareness as it includes assets not selected by states. This raises concerns about its role in allocating federal resources for infrastructure protection, especially after changes in grant levels based on new risk calculations in FY2006. Some Members believe grant allocations were based on a flawed National Asset Database, despite DHS using it to allocate critical infrastructure protection grants. The relationship between ODP's grant-making process, the National Asset Database, and the NIPP is unclear in DHS documents. The NIPP risk assessment process was finalized in June 2006, but ODP has its own risk assessment process. The ODP's grant-making process operates independently from the National Asset Database and the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. Issues remain regarding the quality of information in the Database and the value of including low criticality assets. The National Asset Database's data quality has been questioned, with concerns about accuracy, consistency, and completeness. Early entries were found to be inaccurate, with examples such as non-operational electric power assets and incorrect locations like Disneyland. DHS itself deemed the early Protected Measures Target List unreliable. The IG report highlighted DHS's efforts to improve the quality of information in the National Asset Database, including hiring contractors to standardize data, approve a taxonomy for categorizing assets, and use expert panels for review. Concerns remain about the completeness of critical infrastructure information. The IG report raised concerns about the National Asset Database's completeness and quality of information, noting that certain assets may be missing. Private sector reluctance to share information was identified as a contributing factor. Maintaining quality requires continuous effort to ensure accuracy and currency, including capturing changes in ownership or location. Accessibility, flexibility, and security of the database are also important considerations. The DHS plans to develop a second generation Database integrating vulnerability, risk, and threat information, expected in two years. The Undersecretary claims the current Database meets security standards. The IG report warns that maintaining unusual entries may complicate database use, resource allocation, and credibility. The DHS IG report raises concerns about the potential complications and costs associated with maintaining unusual entries in the Database, but does not provide clear explanations on how these entries could impact efforts. The presence of this data requires time and resources for verification, and additional costs may be incurred for further analysis. Budget details on DHS spending for the Database are not provided, but Congress allocated $20 million for it. The DHS IG report raises concerns about maintaining non-critical assets in the Database, noting that their costs could dominate maintenance expenses. Currently, only 2,500 assets are considered critical out of a larger number. Owners are not obligated to provide information to the Database, raising questions about the value of including non-critical assets. The National Asset Database does not require asset owners to provide information voluntarily. However, having assets listed may result in legal or regulatory consequences. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, which includes a section on the National Asset Database. The Homeland Security Act was amended to establish a National Asset Database and a National At-Risk Database. The House disagreed with the Undersecretary on the prioritization of assets in the Database. A National Asset Database Consortium was created to advise the Secretary on maintaining the Database. The Secretary is required to maintain the National Asset Database and solicit comments from the Consortium on risk methodologies. Recommendations must be secured within 60 days of the act being enacted. The Secretary must annually review the Database to ensure accuracy and remove assets that do not meet national guidelines. This requirement contradicts the Undersecretary's stance on less critical assets in the Database. The Secretary is required to maintain the National Asset Database, provide it to states for review, and meet annually with them to discuss guidelines for submissions. The Database must be organized by sector, state, locality, and region, with an annual report to Congress on at-risk assets. The report includes asset name, location, sector, changes in criteria, and Database usage for resource allocation. The Database is used for allocating resources, with DHS likely classifying asset-specific information. Title XI of S. 4 requires a risk-based list of critical infrastructure and key resources, considering assets that, if destroyed, would cause significant harm. The list guides prevention, protection, recovery, and reconstitution efforts, with annual reporting to Congress on criteria and methodology. Title X of the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 established the National Asset Database and instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security to maintain a classified list of critical infrastructure that could cause \"catastrophic effects\" if destroyed. The Database is updated annually with input from State officials, and methods for data collection are evaluated. The Secretary of Homeland Security was instructed to maintain a classified list of critical infrastructure in the National Asset Database. Annual reports are required to include details on assets at risk of terrorism, use of the Database for allocating federal funds, and comprehensive sector assessments with recommended countermeasures. Reports may be classified, with an unclassified version available. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to report annually on actions taken to ensure private sector preparedness for critical infrastructure interruptions due to terrorism or natural disasters. The report goes to specific congressional committees and allows the Secretary discretion on the Consortium concept. The House version of the FY2008 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill directed the removal of insignificant items from the National Asset Database. The House version of the FY2008 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill directed the removal of insignificant items from the National Asset Database. The Senate version did not contain similar language, but encouraged the Directorate to clarify guidance for asset review and information solicitation."
