    "content": "The 10-year ban on \"semiautomatic assault weapons\" and \"large capacity ammunition feeding devices\" expired in 2004, sparking controversy. Various bills were introduced to extend, make permanent, or expand the ban. Congress is considering whether the ban reduced violent gun crimes and if SAWs are more dangerous than other firearms. The report focuses on firearms trace data from the ATF to support extending, making permanent, and possibly expanding the ban on \"semiautomatic assault weapons.\" Ban opponents argue there are limitations with the trace data, while researchers debate its proper interpretation. Legal challenges to the ban are not covered in this report. The report discusses the definition of semiautomatic assault weapons (SAWs) based on specific features such as detachable magazines and additional characteristics like folding stocks or grenade launchers. SAWs legally owned before the ban are exempt, but there is a lack of precise data on the number of SAWs in civilian circulation. The lack of definitive data on SAWs in civilian circulation and their use in crime is a significant issue. Limited data sources include ATF firearm trace data, crime gun recoveries in certain cities, and data on law enforcement officers killed feloniously. However, the proper use and interpretation of ATF firearm trace data remains a matter of debate, raising questions about its representativeness in measuring guns used in crime. Some researchers find firearm trace data useful for measuring crime gun trends in localities with consistent data collection. However, ATF and FBI do not endorse using this data for purposes other than criminal investigations. An assessment in 2004 found that firearms with LCAFDs were used in 14% to 26% of crimes in six cities. The study's researchers found that firearms with LCAFDs were used in 14% to 26% of crimes in certain cities, potentially offsetting any reduction in firearms-related violent crime from the ban. However, limitations in firearm recovery data, such as low recovery rates and variations in enforcement strategies, hindered the researchers' ability to draw definitive conclusions. The study's researchers were limited in testing statistical significance between different firearms recovered. Data on law enforcement officers killed with firearms showed SAWs and similar rifles were used in many cases. Proponents of the ban argue that military-style firearms were used in a significant number of cases. It is unclear if all firearms were SAWs and their impact on criminals outgunning police. Supporters of the ban on assault weapons argue that these firearms were designed for military purposes, are favored by criminals, and are not suitable for hunting or self-defense. They emphasize that assault weapons have features that increase their firing capacity and ease, making them more lethal than other firearms. The ban was prompted by several mass shootings involving assault weapons, which are disproportionately used in crimes with multiple victims and police officers as targets. Despite legal challenges, proponents maintain that the ban is necessary to prevent further tragedies. Opponents of the assault weapons ban argue that these firearms are not significantly different from other semiautomatic firearms, with features that are mainly cosmetic. They claim that assault weapons are used by law-abiding citizens for self-defense, marksmanship, and hunting, and were only involved in a small percentage of violent crimes before and after the ban. They see the ban as a violation of citizens' rights to own firearms. Defining an \"assault weapon\" has been a contentious issue, with varying opinions on whether it includes all military-style firearms or just semiautomatic weapons. The term has been used for marketing and journalistic purposes, and the 1994 legislation provided a statutory definition that expired with the ban. Categorizing firearms based on traditional notions is challenging due to the wide variety of designs. Some debate exists over the term \"assault weapon,\" with firearms experts noting that assault rifles were developed during World War II for lighter infantry weapons with increased capacity and rate of fire. Features included detachable magazines and select fire modes for automatic or burst firing. During World War II, mid-size rounds were developed for lighter infantry weapons with increased capacity and reduced recoil. The Germans created the first assault rifle, the Sturmgewehr (StG 43), based on the Mkb 42 design. This design influenced later assault rifle models like the AK-47 and the G-3. The United States developed the M-16 assault rifle in the late 1950s, chambered for Remington .223 cartridges. It became the standard infantry rifle during the Southeast Asian conflict and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. Most military assault rifles are fully automatic, with select fire features for multi-round bursts or semiautomatic mode. These rifles incorporate features from submachine guns and handguns. The curr_chunk discusses the features of semiautomatic rifles, including pistol grips, barrel shrouds, and detachable magazines with high capacity. These rifles are self-reloading and fire one round per trigger pull. They are different from fully automatic rifles and have similarities to submachine guns and handguns. Semiautomatic rifles fire one round per trigger pull, similar to revolvers. They can accept high-capacity magazines and were originally designed for military use but modified for civilian markets. Converting them to fully automatic is illegal. Large-capacity magazines are a key feature of assault weapons. The 1994 ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines was a result of congressional hearings following a 1989 shooting in Stockton, California. Legislation to restrict these weapons was debated in Congress but not enacted until the 103rd Congress, when Senator Dianne Feinstein successfully amended the omnibus crime control act of 1993. The 1994 assault weapons ban was included in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (H.R. 3355) signed into law by President Clinton on September 13, 1994. Efforts to repeal the ban with H.R. 125 in the 104th Congress were met with a veto threat from President Clinton. The 1994 assault weapons ban expired on September 13, 2004, after no further action was taken to extend or terminate it. The ban prohibited the manufacture, transfer, or possession of certain firearms for 10 years, including specific make and model definitions of assault weapons. The 1994 assault weapons ban expired in 2004, prohibiting certain firearms for 10 years, including specific make and model definitions of assault weapons such as Colt AR-15, Fabrique National FN/FAL, SWD M-10, Steyr AUG, INTRATEC TEC-9, and revolving cylinder shotguns. SAWs were defined by features like semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines and certain other features, and semiautomatic pistols with detachable magazines and specific features. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban prohibited certain firearms for 10 years, including specific make and model definitions of assault weapons. It also banned semiautomatic shotguns with specific features and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. Exemptions were provided for weapons lawfully possessed before the ban. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban prohibited certain firearms for 10 years, including specific make and model definitions of assault weapons, semiautomatic shotguns with specific features, and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. Exemptions were provided for weapons lawfully possessed before the ban, as well as certain types of long guns and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns with restrictions on feeding devices. Additionally, exemptions were granted for the importation of certain firearms and for public agencies or individuals meeting specific conditions. Following the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, firearm manufacturers modified designs to comply with the ban's requirements. References to \"pre-ban\" and \"post-ban\" assault weapons emerged, with post-ban firearms being modified to evade the ban. The importation of some semiautomatic firearms was halted in 1989 under the George H.W. Bush administration. The Clinton Administration halted the importation of semiautomatic firearms that could be considered \"assault weapons\" under the 1968 Gun Control Act, due to concerns about their suitability for sporting purposes. This decision was influenced by a trade dispute with China and the involvement of companies linked to the Chinese Army in providing surplus military firearms to U.S. importers at low costs. Domestic firearm manufacturers continued to produce firearms, some of which were in violation of the importation ban or should have been banned under an expanded definition of assault weapons. The 1994 Act imposed an importation ban on certain firearms, leading to concerns about incongruities in the law. The Attorney General was required to study the impact of the ban on drug trafficking and violent crime, delegating this task to the National Institute of Justice. The initial SAW ban impact study was released in 1997. The Urban Institute researchers conducted a study to measure the impact of the SAW ban on reducing SAW-related crime. They found that the ban had only a modest effect on gun murders due to the limited use of banned weapons in such crimes. The researchers found that the assault weapon ban possibly led to a 6.7% decrease in total gun murders and a 27% decrease in assault weapon-related crime between 1994 and 1995. They also noted a slight reduction in killings of police officers with assault weapons. The ATF firearms trace data were considered imperfect but reflected similar trends in data on all guns recovered in two cities. The Urban Institute researchers recommended developing new gun market data sources, studying criminal use of certain firearms, improving recording of recovered firearms in crime guns, and conducting in-depth research on gun assaults. An updated impact study was completed in July 2004 for NIJ, addressing the lack of definitive data on \"assault weapons\" and civilian gun stock. The 1994 ban aimed to reduce the number of legally available assault weapons, estimated at 1.5 million in the US. SAWs constituted less than 1% of the civilian gun stock, with 231 million firearms in total in 1994. About 25 million firearms could accept large capacity ammunition feeders, making up roughly 11% of the civilian gun stock. Opponents argue that assault weapons are rarely used in crime, while proponents counter that they are disproportionately used in crimes involving multiple victims and police officers. Supporters of the ban cite ATF firearm trace data to extend or make the ban permanent, but there are limitations in the data collection process. The ATF National Tracing Center (NTC) supports law enforcement agencies by tracing firearms recovered from crimes. Different views exist on interpreting SAW-related firearm trace data, with opponents highlighting its limitations. The NTC is operational to aid investigations, not for comprehensive data collection. The ATF National Tracing Center supports law enforcement investigations by tracing firearms recovered from crimes, focusing on aiding ongoing investigations rather than collecting comprehensive crime gun statistics. Crime gun tracing is part of a strategy to combat illegal firearms trafficking, with variations in tracing practices due to factors like missing identifying information on firearms. The ATF National Tracing Center supports law enforcement investigations by tracing firearms recovered from crimes, focusing on aiding ongoing investigations rather than collecting comprehensive crime gun statistics. Crime gun tracing may be biased due to missing identifying information, leading to potential under-representation of older firearms and over-representation of firearms of interest to law enforcement. This bias makes it difficult to draw clear statistical conclusions about the effectiveness of the SAW ban based on firearm trace data. The ATF National Tracing Center supports law enforcement investigations by tracing firearms recovered from crimes, focusing on aiding ongoing investigations rather than collecting comprehensive crime gun statistics. Crime gun tracing may be biased due to missing identifying information, making it difficult to draw clear statistical conclusions about the effectiveness of the SAW ban based on firearm trace data. Senators Feinstein and Schumer called for a renewal of the ban based on declining shares of firearm traces due to SAWs, but the data may not be statistically valid for national inferences. The ATF National Tracing Center traced firearms recovered from crimes, with total firearm traces nearly tripling over the years. Traced assault weapons were identified by make and model, but not when they were manufactured or imported. SAW traces may involve illegally manufactured firearms. The NTC does not include fields to identify SAW characteristics. The Brady Center and Violence Policy Center released studies on total firearms. The Brady Center and Violence Policy Center released separate studies on total firearm and SAW traces for FY1990-2001. The Brady Center found a decrease in SAW percentage of total firearm traces, indicating the ban had made these firearms less available for criminal use. The VPC noted a corresponding decrease in SAW percentage of total firearm traces since the ban's enactment, suggesting a reduction in the use of assault weapons in crime. The Brady Center and Violence Policy Center released studies on firearm traces from FY1990-2001. The VPC found a decrease in SAW percentage of total traces, indicating reduced availability for criminal use. The Brady Center reported a 66.7% decrease in SAW share of traced firearms from FY1990-1994 to FY1995-2001. Different interpretations may arise based on data presentation.

The Brady Center reported a 66.7% decrease in SAW share of traced firearms from FY1990-1994 to FY1995-2001. Different interpretations may arise based on data presentation, with questions about the actual decrease in SAW traces after the ban. The VPC argues that trace data may not accurately reflect a decrease in SAW-related crime due to the \"time-to-crime\" phenomenon, which shows that the likelihood of a firearm being traced diminishes over time. Analysis of ATF trace data for CY2000 revealed that a significant portion of traced firearms were traced within a few years of retail purchase. Therefore, the VPC contends that the annual number of SAW traces would have decreased over the decade if the SAW ban had effectively reduced the population of legally available SAWs. Since the ban on assault weapons went into effect, firearm manufacturers have modified designs to comply with or evade the ban. Post-ban modified firearms, known as \"copycats,\" are similar to SAWs and are often referred to as \"ccs.\" Organizations like the VPC and Brady Center advocate for greater regulation of these firearms. Traces of certain CC firearms, such as AB-10 Pistols, Bushmaster Rifles, and DPMS Rifles, were included in reports by the Brady Center and VPC. The Brady Center study included traced CC firearms like AB-10 Pistols, Bushmaster Rifles, and DPMS Rifles. The number of traced CC firearms increased from 96 in FY1990 to about 3,400 in FY2001. The annual average number of SAW and CC traces increased by 63.67% after the ban. SAWs and CCS combined accounted for 5.72% of traced firearms from FY1990-FY1994, decreasing to 3.11% from FY1995-FY2001, reflecting a 45.63% decrease in the SAW/CC share of total firearm traces. The Brady Center study found a 45.63% decrease in SAW/CC share of total firearm traces before and after the ban, indicating criminals substituted CCS for SAWs. Other \"military-style\" firearms like SKS, M-1 Carbine, Roger Mini-14, and Hi-Point Carbine were also advocated for banning. Traced firearms for selected other firearms increased from nearly 1,800 to over 3,400 from FY1995-1999, then decreased to about 3,200 in FY2000. Total firearm traces increased by 162% from FY1995-FY2000. The Brady Center study showed a decrease in SAW/CC share of total firearm traces, indicating criminals substituted CCS for SAWs. Traced firearms for selected other firearms increased from nearly 1,800 to over 3,400 from FY1995-1999, then decreased to about 3,200 in FY2000. Total firearm traces increased by 162% from FY1995-FY2000. The 2004 impact study for the NIJ aimed to reduce gunshot victimizations by limiting semiautomatic firearms with large ammunition capacities. The study reported that SAWs accounted for 2-8% of firearms recovered by police and no more than 13% of crime guns used in rare incidents of police murders and mass shootings. The study on semiautomatic firearms with large ammunition capacities found that SAWs accounted for a small percentage of crime guns due to factors like difficulty in concealment, importation bans, and higher cost compared to other firearms. Data limitations prevented statistical testing for relationships between firearm traces and SAWs. The study found a decline in the use of semiautomatic assault weapons (SAWs) in crime since the ban's enactment, with SAWs accounting for 5.4% of ATF firearm traces in 1992-1993 compared to 1.6% in 2001-2002, a 70% decrease. By adopting the Brady Center's methodology, a 60% decrease in the SAW share of total firearms traced was calculated. Researchers examined databases of guns recovered by police in six localities to track changes in the types of guns used in violent crime. The study found a decline in the use of semiautomatic assault weapons (SAWs) in crime since the ban's enactment, with reductions in SAW recoveries ranging from 17% to 72% in two cities. ATF firearms trace data showed that SAWs typically fell by one-third or more as a share of firearms used in crime from the late 1990s through 2002. Despite limitations in the data, LCAFDs were used in between 14% and 26% of crimes in several locations. The study noted that the 1994 ban on semiautomatic firearms equipped with LCAFDs had limited impact on reducing firearms-related violent crime, as criminal use of these firearms partially offset any potential benefits. Despite restrictions on the availability of LCAFDs, millions were still in circulation in the US. While these firearms accounted for a significant portion of gun crimes, it was unclear how often their high capacity led to shootings resulting in death or injury. The study concluded that it was premature to draw definitive conclusions. The study found that the 1994 ban on semiautomatic firearms with LCAFDs had limited impact on reducing gun crime. It was difficult to measure any decrease in crime due to the ban, as there was an increase in the use of non-banned firearms with LCAFDs. The researchers could not attribute the drop in gun violence solely to the ban and recommended further studies to gather better data on these firearms. The study found that the 1994 ban on semiautomatic firearms with LCAFDs had limited impact on reducing gun crime. Firearm trace data may not be a good indicator of firearms-related violent crime trends, as the slightly increasing rate of violent crime traces does not correspond to the decreases in violent crime that have occurred in the past decade. The violent crime rate decreased by 41% from 1993 to 1999, leveled out in 2000 and 2001, and slightly increased in 2002. Trends in firearm-related robberies and aggravated assaults mirrored these patterns. However, firearm tracing trends for total firearms and SAWs diverged from actual violent crime trends, suggesting that firearm traces may not accurately reflect criminal use of firearms. Additionally, the FBI reported that 708 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed from 1993 to 2002. From CY1993 through CY2002, 708 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed, including 72 in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Firearms were used in 591 of these killings, with handguns being the most common weapon. The VPC conducted research on firearms-related officer killings from CY1998 through CY2001, indicating that at least 41 officers were slain during that period. At least 41 law enforcement officers were killed with assault weapons between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001. However, 20 of these firearms may not meet the statutory SAW definition, lowering the number to 20 out of 211 officers killed with possible SAWs. Between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001, 41 law enforcement officers were killed with possible assault weapons, with 20 of these firearms not meeting the statutory SAW definition. FBI incident summaries suggest that in only a few cases did criminals fire more than 10 rounds of ammunition, the limit imposed by the ban on magazines. The reliability of this data has been questioned, with bills introduced in Congress to extend or make permanent the ban on SAWs and large capacity ammunition feeders. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to modify the definition of \"semiautomatic assault weapon\" and expand the list of banned firearms. Senator Feinstein has introduced bills to make the ban permanent or extend it for 10 years. The expiration of the ban on assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeders remains controversial. The SAW-LCAFD ban is controversial, with Congress considering whether it reduces violent gun crimes. There is a lack of definitive data on SAWs and LCAFDs, but steps can be taken to improve data collection. The FBI could modify data collection for firearm-related homicides, particularly for incidents with multiple shots and victims. The ATF's firearm tracing system could be revamped to improve data quality, including conducting controlled firearm trace surveys in certain areas. Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative surveys have provided useful data for local law enforcement in reducing firearms-related violence. Improved incident-based reporting and firearm trace data could offer valuable insights into the criminal use of military-style firearms and other crime guns. Congress must weigh the lethality and societal dangers of these firearms against the constitutional right to bear arms."
