    "content": "The study investigates how a recurrent neural network (RNN) learns to recognize a regular formal language by training it on positive and negative examples. A decoding function maps RNN states to an abstraction of states from a minimal deterministic finite automaton (MDFA). This abstraction simplifies the interpretation of the RNN's internal representations, revealing a strong structural relationship between RNNs and finite automata. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are highly effective at recognizing grammatical structure in sequences, such as generating source code with few errors. This paper aims to explain how RNNs recognize formal languages by comparing them to finite automata and regular languages. The study investigates how RNNs represent grammatical structure by training them on positive and negative examples and mapping RNN states to states from a minimal deterministic finite automaton (MDFA). In this study, RNNs are trained to recognize formal languages by comparing them to finite automata. The focus is on mapping RNN hidden states to states of a minimal deterministic finite automaton (MDFA) for regular languages. The experiments cover 500 regular languages to investigate this mapping process. The experiments involving RNNs trained to recognize formal languages suggest the existence of a decoding function that can be understood through the concept of abstraction. Abstraction involves clustering states of a machine into \"superstates\", leading to a loss of discerning power but recognition of a superset of the original language. This behavior is commonly observed in RNNs trained to recognize regular languages. The RNN trained to recognize a regular language exhibits abstraction behavior by clustering states into an abstraction of the MDFA. A t-SNE embedding of RNN states shows two states abstracted into one, with a linear decoding function achieving maximal accuracy. The abstraction has low \"coarseness\" and simple interpretations. RNNs excel at recognizing patterns in text. Recent work has explored the expressive power of RNNs, showing their ability to simulate universal Turing machines and represent dynamical systems. Second order RNNs with linear activation functions are equivalent to weighted finite automata. While some research focuses on having RNNs learn DFA structures, most work extracts DFAs from hidden RNN states. Recent studies have successfully extracted grammar rules and DFA structures from RNNs using various clustering and spectral algorithm techniques. A recent approach achieved high accuracy in DFA extraction by utilizing the L* query learning algorithm. This work differs from previous efforts by directly relating RNNs to ground-truth minimal DFAs instead of extracting machines from the RNN's state space. Our work differs from previous efforts by not requiring exact behavioral correspondence between RNNs and DFAs. We allow abstracted DFA states, leading to loss of information but enabling connections between RNNs and DFAs for a broad class of regular languages. The mapping from RNN states to FA states can be approximate, evaluated quantitatively, and can handle larger automata than previous studies. A Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) is defined by a tuple with states, alphabet, transition function, starting state, and accepting states. It reads strings symbol by symbol and accepts a string if it reaches an accepting state. The minimal DFA (MDFA) for a regular language is unique and denoted as A0L. This work allows connections between RNNs and DFAs for regular languages without requiring exact behavioral correspondence. A Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) is similar to a DFA but with a non-deterministic transition relation. For a regular language L, an abstraction map \u03b1 is used to create coarse-grained versions of the original MDFA. The coarsest NFA has only one accepting state. The coarsest NFA, denoted by A DISPLAYFORM2, has one accepting node and accepts all strings on the alphabet \u03a3. A RNN is trained to recognize a regular language L with a certain accuracy threshold, with hidden states denoted by H. The RNN can be viewed as a transition system with continuous state space, topology, and metric, distinguished from a DFA. Decoding DFA states from RNNs involves a decoding function f: H \u2192 Q 0. Decoding functions in neuroscience involve mapping hidden states of a RNN to corresponding states. Decoding accuracy is quantified using metrics, with an abstraction decoding function defined as a composition of functions. Decoding accuracy is evaluated based on input strings, with a focus on decoding abstraction states. Decoding abstraction states involves checking if RNN states are mapped to NFA states accurately by the decoding function. The accuracy measure considers how well transitions are preserved by the function. This differs from the original MDFA transitions, focusing on the states at (t + 1) rather than the underlying transitions in the MDFA. The transitional accuracy of a mapf for a given RNN and abstraction with respect to a data-set D is defined. Decoding functions with high accuracy exist for abstractions with low coarseness. Language recognition models are trained on input strings to determine if they belong to a language. Categorical and continuous states are generated by the abstraction and RNN, respectively. For experiments, 500 unique recognizers are sampled, leading to analysis of 500 MDFAs and 500 RNNs. Decoding accuracy is tested using various functions, including linear and non-linear classifiers. An F-test reveals no significant variation in accuracy among the decoders. The study compared linear and nonlinear decoders in decoding accuracy for MDFA states. Results showed no statistical difference among sampled languages, with nonlinear decoders not improving accuracy as MDFA complexity increased. Linear decoders were found to be sufficient for the task. The study compared linear and nonlinear decoders for decoding MDFA states, finding linear decoders sufficient. A hypothesis suggests the RNN reflects a coarse-grained abstraction of the state space rather than MDFA states themselves. A greedy algorithm is proposed to find an abstraction mapping for the hidden state space of the RNN. The algorithm implicitly considers state transitions while learning the decoder. Decreasing states increases DISPLAYFORM0. A comparison to a random baseline validates the method. Normalized AUC shows improved abstraction accuracy. The greedy algorithm aims for optimal partitioning, but exhaustive search is impractical. The greedy method proposed for clustering has O(M^2) complexity and yields stable results. Different hidden units in Recognizer RNNs produce consistent clustering sequences. Evaluation of abstraction decoder accuracy and coarseness relationship is shown in FIG6. Increasing M leads to decreased decoding accuracy on the MDFA. The decoding accuracy decreases as M increases on the MDFA due to the difficulty of the decoding problem and the abstraction of multiple states into a single state. A non-linear decoder shows no instances of 0% training error. Transitional accuracy is presented as a function of coarseness, showcasing that a low coarseness NFA can be decoded with high accuracy. The average ratio of abstractions relative to M needed for 90% accuracy is low, indicating low coarseness compared to a random baseline. Decoder and transition accuracy for a nonlinear decoder are also presented. The fundamental work presented in the current chunk involves a large-scale analysis of how RNNs relate to abstracted NFAs for hundreds of minimal DFAs. The transition accuracy between R and abstracted NFAs is evaluated to validate the claim of high accuracy decoders. The interpretation of the RNN hidden state space with respect to the minimal DFA is discussed, revealing a unique organization of H with respect to A. The appropriate level of abstraction used by the network for logical language recognition is determined. The current chunk discusses the level of abstraction used by the network for logical language recognition, illustrated with examples of 'real-world' DFAs. It shows clustering sequences of regular expressions for SIMPLE EMAILS and DATES languages. The dendrogram in FIG9 displays the membership of MDFA states and abstractions up to n = M \u2212 1. The question of how to choose the correct level of abstraction is raised, with corresponding accuracies shown in FIG10 as n increases and the number of NFA states decreases. The current chunk discusses the importance of choosing the right level of abstraction in the final partition for linear decoding prediction tasks. It highlights the impact of abstractions on decoder accuracy, specifically focusing on the pattern matching task in the SIMPLE EMAILS DFA. The network's learned abstraction of the pattern [a-d]* is noted as a reason for non-linear separability in hidden states. The RNN uses a hidden state space to recognize patterns, abstracting them from the DFA. The dendrogram shows merged states representing the same input location. Patterns in SIMPLE EMAILS are location-independent, while DATES regex shows location-dependent patterns. States close in sequential proximity tend to agglomerate, indicating location dependence. Our new interpretation of H reveals insights backed by decoding and transitional accuracy scores on how RNN structures hidden state space in language recognition tasks. Patterns are found in almost all tested DFA's, with variability shown in additional random DFA's. Linear decoding performs well in representing knowledge in hidden states, but a ground truth is not always achieved. The linear function decodes RNN states to abstractions of MDFA states, revealing a structural relationship between RNN representations and finite automata. This work aims to study how neural networks learn formal logical concepts and explore more complex formal languages. The Xeger Java library is used to generate strings accepted and rejected by DFAs corresponding to regex R. The Xeger Java library generates strings accepted by regular expressions' corresponding DFAs. However, there is no standard method to generate diverse rejected examples for training acceptor/rejector models. Rejected strings should be drawn from two distinct distributions to effectively train the model. To generate diverse rejected examples for training acceptor/rejector models, negative examples are created by randomly swapping characters in accepted strings or shuffling characters to create rejected strings. 1000 training examples with a 50:50 accept/reject ratio are generated, with strings of varying lengths capped at a constant, such as 20 characters for the SIMPLE EMAILS language."
