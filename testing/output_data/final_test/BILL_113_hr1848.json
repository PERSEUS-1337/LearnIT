    "content": "The \"Small Airplane Revitalization Act of 2013\" emphasizes the importance of a healthy small aircraft industry for economic growth and transportation infrastructure. Small airplanes make up a significant portion of general aviation aircraft, supporting jobs in engineering, manufacturing, maintenance, and piloting. General aviation also contributes to well-paying jobs in manufacturing and technology sectors, with products being exported globally. The small aircraft industry is vital for economic growth and transportation infrastructure, supporting jobs in engineering, manufacturing, maintenance, and piloting. General aviation safety can be enhanced by updating regulations for small airplanes to encourage innovation and investment in new designs. The aging fleet and lack of cost-effective options have led to a decline in private pilots, highlighting the need for regulatory improvements in the industry. The Federal Aviation Administration will issue a final rule by December 15, 2015, to reorganize certification requirements for small airplanes under part 23, aiming to streamline safety advancements. This rule aligns with objectives from the Part 23 Reorganization Aviation Rulemaking Committee to enhance safety, reduce regulatory costs, and establish outcome-driven safety measures for small airplanes. The Federal Aviation Administration will implement outcome-driven safety objectives for small airplanes by reorganizing certification requirements under part 23. This includes replacing prescriptive regulations with performance-based rules and utilizing consensus standards to clarify safety objectives. The Administrator will also collaborate with industry leaders to enhance general aviation safety. The Federal Aviation Administration aims to improve general aviation safety by collaborating with regulators to adopt complementary regulatory approaches for small airplanes. Consensus standards are defined as standards developed by organizations that require owners of intellectual property to make it available on a nondiscriminatory basis. The Part 23 Reorganization Aviation Rulemaking Committee was established by the Federal Aviation Administration in August 2011 to consider reorganizing regulations under part 23 for small airplanes certified to part 23 standards. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
