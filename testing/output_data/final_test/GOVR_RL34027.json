    "content": "Honduras, a Central American nation with 9.1 million people, faces challenges like fragile democratic institutions, high poverty rates, and violent crime. These issues have led to instability, displacement, and emigration. Despite some efforts by the government, analysts believe Honduras lacks the necessary resources to address these problems. U.S. policymakers have increased focus on Honduras and its neighbors since 2014 due to a surge in migrants and asylum-seekers. The Obama Administration determined it was in the national security interests of the United States to work with Central American governments to improve security, governance, and economic prosperity. The Trump Administration initially maintained the Central America strategy but sought to reduce foreign assistance to Honduras and its neighbors. Despite declining assistance since FY2016, Congress has rejected many proposed cuts and appropriated over $2.6 billion for Central America in the past four years, including at least $431 million for Honduras. In March 2019, the Trump Administration announced its intention to end U.S. foreign assistance to Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala due to migration issues. The 116th Congress could influence U.S. policy in the region as it considers FY2020 appropriations and other legislative initiatives. Honduras has a history of political instability and military influence. The current constitution establishes a representative democracy with separate branches of government. Key issues in U.S.-Honduran relations include foreign assistance, migration, security cooperation, human rights, and trade. Honduras's legislative process is executive-driven, with a judiciary prone to intimidation and corruption. The traditional two-party system, Liberal (PL) and National (PN) Parties, has fractured. Both parties are center-right and supported a 2009 coup against President Manuel Zelaya, who governed in a populist manner. After a 2009 coup in Honduras, many PL members joined Zelaya's new LIBRE party. The PN, now the largest political base, has controlled the presidency and congress since 2010. The party has been criticized for eroding checks and balances to consolidate power, such as replacing supreme court justices in 2012. The PN in Honduras has been criticized for eroding checks and balances to consolidate power, including manipulating appointments to nominally independent institutions. President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who was reelected in 2015 despite the constitution's ban on presidential reelection, lacks legitimacy among many Hondurans. Honduras is classified as \"partly free\" by Freedom House and an \"electoral autocracy\" by the Varieties of Democracy Project. The 2017 Honduran election, won by President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, was marred by irregularities and allegations of fraud. International observers questioned the results, leading to protests and violence in which at least 23 people were killed. The United Nations attempted to mediate a national dialogue in response. In response to the 2017 election irregularities in Honduras, the United Nations facilitated a national dialogue to promote reconciliation. Despite reaching consensus on various issues, formal political agreements were not reached. However, in January 2019, the Honduran congress approved constitutional changes to reform the electoral process, including restructuring the national registry office and creating new electoral institutions. Analysts have suggested depoliticizing electoral institutions in Honduras. Honduras is urged to depoliticize its electoral institutions by restructuring agencies with three primary officials each, allowing political parties to divide positions. President Hern\u00e1ndez has maintained business-friendly economic policies and a tough security approach. Despite his party's control of congress, 86% of Hondurans feel the country is heading in the wrong direction, with unemployment being the top concern. Hondurans protest against corruption, poor healthcare, insecurity, drugs, and high cost of living under the Hern\u00e1ndez Administration. The country has made progress in combating corruption since 2016 with the support of an international anti-corruption organization. Civil society has demanded accountability after millions were embezzled from the social security institute during the previous administration. Funds were used to support Hern\u00e1ndez's 2013 election campaign. Facing pressure, he negotiated a limited arrangement with the OAS to establish the MACCIH in Honduras to prevent and punish corruption. The MACCIH focused on strengthening anti-corruption laws, but faced delays and weakening of proposed reforms by the Honduran congress. The Honduran congress weakened MACCIH's proposed anti-corruption reforms, including limiting the jurisdiction of new anti-corruption courts and stalling plea-bargaining laws. These actions hindered the mission's efforts to combat corruption in Honduras. MACCIH officials in Brazil are collaborating with Honduras's Special Prosecution Unit to Fight Corruption-related Impunity (UFECIC) to investigate and prosecute high-level corruption cases. They have presented 12 cases involving corruption networks misusing funds and awarding contracts to traffickers. Over 120 people, including cabinet ministers and legislators, are facing prosecution. However, progress has been slow in the Honduran justice system, with the first trial starting in March 2019. Political and economic elites have tried to obstruct MACCIH's efforts. The Honduran congress has obstructed MACCIH's efforts by passing laws to block investigations into corruption. A new criminal code may reduce penalties for corruption offenses. Some judges presiding over MACCIH cases have been questioned for impartiality. More than 61% of Hondurans want MACCIH to remain in the country. In 2020, over 61% of Hondurans support the MACCIH staying in the country, despite the Hern\u00e1ndez Administration showing little interest in renewing the agreement. The U.S. government has provided crucial support for the MACCIH, but analysts believe Honduran prosecutors would struggle without international assistance. The Honduran economy, historically reliant on agricultural commodities, has diversified since the late 1980s. The Honduran economy has diversified since the late 1980s, with policy changes leading to growth in the maquila sector and nontraditional agricultural exports. President Hern\u00e1ndez prioritized putting government finances on a sustainable path in 2014 due to a growing deficit. In 2014, Hern\u00e1ndez negotiated a three-year agreement with the IMF to reduce the deficit to 2% of GDP by 2017 and implement structural reforms in various sectors. The deficit was reduced to less than 1% of GDP in 2017, and a new economic program was agreed upon in 2019, providing $311 million in financing. Hern\u00e1ndez also aimed to attract foreign investment through the \"Honduras 20/20\" plan. The Honduran government's \"Honduras 20/20\" plan aims to attract $13 billion in investment and create 600,000 jobs in key sectors. They have implemented business-friendly policies, increased infrastructure investments, and formed a customs union with Guatemala and El Salvador. Additionally, they are pushing forward with the creation of \"Employment and Economic Development Zones\" for foreign investors. Despite these efforts, foreign direct investment inflows have decreased, and the economy has grown at an average of 3.9% annually over the past five years. Honduras's economy has grown by 3.9% annually over the past five years but struggles to create enough jobs for its growing labor force. In 2017, only 8,500 formal sector jobs were created despite a 110,000 increase in the labor force. The majority of new workers end up in the informal sector without job security or benefits. With a large young population, job creation is crucial to avoid missing out on economic growth opportunities. Unemployment and underemployment rates are high, with many working full time for less than minimum wage. Economic growth has not significantly reduced poverty in Honduras. The Hern\u00e1ndez Administration's fiscal austerity policies have worsened Honduras's high poverty rate, with over 67% living below the national poverty line. Rural areas face extreme poverty, exacerbated by coffee fungus outbreaks and droughts. Households resort to extreme measures like debt and migration. Economic performance is expected to follow the U.S. business cycle. Honduras's economic performance is tied to the U.S. business cycle due to its reliance on the U.S. as a top export market and source of investment, tourism, and remittances. To improve long-term growth, the country needs to address issues like education, infrastructure, crime, corruption, and poverty. High levels of crime and violence in Honduras are fueled by factors such as poverty, fragmented families, lack of education, and youth susceptibility to gang recruitment. Gangs like MS-13 and Barrio 18 engage in criminal activities like drug dealing and extortion, contributing to a significant portion of homicides and overall crime in the country. Honduras is a significant drug-trafficking corridor due to its location between cocaine-producing countries in South America and the United States. Transnational criminal organizations battle for control of Honduran territory, with ties to political and economic elites involved in illicit finances. In November 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Antonio \"Tony\" Hern\u00e1ndez, a former member of congress and President Hern\u00e1ndez's brother, for large-scale drug trafficking. President Hern\u00e1ndez campaigned on a hard-line security platform, pledging to reduce crime and violence in Honduras. He ordered security forces into high-crime neighborhoods and established the military police force (PMOP) to combat criminal threats. Honduras has historically struggled with corruption and lack of resources in its security forces. The PMOP, under the ministry of defense, and the military-trained police unit \"Tigers\" have been involved in human rights abuses, including killings after the 2017 election. Calls have been made to withdraw the military from domestic law enforcement. President Hern\u00e1ndez has taken steps to strengthen security and justice institutions, including creating a police reform commission in response to reports of police corruption. In 2013, the head of the anti-money-laundering unit of the public prosecutor's office in Honduras was involved in covering up internal investigations. A special commission dismissed over 5,600 police personnel, proposed restructuring measures, and increased salaries. Despite improvements in investigative and prosecutorial capacity, impunity remains widespread. Public confidence in the national police force remains low, with less than 34% of Hondurans expressing trust in 2018. The police and public prosecutor's office in Honduras have established new investigative divisions and forensic laboratories, leading to improvements in security conditions over the past five years. The budget of the public prosecutor's office increased significantly, allowing for the hiring of additional personnel. Despite these efforts, the public prosecutor's office remains overburdened, accounting for less than 1.5% of the government's expenditures in 2018. The homicide rate has decreased from 86.5 murders per 100,000 residents in 2011 to 41.3 murders per 100,000 residents in 2018. In 2018, crime rates in Honduras decreased, with 12.8% of Hondurans reporting being victims of crime. However, there is still a sense of insecurity, as 52% feel their cities are unsafe and 88% consider the country unsafe. The United States has had a historically close relationship with Honduras, especially in the 1980s when it played a key role in U.S. policy in Central America. The U.S. has had a close relationship with Honduras since the 1980s. Joint Task Force Bravo has been stationed in Honduras since 1983. Economic ties deepened with the Caribbean Basin Initiative and CAFTA-DR. Relations were strained during the 2009 political crisis, with the Obama Administration imposing sanctions to pressure for the restoration of Zelaya to power. The Obama Administration imposed sanctions on Honduras in 2009, shifting focus to ensuring the legitimacy of scheduled elections. Current U.S. policy in Honduras aims to strengthen democratic governance, promote human rights, enhance economic prosperity, and improve security to address challenges like irregular migration and organized crime. The United States provides substantial foreign assistance to Honduras to address challenges like irregular migration and organized crime. Bilateral cooperation could be affected if the U.S. ends assistance programs in the region. Assistance levels have varied over the years, with a peak in the 1980s and early 1990s due to Honduras' role in U.S. operations in Central America. The United States provides significant foreign assistance to Honduras to address issues like irregular migration and organized crime. Assistance levels have fluctuated over the years, with peaks in the 1980s and early 1990s. Current assistance is guided by the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, aiming to promote economic prosperity, strengthen governance, and improve security in the region. The Obama Administration increased assistance following a surge in migration from Central America in 2014, with over $2.6 billion appropriated for the strategy since FY2016, including at least $431 million allocated to Honduras. U.S. assistance to Honduras, funded through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), supports various development activities including good governance, agriculture, education, and economic reform programs. Bilateral aid also includes training and equipment for the Honduran military, while CARSI assistance focuses on law enforcement, justice-sector reform, and crime prevention. In 2019, Congress appropriated $527.6 million for implementing the U.S. Strategy in Honduras. In 2019, Congress appropriated $527.6 million for implementing the U.S. Strategy in Honduras, with specific allocations for various development activities and assistance to the Honduran government, including support for the MACCIH and attorneys general offices in the region. The act places strict conditions on assistance to Honduras, requiring 50% of funds for the central government to be withheld until certain criteria are met. The future of U.S. foreign aid programs in Honduras is uncertain, with conditions such as improving border security, combating corruption, and supporting economic growth. The Trump Administration announced its intention to end all foreign assistance to Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala due to migration issues. The Trump Administration's decision to end all foreign assistance to Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala affects U.S. assistance appropriated for Honduras in FY2018. The Honduran government expressed irritation with the U.S. government's \"contradictory policies\" following the announcement. The President has discretion to cut some foreign assistance to the Northern Triangle. The Trump Administration's decision to end foreign assistance to the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala could lead to cuts in assistance for their central governments until certain conditions are met. The Secretary of State has the authority to withhold funds and reprogram them elsewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean if progress is deemed insufficient. The 116th Congress is considering authorization and appropriations measures in response. The 116th Congress is considering measures to increase oversight over foreign assistance programs and provide additional aid to Honduras and its Central American neighbors. The United States-Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act, H.R. 2615, would authorize $577 million for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America in FY2020, with a focus on the Northern Triangle. The bill includes various programs in the region, reporting requirements, and restrictions on fund reprogramming. The Central America Reform and Enforcement Act, S. 1445, would authorize $1.5 million for the Central America strategy in FY2020 and prohibit fund reprogramming. The Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2020, H.R. 2839 (Lowey), would appropriate $540.9 million for the Central America strategy in FY2020, including at least $75 million for Honduras. The bill would also modify previous appropriations legislation to strengthen funding directives for aid to Central America. Migration from Honduras to the United States is driven by poverty, unemployment, and the poor security situation in Honduras. Migration from Honduras to the United States is driven by poverty, unemployment, and the poor security situation in Honduras. More than 40% of Hondurans have a family member who has emigrated in the past year, potentially leading to additional migration in the future. The number of Honduran migrants and asylum-seekers arriving at the U.S. border has significantly increased in recent years, with a notable rise in apprehensions. The demographics of those attempting to reach the United States have also shifted, with more unaccompanied children and families making the journey. The United States has seen a significant increase in unaccompanied children and families seeking humanitarian protection at the border in the past five and a half years. Both the U.S. and Honduran governments have tried to deter migration through public-awareness campaigns and policy changes. The Trump Administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy led to over 1,000 Honduran children being separated from their parents, but the effectiveness of these deterrence efforts has been questioned. The U.S. and Honduran governments are collaborating to combat human smuggling, with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security working with Honduran police to investigate trafficking and smuggling. Initiatives are also in place to address the root causes of emigration. President Hern\u00e1ndez is involved in these efforts. President Hern\u00e1ndez, along with counterparts in El Salvador and Guatemala, established the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle to address root causes of emigration by fostering economic growth, improving security conditions, and strengthening government institutions. The Honduran government has allocated nearly $2.9 billion towards these objectives over the past three years. The U.S. government has been supporting similar efforts through the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, but the future of this initiative is uncertain. Economic development may initially increase outward migration by removing financial barriers. Economic development may increase outward migration initially by removing financial barriers faced by households in poverty. Assistance programs that provide support or skills training without ensuring local opportunities may intensify migration flows. Violence prevention programs could have a more immediate impact on migration trends by mitigating forced displacement. Honduras is a significant recipient of deportees from the United States and Mexico, raising concerns about the country's ability to absorb the large volume. Honduran policymakers are worried about the country's capacity to handle deportees due to challenges in finding employment and potential increase in crime. The US has provided financial aid to improve reception centers for repatriated migrants. Honduras heavily relies on remittances, with nearly $4.8 billion received in 2018, equivalent to 19.8% of GDP. A decrease in remittances could significantly impact the country's socioeconomic conditions. The Honduran Central Bank states that remittance levels are more tied to the U.S. economy than deportations. Nearly 81,000 Hondurans benefit from temporary protected status (TPS), which was first granted after Hurricane Mitch in 1998. The Trump Administration terminated TPS for Honduras in May 2018, giving beneficiaries until January 5, 2020 to seek alternative immigration status or leave the U.S. The Trump Administration terminated Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Honduras in May 2018, giving beneficiaries until January 5, 2020 to seek alternative immigration status or leave the U.S. The termination decision is currently on hold due to a court order. Some analysts argue that the Secretary's decision ignored ongoing challenges in Honduras and could undermine efforts to address irregular migration. TPS beneficiaries sent an estimated $176 million in cash remittances to Honduras in 2017, equivalent to U.S. foreign aid to the country. The United States and Honduras have cooperated closely on security issues for many years, focusing on citizen safety and drug trafficking. Honduras faces significant security challenges, with citizens contending with criminal threats daily. The U.S. government has sought to assist in foreign aid, and some Members of Congress may consider measures to provide a path toward permanent resident status for TPS holders. The U.S. government has used funds appropriated through CARSI to assist Honduras in addressing security challenges, implementing crime- and violence-prevention programs through USAID. These programs include primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention initiatives, leading to significant reductions in robberies, murders, and extortion attempts in Honduran communities. The U.S. government, through CARSI funds, supports crime- and violence-prevention programs in Honduras. Efforts include establishing model police precincts, purging corrupt officers, and leading a Transnational Anti-Gang Unit to combat criminal gang activity. USAID and INL collaborate on prevention and law enforcement initiatives. The U.S. government, through CARSI funds, supports crime- and violence-prevention programs in Honduras, including establishing model police precincts and leading a Transnational Anti-Gang Unit. USAID and INL have integrated prevention and law enforcement interventions in dangerous communities in Honduras to combat illicit narcotics trafficking. Honduras serves as a key transshipment point for cocaine between South America and the United States, with the Caribbean coastal region being a primary landing point for traffickers. The U.S. government aims to strengthen counternarcotics cooperation with Honduras to reduce illicit drug flows through the country. The U.S. government provides assistance to Honduras through CARSI funds for crime prevention and law enforcement programs. This includes support for specially vetted units and task forces to combat transnational criminal organizations, as well as counternarcotics assistance from the Department of Defense. Specialized training and equipment are provided to extend the reach of Honduran security forces and improve control over national territories. The U.S. government provides counternarcotics assistance to Honduras through specially trained units like the TIGRES unit of the Honduran national police. This assistance has led to the apprehension of high-level drug traffickers, with many extradited to the United States. DOD assistance to Honduras for ground and maritime interdiction efforts totaled nearly $12 million in FY2016 and $12.4 million in FY2017, with planned assistance of $5.7 million in FY2018. The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act freezes assets and prohibits transactions with designated individuals. U.S. and Honduran counternarcotics efforts have not significantly impacted drug trafficking in Honduras. Organized crime may have infiltrated government institutions, as seen in the case of Fabio Lobo, son of a former president, sentenced for cocaine conspiracy. Fabio Lobo linked Honduran drug traffickers to corrupt politicians and security forces for protection and contracts in exchange for bribes. DOJ charged Honduran congress members, including President Hern\u00e1ndez's brother, with similar offenses. Questions raised about U.S. counternarcotics efforts and human rights abuses. Operation Anvil, a DEA-led program in Honduras, resulted in deadly interdiction missions. The State Department and DOJ Offices of Inspectors General released a report on deadly force incidents involving a river taxi in Honduras, where four people were killed and four others injured. The report found that the DEA had not adequately planned for the operation, provided inaccurate information to DOJ leadership and Congress, and Honduran officers filed inaccurate reports and planted a gun at a crime scene. Human rights organizations have alleged various abuses by Honduran security forces, including in the high-profile case of Berta C\u00e1ceres. Berta C\u00e1ceres, an indigenous and environmental activist, was killed in 2016 for opposing a hydroelectric project. Seven men were convicted for her murder, but those who ordered and financed it remain at large. Similar attacks have targeted journalists and human rights defenders in Honduras, with unclear involvement of security forces. The Honduran government often attributes attacks on journalists, human rights defenders, and activists to generalized violence, downplaying the connection to their work. Despite a decrease in homicides, attacks persist. From 2014 to 2018, 33 journalists were killed, and during the 2017 elections, 62 political killings were documented. Human rights advocates criticize the government's practice of criminalizing dissent. Human rights advocates criticize the Honduran government for criminalizing journalists and rights defenders' activities. President Hern\u00e1ndez and his administration dismiss protests and justify repressive actions by labeling political opposition and social movements as criminals. The government uses criminal charges as a deterrent against investigating abuses. U.S. policy in Honduras aims to promote human rights but may prioritize bilateral security cooperation. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America includes objectives to uphold democratic values and human rights in Central American governments. The Trump Administration has refrained from publicly criticizing the Honduran government over human rights abuses and instead supports efforts to improve the situation through a bilateral human rights working group. The group focuses on strengthening human rights institutions, cooperation with international partners and civil society, citizen security, combating corruption and impunity, and addressing migration issues. The U.S. government has allocated foreign assistance to promote human rights in Honduras, including about $9 million in FY2017. USAID is working with Honduran government institutions and human rights organizations on implementing a 2015 law that created a protection mechanism for journalists, human rights defenders, and justice sector officials. As of November 2018, the protection mechanism was implementing protective measures for various individuals, including self-protection trainings, psychosocial support, and police escorts. The U.S. government supports human rights in Honduras through various initiatives, including providing assistance for the development of judicial institutions and rule-of-law initiatives. This includes support for a protection mechanism for journalists, human rights defenders, and justice sector officials, which offers trainings, psychosocial support, police escorts, and temporary relocations. However, there is skepticism towards the protection mechanism due to its reliance on the country's security forces, seen as perpetrators of human rights violations. The task force in Honduras, with vetted members of the national police and public prosecutor's office, arrested 42 people and secured six convictions in 2018. The U.S. government restricts foreign assistance due to human rights concerns, vetting security forces to prevent funding for units with human rights violations. The U.S. has chosen not to work with certain Honduran security forces, like the military police force, and has never provided assistance to them. Some members of the Honduran military trained by the U.S. have been assigned to the military police. Congress has imposed restrictions on U.S. security aid to Honduras, withholding a percentage until human rights conditions are met. Since FY2016, aid to the Honduran government is withheld until concerns, including human rights violations, are addressed. The State Department certified Honduras for assistance from FY2012 to FY2017, but has not done so for FY2018 or FY2019. The 116th Congress may consider legislation like the Berta C\u00e1ceres Human Rights in Honduras Act, which would suspend U.S. security aid until human rights abuses are addressed. The United States and Honduras have close commercial ties, with Honduras benefiting from preferential trade arrangements with the U.S. since the 1980s. The maquila sector, consisting of export-assembly companies, has flourished, especially after the passage of the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act in 2000. Commercial relations between the two countries have continued to expand. The maquila sector in Honduras has been boosted by tariff treatment and trade agreements like CAFTA-DR. Despite a decline after the global financial crisis, bilateral trade with the United States has increased significantly since 2005. U.S. exports to Honduras have grown by 72%, and U.S. imports from Honduras have grown by 25%. Since the implementation of CAFTA-DR, U.S. exports to Honduras have increased by 72% and imports from Honduras by 25%. Total two-way trade in 2018 amounted to $10.3 billion, with the U.S. having a trade surplus with Honduras since 2007. Top U.S. exports to Honduras included textile and apparel inputs, refined oil products, machinery, and cereals, while top imports from Honduras included apparel, insulated wire, bananas, and coffee. U.S. foreign direct investment in Honduras has also grown significantly. Since the implementation of CAFTA-DR, U.S. foreign direct investment in Honduras has increased by 71% since 2005, totaling $1.4 billion in 2017. Over 75% of the investment is in the manufacturing sector, with approximately 200 U.S. companies operating in the country. Despite low labor costs and proximity to the U.S. market, Honduras faces challenges such as high crime rates, weak institutions, corruption, low education levels, and poor infrastructure. Concerns have been raised about the enforcement of labor rights provisions under CAFTA-DR, with the AFL-CIO and Honduran organizations filing a petition in 2012. Civil society organizations filed a petition with the U.S. Department of Labor, alleging that the Honduran government failed to enforce laws on freedom of association, child labor, and working conditions in various sectors. After a three-year investigation, the Department of Labor found evidence of labor law violations and expressed concerns about Honduras's enforcement of labor rights. No significant improvements have been made to address these concerns. In December 2015, a monitoring and action plan was signed by U.S. and Honduran officials to address labor law enforcement challenges in Honduras. Despite the passage of a comprehensive labor inspection law in 2017, enforcement remains inconsistent and ineffective. Anti-union discrimination is a serious problem, with documented incidents of violence against labor activists. USAID is supporting a program to strengthen the Honduran government's ability to uphold labor rights and enhance civil society's advocacy capacity. Honduras has made uneven progress in addressing domestic challenges over the past five years, with improvements in combating corruption and finances, but poor living standards and human rights abuses persist. The U.S. has increased foreign assistance to strengthen government institutions and improve security in the country. The U.S. has increased foreign assistance to improve security in Honduras, but it is too early to assess the impact. Long-term efforts by the Honduran government and international community are needed for significant improvements in living conditions. Uncertainty surrounds U.S. policy as funding continues for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, despite the Trump Administration's intention to end some foreign assistance programs. Without sustained support, Honduras may struggle with political and social instability, which could affect the United States."
