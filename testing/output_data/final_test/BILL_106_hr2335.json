    "content": "The Act titled \"Hydroelectric Licensing Process Improvement Act of 1999\" is referred to as the short title. It includes findings related to the act. Congress finds that hydroelectric power is a crucial source of clean, renewable energy in the United States, providing various benefits such as recreation, irrigation, flood control, and wildlife support. The relicensing of non-Federal hydroelectric projects by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the next 15 years is highlighted as a significant upcoming process that needs improvement. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's licensing process is criticized for not producing optimal decisions, being inefficient, burdened by uncoordinated environmental reviews, and leading to litigation. Alternative licensing procedures for hydroelectric projects offer collaborative resolution opportunities. While alternative licensing procedures offer collaborative resolution opportunities, they cannot substitute for statutory reforms in the hydroelectric licensing process. The purpose of this Act is to improve the relicensing process for hydroelectric power projects by requiring agencies to consider environmental impacts, setting deadlines for agencies to submit conditions to a license, and making other improvements in the licensing process. The Act aims to enhance the relicensing process for hydroelectric power projects by mandating federal agencies to review environmental impacts and establish deadlines for submitting license conditions. The section defines \"condition\" as requirements for project licenses on Federal reservations and fishway construction, and \"consulting agency\" as the responsible Federal agency or the Secretary of the Interior. The consulting agency, either the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, must consider various factors when determining conditions for a project license, including economic impacts, power values, air quality, water supply, and compatibility with other conditions. The consulting agency must consider various factors when determining conditions for a project license, including economic impacts, power values, air quality, water supply, and compatibility with other conditions. Documentation must be created detailing proposals, comments, facts, and analyses to demonstrate full consideration of factors before any review. The consulting agency must submit documentation to the Commission when determining project conditions. Conditions must undergo scientific review based on current data and peer review. In the case of a condition for the first proviso of section 4(e), each condition by a consulting agency must be directly related to project impacts within the Federal reservation. Consulting agencies must provide proposed conditions to license applicants for review before submission to the Commission. The consulting agency must consider the impact on energy and economic values of a project when implementing a condition. The review of a proposed condition should be completed within 180 days after the license applicant notifies the agency. Failure to complete the review on time allows the Commission to handle the condition. The Commission may treat a condition submitted by the consulting agency as a recommendation under section 10(j). If the administrative law judge or reviewing body deems a proposed condition unreasonable or finds non-compliance with requirements, they must render a decision explaining the reasons and may provide recommendations for a more reasonable condition formulation. After administrative review, a consulting agency must take necessary action to withdraw, modify, or comply with conditions as recommended by the administrative law judge or reviewing body. After an applicant files an application for a license, a consulting agency must submit a final condition to the Commission within 1 year of the notice for environmental review. The final condition should include the record on administrative review and documentation of any actions taken post-review. The consulting agency must submit a final condition to the Commission within 1 year of the notice for environmental review. If the agency fails to do so, they lose the authority to recommend conditions, and the Commission may establish appropriate conditions that align with the law. The Commission has the option to grant one extension. The Commission may grant one extension of up to 30 days for a deadline set under paragraph (1). The Commission shall conduct an economic analysis of conditions submitted by a consulting agency to assess their impact on the project's economic viability. In making determinations under section 10(j)(2), the Commission will consider the consistency of recommendations with the purposes and requirements of the section. When requested in a rehearing, the Commission will provide a written determination on the effect of conditions. The Commission will assess conditions submitted by a consulting agency for public interest, scientific review, project impacts, reasonableness, substantial evidence, and consistency with the Act and license terms. Amendments are made to the Federal Power Act regarding project impacts within reservations. Amendments are made to the Federal Power Act regarding project impacts within reservations, including consideration of greenhouse gas emissions. Section 18 is amended to specify that conditions are to be determined in accordance with section 32 by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce. SEC. 33. COORDINATED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS is added to Part I of the Federal Power Act, focusing on streamlining environmental reviews for projects. The Commission is responsible for conducting a consolidated environmental review for projects licensed under the Federal Power Act, either individually or for multiple projects in the same area. Consulting agencies are not required to perform additional environmental reviews. The Commission must set deadlines for the submission of comments by government agencies. The Commission sets deadlines for government agencies to submit comments on environmental impact statements or assessments for projects licensed under the Federal Power Act, considering the applicant's need for a prompt decision, resources of involved agencies, and statutory requirements. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct a study on the feasibility of a separate licensing procedure for small hydroelectric projects with a generating capacity of 5 megawatts or less."
