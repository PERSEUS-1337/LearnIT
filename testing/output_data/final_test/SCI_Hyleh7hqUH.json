    "content": "The use of deep learning models in compressive sensing for seismic data acquisition shows potential for cost-effective solutions. A Wasserstein generative adversarial network is designed to learn statistical properties of seismic wavelets. The model is validated and tested for compressive sensing with sparse representation, non-uniform samplings, and recommendations for seismic survey grids. The goal is to optimize seismic acquisition design while minimizing loss in imaging quality. A compressive sensing design using a GAN model is proposed for seismic data acquisition, aiming to improve imaging quality and reveal finer details compared to traditional approaches. The model is capable of recovering compressed images under uniform or nonuniform sampling, offering a cost-effective solution with enhanced performance. Compressed image recovery model introduced for missing pixel inpainting problem using deep learning on historical images of uncompressed dataset. Model leverages raw image as ground truth and binary mask to indicate missing pixel locations, achieving efficient and reliable recovery. The challenges in using an inpainting model for seismic image sampling include different statistical characteristics, a larger number of unknown pixels, and sparsely distributed known regions in the compressed image. To address these issues, modifications will be made to the original network and different experiments will be conducted using the Generative Inpainting Network with Contextual Attention (GIN). The Generative Inpainting Network (GIN) outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by combining coarse and refinement networks with Contextual Attention. In GIN-CS, binary masks replace bounding boxes for incomplete image generation, improving spatial relations. The study used an internal offshore dataset to train a network for seismic image inpainting. Two methods for arranging training masks were compared: random single bounding boxes and predefined binary sampling masks. The testing dataset was from the Gulf of Mexico. The modified GIN-CS model showed superior performance in terms of MSE and SSIM index compared to the original GIN and conventional biharmonic method. The study compared the performance of the GIN related methods in seismic image inpainting, showing superior results in MSE and SSIM index. The proposed model aligns better with ground truth compared to GIN, generating realistic images without artificial noise. A non-uniform sampling recommendation approach leveraging fast image reconstruction with GIN is suggested for optimal survey set-up. The recommended sampling method for seismic image inpainting relies on GIN performance. It involves mask generation, difference map generation, and initial candidate traces generation for comparison. Smaller difference values indicate better reconstruction quality. Initial candidate traces are generated using observed intervals to distinguish traces based on mean differences. The top-to-bottom hierarchical sorting is then implemented to select traces in a specific order to avoid repetition. The study compares reconstruction performance of recommended sampling survey with random samplings. Results show improvement in Table 2. Uniform sampling and sampling recommendation are compared on GoM dataset in Figure 1. Cross-line and in-line results are combined for 3D reconstruction. The study presents a modified GIN model, GIN-CS, for seismic image reconstruction with superior performance compared to conventional methods. It successfully captures heterogeneity and can fill missing traces even at high compression rates. The proposed method is significantly faster and a strategy for non-uniform survey recommendations is suggested. A strategy for constructing a recommendation of non-uniform survey is proposed for a field dataset from Gulf of Mexico, based on results from limited uniform sampling experiments."
