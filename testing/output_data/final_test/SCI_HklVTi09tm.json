    "content": "Active matter consists of active agents that convert energy into momentum, leading to collective phenomena. A synthetic active system of microtubule polymers driven by protein motors forms a liquid-crystalline nematic phase, causing continuous buckling and folding of the microtubules. Defect motion in this system provides insights into active nematics, such as bacterial films and animal cells. Deep Learning was used to train a defect detector for analyzing microscopy videos more efficiently. Our method applied Deep Learning to train a defect detector for analyzing microscopy videos of the microtubule active nematic. Results show robust and accurate performance, expected to increase video data processing. Active nematics involve systems converting energy into mechanical work, self-organizing with structure on various scales. An important class includes active-nematics with anisotropic particles creating material flows through collective motion. In this work, a model quasi-2D active nematic system composed of microtubules and motor proteins is studied. The system creates a dense, liquid-crystalline nematic phase with extensile stresses driving neighboring microtubules to slide anti-parallel, leading to instability and bend fluctuations. Topological disclinations eventually form in the system. The active nematic system composed of microtubules and motor proteins creates localized topological disclinations characterized by winding numbers. These defects induce fluid flows, with self-propelling +1/2 defects and three-fold symmetry -1/2 defects causing active flows leading to net translation. Hydrodynamic interactions between defects result in chaotic flows, which can be tamed into circulating vortices in microfluidic wells. Defect dynamics play a crucial role in transitioning from bulk-like turbulence to regular circulation, providing insights into complex fluid behavior. Researchers developed an image processing algorithm based on the winding number of topological defects in 2D confined active nematics to detect both +1/2 and -1/2 defects. The algorithm is limited by visual quality variations and noise from experimental settings, requiring fine-tuning for different datasets and human labor for parameter adjustments. The traditional defect detecting algorithm based on image processing techniques faces challenges such as noise in data, intensive calculations, slow processing speed, and lack of robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose using deep learning, specifically a deep convolutional neural network, to improve defect detection efficiency. Our tasks include labeling defect positions in experimental data and training a YOLO network with bounding boxes. Our method improves defect detection efficiency by training a YOLO network with labeled defect positions in experimental data. It performs well on data with varying visual qualities and sizes, showcasing improved robustness and precision. The algorithm can handle defects of different shapes, sizes, configurations, and occlusions, reducing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the use of an end-to-end neural network enables efficient training. The algorithm utilizes a unified neural network for efficient training and testing. The labeled dataset includes 9 videos of active nematics in different settings. The videos show continuous turbulent-like flow. The testing dataset is separated by 500 frames from the training dataset. Figure 4 illustrates the trajectory of +1/2 defects from nucleation to annihilation. The trajectory of a +1/2 defect from nucleation to annihilation is shown in Figure 4. The process involves the defect moving, rotating, and eventually annihilating with a -1/2 defect. The detection of defects relies on identifying characteristics that differentiate them from their surroundings, with the topological winding number being a key factor. Researchers previously developed an algorithm based on the topological winding number to detect defects in images. The algorithm requires preprocessing to extract the direction field from the original image, which can be challenging due to imperfections and noise. Issues such as occluded defects, overexposure, and presence of unwanted materials like hairs can lead to false detections. To improve defect detection in images, a new approach treats it as an object detection task using a convolutional neural network. The model generates bounding boxes around defects for accurate results. By training on a diverse dataset with various defect configurations, sizes, and visual qualities, the model can generalize better without needing fine-tuning for different datasets. A training dataset of 8800 images was created by manually labeling positive and negative defects. In 8800 images, positive and negative defects were labeled. Comet-like defects were labeled at sharp orientation changes, while trefoil-like defects were labeled at triangular material-devoid regions. The challenge lies in detecting varying sizes of defects, such as \"hollow\" +1/2 defects, where assigning uniform bounding boxes is problematic. To address the issue of varying defect sizes, a separate class was created for \"hollow\" +1/2 defects with slightly bigger bounding boxes. Different sizes of bounding boxes were assigned for +1/2, -1/2, and hollow +1/2 defects. Image augmentation techniques like flipping and rotation were applied to increase model robustness. The state-of-the-art object detection algorithms can be categorized into two main groups. The first category combines selective search with deep CNN for object localization and classification, including RCNN series and Faster R-CNN. The second category includes YOLO algorithm. In this project, YOLO algorithm was chosen for its speed and ease of optimization. The algorithm uses a grid cell approach for object detection, with coordinates of bounding boxes and confidence values as output. Some modifications were made to the original settings, such as adjusting the number of filters in the last convolutional layer and decreasing the jitter value to improve defect detection near boundaries. The YOLO algorithm was modified for defect detection by adjusting parameters such as the non-object coefficient and removing image augmentation. Evaluation results for different defect classes on three testing datasets were presented, with a total of 1700 images analyzed. The model's performance was assessed based on correct predictions of defects within generated bounding boxes. Our model achieved an overall F1-score of 0.6568, with 0.7902 for +1/2 defects and 0.3960 for -1/2 defects. In comparison, the traditional image processing algorithm scored 0.6505 overall, with 0.7323 for +1/2 defects and 0.4956 for -1/2 defects. The detection of -1/2 defects was particularly poor, attributed to their complex geometric configuration and an unbalanced training dataset. Within the dataset, there are 58536 +1/2 defects and 24518 -1/2 defects. Detection performance decreases near the system boundary due to factors like defect distribution and nucleation/annihilation processes. Defects are more common in central regions, leading to lower detection rates in outer regions. Defects near the boundary are smaller in size and harder to define. YOLO and traditional methods were compared with 1500 testing images, showing different detection rates. The traditional method was tested on a Desktop with specific hardware, while the new method used a machine with higher specifications. The method operates on a machine with strong computational ability, showing significant speed advantage over YOLO in object detection for videos. YOLO, while state-of-the-art for images, lacks the ability to consider information from previous and next frames. Improving YOLO to utilize temporal connections between frames is crucial for detecting results in active nematics experiments with videos containing up to twenty thousand frames. The T-CNN method, developed to enhance object detection by incorporating temporal and contextual information, has shown state-of-the-art results in defects detection algorithms. This approach, which boosts detecting results under the R-CNN framework, will now be applied to improve YOLO's pipeline for detecting results in the dataset. The method offers faster processing, higher F1-score, and easy execution, making it accessible to researchers with basic Python skills. This demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in soft matter applications, particularly in tasks involving images or videos. Object detection is a common task in physics involving images or videos. This paper offers an effective alternative for physicists tackling similar tasks."
