    "content": "Nanotechnology has been a focus of interest for Congress since 2000 with the launch of the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). Approximately $20.9 billion was appropriated for nanotechnology R&D from FY2001 to FY2015, with President Obama proposing $1.5 billion for NNI funding in FY2016. The NNI aims to advance understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, offering significant economic and societal benefits through the development and application of nanotechnology across various industries. The United States faces technical and policy challenges in commercializing nanotechnology, including EHS concerns, regulations, standards, technology transfer, intellectual property, investment capital, ethical concerns, public acceptance, and workforce development. This report discusses nanotechnology, the National Nanotechnology Initiative, potential reauthorization of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, and appropriations issues. The United States is a global leader in nanotechnology, with the National Nanotechnology Initiative established in 2000. Other nations have also developed their own nanotechnology programs, leading to increased competition for global leadership. Almost every nation supporting research and development now has a national-level nanotechnology program. In 2014, global nanotechnology funding was estimated at $18.5 billion, with corporate R&D surpassing publicly funded R&D in 2010. Nano-enabled products generated $731 billion in revenues in 2012, showing economic benefits. Nanotechnology has the potential to transform industries, improve lives, and enhance national security. Nanotechnology products on the market offer incremental improvements in various areas like performance, aesthetics, and cost. Advocates project nanotechnology product revenues to reach $4.4 trillion by 2018, with potential long-term economic and societal benefits. Nanotechnology, in combination with information technology, biotechnology, and cognitive sciences, may lead to revolutionary advances such as new prevention, detection, and treatment technologies for deadly illnesses, replacement organs, wearable health monitoring devices, protective clothing, renewable energy sources, water purification systems, green manufacturing, high-density memory systems, and electronic skin sensors for robots and prosthetics. Nanotechnology has various applications such as electronic skin sensors for robots and prosthetics, agricultural technologies for increased crop yield, self-repairing materials, and sensors for detecting toxins. Research is ongoing to understand nanoscale phenomena and interactions with humans and the environment. The federal government has been funding nanoscale science, engineering, and technology R&D for over a decade. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) was initiated in 2000 as a Presidential technology initiative, with various agencies participating. In 2013, 27 agencies are involved in the NNI, with 16 receiving appropriations for nanotechnology R&D. Since its inception in 2000, the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) has seen fluctuations in federal funding, reaching a peak of $1.9 billion in FY2010 before declining to $1.5 billion in FY2015. President Obama requested the same amount for FY2016. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 established the National Nanotechnology Program (NNP) and authorized agencies like NSF, DOE, NASA, NIST, and EPA for nanotechnology R&D, but did not include DOD, NIH, and DHS in its provisions. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) coordinates nanotechnology R&D activities across various funding agencies, including DOD, NIH, and DHS. The NNI focuses on developing fundamental scientific knowledge through basic research, with investments supporting nanotechnology applications development for mission agencies like DOD. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) has contributed to developing tools and standards for measuring and controlling matter at the nanoscale. They work with industry organizations to move research results to the marketplace in various fields. NNI agencies also address regulatory issues, public understanding, and workforce education. They engage in international forums like the OECD. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of maintaining U.S. leadership in nanotechnology, including environmental and safety concerns, developing standards and metrology tools, building a skilled workforce, technology transfer, public perception, ethical considerations, intellectual property protection, and securing investment capital. The curr_chunk discusses the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), focusing on implications, protecting intellectual property, securing investment capital, and fostering international cooperation. Proponents emphasize the importance of nanotechnology for U.S. competitiveness and national security, while critics have varying views on government involvement and industry collaboration. Some industry voices criticize the NNI for its emphasis on basic research and slow progress in transitioning R&D to industry. Some criticize the federal government for not supporting nanotechnology R&D enough to make it economically viable for investors. Critics also point out the NNI's lack of support for developing necessary manufacturing processes. Supporters of industry-driven investments argue against excessive government involvement, fearing it may interfere with market dynamics. Some critics argue that federal government funding of scientific research is wasteful and driven by political considerations rather than scientific merit. Non-governmental organizations are concerned about the potential adverse impacts of nanotechnology on human health, safety, and the environment. They believe that the government is moving too quickly in developing and commercializing nanotechnology without adequately investing in research to understand and mitigate negative implications. Critics suggest applying the precautionary principle to regulate nanotechnology. The precautionary principle calls for regulatory action on potentially hazardous substances before a causal link is established by scientific evidence. Some NGOs have called for a moratorium on nanotechnology R&D and products with synthetic nanoparticles. The European Parliament Committee proposed a moratorium on nanomaterials in food. The National Nanotechnology Initiative coordinates federal nanoscale R&D activities. The NNI envisions a future where nanoscale technology revolutionizes technology. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) aims to advance nanotechnology R&D, transfer new technologies into products, develop educational resources and support responsible nanotechnology development. Coordination of federal nanoscale R&D efforts began in 1996. The Interagency Working Group on Nanotechnology (IWGN) was established in 1998 under the NSTC. In 1999, IWGN developed a plan for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which was approved by PCAST and OSTP. President Clinton elevated nanotechnology research to a federal initiative in his FY2001 budget. Congress has been instrumental in providing funding and legislative support for the NNI. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) receives funding through appropriations to participating agencies, with a budget calculated by aggregating nanotechnology budgets. In FY2001, Congress provided $464 million to eight agencies for nanoscale R&D. Currently, 27 agencies participate in the NNI, with an estimated total funding of $1.5 billion in FY2015. The original six agencies still account for the majority of NNI funding. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 codified NNI activities, receiving bipartisan support in Congress. It established the National Nanotechnology Program (NNP) and authorized funding for five NNI agencies. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 established the National Nanotechnology Program (NNP) and authorized funding for five NNI agencies, including NSF, DOE, NASA, NIST, and EPA. Key provisions include authorizing appropriations totaling $3.679 billion for fiscal years 2005 through 2008 and establishing a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office for interagency coordination. The National Nanotechnology Program was established in 2003 with key provisions including funding for five NNI agencies and the creation of a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office. Key actions include establishing a National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel, conducting triennial reviews, overseeing program planning, and directing research on nanotechnology issues. The National Nanotechnology Program established in 2003 includes key provisions for funding NNI agencies and creating a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office. Additional directives include establishing a clearinghouse of information, supporting interdisciplinary R&D, carrying out projects for investigators, and establishing two merit-reviewed centers for societal, ethical, and environmental implications of nanotechnology. The National Nanotechnology Program, established in 2003, includes provisions for funding NNI agencies and creating a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office. It also establishes two centers for societal, ethical, and environmental implications of nanotechnology and nanomaterials manufacturing. The program aims to encourage research, development, and application of nanotechnology, as well as transfer manufacturing technologies to U.S. industries. The NNI's 2004 Strategic Plan aligns with the activities outlined in the program. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) activities were already in progress before the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. The Act provided a legislative foundation for some NNI activities and authorized agency funding levels through FY2008. No comprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced since then. In the 114th Congress, a bill was introduced to amend the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. The bill, known as the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2015, was referred to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. No further action had been taken as of the date of the report. In the 113th Congress, efforts were made to amend the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act through bills like H.R. 4159 and S. 2757, which were part of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2014. However, no further action was taken on these bills. Additionally, in the 111th Congress, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (H.R. 5116) included provisions related to nanotechnology. In the 111th Congress, several bills were introduced to amend the National Nanotechnology Initiative, including H.R. 5116, H.R. 820, S. 1482, and H.R. 554. However, no further action was taken on these bills. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the National Nanotechnology Initiative, including H.R. 5116, H.R. 820, S. 1482, and H.R. 554. H.R. 5940 (110th Congress) and S. 3274 (110th Congress) were titled the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008. The House passed H.R. 5940 by a vote of 407-6; the Senate did not act on S. 3274. The NNI is coordinated within the White House through the NSTC. The NSET Subcommittee under the NSTC's Committee on Science is led by agency co-chairs from NIST and OSTP, with representatives from 27 federal entities. It has two working groups and coordinators for various issue areas, with a focus on nanotechnology R&D and environmental, health, and safety research. The Nanotechnology Environmental and Health Implications working group was established to facilitate research and communication on the environmental and health effects of nanotechnology products among government agencies and non-government parties. Sixteen NNI agencies, along with other key entities, participate in identifying and prioritizing EHS research needs related to nanotechnology. The Nanomanufacturing, Industry Liaison, and Innovation (NILI) working group aims to enhance collaboration between U.S. industry and government on nanotechnology-related activities to create new products and manufacturing processes at the nanoscale. It also facilitates technology transfer from federally funded research to industry, fostering collaborations with various industries. The National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO) was established in 2001 to provide support to the NSET Subcommittee and promote access to nanotechnology technologies. It serves as a point of contact for federal nanotechnology activities, conducts public outreach, and facilitates information exchange among stakeholders. Additionally, the NNCO liaises with academia, industry, and other organizations to promote collaboration and early application of nanotechnology innovations. The NNCO facilitates the exchange of technical and programmatic information, coordinates NNI planning and budget documents, and maintains the NNI website. Funding for the NNCO is provided by contributions from NSET Subcommittee member agencies, with total funding in FY2013 at $3.0 million from five main agencies. EPA now contributes to funding the NNCO, with two agencies initially exempt due to small nanotechnology budgets. The NNI is funded by five main agencies, accounting for 95% of the funding. This supports NNCO staff, activities, and the triennial review of the NNI. The funding also goes towards research, multidisciplinary centers, research infrastructure, and addressing societal implications of nanotechnology. The NNI budget is an aggregation of individual agency budgets for nanotechnology. The NNI budget is developed internally by individual agencies as part of their overall budget process, reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget. For FY2015, NNI R&D funding totaled $1.488 billion, with decreases in NSF, DOD, and NIST budgets offset by increases at DOE and FDA. President Obama requested $1.495 billion for NNI funding. President Obama has requested $1.495 billion in funding for the NNI in FY2016, with increases in funding for DOE and NIH offset by decreases at DOD, DHS, and NASA. NSF, HHS (primarily NIH), DOE, DOD, and NIST were the top five agencies accounting for 93% of NNI funding in FY2015. The NNI funding for FY2016 includes investments in nanotechnology for national security missions by various agencies such as NIST, DHS, NASA, EPA, USDA, HHS, DOT, and CPSC. The 21st Century Nanotechnology R&D Act of 2003 established Program Component Areas for investment categories. The Program Component Areas (PCA) are categories of investments that inform Congress and the executive branch about relative investments in nanotechnology. The 2007 NNI Strategic Plan split the seventh PCA into two: Environment, Health, and Safety; and Education and Societal Dimensions. In 2014, the number of PCAs was reduced from eight to five to accommodate the maturation of the Initiative and enhance applications. A new PCA was added to identify funding for Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives (NSIs). The NNI's Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives (NSIs) are multi-agency collaborations aimed at accelerating innovation in national priority areas. The new PCAs provide a strategic and inclusive approach to funding allocation, aligning with NNI goals and objectives. Funding breakdown for each NSI is detailed in tables for FY2013 to FY2016 and FY2006 to FY2012. The NNI's Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives (NSIs) are dynamic collaborations across Federal agencies, focusing on foundational research and applications. Funding for NSIs in FY2015 was $246.5 million, decreasing by 9.6% from FY2014. The President requested $251.5 million for FY2016. The Nanotechnology for Solar Energy Collection and Conversion NSI focuses on improving energy conversion and storage at the nanoscale for solar energy. Funding in FY2015 was $71.7 million, down $1.5 million (2.0%) from the previous year. The Sustainable Nanomanufacturing NSI aims to develop manufacturing technologies for integrating nanoscale building blocks into large-scale systems sustainably. It focuses on carbon-based nanomaterials, optical metamaterials, and cellulosic nanomaterials. Funding in FY2015 was $37.1 million, down $10.1 million (21.4%) from FY2014. The President requested $42.6 million for FY2016. The Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond NSI received $71.4 million in funding for FY2015, a decrease of $7.2 million from FY2014. The President requested $73.8 million for FY2016. The NSI focuses on novel nanoscale fabrication processes and innovative concepts to advance nanoelectronics, with five thrust areas including exploring new computing variables and expanding the national research infrastructure network. The Nanotechnology Knowledge Infrastructure NSI in FY2016 had four thrust areas focusing on collaborative community, modeling network, cyber-toolbox for nanomaterials design, and digital data infrastructure. Funding increased to $22.8 million in FY2015 and the President requested $23.6 million for FY2016. Nanotechnology for Sensors and Sensors for Nanotechnology NSI aimed to develop new technologies using nanoscale materials for sensors and detect engineered nanomaterials. The Foundational Research PCA in FY2015 received $43.6 million in funding, a decrease from the previous year. The President requested $34.5 million for FY2016 to develop methods and devices for detecting engineered nanomaterials and assessing their impact on human health and the environment. The Foundational Research PCA in FY2015 received $510.6 million in funding, a decrease of $38.3 million from FY2014. The President requested $512.4 million for FY2016. The Nanotechnology-Enabled Applications, Devices, and Systems PCA focuses on applying nanoscale science and engineering to create novel devices and systems, with funding allocated for various aspects such as metrology, manufacturing technology, and standards. The Nanotechnology-Enabled Applications, Devices, and Systems PCA received $395.9 million in FY2015, down $22.9 million from FY2014. The President requested $385.8 million for FY2016. This PCA includes R&D for tools needed to advance nanotechnology research and commercialization, such as next-generation instrumentation for characterization, measurement, synthesis, and design of materials, structures, devices, and systems. The National Nanotechnology Initiative includes funding for various categories such as Research Infrastructure and Instrumentation, Environment, Health, and Safety. In FY2015, funding for Research Infrastructure was $235.8 million, and for Environment, Health, and Safety was $98.9 million. The President requested $240.2 million and $105.4 million for FY2016, respectively. The initiative focuses on interdisciplinary research and education centers to support nanotechnology development. The National Nanotechnology Initiative funds interdisciplinary research and education centers, networks, and user facilities at universities and federal laboratories across the country. These centers support multidisciplinary research among investigators from academia, industry, and government laboratories, leading to advances in knowledge and the development of basic research results into applications. The NSF has established university-based centers supporting nanotechnology research, including Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers (NSECs) and Nanosystems Engineering Research Centers (NERCs). The National Nanotechnology Initiative funds interdisciplinary research centers and networks at universities and federal laboratories. These centers support multidisciplinary research leading to advances in knowledge and applications. Various agencies have established university-based centers for nanotechnology research, including Nanoscale Science and Engineering Networks, Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers, and Centers for Chemical Innovation. Additionally, the NIH has established Nanomedicine Development Centers, Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory, Centers of Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence, and Innovative Research in Cancer Nanotechnology. Various government agencies have established university-based nanotechnology research centers, including the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the USDA Forest Service. These centers focus on research into nanomaterials and their applications in various fields. User facilities are available at various research centers, such as the Maine School of Forest Resources and the Advance Structures and Composites Center. These facilities allow outside researchers to utilize equipment and expertise for research purposes. Charges may apply for proprietary work, but non-proprietary work leading to publication is typically free of charge. Conditions for access vary by facility and agency. The government laboratories and user facilities at universities are supported by federal funds. The 21st Century Nanotechnology R&D Act of 2003 established the American Nanotechnology Preparedness Center and the Center for Nanomaterials Manufacturing. The American Nanotechnology Preparedness Center was fulfilled by NSF's Network for Nanotechnology in Society, with centers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Harvard University, and the University of South Carolina. These centers were funded under NSF's NSEC program. The NSET Subcommittee confirms NSF's establishment of the National Nanomanufacturing Network (NNN) through four NSECs, with the Center for Integrated Hierarchical Manufacturing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as the main node. The NNN NSECs were created with NSF, DOD, and NIST collaboration but solely funded by NSF. The 21st Century Nanotechnology R&D Act mandates external reviews of the National Nanotechnology Program by the National Research Council and the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel, requiring the President to establish a National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, designated as the NNAP, reports to the President and Congress every two years on various aspects of the National Nanotechnology Program. This includes assessing trends in nanotechnology science and engineering, progress in program implementation, the need for program revisions, funding levels, U.S. leadership in nanotechnology, program management, and addressing societal and ethical concerns. The NNCO is directed to conduct a triennial review of the National Nanotechnology Program, evaluating technical accomplishments, goal achievement, management, funding levels, technology transfer, interdisciplinary research, and ethical considerations. The NNCO conducts a triennial review of the National Nanotechnology Program, evaluating technical accomplishments, goal achievement, management, funding levels, technology transfer, interdisciplinary research, and ethical considerations, including recommendations for program improvements and policy changes. The PCAST and NRC have conducted assessments of the National Nanotechnology Initiative, focusing on critical research areas, impact on the U.S. economy, and recommendations for future impact. The reports include the First Assessment in 2005, the Second Assessment in 2008, and others. In the Third to Fifth Assessments of the National Nanotechnology Initiative, key recommendations and findings were highlighted by PCAST. The Fifth Assessment emphasized the critical transition point for nanotechnology and the NNI, with technological advancements being a key focus. PCAST emphasizes the critical transition point for nanotechnology and the NNI, highlighting the evolution towards interdisciplinary nano-systems and the need for rapid commercialization. The United States must focus on enabling commercialization to compete internationally and reap the rewards of investing in nanotechnology research. PCAST recommends transitioning nanotechnology efforts towards building program, coordination, and leadership frameworks for commercial product translation. Key recommendations include shifting from Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives to Grand Challenges, establishing a cross-sector advisory committee, enabling cross-funding priorities, and implementing formal metrics for assessing research and commercialization effectiveness. PCAST recommended expanding NSF's iCorps program to focus on entrepreneurship in nanotechnology, identifying potential Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation for nanomanufacturing, and providing additional support for high-risk research in nanoscience. They emphasized the importance of commercializing nanotechnologies while supporting discovery research. Implementation of these recommendations is crucial for the success of the NNI. The PCAST's Fifth Assessment of the NNI recommended changes to its management, including replacing Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives with Grand Challenges, engaging stakeholders in identifying challenges, using innovation prizes and partnerships, selecting leaders for each challenge, and putting the NNI review on a three-year interval. Failure to implement these changes could decrease the value of the NNI. The 2013 Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative draft by the NRC identified five crosscutting topics: supporting the NNI nanotechnology community, strengthening planning and coordination, improving the NNI website to serve various stakeholder groups, establishing a separate committee of nanotechnology experts, and creating a common set of evaluation metrics. The NSET Subcommittee, NNI agencies, and the NNCO should utilize technology and social-network analysis for developing metrics to assess progress towards NNI goals. Implementing best practices, especially in technology transfer and commercialization, is recommended. The NRC suggests regular assessment of working groups and forming new ones as needed. The NRC recommended the NSET Subcommittee establish working groups on facility oversight, coordination, education, and workforce development. Each working group should have specific goals, annual plans, and ties to NNI signature initiatives. The NSET Subcommittee should inform the NSTC Committee on Technology about NNI objectives annually. The NNI website should be redesigned for various stakeholder communities. Signature initiative teams should develop strategic plans with technical targets, milestones, and expected outcomes. The NSET Subcommittee should incentivize groups in nanotechnology-enabled industries to participate in developing technical roadmaps and in partnering to address long-term research needs through agency efforts such as the NIST Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortium program (AmTech). The NRC and PCAST have expressed concerns about the authority of NSET Subcommittee representatives within their agencies and their ability to influence budget decision making. PCAST praised the NNI's progress but raised concerns about the lack of cohesion in agency contributions and alignment with the NNI strategic plan. PCAST recommended that agencies develop implementation plans to better align their activities with NNI objectives. PCAST recommended that each NSET Subcommittee agency have senior representatives with decision-making authority participate in coordination activities of the NNI and dedicate 0.3% of NNI funding to the NNCO for staffing and budget levels. They also suggested appointing the NNCO director as a co-chair of the NSET Subcommittee and allowing non-federal experts to serve as NNCO director. Additionally, PCAST recommended creating a standing PCAST Nanotechnology Steering Committee for guidance. The recommendation is to establish an independent advisory panel with expertise in nanoscale science and engineering to better serve the role of the NNAP. This suggests the need for a separate entity focused solely on the NNI to serve as the NNAP. Critics argue for a separate, NNI-focused entity as the NNAP, citing the need for nanotechnology-specific expertise. Supporters advocate for using PCAST, emphasizing integrated perspective and reduced costs. PCAST praised NNI's success but offered recommendations for improvement in program management. PCAST recommended improvements for NNI program management, including requiring senior agency representatives to participate in coordination activities, strengthening the NNCO as the coordinating entity, and dedicating 0.3% of NNI funding to the NNCO for staffing and budget. These recommendations were deemed unnecessary by the NSET Subcommittee in their 2013 budget supplement. The NSET Subcommittee clarified that member agencies make their own decisions on representation. They emphasized that the NSET Subcommittee, not the NNCO, coordinates the NNI, with the NNCO providing administrative support. Funding for nanotechnology R&D and allocation among program areas are key considerations for policymakers. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) has seen fluctuations in funding, with a peak of $1.913 billion in FY2010 but falling to $1.488 billion in FY2015. The President has requested $1.495 billion for FY2016. Recommendations have been made to increase funding to maintain the US leadership in nanotechnology development amidst global competition. The NNI should maintain or expand funding for basic nanotechnology research to balance short-term goals with long-term R&D. Congress is interested in the US competitive position in nanotechnology due to its economic, societal, and national security potential. New funds are needed without reducing investment in physical sciences and engineering research. The NRC and PCAST recommend periodic reviews of the competitive environment for nanotechnology in the US relative to other nations, emphasizing the importance of funding creative, high-risk research to maintain competitiveness. PCAST supports single investigators in high-risk research and funds new grants in nanoscience annually. They emphasize the importance of nanoscale research centers and infrastructure networks for training scientists and engineers. PCAST credits the NNI for the US leadership in nanotechnology. The US leads in nanotechnology R&D and commercialization, thanks to the NNI. However, competitors like China, South Korea, Germany, and Japan are gaining ground in research publications, patents, and funding. China, in particular, has increased its share of nanotechnology research and supports it more in total scientific research compared to the US. The United States is still the leader in nanotechnology R&D and commercialization but is losing ground to foreign competitors like China, South Korea, Germany, and Japan. Russia's Nanotech Corporation (RUSNANO) is also emerging as a major player in nanotechnology R&D spending, second only to the United States. RUSNANO has increased its funding significantly and plans to further increase it by 2015. The U.S. leadership position in nanotechnology is based on metrics that indicate potential innovation rather than sales or market share. The United States leads in nanotechnology R&D and commercialization but faces competition from China, South Korea, Germany, Japan, and Russia's Nanotech Corporation. Metrics for potential innovation, not sales, determine leadership. Technology commercialization translates R&D investments into economic benefits. The United States leads in nanotechnology R&D and commercialization, facing competition from other countries. Technology commercialization translates R&D investments into economic and societal benefits. PCAST recommended changes to improve nanotechnology commercialization, including defining potential Manufacturing Innovation Institutes and expanding the NSF iCorps program. The PCAST recommended changes to improve nanotechnology commercialization, including providing hands-on business knowledge to scientists and engineers in bringing technology products to market. Additionally, they called for the establishment of an annual nano-focused economic development forum to facilitate business partnerships. The NRC credits the NNI agencies and the NNCO for boosting technology transfer of NNI research results. The NRC recommended that the NNI agencies identify and share best practices in intellectual property management to facilitate technology commercialization. PCAST lauded the NNI's response to commercialization-related recommendations, including the development of an NNCO Industry and State Liaison position and expanded efforts in supporting nanotechnology commercialization. The NILI working group focused on job creation, state outreach, and incorporating industrial input in NNI efforts. The PCAST co-chairs highlighted efforts by DOE, NIST, and NIH to promote nanotechnology commercialization and technology translation. However, they emphasized the need for additional work in strategic planning, program management, impact assessment metrics, and research support for environmental aspects. PCAST recommended increasing support for research on environmental, health, and safety issues related to nanotechnology to maintain U.S. leadership in commercialization. Suggestions included doubling federal funding for nanomanufacturing, establishing government-industry-university partnerships, and enhancing cooperation among NNI agencies for translating scientific discoveries into commercial activities. The Nanoelectronics Research Initiative is being used as a model for nanotechnology signature initiatives. The goal is to fund at least five NSIs in priority areas like homeland security, national defense, and human health, with annual funding levels of $20 million to $40 million each. The Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration will provide advice on creating new jobs in the U.S. The NSET Subcommittee responded to PCAST's recommendations by stating that key NNI agencies were on track to double their funding. The NSET Subcommittee responded to PCAST's recommendations by stating that key NNI agencies were on track to double their nanomanufacturing investments over five years, with funding concentrated in NSF and DOD. However, President Obama requested a reduction in nanomanufacturing funding for FY2014. Interagency task forces for NSIs were developing coordination plans, with the likelihood of adding two additional NSIs within the next year. The NILI working group was also active in their efforts. The NSET Subcommittee is working on adding more NSIs and collaborating with the NNCO's Industry and State liaison to create a work plan focusing on job creation and outreach. They are utilizing established mechanisms like the SBIR and STTR programs to clarify the development pathway and are developing new programs for technology transfer. Standards will play a crucial role in various aspects of nanotechnology R&D and commercialization, as highlighted in the NRC's 2013 draft report. The NNI and NNCO are focusing on standards development for nanotechnology commercialization and regulation. PCAST emphasized the importance of standards for technology growth, recommending NNCO to coordinate with stakeholders on metrology, size, shape, and composition standards for nanomaterials. The PCAST recommended appointing an individual to lead interagency coordination of standards development efforts for nanotechnology. Dr. Ajit Jillavenkatesa was named to this role, also co-chairing the Nanotechnology Standards Panel of ANSI and participating in the NSET Subcommittee. PCAST's Fifth Assessment recommended establishing a common set of evaluation metrics to measure the impact on workforce, productivity, and scientific knowledge. The NRC's 2013 draft report recommended the NNI establish a framework to link goals with specific actions and collect nine data sets to assess success, including NNI-funded projects, published documents, technology transfer data, and job advertisements. The NRC recommended using qualitative and semi-quantitative metrics, along with quantitative measures, to evaluate NNI success and set goals. Data-mining expertise is needed for data collection and analysis, linking NNI participants to their work, and making data publicly available. PCAST emphasized the importance of economic impact in the Third Assessment. In its Third Assessment, PCAST highlighted the need for economic impact metrics and data collection, recommending the development of NNI economic impact metrics and lodging responsibility with a statistical agency to estimate job creation and the value of nanotechnology products. The NSET Subcommittee also engaged in discussions with the Department of Commerce about economic metrics and supported a symposium on the economic value of nanotechnology. The NRC recommends focusing on developing metrics for quantifying the economic return from federal investment in nanotechnology R&D, with a greater role for the Department of Commerce in data collection and analysis. Metrics should cover technology transfer, commercial development, and economic impacts, as there have been few efforts to understand the economic effects of the NNI investments. The Department of Commerce lacks formalized assessments on the economic impact of nanotechnology products. The Technology Administration, responsible for NNI activities, was eliminated in 2007. Prior studies aimed to address the lack of economic analysis in nanotechnology commercialization and innovation metrics. The Department of Commerce lacks formal assessments on the economic impact of nanotechnology products. Reports by the Alliance for Science and Technology Research in America (ASTRA) analyze innovation metrics. Advocates predict millions of new jobs from global nanotechnology investments, emphasizing the need to prepare students for nanotechnology research, engineering, and production roles. Identifying industries likely to create these jobs, required skills, and timelines are key challenges. If workers with nanotechnology-specific skills are scarce domestically, employers may move operations abroad. The NRC recommended better coordination among NNI agencies for nanotechnology education and workforce training. Close coordination among the Departments of Commerce, Education, and Labor could align federal education and training efforts with the labor market for nanotechnology workers. In its assessments, the NRC and PCAST recommended creating a working group on education and workforce development for nanotechnology. PCAST noted that while the US trains the majority of Ph.D. students in nanoscience, many foreign students return to their home countries after completing their education. PCAST recommended the federal government develop a program to provide U.S. Permanent Resident Cards for foreign individuals with advanced degrees in science or engineering from accredited U.S. institutions. They also suggested NNI agencies continue investing in education and training, and NNCO evaluate the outcomes of NNI education investments. The NSET Subcommittee responded to PCAST's Third Assessment recommendations on workforce education and training in nanotechnology. They mentioned NNI agencies contributing to nanotechnology curricula development from grade school to postdoctoral training. NSF is considering supporting a study to evaluate NNI's education investment. NanoEHS issues remain a focus, with concerns about nanoscale particles accumulating in vital organs. Nanoscale particles may accumulate in vital organs, posing harm to humans and animals, while also potentially harming ecosystems. However, nanotechnology offers EHS benefits such as reducing energy consumption, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as providing safety-enhancing materials. Stakeholders agree that addressing concerns about nanoscale materials is crucial for human health, safety, and the environment. The NSET Subcommittee aims to address nanotechnology-related EHS concerns through various approaches, including funding for EHS research, increased coordination of agency research, and a government-wide research strategy. The NRC conducted a review of the Subcommittee's 2008 nanoEHS research strategy, finding it to be effective in communicating federally supported research in this area. The NRC review found that the 2008 nanoEHS research strategy effectively communicated federally supported research but lacked a clear plan, stakeholder input, vision, objectives, and resource estimates. A national strategic plan for nanotechnology-related EHS research is urgently needed to build on current research efforts. The NRC criticized the 2008 NNI document for poorly defined research needs in risk management and exposure assessment, lack of concrete objectives, flawed gap analysis, and unclear priorities for nanotechnology-related research funding. The NRC criticized the 2008 NNI document for poorly defined research needs in risk management and exposure assessment, lack of concrete objectives, flawed gap analysis, and unclear priorities for nanotechnology-related research funding. The federal funding addressing nanotechnology-related EHS issues is less than portrayed in the NNI document and may be inadequate. The NRC called for a national strategic plan, not just a federal government plan, to involve non-governmental stakeholders in research on EHS implications of nanotechnology. The NSET Subcommittee published a strategy in 2011 to address the shortcomings identified by the NRC in the 2008 research strategy. The 2011 strategy identified five core nanoEHS research needs: nanomaterial measurement infrastructure, human exposure assessment, human health, environment, and risk assessment and risk management methods. The NSET Subcommittee set goals, identified needed research, and analyzed ongoing research. The strategy also included a chapter on informatics and modeling for nanoEHS research. In 2012, the NRC published, A Research Strategy for Environmental, Health, and Safety Aspects of Engineered Nanomaterials. The NRC developed an integrated research strategy to address EHS aspects of engineered nanomaterials, highlighting the lack of information for informed policy decisions. The strategy focused on a value-chain perspective, nanomaterial properties' effects on hazard and exposure, and identifying potential risks. PCAST recommended the development of a multidisciplinary nanotechnology environmental, health, and safety ecosystem promoting non-animal based test strategies and multi-stakeholder participation in regulatory decision-making. The distinction between plausible and implausible risks in nanomaterials remains unclear due to a lack of detailed scientific evidence and effective communication of existing evidence. The uncertainty surrounding risks in nanotechnology threatens confidence among investors, businesses, and consumers. Concerns have been raised about the use of engineered nanomaterials in various products, leading to regulatory uncertainty and industry hesitation. The NRC recommended increased funding for nanoEHS research to assess the effects on public health and the environment. The NRC recommended increased funding for nanoEHS research to assess effects on human health and ecosystems, while PCAST's Fourth Assessment praised the progress made by the NNI in addressing potential EHS risks of nanotechnology. The NNI strategy aligns with the 2012 NRC report on nanomaterials, emphasizing the importance of a life cycle approach, more research on human and environmental exposure, better measurement tools, and cross-cutting informatics infrastructure. PCAST raised concerns about the lack of integration between nanotechnology-related EHS research and policymakers' needs. They recommended expanding the NEHI working group's charter to address cross-agency nanotechnology-related policy issues and ensuring closer integration within the NNI. PCAST recommended additional funding for cross-cutting areas of EHS in nanotechnology research, with funding increasing from $37.7 million in FY2006 to $109.9 million in FY2012. President Obama requested $121.1 million for nanoEHS funding in FY2014. Some advocates proposed a separate agency for nanotechnology EHS research, but PCAST found this to be \"misguided\" in their Second Assessment. The Panel on Nanotechnology EHS Research recommended increased funding for cross-cutting areas of EHS in nanotechnology research, with a proposed budget of $121.1 million in FY2014. They found proposals for a separate agency for nanotechnology EHS research to be \"misguided\" and potentially counterproductive. Nanotechnology's societal implications encompass ethical, economic, and legal considerations, with potential breakthroughs in various fields like medicine, environment, and national security. The importance of understanding societal implications of nanotechnology is emphasized by PCAST, recommending NNI to inform the public and address societal issues openly. A strong program in societal implications should have clear focus areas, outcomes, and evaluation plans. The NNI aims to streamline nanotechnology innovation, create new jobs, and boost the economy. Critics raise concerns about ethical, societal, economic, and legal implications of nanotechnology, including risks to health and the environment from nanoscale manufacturing. Nanotechnology poses risks to health and the environment due to small particle size and unique characteristics, leading to increased attention on costs and benefits. Privacy concerns arise from the potential use of nanotechnology in creating sensitive sensors for various applications, raising issues about individual privacy rights. The use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal substances without permission can have implications in law enforcement, insurance, and employment. Nanotechnology is expected to bring economic and societal benefits, with the United States leading in technological advancements in this field. Other nations are also heavily investing in nanotechnology. The National Nanotechnology Initiative has been successful in achieving its objectives but faces challenges in realizing the full potential of nanotechnology. Congress may address these issues during deliberations on reauthorization of the 21st Century Nanotechnology R&D Act. Funding authorizations for the Act extended through FY2008, and subsequent Congresses have considered legislation for reauthorization. If the 114th Congress considers reauthorization, it will need to address the identified issues. If the 114th Congress considers reauthorization of the 21st Century Nanotechnology R&D Act, key issues to consider include budget levels, R&D funding priorities, administration, technology translation, safety concerns, workforce education, public awareness, and international collaboration.
