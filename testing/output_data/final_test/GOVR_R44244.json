    "content": "In the landmark decision Obergefell v. Hodges, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled state bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held that excluding same-sex couples from civil marriage violated their rights under the Due Process Clause, extending to personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy. The U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges ruled state bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, citing the right to marry as protected by the Constitution. The Court recognized the evolving societal perceptions of same-sex relationships and concluded that same-sex couples must be afforded the same marriage rights as opposite-sex couples. The U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges ruled state bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, stating that same-sex couples must have the same marriage rights as opposite-sex couples. The decision was made by a 5-4 vote, with dissenting justices raising objections, including concerns about religious freedom. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, acknowledged that not everyone would accept same-sex marriage, particularly citing religious objectors. The Court emphasized the First Amendment rights of individuals and religious beliefs. The Court emphasized the First Amendment rights of individuals and religious entities to engage in debate regarding same-sex marriage, while also highlighting the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition of unequal treatment of couples. The Establishment Clause protects against government actions endorsing specific religious practices, while the Free Exercise Clause safeguards voluntary religious practices from government interference. The Establishment Clause prohibits government actions endorsing specific religious practices, while the Supreme Court applies various tests to determine violations. The Lemon test requires a secular purpose, non-advancement of religion, and no excessive entanglement. The Free Exercise Clause protects voluntary religious practices from government interference. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment protects against government interference with voluntary religious exercise. In the 1990 decision of Employment Division v. Smith, the Court lowered the standard for government actions infringing on religious exercise. The Court clarified that individuals must still comply with neutral laws, but Congress can consider heightened protection through legislation. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) was enacted in response to a new standard adopted by the Court, applying heightened scrutiny to federal government actions affecting religious exercise. RFRA prohibits substantial burden on religious exercise unless it furthers a compelling governmental interest using the least restrictive means. It has been mainly applied in cases involving individuals and nonprofit religious organizations, with limited interpretation by the Supreme Court. In the landmark 2014 case, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., the Supreme Court interpreted the scope of RFRA's protections to include some corporations. Hobby Lobby, a closely held for-profit corporation, challenged the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive coverage requirement as a burden on their religious exercise. The Court ruled that RFRA requires accommodation for entities owned and controlled by a single family, sparking a debate over the protection of other businesses. The Hobby Lobby decision in 2014 sparked a debate over the future implications of neutral laws affecting religious beliefs. Justice Ginsburg questioned if the decision could allow employers to avoid compliance with government mandates. The majority clarified that the decision only applied to the contraceptive coverage requirement in the case, leaving open the possibility of future challenges under RFRA for other legal mandates. The Hobby Lobby decision in 2014 raised questions about the reach of future RFRA challenges. It is unclear how individuals and businesses can avoid compliance with legal mandates related to same-sex marriage. The decision broadened RFRA's protections but did not clearly define how they can be used. One critical question is what constitutes a substantial burden under RFRA, as it only applies to federal government actions. RFRA applies to federal government actions burdening religious exercise, while state and local protections depend on state law. Many states have enacted their own versions of RFRA to prevent such burdens, with some offering broader protections than the federal RFRA. Indiana's RFRA, for example, applies to individuals, organizations, and businesses, allowing for protection even when religious exercise is likely to be substantially burdened. The recognition of same-sex marriage raises debates on religious freedom and government involvement in marriage officiation. States may have heightened statutory protections or constitutional provisions that offer additional safeguards. Marriage laws allow religious ministers to officiate civil marriages, leading to questions on the impact of same-sex marriage recognition on officiants. The dual role of religious officiants in officiating civil and religious marriages has raised concerns about potential conflicts. The Court's decision in Obergefell emphasizes the right of same-sex couples to civil marriage, without requiring religious marriages to include all couples. Some suggest establishing separate civil and religious marriage institutions to address controversies. Couples could have a civil ceremony for legal benefits and a religious ceremony according to their faith. The potential conflicts arise when considering whether individuals with religious objections to same-sex marriages, such as government employees involved in officiating civil marriages, could be required to do so. While religious officiants have constitutional protections, other individuals may seek legal protection in such situations. The question of whether legal recognition of same-sex marriage would compel faith leaders to officiate ceremonies conflicting with their beliefs is a key issue in the context of religious freedom. A number of states enacted protections to safeguard religious officials and institutions from being forced to officiate marriage ceremonies conflicting with their beliefs. Federal constitutional law also protects religious institutions from government interference in their internal matters, including religious doctrine and ministerial employment. Courts have traditionally avoided deciding on religious doctrine, including which marriages religious authorities can recognize and solemnize. The Supreme Court maintains that courts should not delve into a person's or institution's religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has recognized the right of churches and religious institutions to address their internal matters independently without government interference. Courts have been cautioned against probing into religious authority and doctrine to avoid entanglement in religious practices. In the 1872 case of Watson v. Jones, the Court emphasized that matters of religious doctrine should be determined within the authority of the particular church and separate from secular legal interpretation. The Court's decision in a dispute over leadership of a local Presbyterian church during the post-Civil War era reflected divisions within the church regarding slavery. The case involved a schism in the church, with the Court determining which body should be recognized as the church's official leadership. The Court's decision in a dispute over leadership of a local Presbyterian church post-Civil War era upheld the church's authority in matters of discipline and faith. It recognized the church's right to determine its leaders based on its doctrine and practice, while also acknowledging that civil courts can intervene in cases involving criminal activity or personal disputes. The Watson decision affirmed the independence of churches in ecclesiastical matters, stating that civil courts have no jurisdiction over theological controversies, church discipline, or doctrinal policies. This departure from English precedent emphasized the freedom of religious belief and practice in American political foundations. The Court established the principle of freedom for religious organizations from government control, granting constitutional protection for churches to govern themselves in matters of faith and doctrine. The Court established the principle of freedom for religious organizations from government control, granting constitutional protection for churches to govern themselves in matters of faith and doctrine. The Court has reiterated the limits of the First Amendment on government authority to decide the legitimacy of matters of church internal practices, prohibiting both the legislature and courts from interfering with the free exercise of religion in accordance with church polity and doctrine. The Court affirmed the constitutional right of religious institutions to independence in matters of church doctrine, exempting them from compliance with employment nondiscrimination laws for ministerial employees. The Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause protect a religious group's decision to fire its ministers, extending to all ministerial positions without defined parameters. The Constitution prevents the government from controlling the duties and authority of religious leaders. In the context of same-sex marriage, religious institutions cannot be forced to go against their faith. Civil officials like justices of the peace are not protected in the same way as clergy. Civil servants may object to same-sex marriage based on their beliefs, but their legal protection is limited. Legal protection for civil servants who object to tasks conflicting with their religious beliefs is unclear. While government officials must not show preference for one religion over another, civil servants may still be protected by employment nondiscrimination provisions or specific exemptions. Following the legalization of same-sex marriage, some public officials have objected to their role in performing same-sex marriages. In Florida, some clerks refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but a federal judge ruled the state's marriage laws unconstitutional. Clerks were instructed to issue licenses to all qualified couples, regardless of personal beliefs. In Alabama, the Chief Justice ordered probate judges not to recognize same-sex marriages despite a federal court striking down the state's ban. The Chief Justice of Alabama ordered probate judges not to recognize same-sex marriages despite a federal court striking down the state's ban. The federal court issued an injunctive order barring state officials from refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Alabama Supreme Court's legal reasoning was deemed moot after the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell. States must comply with decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. Following the Obergefell decision, a county clerk in Kentucky refused to issue marriage licenses to any couple due to religious objections. Lawsuits were filed challenging the clerk's actions, leading to her being held in contempt of court and ordered to issue licenses. The Kentucky county clerk's refusal to issue marriage licenses due to religious objections led to legal challenges regarding government employees asserting their religious freedom rights. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees with religious objections to their job duties, prohibiting employers from discriminating based on religion. The government must accommodate an employee's religious observance or practice unless it causes undue hardship. Title VII protects employees with religious objections and requires employers to find a reasonable alternative. The accommodation offered does not have to be the most reasonable one. The accommodation offered to an employee does not have to be the most reasonable one, the one requested by the employee, or the one that imposes the least burden. Evaluation of reasonable accommodations and undue burden are made on a case-by-case basis. Lawsuits have been filed asserting protection under Title VII for religious objections to job duties involving same-sex couples. In one pending case, an employee in an Indiana county clerk's office cited religious objections to processing paperwork related to same-sex marriages. Prior to federal recognition of same-sex marriage, employees in county clerk's offices faced termination for religious objections to processing paperwork for same-sex couples. Accommodations were offered, but employees were still terminated for their objections. The courts found that efforts to accommodate were insufficient. The court found that the county did not adequately accommodate an employee with religious objections, leading to her termination. Despite the employee offering to take on additional duties and the office not exploring other accommodation options, the county argued it had no choice but to terminate her. The court disagreed, citing previous cases where employees with religious objections were accommodated by referring customers to non-objecting employees. The court also noted that the workload related to the registrations in question was unevenly distributed and that the office continued processing applications even after the employee's termination. The court found that the office continued processing applications even after the objecting employee's termination. To address conflicts with state officials having religious objections to same-sex marriage, conscience protections could allow officials to opt out of marriage-related duties, as seen in Texas and North Carolina. Officials retain the right to object to duties involving same-sex marriages, with accommodations evaluated case-by-case. The opinion emphasized evaluating objections and accommodations on a case-by-case basis, citing federal and state nondiscrimination laws and RFRA as applicable provisions. North Carolina passed legislation allowing officials with religious objections to same-sex marriage to recuse themselves from performing marriages, effective for at least six months. The law allows officials to recuse themselves from performing marriages due to religious objections, with the state providing another official for the task. Congress may not directly regulate state officials' duties regarding marriage, but has protected conscientious objections in other legal matters. Federal conscience protections, such as those related to abortion, have been linked to federal funding. Federal conscience clauses require employers to accommodate employees who refuse to participate in certain reproductive procedures to continue receiving federal funding. These clauses are linked to various funding programs, such as the Church Amendment and the Weldon Amendment, which prohibit discrimination based on employees' refusal on religious or moral grounds. The Weldon Amendment prohibits discrimination in health care entities based on refusal to provide abortions. Federal legislation could provide similar protections for religious objections to same-sex marriage, differing from Title VII accommodations. The Obergefell decision prohibits discrimination against same-sex couples seeking to marry, but does not provide general Fourteenth Amendment protection based on sexual orientation. Private parties are not dictated in their behavior. A conscience clause could potentially balance conflicting interests in practice. Through civil rights legislation, governments can regulate private entities that provide public accommodations, housing, employment, or credit. While federal law does not explicitly protect based on sexual orientation, some states and local governments have enacted such protections, leading to legal challenges from those with religious objections. Entities with religious objections may seek legal protection under state religious freedom laws, claiming that nondiscrimination laws are a substantial burden. Some states have enacted laws similar to RFRA, addressing claims of substantial burden on nondiscrimination laws. The balance between freedom of religion and nondiscrimination requirements has been explored in Supreme Court cases like Bob Jones University v. United States. The Supreme Court case Bob Jones University challenged the school's tax-exempt status due to its prohibition on interracial dating and marriage, despite allowing admission of black students. The Court rejected the school's defense based on First Amendment rights, emphasizing the government's interest in eliminating racial discrimination in education. The Supreme Court upheld the government's interest in eliminating racial discrimination over First Amendment religious exercise claims. It found the government's interest compelling, allowing enforcement of nondiscrimination protections even if they conflicted with religious exercise rights. The Court also considered cases involving civic organizations like the Jaycees and Boy Scouts being compelled to admit members under nondiscrimination laws. The Supreme Court upheld the government's interest in eliminating discrimination in civic organizations like the Jaycees and Boy Scouts. The Court found that the right to associate is not absolute and must be balanced against the government's interest in regulating discriminatory practices. It determined that the government had a compelling interest in offering equal access to services provided by these organizations. The Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts' First Amendment right to free association outweighed the government's interest in enforcing nondiscrimination laws based on sexual orientation. This decision came as states began recognizing same-sex relationships, leading to legal challenges from individuals and organizations with religious objections to serving such couples. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the government's authority to impose requirements on business owners with religious objections to certain mandates. Hobby Lobby has shown that business owners retain legal rights related to their religious beliefs while engaging in commercial activities. Discrimination cases based on same-sex orientation have arisen in various contexts. In a 2008 case, the California Supreme Court ruled that physicians with religious objections to same-sex couples could not claim constitutional religious exemption from the state's civil rights law, which prohibits sexual orientation discrimination. A same-sex couple sought fertility treatment from a medical office where some doctors had objections, but other doctors in the practice were available to provide treatment. The California Supreme Court ruled that physicians with religious objections to same-sex couples could not claim constitutional religious exemption from the state's civil rights law. The court stated that doctors could avoid conflict with the law by limiting their practice to procedures they would perform for any patient or ensuring a non-objecting physician was available. The court ruled that a physician's religious objections to treating a same-sex patient could not exempt them from providing necessary treatment. The state had a compelling interest in ensuring access to medical care regardless of sexual orientation, and no less restrictive means were available. Challenges have also been seen in business owners' objections to serving same-sex couples for wedding celebrations. The New Jersey Division on Civil Rights upheld a ruling that a boardwalk pavilion must allow same-sex civil union ceremonies, citing state nondiscrimination laws. Similar challenges in other states have resulted in courts rejecting religious freedom claims of businesses refusing service to gay couples. A Colorado court ruled against a bakery claiming exemption from nondiscrimination laws for refusing to serve same-sex couples based on religious objections. While challenges under the Smith standard have favored same-sex couples, some businesses have used RFRA in defense. The Supreme Court of New Mexico found a wedding photography business in violation of public accommodations laws for refusing to serve a same-sex couple. The Colorado court ruled against a bakery that refused to serve a same-sex couple based on religious objections, stating that the business could not assert protection under the state RFRA. The court rejected the argument that the business's religious objections should exempt it from serving same-sex couples, holding that the public accommodations law was neutral and generally applicable. The court also found that the company's First Amendment rights were not infringed. The court declined to apply the state RFRA to a neutral law of general applicability, stating it only applied to government actions and cases where the government was a party. The Hobby Lobby decision clarified that owners of for-profit businesses can claim religious freedom protections under the federal RFRA. Many states have similar RFRAs that could also protect such entities. State versions of RFRA have tried to address concerns about limits to religious freedom protections, as seen in the New Mexico photography case. Arizona amended its RFRA to clarify that the government wouldn't need to be involved in RFRA lawsuits, but the governor vetoed the bill due to potential unintended consequences and opposition from businesses. States proposing broader RFRA language faced controversy in 2015 due to opposition from businesses. The Hobby Lobby decision raised questions about using RFRA to exempt businesses from nondiscrimination mandates. The Supreme Court's decision on RFRA did not provide a shield for businesses to engage in racially discriminatory hiring practices. The Court emphasized the government's compelling interest in equal opportunity in the workforce regardless of race. The decision did not address sexual orientation discrimination specifically and highlighted the case-by-case evaluation of heightened protection. The Supreme Court's decision on RFRA emphasized the case-by-case evaluation of heightened protection, indicating that RFRA protections may not supersede civil rights protections. Concerns about religious objections to same-sex marriage have also arisen in government funding programs for private entities with religious objections. Public funding to religious entities raises constitutional questions, with funding generally permitted under certain circumstances. Questions about implications for religious service providers who object to same-sex marriages have mainly surfaced in adoption services. The debate over religious objections to same-sex marriages in adoption services has raised questions about whether entities receiving public funds can refuse to serve same-sex couples. While Obergefell requires states to recognize same-sex marriages, it did not address the recognition of same-sex couples as potential foster or adoptive parents. States have varying laws regulating adoption, including restrictions based on the sexual orientation of potential parents. Laws regulating adoption, including limitations based on sexual orientation or marital status, have raised objections from religious entities. Federal funding can impact the adoption process through Congress's authority to condition the use of funds for child welfare agencies. Following Obergefell, questions have been raised about whether adoption services providers must consider placing children with same-sex couples. Federal law currently does not require nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation for adoption services funding. It is unlikely that federal law would require religious entities to place children with same-sex couples for adoption. State laws or conditions on state funds may impose such requirements. Congress may consider legislation to address concerns about discrimination against same-sex couples in adoption or burdens on religious service providers. Previous legislation has addressed similar concerns in the context of faith-based funding rules. The conscience clause model may be used to protect entities with religious objections to certain practices when receiving federal funds. The balancing of rights between religious organizations and beneficiaries in faith-based funding for same-sex adoptions has been addressed by Congress through protections for providers' religious identity and beneficiaries' rights. Controversial participation of faith-based providers in publicly funded programs is authorized by legislation with provisions to address potential constitutional issues. The participation in faith-based funding includes provisions to protect the religious independence of organizations receiving federal funds. Religious entities can maintain control over their religious beliefs and practices, and cannot be forced to change their governance or remove religious symbols. Some programs offer alternative providers for beneficiaries who object to the religious nature of the organization. Religious service providers are prohibited from discrimination. The current provisions in existing statutory programs protect the religious identity of organizations and the religious freedom of beneficiaries. If Congress adopted statutory nondiscrimination requirements for adoption services funding, the balance of rights between religious providers and potential same-sex parents would be a matter of congressional discretion. The ban on discrimination against beneficiaries based on religion is unclear. The prohibition on discrimination based on religion in adoption services funding is ambiguous. It could mean service providers can't only serve co-religionists or extend services to same-sex beneficiaries, potentially infringing on religious identity. The issue of religious freedom protections in adoption services funding is complex and novel. It may involve balancing the rights of religious organizations with civil rights, similar to the Bob Jones University case. Congress could consider a federal conscience clause to protect religious objections to placing children with same-sex couples. Federal conscience clauses could protect religious objectors in adoption services funding by conditioning federal funding on nondiscrimination based on religion. This would incentivize inclusion of religiously affiliated adoption agencies while balancing the interests of same-sex adoptive parents. Agencies that force religious adoption agencies to place children with same-sex couples would risk losing federal funds. In federal funding for adoption services, agencies with objections must provide alternative options for couples they cannot serve. Existing models of conscience clauses do not include a right of action for individuals, but Congress could add one in the future. Religious entities with objections are typically required to notify beneficiaries of alternative providers. Congress may ensure availability of alternative service providers for beneficiaries that religiously affiliated agencies object to serving. For example, if protections allow religious providers to refuse placing children with certain couples, alternative providers must be available. If religious providers are allowed to refuse placing children with certain couples, it could impact the availability of services for those couples, especially if there are limited alternative providers. For instance, Catholic Charities in Illinois handles 20% of adoption and foster care services, so if they withdrew due to religious objections, it would increase the workload for other agencies. This could have repercussions for the program as a whole. The potential issue raised is whether churches and religious entities could lose federal tax-exempt status for opposing same-sex marriage. Churches and religious organizations qualify for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The \"illegality doctrine\" is a condition for organizations to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions under IRC Section 170 and Section 501(c)(3) status. It prohibits engaging in illegal activities or violating fundamental public policy. The Supreme Court has established this doctrine as an implicit condition for charitable trusts. There is controversy over applying this doctrine to churches opposing same-sex marriage. The report analyzes potential violations of First Amendment rights if religious organizations are denied Section 501(c)(3) status based on their religious beliefs. The illegality doctrine is a condition for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3), prohibiting illegal activities or violations of public policy. The question arises whether denying tax-exempt status to religious entities based on their beliefs violates the First Amendment, as discussed in the Bob Jones University case. In Bob Jones University v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld the IRS's revocation of a private religious school's tax-exempt status for racially discriminatory practices, stating it did not violate the First Amendment. The Court found that the government can justify burdening religion to achieve a compelling interest, such as eradicating racial discrimination in education. The Supreme Court upheld the IRS's revocation of a religious school's tax-exempt status for racial discrimination, citing the government's compelling interest in eradicating such practices. The Court rejected the school's argument that the policy violated its rights under the Establishment Clause, stating it was based on neutral criteria. The extent of First Amendment analysis in this context regarding churches and houses of worship remains unclear. The Supreme Court upheld the IRS's revocation of a religious school's tax-exempt status for racial discrimination, citing the government's interest in eradicating such practices. It is unclear how the illegality doctrine applies to churches acting on religious beliefs. The analysis post-Bob Jones case is uncertain regarding denial of tax-exempt status for religious entities opposing same-sex marriage. The illegality doctrine raises issues for Section 501(c)(3) organizations opposing same-sex marriage, questioning if their actions violate laws triggering the doctrine's application. The Supreme Court has stated that the doctrine applies only if there is no doubt the organization's activity is contrary to law. The Supreme Court has stated that the illegality doctrine applies only if there is \"no doubt\" the organization's activity is contrary to a fundamental public policy. In Bob Jones, the Court found that racially discriminatory practices violated a well-established national public policy against racial discrimination in education, supported by actions from all three branches of the federal government. It is unclear if a similar well-established public policy exists in the current context. It is not clear if a well-established public policy exists to justify denying Section 501(c)(3) status to an organization opposing same-sex marriage. Unlike Bob Jones, where racial discrimination in education was clearly prohibited by decades of governmental actions, there is minimal analogous governmental support for same-sex marriage. Recent Supreme Court cases like Obergefell and Windsor have addressed same-sex marriage, but their implications are still evolving. Congress has not taken significant legislative action in this area comparable to laws prohibiting racial discrimination. In July 2015, IRS Commissioner Koskinen stated that the IRS would not revoke tax-exempt status of religious entities opposing same-sex marriage due to lack of public policy support for revocation under the illegality doctrine. However, the IRS may revisit the issue in the future based on legal and policy developments, as public policy can change over time. This stance is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Bob Jones, where behavior once deemed acceptable later violated the illegality doctrine. The IRS, as explained by Commissioner Koskinen, will not revoke tax-exempt status of religious entities opposing same-sex marriage for now. The IRS's role is to determine if a public policy exists to justify denial of tax-exempt status under the illegality doctrine. Any future action by the IRS would involve public notice and opportunity to comment, with potential review by Congress and the courts. The IRS determined the illegality doctrine was triggered for private schools engaging in racially discriminatory practices, leading to the Bob Jones case. A court case brought by black families in Mississippi challenging tax-exempt status for discriminatory private schools played a pivotal role. Prior to 1970, the IRS allowed private schools to qualify for tax-exempt status without considering their racial admissions policies. In response to a court case in Mississippi challenging tax-exempt status for racially discriminatory private schools, the IRS issued a news release stating it could no longer justify tax-exempt status for such schools. The court permanently enjoined the IRS from granting tax-exempt status to any Mississippi school without a nondiscrimination policy, leading to a nationwide policy for denying tax-exempt status to private schools engaging in racial discrimination. This could impact similar cases in the same-sex marriage context due to the requirement of establishing personal injury by allegedly unlawful conduct for constitutional standing. The Court's standing requirement limits third parties challenging IRS tax-exempt status policies. Violating a law doesn't automatically revoke tax-exempt status; justification is needed based on the organization's actions. The key question is whether an organization should still be tax-exempt despite impermissible actions. The IRS may revoke tax-exempt status for organizations engaging in substantial impermissible activities, but the threshold for substantiality is unclear. The illegality doctrine is an implicit condition for tax-exempt status and eligibility for charitable deductions. Congress could potentially amend statutes to affect the doctrine's applicability. Legislation could address the doctrine's application generally or only in the same-sex marriage context, consistent with the Constitution. An issue could arise if providing tax-exempt status to discriminatory institutions violates constitutional protections for same-sex couples or LGBT individuals. For example, in Bob Jones, denial of tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory schools was argued to be required by the Fifth Amendment's equal protection guarantees. The Court's holding in Bob Jones denied tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory schools under the illegality doctrine. If the denial was based on the Fifth Amendment, Congress could not amend the IRC for discriminatory schools without violating constitutional rights. Legislative actions affecting same-sex couples could impact the application of the illegality doctrine. The approach may suggest that there is no current public policy in place to protect certain rights."
