The United Houma Nation has an unbroken tribal existence dating back to time immemorial. Recorded history of the tribe begins in 1682 when they were encountered by explorer Robert Cavalier, Sieur de La Salle. By 1706, the tribe migrated south to be closer to their French allies.

The United Houma Nation sought refuge in southern Louisiana after the Louisiana Territory was acquired in 1803, where they continued their tribal existence.
