    "content": "The Act titled \"Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act of 2011\" limits liability for volunteer health care professionals under the Public Health Service Act by inserting a new section 224A. The \"Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act of 2011\" limits liability for volunteer health care professionals during disasters, except for willful misconduct or gross negligence. The \"Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act of 2011\" limits liability for volunteer health care professionals during disasters, except for willful misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or rendering services under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In civil actions, the burden of proof falls on the plaintiff to show the limitation does not apply. This section preempts state laws inconsistent with its provisions. The section provides additional protections for volunteer health care professionals during disasters, preempting state laws that are inconsistent unless they offer greater liability protection. Definitions include what constitutes a disaster and the broad scope of harm. The term 'volunteer' in this context refers to a health care professional who does not receive compensation exceeding $500 per year for their services. The term 'compensation' includes payment from insurance or health plans, federal or state health benefits programs, but excludes reimbursement for expenses, paid leave, and items for volunteer health services. The Act and its amendment will take effect 90 days after enactment. This Act applies to claims for harm caused by healthcare professionals filed after its effective date, only if the harm or conduct occurred after that date."
