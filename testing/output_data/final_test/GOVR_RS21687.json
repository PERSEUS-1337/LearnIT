    "content": "Ecuador, slightly smaller than Nevada, with a population of 13.8 million, has lost 61% of its land area due to border conflicts. Its strategic location between drug-producing countries Colombia and Peru is important to the United States. The country is geographically and ethnically diverse, with a history of democratic rule. However, poverty affects 40% of the population. Past political and economic crises have seen presidents removed from office, such as Abdala Bucaram in 1997 and Jamil Mahuad in 2000. Ecuador has a history of democratic rule but has faced political and economic crises, with presidents like Jamil Mahuad being ousted in 2000. Lucio Gutierrez was removed from office in 2005 after attempting to replace judges with his allies. Regionalism and personalism have long defined Ecuadorian politics, with Quito and Guayaquil vying for dominance. Ethnic and class divisions have fueled the development of political parties as electoral machines. Since the return to democracy in 1979, Ecuador has experienced party splits, corruption, and economic deterioration. Voters blame incumbents for their troubles, leading to support for populist, anti-party candidates like Correa. This trend has resulted in presidents unable to complete their terms and inconsistent economic policies. The country's economy is weak, poorly regulated, and overly dependent on a few export commodities with volatile prices. In 1998, El Ni\u00f1o rains, white spot disease in the shrimp industry, and plunging oil prices caused a disastrous economic crisis in 1999-2000. Ecuador faced a severe economic crisis in 1999-2000, leading to dollarization to combat hyperinflation. While dollarization helped stabilize the economy, it limited the government's monetary policy independence. Efforts to diversify the economy and promote investment faced challenges, with popular protests against austerity measures. Despite some economic growth in 2004, fiscal discipline issues persisted. Ecuador's economy faces challenges due to low oil prices, weak U.S. dollar, and lack of fiscal discipline. President Rafael Correa, an economist, took office in 2007 after winning the election with 57% of the vote. President Correa, elected in 2007 with 57% of the vote, enjoys high approval ratings halfway through his term. He has implemented political reforms, increased social spending, and asserted government control over Ecuador's economy and territory. Correa's condemnation of Colombia's 2008 raid and decision not to renew the U.S. lease on the air force base at Manta have strained relations. While popular among Ecuadorians, his economic policies have worried foreign investors, leading to a decline in foreign direct investment. President Correa's government may default on part of its $10 billion foreign debt due to declining oil revenues. He successfully enacted constitutional reform through a referendum, leading to the formation of a new Constituent Assembly in 2007. Correa's party, \"Alianza Pais,\" won 80 out of 130 seats in the Assembly, which convened on November 29, 2007. The Constituent Assembly in Ecuador, formed in 2007, closed the Congress and increased the president's power. The new constitution was approved by 64% of voters in 2008, aiming to combat corruption. Critics are concerned about the strong presidential system and the legitimacy of the transitional assembly. Oil is crucial to Ecuador's economy, accounting for over 50% of exports. Production by the state-owned oil company, Petroecuador, has declined by 50% in the last decade, leading to a financial crisis. President Correa aims to increase state control over the energy sector, with a decree in 2007 raising the state's share of oil revenues to 99%. President Correa pushed for foreign oil companies to switch to service contracts controlled by Petroecuador, shortening the transition period from two years to six months. Three companies signed interim agreements by November 2008. Private companies face challenges investing in Ecuador's oil industry due to instability. Correa supported terminating a contract with Occidental Petroleum in 2006. In March 2008, the Colombian military bombed a FARC camp in Ecuador. In a military operation, Colombia bombed a FARC camp in Ecuador, killing 25 people including Ra\u00fal Reyes, the group's second-in-command. Laptops seized from the camp implicated Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in funding FARC and Ecuador's President Correa in receiving campaign donations. This led to a diplomatic crisis with Ecuador and Venezuela breaking ties with Colombia. President Ch\u00e1vez broke ties with Colombia and sent troops to Venezuela's border with Colombia in solidarity with Ecuador. Concerns of military conflict were alleviated after a summit where President Uribe apologized for the incursion. The Rio Group resolution rejected Colombia's actions but acknowledged Uribe's apology. The Organization of American States resolution called for the restoration of diplomatic ties between Ecuador and Colombia, which have yet to be restored. Ecuador has not restored diplomatic relations with Colombia after the border crisis. The Correa government in Ecuador has strengthened ties with the Ch\u00e1vez government in Venezuela. Relations between Ecuador and the United States have been strained, with free trade agreement negotiations suspended indefinitely. U.S. officials are concerned about Correa's populist tendencies and state-centered economic policies. Analysts suggest using pragmatic means to encourage open-market and democratic policies in Ecuador. Ecuador's relationship with the United States has been strained, with trade preferences being questioned due to hostile actions against U.S. companies. President Correa's decision not to renew the lease on the U.S. air base at Manta may impact counternarcotics cooperation. The U.S. had previously signed a 10-year agreement with Ecuador for a forward operating location for counter-drug operations. President Correa confirmed that Ecuador will not renew the lease on the U.S. air base at Manta when it expires in 2009. He has opposed involvement in Plan Colombia and Colombia's incursions into Ecuadorian territory. The U.S. is the largest bilateral donor in Ecuador, providing assistance for democracy, poverty reduction, environmental protection, and border security with Colombia. Ecuador received $32 million in U.S. aid in FY2008, including $9.1 million for counternarcotics. The FY2009 request was for $32.5 million, with $13.4 million for counternarcotics. The U.S. is Ecuador's main trading partner. Since joining the WTO in 1996, Ecuador has reduced its average tariff rate from 30% to 13%. The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) has provided trade preferences for Ecuador, benefiting goods like seafood and cut flowers. The ATPA was expanded by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA). Oil remains a dominant export, with machinery and plastics being top U.S. exports to Ecuador. The U.S. is Ecuador's main trading partner, with 45% of Ecuadorian exports going to the U.S. The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) extended preferential trade benefits to Ecuador until December 31, 2006, including textiles, petroleum, and tuna. Congress has favored short-term extensions of ATPA, with Ecuador estimating potential job losses and trade impact without ATPA. Some Members of Congress support continuing ATPA benefits regardless of a country's stance on FTAs, while others oppose extending benefits for Bolivia and Ecuador. The 110th Congress extended ATPA trade preferences until December 31, 2009 for Colombia and Peru, and until June 30, 2009 for Bolivia and Ecuador. Bolivia's preferences depend on meeting eligibility criteria, while Ecuador's preferences are automatically extended unless eligibility criteria are violated."
