    "content": "The gap between U.S. coal supply and domestic demand may widen due to the attractiveness of low-cost natural gas and uncertainties with new environmental regulations. Coal producers may look to expand their market abroad, leading to an expected rise in U.S. coal exports in the long run. However, in the near term, coal exports are projected to decline. Potential growth in Asian coal markets faces challenges such as lack of infrastructure, rising regulation costs, competition from other fuels, and transportation issues. Limits on natural gas supply could increase domestic coal prices and impact exports. The U.S. coal supply may increase domestic prices and reduce exports, despite a global rise in coal use. U.S. coal consumption and production declined, but exports increased. The EIA predicts a 50% rise in coal exports by 2040, potentially improving the trade balance. However, exporting coal conflicts with domestic environmental policies on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. coal supply may increase domestic prices and reduce exports, despite a global rise in coal use. Current and projected coal exports, issues associated with infrastructure, and the environment have prompted interest by Congress. Bills were introduced in the 112 th Congress that supported increased coal exports and sought to limit exports. Coal export-related issues that have raised congressional concern include carbon emissions abroad, coal dust from rail transport, infrastructure development, and federal coal valuation for royalty purposes. Global production, consumption, and trading of coal have increased over the last decade and are projected to continue growing. According to the IEA's Coal Medium-Term Market Report 2012, worldwide coal was the fastest-growing source of primary energy in 2011. Coal consumption is projected to surpass oil and natural gas in the next five years, reaching parity with oil as the most used fuel source globally. China saw a significant increase in coal production, accounting for about 50% of global production in 2011. Other countries such as Colombia, Indonesia, and India also experienced notable production increases since 2002. Global coal production more than tripled, with Australia increasing production by 26%. The top five coal producers in 2010 accounted for 18% of world production, with the top 30 firms producing 40%. The United States, Russia, and China hold 59% of the world's coal reserves, with the top five countries holding 75% of recoverable reserves. Global coal consumption has been steadily rising due to increasing electricity demand, with China leading the growth in coal consumption for its expanding electricity generation sector. The global coal market in 2011 was over 3,700 Mtoe or 8.2 billion short tons, with China dominating the market. The IEA projects that coal use will be on par with oil as the top fuel in the world's energy mix by 2017. China dominates the global coal market with roughly 5% growth rate, accounting for almost half of global coal consumption in 2011. The country shifted from being a net coal exporter to a net importer, becoming the world's second-largest importer. International coal trade is limited compared to oil and natural gas. Global coal trade is significant, with 15% of world production being traded. China, the United States, and India are the largest consumers and producers of coal. Other major coal exporters include Indonesia, Australia, Russia, and Colombia. The United States, Australia, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, and Colombia are among the top coal exporting countries, while Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, India, and Germany are the top importing countries. China has transitioned from a net exporter to a net importer of coal. China became the second-largest coal importer in 2009, surpassing Japan in 2012. Coal prices peaked in 2008, then fell sharply with the global economy. As prices rebounded in 2009, the gap between U.S. coal prices and international prices widened. The additional demand for U.S. coal in the global market is expected to raise domestic prices and contribute low-cost coal to the world market. The United States has been exporting coal since the late 1800s, with coal exports rising over 200% from 2003 to 2012. U.S. coal exports were aided by a drop in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, leading to an increase in exports since 2009. Exports of both metallurgical coal and thermal coal have been on the rise, with a significant increase in both types since 2009. Since 2009, U.S. coal exports have increased significantly, with a rise of almost 87% and 73% for metallurgical and thermal coal, respectively. In 2011, U.S. coal exports surpassed 100 MST for the first time since 1992, reaching 126 MST in 2012. The value of U.S. coal exports also saw an increase, going from under $10 billion in 2010 to almost $16 billion in 2011. West Virginia accounted for the largest portion of U.S. coal exports, with Appalachian region coal exports growing by almost 70% since 2007. Other key exporters from the Appalachian region include Pennsylvania and Virginia, while Western states, led by Montana, comprised the second-largest share of exports in 2011. The Interior region saw the greatest percentage increase in coal exports, rising from 1.5 MST to 7.7 MST. U.S. coal exports have been on the rise since 2009 due to factors like lower natural gas prices. Coal and natural gas compete in electricity generation, with natural gas prices dipping below coal prices in 2012. This shift has altered the industry's dynamics, with coal and natural gas reaching parity in electricity generation for the first time in April 2012. Electricity generation accounts for 93% of coal consumption, with a decrease in coal generation leading to lower coal prices compared to international markets. The trend of decreasing gas prices is expected to further reduce coal's competitiveness in the U.S. market for electric power generation. To maintain production levels, coal companies are increasingly looking to foreign markets and exports. In 2011, 107 MST of coal were exported, with 54 MST going to Europe and 28 MST to Asia, including South Korea, Japan, and China. Metallurgical coal exports increased to 70 MST in 2011, while steam coal exports reached 38 MST. Metallurgical coal, used in steel production, is mainly produced in Appalachia. Metallurgical coal, mainly produced in Appalachia, is used to make coke for steel production. Most U.S. coal exports pass through Mid-Atlantic ports like Norfolk, VA, and Baltimore, MD. Norfolk handles nearly 40% of exports, with 34 MST of 41 MST being metallurgical coal. Western coal exports are 7.4 MST, with Seattle, WA, customs district handling nearly 5 MST. Metallurgical coal's higher energy content makes it attractive for longer distance shipping, and global demand has increased due to economic growth in emerging markets. Global demand for metallurgical coal has surged due to economic growth in emerging markets, particularly in China. Metallurgical coal accounts for 14% of global coal consumption but over 30% of international coal trade. The United States is looking to increase its coal exports significantly, with proposed export terminal projects potentially doubling current exports. Projects in the Pacific Northwest are receiving the most attention for potential export growth. The Gulf Coast export facilities are poised to expand capacity and increase exports. The EIA projects a steady rise in U.S. coal exports from 2013 to 2038, with a 50% growth. There is a growing interest in exporting Powder River Basin (PRB) coal due to its low production costs and large reserves. However, PRB coal has higher moisture content and lower energy content, making it more expensive to transport. PRB coal from the Powder River Basin is mainly used for electric power generation in the United States due to its low sulfur content. Most of the coal stays within the country, with less than 1% exported in 2010. However, exports have increased in 2011 as total U.S. exports have risen significantly, with 95% of PRB coal distributed around the U.S. for electric generation. PRB coal, mainly used for electric generation in the United States, has been distributed around the country. While its low sulfur content helps meet EPA regulations, new regulations may reduce domestic demand. Canadian export terminals are at capacity, prompting PRB coal producers to seek a domestic export link to the Asian market through the Pacific Northwest. Three port terminal projects in Washington and Oregon have permit applications pending. Several port terminal projects in Washington and Oregon, including Gateway Pacific Terminal (GPT), Millennium Bulk Terminal (MBT), and Coyote Island Terminal (CIT), have permit applications pending with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Gulf Coast may be a more feasible option for coal export capacity due to existing infrastructure and less opposition. Over 40 million short tons of expansions and new projects are expected to be evaluated in the next five years, focusing on Illinois Basin coal (IB) and Powder River Basin (PRB) coal. Transporting IB coal by barge to Gulf export terminals, particularly New Orleans, is being considered. The Illinois Basin (IB) coal production is increasing, with exports rising to the UK, Netherlands, and China. Despite high sulfur content, IB coal is cost competitive internationally. Exports from Illinois doubled from 2010 to 2011, reaching 2.5 million tons. Transporting IB coal by barge to Gulf export terminals, especially New Orleans, is a cheaper option compared to rail transport to the coasts. Coal exports from Illinois doubled from 2.5 million tons in 2010 to 5 million tons in 2011. The shift in demand towards low-cost, high-sulfur coal from the Illinois Basin led to increased domestic demand. Producers in the Illinois Basin were less affected by low natural gas prices due to their low-cost coal and modern pollution control equipment. Appalachian coal exports dominated U.S. coal exports in 2010 and 2011, but production in West Virginia has declined. Appalachian coal exports have grown almost 70% in absolute terms over the last five years, with West Virginia leading production. Pennsylvania and Virginia also saw increases of 169% and 65% in coal exports, respectively. Multiple projects are being reviewed to expand East Coast export capacity for Appalachian coal, with most companies opting to expand existing terminals due to lower costs and fewer regulatory requirements. Rail and barge are the most economical means of transporting coal for export due to its low value-to-weight ratio and long distances typically required for movement from mine to port. The transportation of coal for export from the East Coast involves using barges and trains. Barges can hold up to 1,570 tons of coal, with 15 barges often tied together in a tow for a total of 23,550 tons. In areas with no locks, like the Mississippi River below St. Louis, 30 to 40 barges can be towed together. Rail transport from mid-Atlantic mines to Norfolk, VA, is a common pathway for U.S. coal exports, with other pathways including movement of coal from Alabama to Mobile, barge transport of Midwest and Ohio Valley coal to Mississippi River Delta ports, and rail transport of Pennsylvania coal to Baltimore. Some U.S. coal is also exported from Ohio across the Great Lakes to Canada. Some U.S. coal is exported from Ohio across the Great Lakes to Canada and Western U.S. coal is shipped by rail to Duluth, MN, and then through the Great Lakes to Quebec for export to Europe. PRB coal could potentially be exported to China, Japan, or Korea through ports in Washington, Oregon, or British Columbia. Most PRB coal currently moves east or south by railroad, with a small fraction going to Washington, Oregon, Vancouver, and Prince Rupert, BC for export. Coal trains, although slower and less time-sensitive, can be cumbersome to move to sidings due to their weight and can interfere with other traffic. Coal terminals at California ports like Richmond, Stockton, and Los Angeles are also used for coal transport. Coal terminals at California ports like Richmond, Stockton, Los Angeles, and Long Beach can export coal from western mines to Asia. PRB coal could be exported to China, Japan, or Korea through Texas ports or Mississippi River Delta ports. Gulf ports offer flexibility in coal sourcing and destination markets. Charleston, SC, and Philadelphia, PA could also serve as conduits for Appalachian coal exports. Rail freight rates are negotiated between shippers and railroads in confidential contracts, which may include discounts or penalties. Governments have limited influence over the cargo railroads carry. Approval by the federal Surface Transportation Board is required for new railroad construction or mergers, not for improvements to existing lines. The Powder River Basin (PRB) is the nation's largest source of coal, with Union Pacific and BNSF Railroads sharing a joint line to transport coal. Two derailments in 2005 caused by ballast deterioration and coal dust interruptions led to extensive repairs and upgrades on the line. Railroads are now shaping coal more uniformly to prevent coal dust from blowing off during transit. The railroads and coal shippers are disputing who should pay for measures to shape coal more uniformly when loading and applying a sealant. Plans for a new railroad line into the PRB are under review. Barge operators are concerned about the reliability of locks due to increased maintenance costs. Funding for lock maintenance, partially offset by a federal fuel tax, is insufficient and could worsen with decreased coal demand. The insufficiency of funds from the fuel tax could worsen with a decline in coal demand. Congress is exploring financing options for inland waterway infrastructure, with most U.S. coal shipped in Panamax vessels limited by Panama Canal locks. Some coal is loaded onto smaller Capesize vessels with drafts up to 50 feet. The expansion of the Panama Canal is also mentioned. The expansion of the Panama Canal in early 2015 will allow smaller Capesize vessels with 50-foot drafts to pass through, but many U.S. ports and foreign unloading ports have insufficient depth to handle this type of ship. Only Puget Sound and Los Angeles area terminals have the depths to handle large Capesize vessels. Table 5 lists the depths of ports that currently export coal or have been mentioned as possibly handling coal in the future. Congress is debating funding for harbor maintenance as most ports require regular dredging. Port development is mainly governed by local port authorities, not the federal government. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for dredging shipping fairways and maintaining breakwaters and jetties. The development of port infrastructure, including dredging and terminal facilities, is funded through various sources such as the General Treasury, ad valorem taxes, and private industry. Shipping rates in the dry bulk sector are volatile due to global supply and demand conditions, with new vessel construction leading to potential oversupply or shortage situations. Dry bulk vessels, favored by new shipyards in boom years, are versatile across commodities. Coal competes for vessel capacity with various goods. Fluctuations in dry bulk rates affect U.S. coal price competitiveness. Rates have declined but show potential for an upswing. Stakeholders along coal transport corridors have raised concerns. Opponents in Washington and Oregon, along with industry and environmental groups, have raised concerns about port terminal projects for increased PRB coal exports in the Pacific Northwest. Environmental groups have filed a lawsuit against BNSF Railway Company and coal companies under the Clean Water Act. Project supporters argue for job creation and increased tax revenue, while some stakeholders are adopting a wait-and-see approach. Some stakeholders are cautious about the potential impacts of various port terminal projects for increased PRB coal exports in the Pacific Northwest. Concerns revolve around the effects of increased rail and barge transport of coal, with the possibility of exceeding 100 million short tons in export capacity. This could lead to 8 to 16 additional trains per day carrying coal from Montana and Wyoming through the Columbia River Gorge to export facilities in Washington and Oregon. The potential increase in coal exports from the Pacific Northwest has raised concerns about impacts such as coal dust emissions, traffic congestion, potential derailments, and environmental impacts from dredging and construction activities. Stakeholders also worry about broader global climate change impacts associated with increased coal burning in Asia. Project proponents argue that many adverse effects can be mitigated. Efforts to mitigate impacts of transporting PRB coal through the Pacific Northwest will likely occur within existing local, state, tribal, or federal requirements. Stakeholders are concerned about broader, cumulative impacts of pending and future projects not being adequately addressed. Permit applications have been submitted to various agencies, with comments urging full consideration of indirect and cumulative impacts before final decisions are made. The Army Corps of Engineers will consider indirect and cumulative impacts of coal export projects before issuing permits, in compliance with NEPA. Opponents requested a region-wide environmental impact statement, but the Corps rejected the idea, stating it was beyond their jurisdiction. The Washington Department of Ecology plans a comprehensive review of environmental, transportation, health, and climate issues for proposed coal ports. The Department of Ecology, Army Corps of Engineers, and Cowiltz County are scoping the environmental review for a proposed coal terminal near Longview, WA. They plan to issue a joint environmental impact statement (EIS) to consider the legal and physical perspectives on greenhouse gas emissions and coal exports. The potential risks of violating climate change obligations and exacerbating climate change through increased coal exports are key considerations. The United States does not have enforceable climate-related obligations regarding coal exports. The EPA regulates methane emissions but not from coal mines. Current federal commitments to reduce coal-related greenhouse gas emissions are not legally binding. President Obama stated a policy in 2009 regarding emissions caps. President Obama set a non-legally binding policy in 2009 to reduce US GHG emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. The lack of enforceable mechanisms makes it challenging to reach this target. Rising coal exports could hinder achieving absolute GHG targets domestically or internationally. The balance between increased methane emissions from coal production and decreased coal use due to higher prices is uncertain. US coal exports may also impede other countries' efforts to meet GHG goals. European utilities are importing inexpensive coal from the US, increasing GHG emissions and complicating efforts to meet EU's GHG targets. US coal exports to China and India could hinder persuading them to reduce emissions. Increasing US coal exports may impair international efforts to negotiate a legal framework for GHG reductions. This could lead to rising global GHG emissions. Increasing U.S. coal exports could lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, as well as other pollution. Appalachian coal producers plan to expand exports, with much of the increase coming from the Powder River Basin. This could contribute to rising emissions globally and locally, impacting climate change and air quality. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of their actions before making a final decision. Projects with uncertain impacts may require an environmental assessment (EA) to determine significance. The Corps will prepare an EA for the Coyote Island coal terminal project in the Pacific Northwest. The Corps will prepare an EA for the Coyote Island coal terminal project in the Pacific Northwest, while the GPT and MBT projects will require an EIS due to significant impacts. The scoping phase is ongoing for these projects, with a focus on analyzing connected, cumulative, and similar project-related actions and their effects. Permit applications for export terminal expansion projects in Oregon and Washington may also have indirect or cumulative impacts. The Corps may define indirect impacts broadly, including increased train traffic out of Montana or Wyoming due to coal export capacity expansion. Uncertainty exists regarding the need to expand rail capacity as a result of port terminal permit approval, potentially requiring approval from the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. The full range of project-related actions and impacts in the EA remains difficult to determine. The Corps will consider specific project activities requiring a permit and federal control for environmental review. The scope of analysis will extend beyond the proposed activity if deemed appropriate under NEPA regulations. The Corps and EPA have disagreements over project impacts under NEPA regulations. EPA determined an EIS was necessary for the Coyote Island terminal project due to potential public health impacts from coal dust and diesel pollution. The EPA recommended a cumulative impacts analysis for the proposed Coyote Island terminal project due to concerns about transporting coal from Wyoming and Montana to Asia. The Corps is preparing an Environmental Assessment (EA) instead of conducting the recommended analysis. The Corps is preparing an EA for the Coyote Island terminal project and individual EISs for other pending projects. EPA and Congress have requested a comprehensive analysis of cumulative impacts for all proposed port terminal projects. The Corps accepted public comments until early 2013 on the scope of issues to be analyzed in the EISs for GPT and MBT. It is uncertain how extensively the Corps will consider indirect and cumulative impacts of the proposed projects. The Corps announced in June 2013 that it would not conduct an area-wide EIS for the proposed export terminals. The Obama Administration supports various energy sources for electric power in the US, including clean coal, natural gas, renewables, and uranium. There is a growing interest in exporting US hydrocarbon resources, with coal exports on the rise. The Administration proposed limiting US government financing for coal plants overseas to reduce carbon emissions. The US became a net exporter of petroleum products in 2011, and there are pending liquefied natural gas export projects. The planned expansion of U.S. hydrocarbon exports has sparked controversy, with environmental and consumer groups opposing exports. Coal exports have also drawn attention, with opposition from communities along rail routes and mining sites. Proposed legislation such as H.R. 2396 and S. 831 aim to address issues related to coal exports. S. 831, the Coal Miner Employment and Domestic Energy Infrastructure Protection Act of 2013, would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from issuing regulations that reduce coal available for domestic consumption or export before December 31, 2017. Congressional committees have discussed coal exports and the future of coal utilization in the U.S. Coal is a dense carbonaceous fossil fuel formed from decayed organic matter. It contains hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen, and mineral matter. There are four basic types of coal with varying characteristics in the United States. Coal quality is determined by characteristics such as energy value, moisture, sulfur levels, and ash content. Lignite is a low-quality coal with high moisture and ash content, mainly used for electricity generation. Sub-bituminous coal, the most produced type in 2011, has a higher heating value and is used for electricity generation and space heat. Coal in the United States is classified into different types based on its heating value and carbon content. Bituminous coal is the most abundant type with a heating value between 10,500 to 15,500 Btu per pound, primarily used for electric power generation. Anthracite coal has the highest energy content at 15,000 Btu per pound but is limited to specific geographic areas like Appalachia and Pennsylvania. Thermal coal is used for industrial purposes to generate steam or heat, while metallurgical coke produced from bituminous coal is used in steel production. Metallurgical Coal, also known as coking coal, is used to make steel. Appalachia, Interior, and Western are the main regions for coal production in the United States."
