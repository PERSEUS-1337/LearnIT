It addresses the treatment of drugs and biologicals under the Medicare outpatient hospital prospective payment system. The \"Beneficiary Access to Care Act of 2003\" addresses the separate classification of drugs and biologicals under the Medicare outpatient hospital prospective payment system. It specifies that certain drugs and biologicals are treated as a distinct group of covered OPD services. The \"Beneficiary Access to Care Act of 2003\" amends the Social Security Act to calculate Medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for covered services. Effective January 1, 2004, the amendments apply to items and services furnished on or after that date. The \"Beneficiary Access to Care Act of 2003\" changes how Medicare OPD fee schedule amounts are calculated for covered services, with special rules for 2004. The 2004 schedule amount for a drug or biological treated as a separate group of covered OPD services is determined based on specific criteria for single-source drugs, innovator multiple source drugs, or biological products approved under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The 2004 schedule amount for a drug or biological under the Public Health Service Act must be at least 87.37 percent of the payment rate as of December 31, 2002, without any revision of relative payment weights. The 2004 schedule amount for a drug or biological under the Public Health Service Act must be at least 87.37 percent of the payment rate as of December 31, 2002, without revision of relative payment weights for covered OPD services. In 2004, the payment rate for a drug or biological under the Public Health Service Act must be at least 87.37 percent of the December 31, 2002 rate, without adjusting for relative differences in labor costs. The Secretary will use external data to adjust the payment weight for drugs or biologicals treated as a separate group of covered OPD services after 2003. The reliable and valid data from entities and organizations outside the Department of Health and Human Services show that the payment weight for certain services is inadequate. Adjustments made in 2004 will not affect payment weights for other services that year. The Medicare OPD fee schedule amount will be determined using adjusted relative weights.

The report will include recommendations for necessary legislation to implement identified changes."
