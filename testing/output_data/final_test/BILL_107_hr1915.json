The Gas Affordability Act of 2001 suspends fuel taxes for six months, reducing tax rates by 4.3 cents per gallon for various fuels, including diesel, special fuels, compressed natural gas, methanol, and ethanol. No tax is imposed on compressed natural gas sales during this period. The Gas Affordability Act of 2001 suspends fuel taxes for six months from July 1, 2001, to December 31, 2001. The amendment made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. FLOOR STOCK REFUNDS. Before the tax suspension date, if tax has been imposed on any liquid under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and on that date the liquid is held by a dealer for sale without being used, a credit or refund will be given to the taxpayer for the excess tax paid. Claims for credit or refund must be filed with the Secretary of the Treasury within 6 months after the tax suspension date. On the tax suspension date, a dealer can request a refund or credit from the taxpayer within 3 months. No credit or refund is allowed for liquid held in retail stocks. Definitions for \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are provided in this section. The terms \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are defined in section 6412 of the Internal Revenue Code. The tax suspension date is the start of the suspension period under section 4081(f) of the Code. Rules similar to those in section 6412 apply to this section. SEC. 4. FLOOR STOCKS TAX. Imposition of Tax: A floor stocks tax is imposed on taxable liquid held on the floor stocks tax date, calculated as the excess of the tax that would be imposed under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code over the tax already paid on the liquid. Liability and Payment: The person holding the liquid is liable for the tax, which must be paid within 6 months of the floor stocks tax date as prescribed by the Secretary. The floor stocks tax date is defined as the day after the suspension period. Liquid held by a person is considered owned by them, regardless of delivery. Taxable liquid refers to any liquid subject to tax under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel have specific definitions under the Code. The term \"date\" refers to the day after the suspension period under section 4081(f) of the Code. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury or their delegate. The tax imposed by subsection (a) does not apply to taxable liquid held for exempt uses or in the tank of a motor vehicle or motorboat. No tax is imposed on gasoline held on the floor stocks tax date by any person. The exemption applies to gasoline up to 4,000 gallons and diesel fuel, kerosene, or aviation fuel up to 2,000 gallons held by a person on a specific date. Submission of required information to the Secretary is necessary. Fuel exempt from tax under subsection (d) or (e) is not considered. The term \"controlled group\" under subsection (d) or (e) means all persons treated as 1 person, with regulations for nonincorporated persons under common control. Principles similar to those in subparagraph (A) apply to a group of persons under common control, even if not all are corporations. Other laws, including penalties, applicable to certain fuel taxes also apply to floor stock taxes imposed under subsection (a). SEC. 5. Protection of Highway Trust Fund: Amounts transferred to the Highway Trust Fund will be determined as if this Act had not been enacted."
