    "content": "The \"Community Development Bank Act\" is the short title of this legislation, which aims to establish community development banks. The purposes of the \"Community Development Bank Act\" are to increase credit availability for economic revitalization in distressed urban and rural communities, improve access to financial resources for disadvantaged individuals and businesses, increase mortgage credit for housing rehabilitation, provide capital for various projects, and offer assistance to small businesses. The \"Community Development Bank Act\" aims to provide technical and managerial assistance to small businesses in economically distressed areas and promote the establishment of community development banks to serve the credit needs of underserved residents in urban and rural areas. Establishment of a Community Development Bankers' Bank. The Comptroller of the Currency can issue a certificate of authority for a national banking association solely owned by insured depository institutions, primarily focused on community development activities. The association must be named a \"community development bank\" and follow regulations set by the Comptroller. The community development bank, as a national banking association, has the same rights and duties as others, including accepting deposits. At least 25% of its board members must represent the community it serves. SEC. 102 allows insured depository institutions to invest in community development banks up to 5% of their tier one or core capital. SEC. 103 outlines expedited procedures. SEC. 103 of the Act requires the Comptroller of the Currency to establish expedited procedures for community development bank applications within six months. The FDIC must also create fast-track procedures for deposit insurance applications. Final decisions must be made within nine months of receiving completed applications. A community development bank's primary purpose is to provide credit, capital, and related services to targeted persons and areas within its community while ensuring a reasonable economic return for its shareholders. It can engage in various activities such as residential mortgage loans, small business loans, home improvement loans, and equity investments in low- and moderate-income real estate. A community development bank offers equity investments in real estate projects, community development corporations, and small business development corporations. It also provides marketing, management assistance, business planning, counseling services, financial and technical services, vocational training, and deposit funds in credit unions serving low-income members. Coordination with various government departments and agencies is essential. A community development bank focuses on financing projects for small businesses and community development organizations. It targets customers not adequately served by existing depository institutions. Any insured depository institution can apply to be certified as a \"community development bank\" by the appropriate Federal banking agency if it is primarily engaged in community development activities. The agency will issue certification if the bank complies with the provisions of the Act and the certification will further the purposes of the title. The appropriate Federal banking agency conducts annual examinations of community development banks to assess compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Prior to issuing a final evaluation, a hearing must be held and notices must be published for consumer and community groups. The appropriate Federal banking agency conducts annual evaluations of community development banks under the Community Reinvestment Act. A hearing must be held with published notices inviting testimony from interested parties. The agency considers community input in evaluating the bank's performance and provides a final evaluation with explanations for findings. Re-evaluation of a community development bank with a rating less than satisfactory must occur within ninety days to determine if necessary changes have been made to warrant a satisfactory rating. SEC. 107. COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT COMPLIANCE. For the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, a community development bank's evaluation and rating apply to all insured depository institutions with qualifying investments. Institutions with satisfactory or outstanding ratings are considered to have met their community's credit needs. Insured depository institutions with qualifying investments in community development banks are exempt from evaluations under section 804 of the Act. Non-qualifying investments by insured depository institutions will be considered separately. The investment made by an institution will be evaluated by the appropriate Federal banking agency under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 does not apply to individuals investing in community development banks authorized under this title. Community development banks, as defined in this title, primarily provide credit and investment capital to targeted populations and geographic areas. Targeted populations include minority-owned and women-owned businesses, non-profit organizations, community groups, and economically disadvantaged persons. Targeted geographic areas are those suffering from economic distress, indicated by factors such as unemployment, poverty, housing conditions, and credit availability. A community development bank's \"community\" refers to contiguous geographic areas representing the market or service areas of financial institutions making qualifying investments. \"Insured depository institution\" and \"appropriate Federal banking agency\" have specific meanings. A \"qualifying investment\" in a community development bank is an equity share investment up to the maximum permissible amount. SEC. 110. SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS.\n\nFederal banking agencies and the FDIC can limit activities of insured depository institutions to protect their safety and soundness.\n\nSEC. 111. DISCRIMINATION AND FAIR HOUSING.\n\nFederal banking agencies can enforce laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act without interference from this title. Section 107 does not apply to institutions violating these laws. TITLE II--CONFORMING AMENDMENTS\n\nSEC. 201. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT REVOLVING LOAN FUND FOR CREDIT UNIONS.\n\nRepeals Section 120(k) of the Federal Credit Union Act and inserts a new section 130 for the Community Development Revolving Loan Fund for Credit Unions. The Board has the authority to utilize the Community Development Credit Union Revolving Loan Fund for credit unions, including investing idle moneys in US Treasury securities, requiring loans to be matched by increased shares, allocating interest for technical assistance, and defining the Fund as the Community Development Credit Union Revolving Loan Fund. SEC. 202. STUDY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CREDIT UNION. The National Credit Union Administration Board will conduct a study on community development credit activities by credit unions, considering their role in providing financial services to underserved areas, past failure rates, special examination forces, mentor programs, equipment/furniture recirculation, and financing programs. A report is due by October 1, 1993. The National Credit Union Administration Board will issue a report by October 1, 1993, to the Senate and House committees on necessary regulatory and legislative changes for the viability of community development activities by credit unions."
