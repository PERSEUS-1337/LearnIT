    "content": "In MedImmune v. Genentech, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a patent licensee can bring suit to challenge the validity of a patent without terminating the license agreement, even if threatened with patent infringement lawsuits for not paying royalties. This decision overturned the Federal Circuit's rule that required licensees to stop paying royalties before challenging a patent's validity. The Patent Act allows patent holders to sell their patent rights through an assignment or grant licenses to others. A license is permission for another entity to use the invention in exchange for royalty payments. License agreements may include restrictions on the use of the invention. Violating the terms of the license can lead to legal consequences. A breach of a patent license agreement, such as exceeding the scope or refusing to comply with terms, can lead to liability for breach of contract and patent infringement. Licensees may challenge the validity of a patent to avoid paying royalties if they discover it was improvidently granted. This allows them to pursue activities that were previously restricted by the license. In 1969, the Supreme Court overturned the doctrine of licensee estoppel, allowing patent licensees to challenge the validity of a patent. This decision was based on the importance of promoting competition and the use of ideas in the public domain over strict contract requirements. Licensees play a crucial role in challenging patentability, preventing monopolies, and promoting competition. The Declaratory Judgment Act allows federal courts to issue judgments in cases of actual controversy, ensuring legal rights are upheld. The Court has held that an action for declaratory relief qualifies as a \"case or controversy\" under Article III, requiring a substantial and immediate dispute between parties with adverse legal interests. It must involve definite and concrete legal relations, allowing for specific relief through a conclusive decree. The Supreme Court distinguishes between abstract questions and actual controversies contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit developed a two-part test to determine an \"actual controversy\" in a declaratory judgment action for patent non-infringement or invalidity. The test requires an explicit threat or action by the patentee creating a reasonable apprehension of facing an infringement suit, along with present activity or concrete steps towards potential infringement. In the Lear case, the licensee's refusal to pay royalties led to a lawsuit. In a case where a licensee refused to pay royalties, the licensor sued for breach of contract. The Supreme Court overturned lower court decisions applying licensee estoppel, allowing licensees to challenge patent validity after ceasing royalty payments. The Gen-Probe Inc. v. Vysis, Inc. case clarified that licensees must stop payments and notify the licensor of patent invalidity to invoke Lear doctrine protection. The U.S. Supreme Court faced the question of whether a patent licensee in good standing must breach its license agreement before challenging the validity of the licensed patent. MedImmune, Inc., a pharmaceutical company, was involved in the case regarding its drug Synagis. MedImmune entered into a patent license agreement with Genentech in 1997 for the production of \"chimeric antibodies\" and coexpression of immunoglobulin chains. Genentech later claimed that Synagis infringed on their new patent, leading to a dispute over royalties. MedImmune paid royalties under protest for Synagis, their main revenue source, to avoid potential consequences of a patent infringement suit by Genentech. They initiated a declaratory judgment action seeking to invalidate the patent, while Genentech argued lack of federal court jurisdiction over the claim. The U.S. District Court dismissed MedImmune's case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing a previous ruling that a patent licensee in good standing cannot establish an Article III case or controversy. MedImmune, as a licensee in good standing, continued to pay royalties under the license agreement and was not under threat of infringement suit. On appeal, MedImmune argued that it had the right to challenge the validity of the patent despite paying royalties to avoid a lawsuit. Genentech contended that the issue was about Article III jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, not licensee estoppel. The Federal Circuit agreed with Genentech, affirming the district court's decision based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The appellate court rejected the applicability of Lear in the MedImmune case, as there was no defaulting licensee breaching the license. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case and determine if there was a justiciable controversy under Article III jurisdiction. The Supreme Court ruled that a patent licensee does not need to breach a license agreement before seeking a declaratory judgment on the patent's validity, enforceability, or infringement. Compliance with the license terms does not eliminate the case or controversy requirement under Article III jurisdiction. In MedImmune, compliance with license terms did not eliminate the threat of injury from a patent infringement lawsuit. Justice Scalia compared it to a situation where the government threatens legal action, stating that lack of violation does not eliminate jurisdiction. This was supported by the Altvater v. Freeman case. In Altvater v. Freeman, patentees sued licensees over territorial restrictions in the license. Licensees counterclaimed for declaratory judgment on patent validity, paying royalties \"under protest\" under an injunction. Justice Scalia noted that compliance with license terms in MedImmune did not remove the threat of a patent infringement lawsuit, similar to the Altvater case. Genentech demanded royalty payments from MedImmune under a licensing agreement, threatening a patent infringement lawsuit if not paid. Justice Scalia stated that paying royalties under coercive circumstances does not eliminate court jurisdiction for a declaratory judgment action. The Supreme Court's decision does not require extreme risks before seeking a declaration of contested legal rights. Justice Scalia clarified that the Supreme Court's decision in this case is limited to the procedural issue of federal court jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions by nonrepudiating licensees. Genentech argued that the license agreement prevented the suit by immunizing the licensee from infringement suits as long as royalties were paid and patents were not challenged. The Supreme Court's decision is limited to federal court jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions by nonrepudiating licensees. Genentech argued that the license agreement prevented suits by immunizing the licensee from infringement as long as royalties were paid and patents were not challenged. However, Justice Scalia noted that these arguments go to the case's merits, not the question of jurisdiction. The court decided to leave the discretionary dismissal arguments for lower courts to consider on remand, along with any merits-based arguments for denial of declaratory relief. On remand, any merits-based arguments for denial of declaratory relief in the case are being considered. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, stating that a patent licensee must breach its license before challenging the patent's validity. He argued that MedImmune's suit sought rulings on hypothetical matters, lacking Article III jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit has acknowledged changes in declaratory judgment jurisdiction post-MedImmune, leaving unresolved questions in patent law. The MedImmune decision raised unresolved questions in patent law, including the applicability of the licensee estoppel doctrine to nonrepudiating licensees. District courts still have discretion to decline declaratory judgment actions. The Supreme Court may revisit issues left unaddressed in MedImmune in future cases. The MedImmune decision may lead to an increase in patent litigation as licensees may find it easier to challenge patent validity without breaching their agreements. This could impact the drafting of patent licensing agreements with the inclusion of \"no challenge\" clauses. The MedImmune decision could impact patent licensing agreements by allowing licensees to challenge patent validity without breaching agreements, potentially affecting the use of \"no challenge\" clauses. This decision may have broader implications beyond patent law, extending to licensing and contract law matters unrelated to intellectual property."
