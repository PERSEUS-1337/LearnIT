The soft actor-critic algorithm proposed in this paper is based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework, aiming to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, this method achieves state-of-the-art results. Our method, based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework, achieves state-of-the-art performance on continuous control tasks by combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation. It demonstrates stability and robustness across different random seeds, providing an efficient model-free deep RL algorithm for continuous state and action spaces. The soft actor-critic algorithm, based on maximum entropy reinforcement learning, offers improved exploration and robustness. It extends to complex tasks like the 21-DoF Humanoid benchmark, providing sample-efficient learning and stability. The soft actor-critic algorithm improves performance and sample efficiency in complex tasks like the 21-DoF Humanoid benchmark by incorporating actor-critic architecture with separate policy and value function networks. The soft actor-critic algorithm enhances performance in complex tasks by using separate policy and value function networks, off-policy formulation for efficiency, and entropy maximization for stability and exploration. Many actor-critic algorithms update the actor using the policy gradient formulation and consider policy entropy. The DDPG algorithm is a popular off-policy actor-critic method that uses a Q-function estimator for off-policy learning and a deterministic actor to maximize the Q-function. This method combines deterministic actor-critic and approximate Q-learning algorithms for improved efficiency. The method combines off-policy actor-critic training with a stochastic actor, aiming to maximize actor entropy for stability and scalability, outperforming DDPG. Maximum entropy reinforcement learning optimizes policies for both return and entropy. The maximum entropy distribution is used in various contexts, such as inverse reinforcement learning and optimal control. Recent papers have highlighted the connection between Q-learning and policy gradient methods within the framework of maximum entropy learning. Some approaches approximate the maximum entropy distribution with a Gaussian or a sampling network. The soft Q-learning algorithm proposed by one paper uses a value function and actor network but is not a true actor-critic algorithm. The actor network is motivated as an approximate sampler in this approach. Our method converges to the optimal policy regardless of parameterization, outperforming state-of-the-art off-policy algorithms like DDPG. The soft actor-critic algorithm demonstrates superior performance in deep RL methods. In reinforcement learning, policy learning in continuous action spaces is addressed using infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDP). The objective is to maximize the expected sum of rewards by considering a more general maximum entropy objective. The maximum entropy objective in reinforcement learning favors stochastic policies by incorporating the expected entropy of the policy. The temperature parameter \u03b1 controls the stochasticity of the optimal policy, with the conventional objective being recoverable as \u03b1 approaches 0. This objective encourages wider exploration and the capture of multiple modes of near-optimal behavior. In reinforcement learning, the maximum entropy objective promotes stochastic policies by including the expected entropy of the policy. It encourages wider exploration and captures multiple modes of near-optimal behavior. The objective can be extended to infinite horizon problems by introducing a discount factor \u03b3 to ensure finite expected rewards and entropies. This approach improves learning speed over conventional methods and involves solving for the optimal Q-function to recover the optimal policy. The text discusses the development of an off-policy soft actor-critic algorithm within the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. It introduces a novel maximum entropy variant of the policy iteration method and presents a derivation of the algorithm, showing convergence to the optimal policy. Additionally, a practical deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on this theory is presented. Soft policy iteration is a general algorithm for learning optimal maximum entropy policies that alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement. It converges to the optimal policy within a set of policies, such as parameterized densities. In the policy evaluation step, the soft Q-value can be computed iteratively using a modified Bellman backup operator. The soft policy iteration algorithm involves policy evaluation using the Bellman backup operator T \u03c0 to find the soft value of a policy \u03c0. The policy is then updated towards the exponential of the new Q-function to improve its soft value within a set of tractable policies \u03a0. In soft policy iteration, the policy is updated by projecting it into a set of policies using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The partition function is used to normalize the update, and the new policy is shown to have a higher value than the old policy. This is formalized in Lemma 2. The soft policy iteration algorithm converges to the optimal maximum entropy policy among the policies in \u03a0. In continuous domains, the algorithm is approximated using a function approximator to represent Q-values, leading to the practical soft actor-critic algorithm. Repeated application of soft policy evaluation and improvement converges to a policy \u03c0. The soft policy iteration algorithm converges to the optimal maximum entropy policy among the policies in \u03a0. In continuous domains, a practical approximation is used with function approximators for Q-function and policy. The state value function, Q-function, and policy are parameterized with networks using parameters \u03c8, \u03b8, and \u03c6. Update rules for these parameter vectors are derived, with the state value function approximating the soft value. The soft value function is trained to minimize the squared residual error where D is the distribution of previously sampled states and actions. The soft Q-function parameters can be trained to minimize the soft Bellman residual, optimized with stochastic unbiased gradients. The update utilizes a target value network V\u03c8. The update utilizes a target value network V\u03c8, which stabilizes training. The policy parameters can be learned by minimizing the KL-divergence. Different options exist for minimizing J \u03c0 based on the policy class, such as using the reparametrization trick for simple distributions like Gaussians or a likelihood ratio gradient estimator for policies with discrete latent variables. The proposed likelihood ratio gradient estimator uses a state-dependent baseline to center the learning signal and eliminate the intractable log-partition function. The algorithm alternates between collecting experience and updating function approximators using stochastic gradients on batches sampled from a replay buffer. Off-policy data from the replay buffer can be used to train both value estimators and the policy. The algorithm is agnostic to the policy parameterization. The algorithm proposed is agnostic to the policy parameterization and suggests using a practical multimodal representation based on a mixture of K Gaussians to maximize randomness and improve exploration and robustness. This representation can approximate any distribution with precision and provide an expressive distribution in medium-dimensional action spaces. The algorithm proposed uses a mixture of K Gaussians to maximize randomness and improve exploration in high-dimensional action spaces. The policy is defined by unnormalized mixture weights, means, and covariances, which can be complex neural networks. A squashing function limits actions to a bounded interval. The algorithm does not require an accurate approximation of the optimal Q-function distribution. Convergence holds for policies within a policy class. The experimental evaluation compares the sample complexity and stability of the new method with prior off-policy and on-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The algorithm's performance is tested on challenging continuous control tasks from the OpenAI gym benchmark suite, including the Swimmer and Humanoid environments. The algorithm's stability is crucial for solving complex benchmarks like the 21-dimensional Humanoid, which are difficult for off-policy algorithms. Easier tasks allow for better hyperparameter tuning to achieve good results. In comparisons with other deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including TRPO, DDPG, and SQL, the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning is crucial for achieving good results. DDPG is efficient but sensitive to hyperparameters, limiting its effectiveness on complex tasks. Exploration noise was turned off for evaluation in DDPG and TRPO. The study compared deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as DDPG, TRPO, SQL, and SAC. SAC outperformed DDPG on benchmark tasks, learning faster and achieving higher final performance. DDPG struggled on the hardest tasks like Ant-v1 and Humanoid, showing poor stability. SAC still learned faster than TRPO on these tasks due to improved stability. Improved stability is key for successful performance in high-dimensional tasks. TRPO may not show immediate progress in some tasks, but eventually solves them with more iterations. SAC demonstrates superior sample efficiency and final performance compared to other methods. Sensitivity to random seeds is shown in performance comparison on the HalfCheetah-v1 benchmark. SAC consistently outperforms DDPG and TRPO, which exhibit high variability across seeds. In comparison to DDPG and TRPO, SAC shows superior stability and performance on challenging tasks like Ant and Humanoid. Ablations are conducted to identify key components of SAC for its success, contrasting it with non-entropy-maximizing algorithms like DDPG. The main difference between SAC and DDPG is the inclusion of entropy maximization in the objective, which prevents premature convergence and encourages exploration. Including entropy in the policy objective is crucial for performance, while maximizing entropy in the value function is less important. The policy objective is crucial for SAC, while maximizing entropy in the value function is less important. Exploration noise differs between SAC and DDPG, with Boltzmann exploration outperforming external OU noise. SAC uses a separate network to predict state values in addition to Q-values. The value network in SAC serves to bootstrap TD updates for learning the Q-function and reduce policy gradient variance. It plays a minor role in TD updates but is crucial for overall performance. SAC closely resembles DDPG with a stochastic actor, and different components were evaluated by swapping them with DDPG counterparts. Four versions were compared, showing the importance of using the value network for both purposes. The reparametrization trick in SAC yields faster and more stable learning compared to likelihood policy gradient estimator, but limits the use of multimodal mixtures of Gaussians. Using a deterministic policy significantly degrades performance in terms of average return and variance, highlighting the importance of entropy maximization and stochastic policies in off-policy deep RL. Soft actor-critic (SAC) is an off-policy maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning algorithm that offers sample-efficient learning while maintaining entropy maximization benefits and stability. The theoretical results derive soft policy iteration, proving convergence to the optimal policy. Empirical evidence shows SAC outperforms state-of-the-art model-free deep RL methods, surpassing DDPG in sample efficiency. Stochastic, entropy maximizing reinforcement learning algorithms like SAC show promise for enhanced robustness and stability in deep RL. Future work in the field of deep reinforcement learning includes exploring maximum entropy methods with second order information and more expressive policy classes. Discounted policy gradients optimize average reward with a discount factor to reduce variance, rather than the true discounted objective. The objective optimized under a discount factor involves maximizing the discounted expected reward and entropy for future states weighted by their probability under the current policy. The soft policy evaluation and improvement in deep reinforcement learning involve convergence of Q-values under the current policy, with the optimizer minimizing the soft state-action value. The soft policy iteration in deep reinforcement learning involves convergence of Q-values under the current policy, leading to a policy \u03c0* that maximizes Q-values for all states and actions. The soft policy iteration in deep reinforcement learning involves convergence of Q-values under the current policy to find the optimal policy \u03c0*. This optimal policy is proven to be the best among all policies in the set \u03a0 by showing that its soft value is higher than any other policy. To handle unbounded action distributions, a squashing function like tanh is applied to GMM samples, ensuring actions are within a finite interval. Soft actor-critic is sensitive to reward scale, affecting policy stochasticity. Varying reward magnitude impacts learning performance, with small rewards leading to uniform policies and failure to exploit rewards. Experiments on HalfCheetah-v1 benchmark show representative results, but may differ in other environments. The policy's uniformity due to reward scale affects exploration and exploitation balance, leading to performance degradation. Tuning reward magnitude is crucial for fast and stable learning. The number of mixture components in the Gaussian policy has minimal impact on learning performance. The number of mixture components in the Gaussian policy has minimal impact on learning performance. SAC converges to stochastic policies, so making the final policy deterministic at the end is beneficial for best performance. Evaluation involves approximating the maximum a posteriori action by choosing the action that maximizes the Q-function among the mixture component means. Test returns are substantially better than training returns. Varying the smoothing constant for target value network updates shows different update strategies. In experiments with the SAC algorithm, it was found that smaller smoothing constants yield higher performance with slightly slower progress initially. The use of a target network for stabilization is not necessary, as SAC can learn stably without it. The size of the experience replay buffer is crucial for environments where the optimal policy becomes deterministic at convergence. In experiments with the SAC algorithm, it was found that a higher capacity buffer helps to remember initial failures but slows down learning. A buffer size of 10 million samples was used for HalfCheetah-v1, and 1 million samples for other environments. Increasing the number of actor and critic gradient steps per time step tends to improve sample efficiency, but only up to a point. In experiments with the SAC algorithm, increasing the number of gradient steps per time step tends to improve sample efficiency, with performance steadily increasing until 16 gradient updates per step. However, in some environments like Humanoid, the benefit is not as significant. The ability to take multiple gradient steps without negatively affecting the algorithm is crucial for real-world learning where experience collection is a bottleneck. The performance drops after reaching a return of approximately 10 thousand due to the replay buffer size of 1 million samples.
