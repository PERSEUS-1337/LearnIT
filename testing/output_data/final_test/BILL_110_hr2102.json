The \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2007\" prohibits Federal entities from compelling covered persons in journalism to testify or produce documents unless certain conditions are met, including exhausting alternative sources and demonstrating reasonable grounds for a crime in criminal investigations. The \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2007\" restricts Federal entities from forcing journalists to testify or provide documents unless crucial for an investigation or prosecution, or in non-criminal matters, essential for successful completion. If the information could reveal a source's identity, disclosure may be necessary to prevent or identify a perpetrator. Disclosure of a source's identity may be necessary to prevent terrorism, imminent harm, or identify individuals disclosing trade secrets or health information. Disclosure of a source's identity may be necessary in criminal investigations to identify individuals who disclosed classified information without authorization. Unauthorized disclosure causing significant harm to national security must outweigh public interest in news dissemination. Courts can consider harm to national security in making determinations. Testimony or documents compelled must be limited to verifying published information. The Act requires published information to be accurate and narrowly tailored to avoid irrelevant details. It does not apply to defamation claims under State law. Federal entities can compel disclosure of information related to criminal conduct.
