    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iraqi Women and Children's Liberation Act of 2004\". The findings of Congress highlight the historical repression of women in Iraq under the Ottoman Empire, the progress made after the Sevres Treaty of 1919, and the achievements of Iraqi women in various professions by 1941, including earning equal wages for equal work. In 1959, Iraq became the first country in the Middle East to have women in prominent roles, enfranchising them with political and economic rights. The Code of Personal Status secularized the state, allowing women to work in various professions and participate in the workforce. Women held positions as military officers, designers, supervisors, and government officials in education, medicine, accounting, and administration. The Code of Personal Status in Iraq granted women legal protections, including the right to vote and equal status under the law. It prohibited underage marriage, arbitrary divorce, and male favoritism in custody and inheritance disputes. The regime of Saddam Hussein used rape and violence against women to suppress opposition, including beheading over 200 women. After the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq imposed policies leading to economic hardship, discrimination, and oppression of women. Women were prevented from working, with only 19 percent in the workforce despite comprising 65 percent of the population. Article 111 of the Iraqi Penal Code protected men who committed \"honor killings,\" resulting in over 4,000 women killed for tarnishing family honor. Maternal mortality is a significant cause of death in Iraq. (13) Maternal mortality is the leading cause of death among women in Iraq, with a rate of 292 deaths per 100,000 live births. 90 percent of these deaths are preventable. \n(14) Over 48 percent of Iraq's population is under 18 years old, with high rates of child malnutrition and mortality. \n(15) Girls and women in Iraq have limited access to education. Women in Iraq face significant challenges in education, with only 29 percent attending secondary school compared to 47 percent of males. The country has the highest illiteracy rate in the Arab world, with 77 percent of women and 45 percent of men being illiterate. Pressures to adhere to strict Islamic codes limit women's mobility and human rights. Security concerns prevent women from leaving their homes or sending their daughters to school, while women in leadership positions are vulnerable. Women in leadership positions in Iraq face vulnerability to attack, with one council member assassinated and another with a bounty on her head. In contrast, women in the Kurdish region have more freedom, holding important roles and contributing to the region's development. The exclusion of women from political and economic spheres hampers growth in Arab countries, as highlighted in the 2003 Arab Human Development Report. Ambassador L. Paul Bremer supports women's rights in Iraq. Women play key roles in Iraq's political future, with representation in the Iraqi Governing Council and leadership positions in government ministries. Resolution 137, sponsored by conservative Shiite members, aimed to reverse family law in Iraq. In 2003, Resolution 137 threatened women's rights in Iraq, including education, employment, and property inheritance. Ambassador Bremer refused to sign the resolution, leading to its revocation by the Iraqi Governing Council in 2004. The Transitional Administrative Law was then signed to ensure women make up at least 25% of Iraq's interim legislature. The Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) in Iraq does not set a specific representation goal for women in the executive or judicial branches of the interim government. It allows Sharia to be a source of Iraqi law but not the only one. US officials plan to transfer political power to Iraqis on June 30, 2004, despite some factions opposing the TAL and pushing for Sharia to be the supreme law of Iraq. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that women and children in Iraq should benefit from the liberation, women of all ethnic groups should be included in the reconstruction, women should be involved in drafting key legal instruments, women should have membership in committees for Iraq's reconstruction, and women should have equal representation. In Iraq, women should have equal representation in leadership roles at all government levels, including ministers and judges. They should also be involved in the political process and economic activities, with contracts and credit opportunities. Grass-roots organizations and civil society building should receive continued support. In Iraq, women's voices should be incorporated in decision-making, security needs addressed by recruiting and training women for the police force, and the government should adhere to international human rights standards. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE. The President is authorized to provide education, health care, and assistance for women and children in Iraq and Iraqi refugees in other countries. Assistance is also authorized for enhancing political participation, economic empowerment, civil society, and personal security of women in Iraq, with a focus on protecting human rights and utilizing indigenous institutions and women's organizations. The President is authorized to provide assistance for women and children in Iraq, focusing on human rights and utilizing indigenous institutions and women's organizations. Assistance should be conditioned on Iraq's progress towards human rights standards. The Secretary of State must submit reports every six months on the conditions of women and children in Iraq. The Secretary of State must submit reports every six months on the conditions of women and children in Iraq, including the number in refugee camps, their conditions, changes over time, and US Government expenditures to promote their well-being. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign Relations. The appropriate congressional committees for receiving reports on the conditions of women and children in Iraq are the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committees on Appropriations and International Relations of the House of Representatives."
