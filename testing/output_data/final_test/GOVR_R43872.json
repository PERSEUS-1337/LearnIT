    "content": "In 1891, Congress granted the President the authority to establish forest reserves from the public domain to improve and protect forests and secure water flows. The reserves were initially administered by the Division of Forestry and later transferred to the USDA Forest Service in 1905. The management of national forests is one of the three principal responsibilities of the Forest Service. The Forest Service's main responsibilities include providing assistance programs to nonfederal forest owners and conducting forestry research. President Theodore Roosevelt expanded forest reserves in 1906 and 1907, leading to Congress limiting the President's authority to add to the system in certain states in 1907. The Weeks Act in 1911 allowed for additions to the National Forest System (NFS) through the purchase of private lands. The NFS has grown slowly from 154 million acres in 1919 to 193 million acres in 2014 through purchases, donations, and land transfers. The National Forest System (NFS) consists of 154 million acres (97.6% of the system) of national forests, 20 national grasslands with 3.8 million acres (2.0%), and 108 other areas with 0.9 million acres (0.5%). Each NFS unit is administered by a forest supervisor and organized into nine administrative regions. Regional foresters oversee these regions, reporting to the NFS deputy chief, who reports to the chief of the Forest Service. The chief, a career employee, reports to the USDA Secretary through the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment. NFS lands are mainly in the seven western FS regions. Inholdings are private lands within national forests that are not regulated by the Forest Service, causing management difficulties. Private landowners may object to federal restrictions on their lands. The management goals for national forests include outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife conservation. The Act directs land and resource management of national forests for multiple uses, including outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife purposes. It emphasizes sustained yield and coordination of resources without maximizing profits or focusing on one specific use. The Forest Service (FS) follows various statutes, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. FS planning is guided by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act and the National Forest Management Act. These laws promote foresight in managing forest resources, with assessments published every 10 years and comprehensive land management plans revised every 10 to 15 years. The national RPA planning process requires plans to be revised every 10 to 15 years to address changing conditions, management goals, and public use. Plans must use an interdisciplinary approach, including economic analysis and public involvement, in accordance with NEPA. Regulations for plan development have been revised multiple times since 1979. The Clinton Administration's 2000 regulations aimed to increase emphasis on ecological sustainability in forest planning. The George W. Bush Administration replaced Clinton's regulations with the 2005 planning rule to balance ecological sustainability with economic and social considerations. The 2005 rule was challenged for reducing environmental protection without proper public comment and ESA consideration. The 2008 planning rule was invalidated for violating NEPA and ESA, leading to a reversion to 1982 procedures by the FS. The Obama Administration implemented the 2012 planning rule for national forests, focusing on ecological sustainability, landscape restoration, and science-based decisions. Challenges from logging, ranching, and off-highway vehicle groups have been filed against the rule. The Forest Service has developed 125 plans for managing national forests and grasslands, with 60 plans revised by FY2015. The National Forest Service lands are managed for multiple uses including outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, wildlife, fish, wilderness, and mineral extraction. The goal is to balance these uses to meet the needs of the American people while maintaining high-level output without impairing land productivity. Revenue generated from these uses can offset agency costs and benefit local communities. In FY2014, the Forest Service generated $242.2 million in revenue, with recreation being the largest source. Timber harvests also contributed significantly, with KV sales, salvage sales, and timber production totaling $116.0 million. The agency's early focus on timber production aimed for self-sustainability. The Forest Service initially aimed for self-sustainability through timber production but eventually abandoned the idea. Timber sales were minimal until the 1950s when post-World War II housing boom increased NFS timber sales. FS was a major timber provider, selling 10-12 billion board feet annually. However, since the 1990s, FS timber harvests have decreased to around 2 billion board feet annually due to various factors including changing legislative directives and forest management practices. The Forest Service has seen changes in timber harvest volume over the years, with a slight upward trend in recent years. The drop in lumber prices since FY2005, due to instability in the housing market, led to a decline in the value of FS harvests until FY2010. However, the value has been gradually increasing since then. In FY2015, the FS harvested 2.5 billion board feet of timber, the largest production since FY2000, generating $162.7 million. Timber harvests are now used as a tool to achieve land and resource management objectives. The Forest Service utilizes timber harvests as a tool to achieve land and resource management objectives, including enhancing ecosystem conditions and generating revenue. Additionally, the FS engages in stewardship contracts with private parties for activities like thinning to reduce wildfire fuels. Outdoor recreation is a popular use of national forests, with over 166 million annual visits for activities such as hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping. The Forest Service manages national forests through timber harvests and stewardship contracts for ecosystem enhancement and revenue generation. Outdoor recreation, including activities like hiking, camping, skiing, and horseback riding, is a popular use of national forests. Private companies offer additional recreational opportunities through special use authorizations. Controversy exists over activities like off-highway vehicle use, prompting the agency to conduct travel management planning to designate motorized use areas. Recreation on NFS lands also generates significant revenue for the FS. In FY2014, recreation receipts on NFS lands totaled $72.0 million, contributing 30% of the total revenue generated. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act established a recreation fee program for the FS in 2004, which was extended until September 30, 2016. Congress may consider allowing the program to sunset or extending it with or without modifications, as some users object to paying fees for national forest recreation. The National Forest System (NFS) contains important fish and wildlife habitats, botanically significant resources, and over 400 threatened or endangered species. The NFS also issues permits and leases for grazing private livestock on approximately 93 million acres of land, with fees charged under a formula established by law in 1978. Permits and leases generally cover a 10-year period and may be renewed, with expired permits and leases automatically renewed through FY2015 to process a backlog of evaluations. The federal grazing fees for 2016 will be $2.11 per head month, with BLM lands providing more grazing than national forests. Protecting watershed health is a key focus, with NFS lands supporting ecological services and flood control benefits. The Forest Service established the Watershed Condition Framework to assess and prioritize the conditions of watersheds on NFS lands. The initial assessment classified 52% of watersheds as good, 45% as fair, and 4% as poor. Watershed action plans have been developed to guide restoration activities, resulting in improvements in the condition class of 30 watersheds since FY2012. Restoration activities include decommissioning roads and enhancing stream habitat. Congress has created special designations for certain areas within the NFS, such as wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and national trails. The National Forest System (NFS) includes various types of land designations such as national game refuges, wildlife preserves, recreation areas, monuments, and other designated areas. Management of roadless areas within the NFS, which have not been designated as wilderness, remains controversial. Questions persist about managing these areas to protect wilderness characteristics. President Clinton proposed new measures in 2001 to address this issue. President Clinton proposed a rule in 2001 to prohibit road construction and timber harvesting in roadless areas within the National Forest System. The rule faced litigation, but remains intact after the Supreme Court declined to review lower court decisions in 2012. Special use authorizations (SUAs) allow for activities like electricity transmission and commercial filming in NFS lands. Mineral and energy resource exploration and development, including oil, natural gas, and coal, are permitted in many areas. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 governs oil, natural gas, and coal exploration on federal lands, including NFS lands. Approximately 5.6 million acres under NFS lands are leased for energy operations. The FS manages federal oil and gas wells and coal production on NFS lands. Renewable energy projects like solar and wind are allowed on NFS lands through right-of-way SUAs. The Forest Service allows renewable energy projects like solar and wind on NFS lands through right-of-way SUAs. While no SUAs for solar projects have been approved yet, a utility-scale wind power facility SUA was approved in 2012. However, the construction of a 15-turbine facility on the Green Mountain National Forest is pending due to ongoing litigation. Discussions and legislative proposals on FS management have focused on the risk of catastrophic wildfires, exacerbated by degraded forest ecological conditions and climate change. The Forest Service is facing challenges with dense tree stands, exacerbated by drought and climate change, and increasing homes in wildland-urban areas. Advocates suggest actions like prescribed burning and thinning to improve forest resilience. Critics argue that reducing fuel levels is adequate, but removing commercial timber harms forest health and wastes taxpayer money. The FS receives discretionary and mandatory appropriations, with discretionary funds coming from regular Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bills. In FY2016, the Forest Service received $7.06 billion in total funding, with $6.36 billion (90%) as discretionary funds and $691.91 million (10%) as mandatory funds. The National Forest System is primarily funded through discretionary accounts, with Congress appropriating $1.51 billion in FY2016. The NFS account receives approximately 28% of FS discretionary appropriations over the last five fiscal years. Funds are allocated among various subaccounts, programs, and activities, as well as to the nine FS regions, research stations, service centers, and national headquarters. Allocation to national forests can be challenging due to the complex distribution process. The largest subaccount is Forest Products. The NFS account receives a significant portion of FS discretionary appropriations, with funds allocated to various subaccounts and programs. The largest subaccount, Forest Products, funds the Timber Sale program. Other subaccounts include Land Management Planning, Inventory and Monitoring, and Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness, which support forest planning, data acquisition and analysis, and recreation management on the NFS. The NFS receives funding for various programs including Grazing Management, Forest Products, Vegetation and Watershed Management, and Wildlife and Fish Habitat Management. These funds support activities such as livestock grazing permits, timber sales, habitat restoration, and wildlife conservation on NFS lands. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program Fund (CFLR P) funds landscape-scale restoration projects on NFS lands. Minerals and Geology Management administers mineral operations, manages abandoned mine lands, geologic resources, and environmental compliance. Landownership Management supports land management activities like energy transmission corridors and land exchanges. Law Enforcement Operations handles emergencies and investigates illegal activities. The Law Enforcement Operations on NFS lands responds to emergencies, investigates illegal activities such as illegal drug activities, and conducts crime prevention activities. The FS proposed a new budget structure for the NFS account by combining restoration-focused work into one budget line item, Integrated Resources Restoration (IRR), in FY2011. Congress did not enact the FY2011 proposal, but the IRR request was repeated in FY2012. The Integrated Resources Restoration (IRR) program was authorized as a pilot program in FY2012 with up to $68 million transferred from other NFS subaccounts. The pilot was conducted in three regions without a specified sunset date. Implementation began late in FY2012, and funding was continued through FY2016. Congress may decide to expand the IRR program across the NFS, continue it in the pilot regions, discontinue it, or explore other modifications to the NFS discretionary account structure. The Integrated Resources Restoration (IRR) program allows flexibility for land and resource management to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest resilience. Critics fear decreased congressional oversight due to budgetary flexibility. The Forest Service receives appropriations for wildfire management activities through the Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account and FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund, totaling over half of the FS discretionary appropriation in recent years. In FY2016, the FS received $3.9 billion for wildfire management, including a $700 million supplemental appropriation. The Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account received $700 million to repay money transferred from other accounts to cover the high costs of the FY2015 wildfire season. Suppression activities, preparedness, and hazardous fuels are the main recipients of WFM funds, with additional funding available through emergency or supplemental appropriations if needed for fire control activities. Congress has appropriated funds for wildfire suppression activities, including a $700 million supplemental in FY2016. Concerns have been raised about the increasing costs of wildfire management and the impact of fire transfers on other forest management activities. Various options for financing suppression activities have been considered, including proposals to provide funds outside of statutory constraints on discretionary spending. Presidential proclamations and executive orders have modified National Forest System boundaries and names. Presidential proclamations and executive orders have modified NFS boundaries and established new national forests in the East between 1910 and 1951. Today, creating or changing national forest boundaries requires an act of Congress. The Secretary of Agriculture can add lands to the NFS, mainly within or contiguous to existing national forest boundaries. The Weeks Act of 1911 grants broad authority for land acquisition, allowing the purchase of forested lands for stream regulation or timber production. Additional authority comes from the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937. The Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937 authorized the acquisition of submarginal lands and lands not suitable for cultivation, leading to the establishment of national grasslands and land utilization projects by the FS. Various laws allow for land acquisition for national forests, with the Secretary authorized to acquire access corridors and dispose of national forest land for fair market value. The 1897 Organic Act and the 1911 Weeks Act also authorize the disposal of land better suited for other uses. The 1958 Townsites Act and the 1983 Small Tracts Act authorize the Secretary to transfer or dispose of certain lands for specific purposes. Congress also allows the Forest Service to transfer NFS land to public school districts for educational use. Current debates focus on land and resource allocation issues in NFS management. Debates in NFS management focus on land and resource allocation, balancing demands for commodity and non-commodity uses, and public interest in decision-making. Controversies stem from questions about multiple use and sustained yield principles. Discussions revolve around achieving multiple use through single or simultaneous resource uses and ensuring sustained yield management for product flow. Congress has given the Forest Service discretion in managing national forests for multiple uses and sustained yield. However, conflicts arise as users and land managers try to balance these principles. Congress may prioritize certain forest uses or specify production levels through legislation. Congress has considered legislation to prioritize timber production or other uses like recreation, hunting, and fishing in national forests. Ongoing concerns include wildfire management costs, strategies, and impacts on communities. Fire control expenditures are rising, affecting other programs and national forest uses. The containment of these escalating costs remains uncertain."
