    "content": "The \"Corporate Patriot Enforcement Act of 2002\" aims to prevent corporate expatriation to avoid US income tax. The definition of \"domestic\" for corporations and partnerships under the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include entities created or organized in the United States. In corporate expatriation transactions, the acquiring corporation is treated as a domestic entity. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' refers to a situation where a nominally foreign acquiring corporation obtains most of the assets of a domestic corporation, with over 80 percent ownership post-transaction. In a corporate expatriation transaction, if more than 80 percent of the acquiring corporation's stock is held by former shareholders of the domestic corporation, a lower stock ownership requirement of 50 percent may apply to a nominally foreign corporation with limited business activities. In a corporate expatriation transaction, a lower stock ownership requirement of 50 percent may apply to a nominally foreign corporation with limited business activities in the foreign country where the corporation is created or organized, and its stock is publicly traded in the United States. The acquiring corporation must acquire properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership, and more than 80 percent of its stock must be held by former partners of the partnership after the transaction. The acquiring corporation must meet specific requirements related to the transaction, including the acquisition of properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership and having more than 80 percent of its stock held by former partners of the partnership after the transaction. Special rules apply, such as treating a series of related transactions as one transaction and not counting stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group that includes the acquiring corporation. The term 'nominally foreign corporation' refers to a corporation that would be considered foreign if not for certain provisions. The 'expanded affiliated group' is defined as an affiliated group without certain exclusions. Effective Dates: The amendment applies to corporate expatriation transactions completed after September 11, 2001. It also applies to transactions completed on or before that date, but only for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003."
