    "content": "Climate change is a global issue with incomplete greenhouse gas emissions data, especially from developing countries. Despite data shortcomings, the emerging picture of emissions highlights the contributions of individual countries and provides insights on differing interests between developed and developing nations. The World Resources Institute (WRI) has compiled greenhouse gas emissions data. The World Resources Institute (WRI) has compiled greenhouse gas emissions data from various sources into a database for analysis, covering 185 nations. The database includes total emissions, per capita emissions, and greenhouse gas intensity, along with socio-economic indicators. Data is available for all six greenhouse gases identified by the UNFCCC for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005 for both developed and non-Annex I nations. Carbon dioxide data goes back to 1850 and up to 2006. Land use change and forestry effects on CO2 emissions are available from 1990 to 2005 for a subset of nations. This data is used to examine U.S. climate change policy roles. The UNFCCC emphasizes the roles of developed and developing countries in addressing climate change, with developed countries expected to take the lead in combating climate change. U.S. policymakers have grappled with the concept of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" and the need for developed nations to lead in reducing emissions under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol mandated emission reductions for Annex I nations, but the United States refused to join. Non-Annex I nations were exempt from control requirements, leading to the US's rejection of the protocol. The United States played a key role in refusing to agree to the Kyoto Protocol due to difficulties in meeting emission reduction commitments and concerns about emissions from rapidly growing nations like China and India. Developed nations have historically dominated emissions, leading to differential treatment in environmental and economic justifications. From 1850 to 2006, Annex I nations emitted 74% of energy-related CO2, while non-Annex I nations contributed 24%. By 2005, non-Annex I nations accounted for 51% of total emissions, surpassing Annex I nations at 47%. This shift complicates assigning future obligations under the UNFCCC, as non-Annex I nations rely on fossil fuels for economic development. The differing treatment of Annex I and non-Annex I nations in addressing global climate change generates tensions. Annex I nations bear the economic costs, while non-Annex I nations have the opportunity to develop using least-cost energy regardless of emissions. This dynamic creates a perception of some developing nations getting a free ride in certain economic sectors. The Copenhagen Conference aimed to address climate change post-Kyoto by engaging the US and China, the two largest emitters. The US rejected Kyoto partly due to developing nations not curbing emissions, while China became the world's largest emitter. President Obama was proactive in engaging with China at the conference. At the Copenhagen Conference, President Obama met with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to advance negotiations on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome included progress in bridging the gap between developed and developing nations, with a goal of limiting global temperature increase below 2 degrees C. Annex I nations committed to specific emissions targets for 2020, while non-Annex I nations pledged mitigation actions and reporting procedures. The Copenhagen Conference resulted in progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on bridging the gap between developed and developing nations. The accord included a promise of $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. The top 20 greenhouse gas emitters in 2005 represented about 75% of global emissions, with the EU being the third-largest emitter after China and the United States. The EU was the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States. The top 20 emitters in 2005 accounted for 75.3% of global emissions, with China leading at 19.1% and the US at 18.3%. Only eight countries emitted 2% or more, with the top eight emitters contributing to 58.3% of global emissions. The top 20 greenhouse gas emitters in 2005 accounted for 75.3% of global emissions, with China leading at 19.1% and the US at 18.3%. Developed nations like the United States, Japan, Canada, Italy, Australia, France, Spain, and Turkey were among the top emitters, while countries like Russia, Germany, and Ukraine saw a decline in emissions due to economic changes. In the 1990s, the Russian Federation, Germany, and Ukraine ranked 3, 7, and 17 respectively, accounting for 9.0% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2005. Developed nations with free-market economies like the United Kingdom saw emissions decline between 1990 and 2005. Developing nations like China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Iran, and South Africa saw emissions rise during the same period. In 2005, 12 of the top 20 countries were Annex I countries, including 6 of the top 10 emitters. In 2005, 20 countries were Annex I countries, with 6 of the top 10 emitters. The top 20 Annex I countries accounted for 55% of greenhouse emissions, compared to 45% for developing, non-Annex I countries. China and the United States were the top emitters overall, together contributing 37.4% of global emissions. The impact of emissions on climate change is cumulative over decades and centuries, highlighting the tension between Annex I and non-Annex I perspectives. The longer-term view of emissions shows Annex I countries contributed 74% of energy-related CO2 emissions from 1850-2005, compared to 24% from non-Annex I countries. Developing countries like Brazil, South Korea, Indonesia, and Iran drop in rankings when considering historical emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions are closely linked to industrialization. Developed countries dominate cumulative emissions due to industrialization, while developing countries are increasing their annual share. Changes in land use can impact emissions, with deforestation increasing CO2 emissions and afforestation decreasing them. Certain agricultural practices can increase methane or nitrous oxide emissions, while others can sequester carbon. Data on the effects of land use changes and forestry practices on emissions are limited. Including land use in emissions calculations for 2005 highlights the significant impact on certain developing countries like Brazil and Indonesia. Brazil's emissions increase from 276 to 776 MMTCE (+181%), moving its rank from 6th to 3rd, while Indonesia's emissions rise from 159 to 557 (+250%), shifting its rank from 11th to 4th. Other top emitters see smaller adjustments, with Mexico's emissions rising by 6% and the United States experiencing a slight decrease of 1.7%. Historic land use and forestry data are not available for evaluation. Including land use in emissions calculations can disadvantage certain countries, as it highlights the impact of land-clearing and agricultural development at specific points in history. While Western developed nations and China have long-established practices, countries like Brazil and Indonesia have been clearing forests for agriculture, releasing greenhouse gases. This inclusion in emission control equations can be unfair to countries currently undergoing resource exploitation and agricultural development. The data on greenhouse gas emissions reveal issues of effectiveness and fairness in addressing global climate change. Annex I and non-Annex I nations have different responsibilities, but the dominance of emissions has shifted, with non-Annex I nations surpassing Annex I nations in global greenhouse gas emissions. However, Annex I nations still dominate in energy-related CO2 emissions. This raises contradictory fairness issues in controlling greenhouse gases. The current scheme of controlling greenhouse gases raises fairness issues for Annex I countries, as they bear most of the economic costs. Imposing controls on non-Annex I countries could hinder their development and standards of living compared to developed nations. The focus on emissions levels at specific times has differential impacts on nations, with fossil fuel use being a necessary ingredient for economic development. This distinction between developed and developing nations is determined by the emergence of the global climate change issue. Energy exploitation is crucial for economic development in developing nations, with fossil fuels being the most cost-effective option. Imposing limits on fossil energy use could lead to lower standards of living for these countries. Certain land-use activities also impact greenhouse gas emissions, with nations like Brazil and Indonesia potentially facing controls. Developed nations, like the United States and European countries, have already embedded greenhouse gas implications from past resource exploitation. The focus on 1990 as a baseline further complicates the issue. The focus on 1990 as a baseline for greenhouse gas emissions has differential impacts on nations due to their resource endowments and economic development stages. This leads to perceived inequities in addressing emissions targets. Finding equitable metrics for emissions baselines and targets is challenging. Alternative metrics for greenhouse gas emissions and economic development include per capita emissions and economic intensity of emissions. Socioeconomic differences between developed and developing nations lead to considerations about emissions beyond absolute amounts. Per capita emissions highlight the disparity between developed countries like Australia, the United States, and Canada, and non-Annex I nations. Developed countries rank highest in per capita greenhouse gas emissions. The per capita greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries like Australia, the United States, and Canada are nearly double those of the highest-ranked developing country in the top 20 emitters. Reasons for their high emissions include energy-intensive transport, coal power generation, and energy requirements for resource extraction industries. One way to address the differing interests of developed and developing nations in greenhouse gas emissions is to focus on per capita emissions for equitable energy use distribution. This approach could imply constraints for the United States compared to developing countries, depending on compliance time frames and technological advancements. Another method is to assess a nation's contribution through greenhouse gas intensity, measuring emissions per million dollars of GDP. The greenhouse gas intensity of a nation reflects its resource endowment and economic activity. Countries with rich coal resources tend to be higher emitters, while those with hydropower or natural gas resources are lower emitters. Similarly, nations with heavy industry and extensive transportation systems emit more compared to those dominated by service industries. Countries with rich coal resources tend to be higher emitters, while those with hydropower or natural gas resources are lower emitters. The greenhouse gas intensity of Brazil and Indonesia sharply increases when land use is taken into account. In 2005, the top 20 emitters ranged widely in intensity, with Ukraine at 512 tons per million international $GDP and France at 80 tons/million international $GDP. Non-Annex I nations have a narrower range, from Mexico at 136 tons/million international $GDP to China at 372 tons/million international $GDP. Brazil and Indonesia's intensity would dramatically rise when considering land use, jumping Brazil by 182% to 490. In 2005, greenhouse gas intensity increased significantly in Brazil and Indonesia due to land use changes, with Brazil jumping by 182% to 490 tons/million international $GDP and Indonesia by 250% to 790 tons/million international $GDP. The decline in intensity globally from 1990 to 2005 was -1.6% annually, driven by cost efficiencies, policies promoting alternative energy sources, and substitutions for harmful chemicals. However, focusing on intensity alone may not be sufficient as actual emissions can still rise due to population and economic growth. In 2005, the United States ranked 122 in greenhouse gas intensity globally, a more favorable metric than absolute emissions. The US is less efficient compared to Western European countries and Japan but more efficient than China, India, Brazil, and others. China pledged to cut its carbon intensity by 40-45% by 2020 from a 2005 baseline. China's greenhouse gas intensity in 2005 ranked 34, indicating its economy was GHG-inefficient. China's historical trend for intensity showed a decline from 1990 to 2005. Issues of effectiveness and fairness arise in global climate change efforts, with responsibilities not focused on all largest emitters. The UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol focus on historical emissions as a baseline for regulation, leading to differential impacts on nations. Developed countries bear the economic costs of reducing emissions while non-Annex I countries can increase emissions for development. However, this approach has had little effect on global emissions, with major emitters like the US and China hesitant to join international efforts. The US withdrew from the Kyoto process under the Bush administration, and challenges persist, as seen in the Copenhagen meetings. The history of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol raises questions about developing greenhouse gas targets and implementation strategies. The UNFCCC recognizes the right of developing countries to develop while all countries have a responsibility to protect the global climate. A regime combining per capita emissions and carbon intensity may be necessary for an effective climate change framework. Global targets focused on per capita emissions can benefit developing nations by allowing room for economic growth. Developing nations have room for economic growth with global targets focused on per capita emissions. A target of 3 tons carbon per person would benefit most developing nations, except South Korea. Greenhouse gas intensity goals could have diverse implications for developing nations, as some produce higher emissions per GDP than developed nations. For example, in 2005, China's carbon intensity was four times higher than the United Kingdom's and Italy's. A greenhouse gas intensity goal could impact economic development for some countries, creating winners and losers in a regime combining per capita and carbon intensity measures. Adding land-use implications would complicate the regime, affecting nations like Indonesia and Brazil. The United States would need to constrain emissions over time, as its greenhouse gas intensity is declining but not enough to offset increased emissions from population and economic growth. Economic costs of targets would depend on the regulatory scheme. The economic costs of targets would depend on the time frame and implementation strategy of the regulatory scheme. Many countries have struggled to stabilize emissions despite voluntary goals, leading to the Kyoto Agreement and the Copenhagen meeting. Using economic contraction as an emission reduction strategy is not a viable option. The implementation and compliance of emission reduction strategies, such as the Kyoto Agreement and the UNFCCC, remain challenging. Economic contraction as a method to reduce emissions is not feasible. Instead, the focus should be on developing less carbon-intensive technology and improving land-management strategies to stabilize emissions in the long term. The United States and other countries have struggled to meet emission reduction goals, indicating the difficulty in achieving significant progress. The Copenhagen Accord asks nations to voluntarily commit to emission reductions, with a flexible strategy allowing each country to play to its strengths. Market-based mechanisms focus on reducing emissions through either quantity or price controls. A tradeable permit program sets emissions limits with market determining permit value, while a carbon tax sets maximum cost for emission reduction. Implementation choice depends on economic cost tolerance or specific reduction goals. Combinations of approaches are possible for flexibility. The top 20 countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions need significant flexibility to reach any agreement. Appendices provide rankings and indicators for these emitters in 2005."
