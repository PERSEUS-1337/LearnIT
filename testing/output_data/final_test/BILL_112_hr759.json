The \"Federal Lands Counterdrug Strategy Act\" requires the Director of National Drug Control Policy to submit a strategy to Congress every 2 years to prevent illegal drug activities on federal lands. It outlines specific roles, responsibilities, and resources for relevant agencies involved in implementing the strategy. The Federal Lands Counterdrug Strategy Act mandates the collaboration of various agencies to implement a strategy to reduce marijuana cultivation and trafficking on federal lands. It also includes an analysis of how land-management laws impact drug law enforcement. The analysis will assess whether land-management laws hinder enforcement of controlled substances laws on covered lands, specifically looking at restrictions that limit law enforcement tools and access to certain areas. The Director will consult with relevant agencies to develop the Federal Lands Counterdrug Strategy, including assessing the need for additional authorities to prevent the importation, manufacture, distribution, possession, or use of controlled substances on covered lands. The Federal Lands Counterdrug Strategy will be developed in consultation with relevant agencies to address drug-related activities on covered lands. The strategy will not alter existing agency authorities but may suggest changes. The Director will submit the strategy to Congress and handle classified information appropriately. The Federal Lands Counterdrug Strategy, developed in consultation with relevant agencies, addresses drug-related activities on covered lands.

The Federal Lands Counterdrug Strategy defines terms like \"controlled substance\" and \"covered lands\" as per section 702(7) of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998."
