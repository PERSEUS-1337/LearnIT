    "content": "In this paper, a supervised algorithm called DNA-GAN is proposed to disentangle different attributes of images by using DNA-like latent representations. The algorithm aims to address limitations in existing algorithms such as unpredictable disentangling factors and lack of identity information. By introducing a discriminator for adversarial training, the method is able to generate realistic images and disentangled representations. Experiments on Multi-PIE and CelebA datasets show the effectiveness of the approach in overcoming limitations of other methods. The effectiveness of machine learning algorithms relies on data representation, with the ability to automatically learn good representations making it easier to extract useful information. Disentangling factors of variation is crucial for separating explanatory factors in data, such as gender, hair style, and facial expression in human-face images. In this paper, a supervised method called DNA-GAN is proposed to obtain disentangled representations of images. The idea is inspired by the DNA double helix structure, where different visual attributes in an image are controlled by different pieces of encodings in its latent representations. DNA-GAN uses an encoder to separate attribute-relevant and attribute-irrelevant parts of an image for more efficient classification. DNA-GAN is a supervised algorithm that disentangles attributes in images by separating attribute-relevant and attribute-irrelevant parts. It uses adversarial discriminator and reconstruction loss to reconstruct input images and generate new ones with new attributes. Through iterative training, DNA-GAN gradually disentangles attributes in latent representations. The supervised algorithm DNA-GAN disentangles multiple attributes in images by introducing the annihilating operation to prevent trivial solutions. It employs iterative training to handle unbalanced multi-attribute image data efficiently. Traditional representation learning algorithms focus on probabilistic graphical models and geometrical approaches, while recent research has actively focused on this area. Recent research has shifted towards developing deep probabilistic models that learn data distribution, such as BID9 using variational inference. In the semi-supervised setting, BID18 learns disentangled representations, while BID2 introduces ML-VAE for grouped observations. In the unsupervised setting, InfoGAN maximizes mutual information between latent variables and observations, but suffers from unstable training. Another method, \u03b2-VAE, emphasizes disentangled representations. Supervised methods like DC-IGN and TD-GAN aim to disentangle factors using labeled data, improving image quality through adversarial training. However, identity information needs labeling for attribute swapping, limiting its applicability. Our model does not require explicit id information or multi-stage training, unlike other models that rely on labeled data for attribute swapping. Many GAN-based architectures have explored image-to-image translation between unpaired data with weak supervision, similar to our approach. Our model generalizes to multi-attribute image data using iterative training to handle unbalanced datasets. It considers a set of multi-labeled images X and labels Y, where each image X_i has a corresponding label Y_i. The labels are n-dimensional vectors representing attributes. The facial image X_i with label Y_i = (1, 0, 1) should show a smiling face with bangs and no eyeglasses. DNA-GAN consists of an encoder (Enc), decoder (Dec), and discriminator (D). The encoder maps real-world images A and B to latent representations where a_i controls the i-th attribute in the label, and z_a keeps other factors and image identity. A and B must have different labels, (y_1, y_2) respectively, with A for dominant and B for recessive patterns. The focus is on one attribute at a time in the framework. In DNA-GAN, the latent representations of A and B are obtained by copying Enc(A) and annihilating b_i in Enc(B). Swapping elements results in new latent representations decoded into A 2 and B 2. Reconstruction losses ensure quality, and D helps in generating samples. A 1 and B 1 are reconstructions, while A 2 and B 2 are novel crossbreeds. The text discusses using an adversarial discriminator to make generated samples indistinguishable from each other. The encoder and decoder receive reconstruction and GAN losses to measure quality and realism. The discriminator evaluates the generated image's realism based on its label. The discriminator in the model receives GAN loss to distinguish between images A and B. Trivial solutions exist without the annihilating operation, leading to four children in a single-attribute case. Reconstruction loss ensures invertibility between latent encoding and image space, while the adversarial discriminator aims to disentangle attributes from other information. Generative adversarial networks reach the best solution at Nash equilibrium. Without the annihilating operation, information of the whole image could be encoded into the attribute-relevant part, leading to issues with discrimination between images A and B. To prevent trivial solutions, the annihilating operation is adopted by replacing the recessive pattern with a zero tensor. This ensures that the encodings contain relevant information and avoid ambiguity in depicting the person with borrowed attributes. The encodings of B 1 and A 2 contain no information, forcing the attribute-irrelevant part to encode image details. Iterative training is used to disentangle attributes by updating the model with pairs of images with opposite labels. This method is more effective than training with random pairs, especially for unbalanced datasets. The dataset is unbalanced, with proofs in the Appendix. It consists of multi-attribute images with labels represented by n-dimensional vectors. The dataset has 2^n kinds of labels. The balancedness of the dataset with respect to attributes is defined. Iterative training is used to disentangle attributes by updating the model with pairs of images with opposite labels. This method is more effective than training with random pairs, especially for unbalanced datasets. Theorem 2 shows that iterative training is more efficient than random pairs of images when the number of attributes meets a certain criterion. The function (\u03c1 + 1) 2 /(2\u03c1) is related to balancedness, with a minimum at \u03c1 = 1 for a balanced dataset. Iterative training helps stabilize the training process on unbalanced datasets by making it easier to satisfy the criterion. The training process on unbalanced datasets involves selecting pairs of images with specific labels, ignoring pairs that are not useful for training. This can lead to the model being trained more towards one attribute, affecting the overall training process. The training process on unbalanced datasets involves selecting pairs of images with specific labels, ignoring pairs that are not useful for training. This can lead to the model being trained more towards one attribute, affecting the overall training process. Most of the time, the model is trained with respect to the second attribute, making the final learned model less effective for the first attribute. Iterative training evenly updates the model with respect to two attributes to prevent this issue. Experimental validation on real-world datasets using RMSProp BID20 optimization method and other techniques show the effectiveness of the methods. The Multi-PIE BID5 face database contains over 750,000 images of 337 subjects captured under 15 view points and 19 illumination conditions. Aligned images are resized into 128 \u00d7 128 inputs. Light illumination face images are labeled as 1 and dark illumination face images as 0. DNA-GAN effectively disentangles illumination factor from other factors. CelebA BID12 dataset has 202599 face images with attribute vectors and landmark locations. Images are aligned, cropped, and scaled down to 64 \u00d7 64. In experiments using the CelebA dataset, TD-GAN and IcGAN were compared. TD-GAN requires explicit id information in the label, which was encoded in its latent representations. The experimental results of swapping attributes like Bangs, Eyeglasses, and Smiling were compared between the two models. The experimental results compared the swapping of attributes like Bangs, Eyeglasses, and Smiling between TD-GAN and IcGAN models. TD-GAN encodes id information in its latent representations, leading to trivial solutions, while IcGAN's multi-stage training process results in poor image quality. DNA-GAN successfully disentangles multiple attributes in the latent representations. The DNA-GAN algorithm can learn disentangled representations from multi-attribute data, as demonstrated in FIG3 and FIG4. The model effectively interpolates attribute subspaces and showcases generalization potential on unseen data. DNA-GAN is an algorithm that learns disentangled representations from multi-attribute images. The latent representations consist of attribute-relevant and attribute-irrelevant parts, allowing for the creation of new latent representations that can be decoded into novel images with designed attributes. The iterative training strategy helps disentangle multiple attributes in the latent space, overcoming difficulties with unbalanced datasets. Experimental results show DNA-GAN's effectiveness in image editing and learning disentangled representations, with potential applications in interpretable deep learning, image understanding, and transfer learning. However, there are limitations, such as background information being encoded into the attribute-relevant part. The background color changes when swapping attributes in DNA-GAN. The model may struggle with highly correlated attributes like Male and Mustache. Future work includes addressing these challenges. Theorem 1 requires Lemma 1, which discusses the expected number of trials needed to collect a subset of elements. The probability of collecting a new element is calculated using p i = (n \u2212 (i \u2212 1))/m. The expected number of iterations for randomly selecting pairs to select all useful pairs at least once is determined. In iterative training, pairs of images with different labels are selected each time. In iterative training, pairs of images with different labels are selected each time. The subproblem involves considering the indices of labels with specific elements, leading to the calculation of all possible pairs."
