The Electronic Fund Transfer Act is amended to include new section 918, which outlines ATM security requirements. The ATM Consumer Protection Act requires the Board to establish regulations for ATM operators to implement security measures to prevent crimes and aid in identifying offenders within 6 months of enactment. Minimum standards include security programs for deterrence and apprehension of criminals. The ATM operator must establish procedures to identify and preserve evidence of crimes at ATMs, designate a security officer for each machine, and ensure adequate lighting. The ATM operator must ensure adequate lighting at all times for each machine, allowing consumers to see all persons in the building or space. The ATM operator must ensure sufficient lighting for each machine to brightly illuminate the area within 5 feet and adequately illuminate at least 50 feet in any unobstructed direction. The ATM operator must provide sufficient lighting for the machine and nearby parking areas, as well as access points from adjacent sides of buildings or spaces, to ensure adequate illumination at all times. Each automated teller machine operator must ensure that each ATM is equipped with surveillance cameras to monitor users and activities within 3 feet of the machine. Recordings must be maintained as per standards. Each automated teller machine operator must maintain recordings made by surveillance cameras for a minimum of 30 days.
