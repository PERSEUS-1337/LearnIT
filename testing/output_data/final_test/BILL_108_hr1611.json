    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teacher Mentoring Act\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of high-quality teaching in improving the educational system. High teacher turnover rates, especially in low-income schools, hinder the ability to maintain a high-quality teaching environment. Nearly half of new teachers leave the profession within their first 5 years, with better support for beginning teachers being a key reform to retain more educators. Reforms promoting mentoring programs can help school systems retain more teachers, especially in low-income areas. Teachers with mentoring programs are less likely to leave the profession, highlighting the importance of ensuring all students have access to high-quality education through such programs. SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR TEACHER MENTORING PROGRAMS. Part C of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a grant program for Teacher Mentoring Programs. The Secretary may award grants to local educational agencies to establish teacher mentoring programs. The grants must be used to set qualifications for mentors, provide training and stipends, offer mentoring for new teachers, and allow observation of teaching methods. The Secretary may award grants to local educational agencies for teacher mentoring programs in low-performing schools. Grants will be evaluated annually for impact and progress, with a duration of 3 years. \"SEC. 2372. LOW-INCOME LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.\" The Secretary must allocate at least 50% of grants under section 2371 to low-income local educational agencies. A low-income local educational agency is defined as one where at least 30% of children come from families below the poverty line and meets certain criteria related to teacher qualifications, unfilled positions, or teacher turnover rates. In awarding grants, the Secretary aims for equitable distribution among US regions and local educational agencies in urban, rural, and suburban areas. Application process is outlined in Section 2374. To apply for a grant under this section, a local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary including a mentor program plan, details on how the program will benefit new teachers and increase retention rates, research basis for the plan, evaluation and accountability plan, and any other required information. Authorization of appropriations is outlined in Section 2375. \"Authorization of appropriations for Teacher Mentoring Programs under Section 2375 for fiscal years 2004 through 2009.\" The Secretary of Education must report to Congress on the results of the mentoring programs funded under the Act, specifically focusing on the impact on teacher retention rates, at least 3 years after the first grant award."
