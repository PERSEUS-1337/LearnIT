The Second Treaty of Fort Bridger secured the Reservation as a permanent home. The Blackfoot River serves as the northern boundary of the Reservation, flowing westerly, with rangeland dominating land use in the watershed. The Blackfoot River Reservation in Idaho is characterized by rangeland, dry and irrigated farming, and residential development. In 1964, a flood protection project was completed by the Corps of Engineers on the River, authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1950 and sponsored by the Blackfoot River Flood Control District No. 7. The project included building levees, replacing structures, bridges, and channel realignment, which resulted in Indian land located north of the Realigned River and non-Indian land to the south. The Cadastral Survey Office conducted surveys of Indian and non-Indian land parcels in 1999 to resolve disputes related to the realignment of the River in 1964. The Act aims to settle land ownership and land use conflicts resulting from the Corps of Engineers' project.
