    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Post-Abortion Depression Research and Care Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to post-abortion depression. Congress finds that approximately 1,186,000 unplanned pregnancies in the United States end in elective abortion each year. Abortion can have severe and long-term effects on women's mental and emotional well-being, leading to symptoms such as post-abortion depression, guilt, sadness, and even suicidal urges. Women who have had abortions may experience a range of mental health issues such as substance abuse, intrusive thoughts, decision-making difficulties, and lack of social support, leading to increased psychological distress over time. Post-abortion depression can be exacerbated by lack of social support and societal misunderstanding. Social pressure to have an abortion can lead to immediate regret and long-term mental distress. Prompt diagnosis and personalized care, including therapy and medication, can help treat post-abortion depression. The emotional aftermath of abortion can lead to serious negative consequences for women, including a high chance of experiencing major depression and anxiety, especially for those who have had an abortion. After abortion, women had a 64.3% chance of experiencing thoughts of suicide, higher than those who did not have an abortion (35.7%) or did not become pregnant (23%). Research on post-abortion depression and psychosis is being expanded and intensified through the activities of the National Institute of Mental Health. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the National Institute of Mental Health, is expanding research on post-abortion depression and psychosis. Coordination with other national research institutes is required, and programs for post-abortion conditions will be conducted or supported. The Director of the Institute will conduct or support research on post-abortion conditions, including basic research, epidemiological studies, diagnostic techniques development, clinical research for new treatments, and information/education programs. Additionally, a longitudinal study will be conducted. The Director of the Institute will conduct a national longitudinal study to determine the incidence and prevalence of post-abortion conditions, with a focus on identifying characteristics and developing diagnostic techniques. $3,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2012 for this purpose.
