    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Common Sense Housing Investment Act of 2017\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that there is a significant disparity in budgetary resources allocated to supporting home ownership compared to affordable rental housing. This has resulted in a shortage of over 7 million affordable homes for low-income families, with only one in four eligible families receiving rental housing assistance. The shortage of affordable rental homes for low-income households is a major cause of homelessness in the United States. Public housing facilities have over $26 billion in deferred maintenance, leading to a loss of 10,000 units annually. The low-income housing tax credit provides 100,000 affordable housing units each year. Recommendations have been made to cap the mortgage interest deduction for fairer distribution. The mortgage interest deduction primarily benefits the top 20 percent of earners, with fewer than half of tax filers with a home mortgage claiming it. Only 9 percent of rural tax filers claim this deduction, and the majority of homes sold are priced below $500,000. A more equitable approach is needed to support low- and moderate-income homeowners and invest in affordable rental housing to address homelessness and assist those with very low incomes. SEC. 3. REPLACEMENT OF MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION WITH MORTGAGE INTEREST CREDIT. This section introduces a nonrefundable credit for interest on indebtedness secured by a qualified residence. A 15 percent tax credit is allowed for qualified residence interest paid by individuals during the taxable year. Qualified residence interest includes interest on acquisition indebtedness or home equity indebtedness with respect to the taxpayer's qualified residence. The determination of a qualified residence is made at the time the interest is accrued. The aggregate amount of indebtedness for tax purposes is limited to $500,000 ($250,000 for married individuals filing separately). Acquisition indebtedness refers to debt incurred in acquiring, constructing, or improving a qualified residence, secured by the residence, including refinanced debt meeting these criteria. The term 'home equity indebtedness' refers to any debt secured by a qualified residence that does not exceed the fair market value of the residence minus the amount of acquisition indebtedness. The aggregate amount of home equity indebtedness for any period is limited. The aggregate amount of home equity indebtedness for any period is limited to $100,000 ($50,000 for married individuals filing separately). Special rules apply, including defining a qualified residence as the taxpayer's principal residence and one other selected residence used as a residence. Married couples not filing jointly are treated as one taxpayer. The tax code allows married couples to be treated as one taxpayer for certain purposes, with each individual entitled to claim one residence unless both agree otherwise. If a taxpayer does not rent a dwelling unit during the year, it can still be considered a residence. Additionally, indebtedness can still be considered secured by property even if it is subject to debtor protection laws. The tax code allows married couples to be treated as one taxpayer for certain purposes, with each individual entitled to claim one residence unless both agree otherwise. If a taxpayer does not rent a dwelling unit during the year, it can still be considered a residence. Additionally, under debtor protection laws, the security interest may be ineffective or restricted. Special rules apply for estates and trusts regarding qualified residence interest. In the case of taxable years 2017 through 2021, taxpayers may elect to apply this section instead of the deduction for qualified residence interest. The tax code allows married couples to claim one residence each unless both agree otherwise. Special rules apply for estates and trusts regarding qualified residence interest, with a phaseout of the deduction starting in 2017. The applicable percentage for qualified residence interest deduction decreases over the years: 100% in 2017, 80% in 2018, 60% in 2019, 40% in 2020, 20% in 2021, and 0% from 2022 onwards. The mortgage limit for taxable years 2017 through 2021 will be phased down, with specified amounts replacing the original limits of $1,000,000 and $500,000. The mortgage limit for taxable years 2017 through 2021 will be phased down, with specified amounts replacing the original limits of $1,000,000 and $500,000. The amounts specified in the following table will apply. The mortgage limits for taxable years 2017 through 2021 will be phased down, with amounts substituted for $1,000,000 and $500,000 as follows:\n2017 - $1,000,000 and $500,000\n2018 - $900,000 and $450,000\n2019 - $800,000 and $400,000\n2020 - $700,000 and $350,000\n2021 - $600,000 and $300,000. The amendments made by this section include allowing deductions for interest and taxes related to land for dwelling purposes owned or leased by cooperative housing corporations. Additionally, mortgage interest savings can be used to increase low-income housing tax credits. These changes apply to amounts paid or accrued after December 31, 2016. The amendments made by this section include increasing the cost-of-living adjustment for low-income housing tax credits under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The $2,000,000 amount in subparagraph (C) will be adjusted annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for each calendar year. The cost-of-living adjustment for low-income housing tax credits will be increased annually. The $2.70 amount in subparagraph (C) will be adjusted for calendar years after 2017 based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for each year. The cost-of-living adjustment for low-income housing tax credits will be increased annually. Amendments will be made to the $2,000,000 and $2.70 amounts in section 42(d)(5)(B) of the Code for rounding purposes. The eligible basis of a building serving extremely low-income households must be 150 percent of the basis determined for the portion of units designated for such households. The amendments made by this section shall apply to allocations made in calendar years beginning after December 31, 2017. SEC. 6. USE OF MORTGAGE INTEREST SAVINGS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of the Treasury will determine remaining revenues from the enactment of section 3 of the Act and allocate them to the Housing Trust Fund and rental assistance, including a new Renter's Tax Credit. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will allocate remaining revenues to the Public Housing Capital Fund and revise regulations for the Housing Trust Fund within six months of the Act's enactment. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 will be revised to increase flexibility, allow public housing agencies to receive grants, and eliminate rules based on the HOME Investment Partnerships Act."
