    "content": "Some policymakers are interested in having the federal government offset child care costs through the child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC). This report analyzes potential policy changes to the CDCTC, such as making the credit refundable or increasing the maximum expenses that could be claimed. It also provides estimates of families' characteristics that claim the credit, comparing them with those that do not. The report analyzes potential policy changes to the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC), comparing families that claim the credit with those that do not. It discusses four selected policy changes: making the credit refundable, converting it to a deduction, increasing the credit rate, and increasing qualifying expenses. Policymakers can mix and match these options to achieve desired policy goals. Eligibility criteria include incurring qualifying expenses for a qualifying individual and having earned income. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) requires incurring qualifying expenses for a qualifying individual and having earned income. Qualifying expenses are for the care of a dependent child or spouse incapable of self-care to enable the taxpayer to work. Earned income is necessary to claim the credit, with a maximum of $3,000 in qualifying expenses. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) allows for a maximum of $3,000 in qualifying expenses for one qualifying individual, or up to $6,000 for two or more qualifying individuals. The credit rate ranges from 35% to 20% based on adjusted gross income (AGI), with the maximum credit rate decreasing as AGI increases. The AGI levels for the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit are not adjusted for inflation. Lower-income taxpayers may receive little or no credit due to the nonrefundable nature of the credit. Estimates in this report were derived using sample data from a Census household survey and the TRIM3 microsimulation model. Researchers use survey data to estimate characteristics like child care spending and benefit receipt since data on every American family is not available. Information on tax liabilities, benefits, and subsidies from the Child Care and Development Fund is not directly available from the Census household survey. The TRIM3 microsimulation model is used to estimate variables like child care spending and benefit receipt, with potential for sampling and model errors. Estimates in this report may differ from IRS data due to various reasons like misreporting. Appendices provide detailed methodology and assumptions used in the estimates. Tax units claiming credits may be higher than TRIM3 estimates due to misreporting. This report uses 2014 data to analyze tax units and taxpayers, defining them as filers, spouses, and dependents. The analyzed population includes tax units with at least one taxpayer. The analyzed population consists of taxpayers with at least one dependent child under 13, with 19% of tax units in 2014 meeting this criteria. The population is divided into recipients (claiming the CDCTC) and non-recipients. The report focuses on specific income quintiles within this population. The analysis focuses on taxpayers with dependent children under 13, divided into recipients and non-recipients of the CDCTC. Income quintiles are used to compare characteristics, with the bottom quintile representing the lowest income and the top quintile the highest. CDCTC recipients had a median income of $88,036 in 2014, compared to $52,000 for all tax units with dependent children under 13. The median income for CDCTC recipients with at least 1 dependent child under age 13 was $52,000 in 2014. Eligibility for the credit is based on earnings, making very low-income taxpayers without earnings ineligible. CDCTC recipients are mostly married, dual-earning families with one or two children. Each spouse in the tax unit must work to qualify for the CDCTC. Among taxpayers with children under 13 years old, out-of-pocket child care expenses vary widely. The lowest income quintile has a median expense of $857, while the highest income quintile has a median expense of $6,000. Some taxpayers in the highest income quintile have over $25,000 in child care expenses. The associated figures show estimates of the distributional impact of selected policy changes to the CDCTC. The panels summarize the change in the CDCTC across income quintiles and illustrate how the policy option would affect a specific family with child care expenses. The hypothetical family in the report is a married couple with two children and $6,000 in qualified child care expenses. The CDCTC is currently a nonrefundable credit, limiting its value by the taxpayer's income tax liability. Making it refundable would allow taxpayers to claim the full credit, benefiting lower-income populations, especially those in the lowest two income quintiles. The bottom 40% of taxpayers would receive most of the $1 billion in additional credit dollars from the policy change. Low-income taxpayers with little to no income tax liability are currently not eligible for nonrefundable tax credits like the CDCTC. There have been proposals to convert the credit into an above-the-line deduction available to all taxpayers. The proposed policy change would allow taxpayers to deduct out-of-pocket child care expenses from their income, benefiting upper-income taxpayers the most due to higher deductions and tax savings for those in higher tax brackets. This change is estimated to cost $4.5 billion per year. The tax deduction benefits vary based on the taxpayer's bracket, with higher brackets saving more money. Some taxpayers may receive a smaller benefit from a deduction compared to a credit. Married couples with income between $40,000 and $100,000 see a lower benefit from the deduction than from the credit. The value of the deduction falls between $150,000 and $200,000 for other taxpayers due to factors like the phase-out of the child tax credit. Policymakers may consider changing the credit rate, which currently benefits lower-income taxpayers more. Increasing the child care credit rate to 50% for all taxpayers would cost approximately $4.7 billion per year and primarily benefit upper-income taxpayers due to their higher child care expenses. Increasing the child care credit rate to 50% for all taxpayers would cost approximately $4.7 billion per year and primarily benefit upper-income taxpayers due to their higher child care expenses. Policymakers may consider increasing the maximum amount of expenses used to calculate the credit, potentially doubling the current limits to $6,000 and $12,000. This policy change would have cost around $1.6 billion in 2014, with the majority of the benefit going to higher-income taxpayers in the top two income quintiles. The distributional impact of policy changes on the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) is influenced by child care expenditures and the refundability of the credit. The current CDCTC does not benefit lower-income families as they tend to owe no federal taxes and have lower out-of-pocket child care expenses. This does not necessarily mean they do not have child care needs, but rather that their needs are met differently. The cost of making the CDCTC refundable is estimated at $1 billion per year, which is less than other policy options. Lower-income families may still have lower credit amounts even with a refundable credit. Making the credit refundable could increase costs if it encourages more lower-income families to use paid child care. However, a once-a-year tax credit, even if refundable, may have limited value for lower-income families who still have ongoing out-of-pocket expenses for child care. Policy options to enhance the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) include increasing the credit rate or maximum expenses, which would provide additional tax relief for child care costs. Converting the CDCTC to a deduction may benefit higher-income taxpayers more. The cost of making the CDCTC refundable is estimated at $1 billion per year, with lower-income families potentially receiving lower credit amounts. The options to enhance the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) include making the credit refundable, converting it to a deduction, raising the credit rate to 50%, and doubling the maximum qualified child care expenses allowed by the credit. Two microsimulation models were used to simulate the effects of these options on federal income tax credits and liabilities. The report illustrates the effects of four policy options on the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) for a hypothetical family with specific earnings and child care expenses. Assumptions include a married couple with two children, ages one and seven, with $6,000 in annual child care expenses. Additional assumptions are made to calculate the CDCTC and federal income tax liability for this family. The calculator assumes all children are dependents of the tax filer and qualified for the CDCTC. It also assumes the parents are married, filing jointly, both work, and earn at least minimum wage per hour. If earnings are below full-time minimum wage, hours are calculated accordingly. If working less than 20 hours, part-time child care is assumed. This impacts the proposal to make the CDCTC refundable. The proposal to make the CDCTC refundable is affected by various factors such as the impact of child care expenses on federal taxes for different types of families. The TRIM3 microsimulation model is used to analyze how different options would change the federal income tax subsidy for child care expenses across the income distribution. The TRIM3 microsimulation model estimates federal tax credits and liabilities, using the ASEC Supplement to the Current Population Survey sample. The ASEC survey collects demographic and work-related data from approximately 94,000 households in the U.S. The ASEC survey collects demographic and work-related data from households in the U.S. The estimates in the report are weighted to be representative of the U.S. population. Sampling error may affect the estimates. The TRIM3 model applies rules to the population for a specific year. Estimates in the report are based on the 2015 ASEC for federal income tax credits and liabilities. Data used by CRS is publicly available on the TRIM website. The report analyzes extended tax units with dependents under 13 years old, sorting them by total income including market income and government benefits. Data is sourced from the TRIM3 federal income tax module for 2014, using ASEC data to simulate tax filing units. The report analyzes extended tax units with dependents under 13 years old, sorting them by total income including market income and government benefits. It includes cash government benefits like Social Security and Unemployment Insurance, as well as public assistance payments. Noncash benefits are excluded. Total money income is used for income quintiles instead of AGI. The CDCTC option cannot be used to evaluate policy options affecting AGI. TRIM3 uses out-of-pocket child care expenditures reported in the ASEC questionnaire. The Child Care and Development Block Grant subsidizes child care for families. TRIM3 adjusts child care expenses for higher-income taxpayers. It assumes some use employer-sponsored savings accounts for dependent care. The version of TRIM3 available for analysis provides static estimates of policy impact. Assumptions were made for analyzing CDCTC recipients and policy options. The credit is claimed exclusively for child care expenses. Administrative data from the IRS show that most credit dollars are used for child care. The analysis focuses on eligible families with children and the impact of child care expenses on the CDCTC. Taxpayers may claim an exclusion for employer-provided child care. The FSA is assumed to remain unchanged, potentially leading to an underestimation of the credit impact."
