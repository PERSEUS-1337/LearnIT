Congress finds that public transportation systems are crucial for Americans, with 6,800 systems used for 35,000,000 trips daily. However, these systems are increasingly targeted by terrorists, as seen in attacks in Madrid, London, and a foiled plot near Amtrak tracks in 2011. In 2011, a foiled plot involved explosives near Amtrak tracks. In 2016, a terrorist attack in Brussels targeted the airport and a metro station, resulting in casualties. The Global Terrorism Database recorded 57 transportation terror attacks from 2006 to 2014. The Federal Government must balance security and accessibility in public transportation, as mandated by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. Homeland Security oversees public transportation security. Reports in May 2016 highlighted limited oversight of Amtrak's passenger security and recommended measures for resource allocation by the Federal Air Marshal Service. Congress needs to provide necessary resources to combat terrorism and ensure effective use through oversight. Rail security measures, including assigning rail carriers to high-risk tiers and establishing a rail security training program, must be expedited according to the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act. Additionally, visible intermodal prevention and response teams are to be implemented. SEC. 4 amends the authorization of appropriations for visible intermodal prevention and response teams for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. SEC. 5 focuses on public transportation security research and development. SEC. 5 amends the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to allocate necessary funds for public transportation security research and development for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. SEC. 6 addresses railroad security by authorizing appropriations for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. SEC. 7 pertains to over-the-road bus security assistance. SEC. 7 amends the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to authorize appropriations for over-the-road bus security assistance for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. The Secretary of Homeland Security will develop the \"Local Transit Security Instructor Training Program\" at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. The program will provide intensive training on public transit security, leadership skills, and technical skills for trainee officers. The program will be made available to interested individuals. The Secretary will make the program available to eligible law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction over areas where public transit operates. The Federal Air Marshal Program's effectiveness will be evaluated. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure that the Federal Air Marshal Service focuses on high-risk flights by considering risk in resource allocation, conducting risk assessments, and evaluating threat environments for different modes of transportation. The Federal Air Marshal Service must consider risk in resource allocation and evaluate threat environments for different modes of transportation. They should document the rationale for selecting international destinations for air marshal deployment and report performance results for TSA coverage scores to FAMS and TSA leadership."
