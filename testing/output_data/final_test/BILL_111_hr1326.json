    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Great Ape Protection Act of 2009\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. Congress finds that great apes are highly intelligent and social animals, and invasive research on them for economic purposes significantly impacts interstate commerce, particularly in the development of drugs and pharmaceuticals. The regulation of animals and activities under this Act is necessary to effectively regulate interstate and foreign commerce. The National Research Council report on chimpanzees in research emphasizes moral responsibility for their care, a moratorium on breeding, and avoiding euthanasia for population control. The Great Ape Protection Act aims to prohibit invasive research on great apes, their breeding for research purposes, and their transport for such research. It also requires lifetime care for federally owned apes in suitable sanctuaries.
