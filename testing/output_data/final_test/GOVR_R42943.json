    "content": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes job openings data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), providing insight into the number of workers employers plan to hire. This data complements existing information on unemployment rates and employment, offering a unique perspective on the labor market. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening, included in the report, combines supply and demand measures, offering nuanced information for Congress to consider. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening, tracked from January 2001 through February 2012, combines supply and demand measures. It divides the number of unemployed persons actively looking for jobs by the number of job openings, providing insight into the excess supply of labor relative to employer needs. This statistic offers valuable information on the labor market, complementing traditional indicators like the unemployment rate. Figures and tables in the report show the ratio for the United States. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening is highly correlated with the unemployment rate between 2001 and 2012. During recessionary periods, the ratio rises significantly, especially in goods-producing industries. Despite modest improvements post-recession, the ratio remains higher than pre-2007 levels. This section analyzes unemployment and job openings separately to build the ratio. During the period from January 2001 to February 2012, job openings fluctuated in correlation with the economy, being more abundant during economic growth and fewer during recessions. This trend is reflected in the ratio of unemployed persons per job opening, which is a key indicator of the U.S. labor market. During economic contractions or recessions, businesses may freeze job vacancies or lay off workers, leading to a rise in unemployment rates. Not all businesses hire during economic expansion, but overall trends show fluctuations in job openings and unemployment. Figure 1 illustrates the monthly number of unemployed individuals and job openings from January 2001 to February 2012, with shaded columns indicating two recessions during this period. During 2001 and 2007-2009, the US economy experienced recessions as declared by the NBER. Unemployment fluctuated during these periods, reaching a low of 6.7 million in March 2007 before increasing to 7.6 million. During the 2007-2009 recession, unemployment rose sharply to 15.4 million before decreasing to 12.8 million in February 2012. Job openings fluctuated with the business cycle, reaching a high of 4.7 million in November 2006 and March 2007, then dropping to 2.2 million in July 2009 before increasing to 3.6 million by February 2012. As of February 2012, job openings totaled 3.6 million. Job openings preceded changes in unemployment rates post-2006 recession. Job openings peaked in 2007 at 4.7 million before declining, while unemployment rates rose later. The relationship between job openings and unemployment remains uncertain. In 2003, job openings did not lead unemployment changes. The text discusses the potential of job openings as an early indicator of changes in unemployment rates. It highlights the delay in publishing estimates and introduces the ratio of unemployed persons per job opening. The section also compares this ratio with other labor market indicators to provide nuanced information. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening combines supply and demand measures in the labor market. Lower values indicate easier job finding, while higher values suggest more difficulty. Unemployed persons represent the supply of labor, while job openings reflect the demand for workers. This ratio helps assess job availability considering the number of job seekers and available positions. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening is a key indicator of job availability, with lower values indicating easier job finding. The ratio is highly correlated with the unemployment rate and rises during recessionary periods, remaining at higher levels post-recession. This ratio serves as a unique indicator of changes in the labor market. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening is highly correlated with the unemployment rate, showing modest improvements post-recession. Figure 2 graphs the monthly ratio from January 2001 to February 2012, indicating fluctuations with the business cycle. This ratio serves as a unique indicator of changes in the labor market. The unemployment rate and the ratio of unemployed persons per job opening fluctuate with the business cycle, increasing during recessions and decreasing during economic expansions. These labor market indicators roughly correspond with the economy, with unemployment rising during recessions and job openings decreasing. This ratio serves as a unique indicator of changes in the labor market. During economic expansions, the unemployment rate decreases as job openings increase. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening rises during recessions, reaching high levels in the 2007-2009 recession. This ratio serves as a unique indicator of changes in the labor market. During the 2007-2009 recession, the ratio of unemployed persons per job opening rises significantly. The ratio increases from 1.8 in December 2007 to 6.7 one month after the recession ended in July 2009, surpassing the levels seen in previous recessions. The unemployment rate also fluctuates with the business cycle, reaching a high of 6.3% during the 2001 recession. During the 2007-2009 recession, the unemployment rate peaked at 10.0% in October 2009, but has since decreased to around 8%. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening was 3.6 in February 2012, higher than the pre-recession level of 2.9 in September 2003. Despite improvements, both ratios remain elevated compared to pre-recession levels. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening has improved since the recession, showing modest reductions. However, actual hires may have lagged behind job openings, indicating potential difficulties in finding jobs. This ratio combines supply and demand measures and has temporarily changed correlation with the unemployment rate since the 2007-2009 recession. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening may be a leading indicator to changes in unemployment rates. The ratio reached a high in July 2009, preceding the peak in the unemployment rate in October 2009. The relationship between the unemployment rate and the ratio of unemployed persons per job opening shifted after the 2007-2009 recession, suggesting potential difficulties in finding jobs despite improvements in the ratio. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening can indicate changes in unemployment rates. The relationship between the two shifted after the 2007-2009 recession, suggesting challenges in finding jobs despite improvements in the ratio. The differences in measures arise from the unemployment rate measuring excess supply, while the ratio combines supply and demand. The shift in this relationship may depend on other labor market conditions. The number of job openings increased significantly from July 2007 to February 2012, while labor force participation remained relatively unchanged. Various labor market indicators show the severity of the 2007-2009 recession, with unemployment, employment, and hours worked all indicating a significant deterioration. Despite modest growth in employment since the recession, labor force participation has remained stagnant. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening provides insight into current labor market conditions. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening suggests improvements in job availability, but hiring remains limited. Unemployment and the unemployment rate decreased slightly post-recession, with a modest 2.0% increase in employment. However, the employment to population ratio decreased by 1.1%. Job openings increased by 52.9%, but the hires rate only increased by 13.8%, indicating a mismatch between job opportunities and hires. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening can provide insights into trends over time, especially during the 2007-2009 recession. Different industrial sectors show varying ratios, with the goods-producing sector significantly impacting the overall ratio. This section analyzes the ratio for four sectors: goods-producing, producer services, consumer services, and government. Goods production involves tangible items like cell phones and HD-TVs, while services encompass everything else in the private-business sector. The private-business sector is divided into producer services and consumer services, with examples like financial activities and retail trade. A table shows job openings, unemployed persons, and ratios by sector and industry for 2011. Sectors can have a large share of unemployed persons or job openings but still have a small ratio of unemployed persons per job opening. The private-business sector is divided into producer services and consumer services. Consumer services have the largest share of unemployed persons and job openings, but a lower ratio of unemployed persons per job opening compared to the goods-producing sector. Producer services have a lower share of unemployment relative to job openings and the lowest ratio of unemployed persons per job opening. The ratio does not indicate the size of the sector. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening varies across industrial sectors, with the goods-producing sector consistently showing higher ratios, indicating increased difficulty in finding work. The ratio within the goods-producing sector is also more variable, reaching 22.2 by the end of the recession in June 2009. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening in the goods-producing sector is 22.2, higher than other sectors. After the recession, this ratio decreased by 14.4, leading to a drop in employment within the goods-producing sector. In February 2012, goods-producing sector employment was 18.2 million, a 0.5 million increase from the recession low but still below pre-recession levels. Manufacturing employment decreased from 13.7 million in December 2007 to 11.5 million in February 2010, then increased to 11.9 million in February 2012. Manufacturing would need to increase by 43.7% (5.2 million) to return to previous levels. Manufacturing employment needs to increase by 43.7% (5.2 million) to return to January 2001 levels. The decrease in jobs in the goods-producing sector has disproportionately affected male workers, especially those without a college education. Women have historically been more likely to be employed in less cyclical industries. The long-term prospects of the goods-producing sector and the impact of policies are in question. The impact of the recession on manufacturing and construction industries raises questions about additional attention during recessionary periods. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening for consumer services is relatively low in 2011, partly due to lower ratios in education and health services. Unemployed workers in manufacturing may be transitioning to other opportunities. The consumer services sector had a less significant decrease in employment during the recession compared to the goods-producing sector. Employment in consumer services decreased by .001 million employees from December 2007 to February 2012, while goods-producing employment decreased by 3.7 million. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening for manufacturing and construction industries rose to high levels during the 2007-2009 recession. During the recession, the manufacturing industry saw an increase in labor productivity and wage growth, with a significant portion of Research and Development expenditures taking place within this sector. However, despite these benefits, employment in the manufacturing industry has been decreasing. During the recession, the manufacturing industry experienced an increase in labor productivity and wage growth, along with significant Research and Development expenditures. However, employment in the manufacturing industry has been declining. Total non-farm sector employment decreased by 4.5% from 2007 to 2011, compared to a 15.5% decrease in the manufacturing industry. The goods-producing industries, including mining, logging, construction, and manufacturing, were heavily impacted by the recession, with high ratios of unemployed persons per job opening. The table shows that average monthly ratios of unemployed persons per job opening for the construction and manufacturing sectors are higher for all years, more than twice the other producer and consumer services and government sector. The ratios for goods-producing industries are more than twice the ratios of services-producing industries, especially during recessionary periods. The analysis highlights that the ratio of unemployed persons per job opening is highly correlated with the unemployment rate and rises during recessions, reaching very high levels. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening rises to very high levels during recessions, especially in goods-producing industries. Despite some improvements post-recession, the ratio remains higher than pre-recession levels. More years of data are needed to determine if job openings can serve as an early indicator of unemployment. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening remains high post-recession, indicating the severity of the 2007-2009 recession. Various labor market indicators show significant deterioration in conditions, with unemployment rates peaking at 10.0% four months after the recession ended. The ratio of unemployed persons per job opening decreased after the 2007-2009 recession, providing insight into labor market conditions. Data on this ratio by industry and year is presented in tables using information from the Current Population Survey and Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Additional details on potential data limitations are also provided. The Current Population Survey (CPS) and Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data provide insights into labor market conditions post-recession. Details on the unemployed persons per job opening ratio by industry and year are presented in tables, along with information on potential data limitations."
