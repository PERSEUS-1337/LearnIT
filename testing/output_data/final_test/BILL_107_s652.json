    "content": "The \"Rural Rental Housing Act of 2001\" may be cited as the short title. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds a growing need for rural rental housing, with many households lacking access to affordable units and living in inadequate or overcrowded conditions. In rural America, overcrowding is a significant issue with 28% of rural households facing serious housing problems. Approximately 1 million rural renters have multiple housing issues, and 2.6 million households live in substandard conditions. One-third of rural renters spend over 30% of their income on housing, while 20% pay more than 50%. 92% of rural renters with significant housing problems pay over 50% of their income for housing. In rural areas, significant housing problems exist where 60% of households pay over 70% of their income for housing costs. Rural economies face limited job opportunities due to factors like remoteness and low population density. Access to credit is also limited in rural areas compared to metropolitan areas. Federal Government investment in rural rental housing has significantly decreased over the past decade, with a 73% cut in spending since 1994 and an 88% reduction in rural rental housing unit production financed by the Federal Government since 1990. This has led to challenges in accessing credit in rural areas, where credit is often more expensive and available at less favorable terms compared to metropolitan areas. Additionally, banks and other investors prefer larger projects with lower risk in metropolitan areas, leading to a need for interim or bridge financing in rural areas. To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, the Federal Government must collaborate with State and local governments, private financial institutions, philanthropic organizations, and the private sector, including nonprofit groups. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, an \"eligible project\" refers to a project for rental housing in a rural area for low-income families.
