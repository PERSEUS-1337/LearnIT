    "content": "The year 2007 in Pakistan was marked by political crises, including the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December. Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan People's Party, was killed in a controversial gun and bomb attack, causing further challenges to democratization efforts in the country. Her son and husband were named as her successors in the party leadership. In November 2007, Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf declared a Proclamation of Emergency, suspending the country's Constitution due to security concerns and alleged judiciary interference. Musharraf issued a Provisional Constitution Order (PCO) to implement \"emergent and extraordinary measures.\" The Provisional Constitution Order (PCO) issued by Musharraf on the same day as the emergency proclamation required the judiciary to take a new oath of office and suspended certain Fundamental Rights. Several Supreme Court justices and High Court judges who refused to take the new oath were dismissed. Top U.S. officials have urged Musharraf to restore civilian government and rule of law in Islamabad. The United States has been providing billions of dollars in foreign assistance to Pakistan since 2001. Critics in Washington have raised concerns about the Bush Administration's support for President Musharraf, especially after the emergency decree and PCO in 2007. The State Department expressed disappointment in Musharraf's actions and emphasized the importance of free, fair, and credible elections in Pakistan. The United States is working with Pakistani officials and civil society organizations to ensure transparent elections. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice emphasized the need for free and fair elections in Pakistan, with U.S. aid under review. President George W. Bush called for Musharraf to resign from his military post and hold elections soon, leading to a discussion between the two leaders. President Bush showed understanding of the situation in Pakistan. President Bush expressed understanding of Musharraf's situation and commitment to democracy. Several bills condemning the emergency declaration were introduced in Congress, but none have progressed. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte delivered a strong message to Musharraf in Islamabad, urging him to heed U.S. advice or face a reduction in military assistance. Islamabad rejected calls to end the emergency and dismissed U.S. admonitions. Musharraf's actions were seen as a desperate power grab. Musharraf's emergency decree was viewed as a desperate power grab to preemptively thwart the Supreme Court from invalidating his reelection. International criticism accused Western governments of supporting Musharraf, further destabilizing Pakistan and emboldening Islamist militants. The move highlighted the Pakistani military's failure to defeat extremist elements and its profitable role in the country. The security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons is a crucial issue during political instability in Islamabad. Pakistan's Western allies support an unpopular Musharraf, leading to tensions with opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto's removal from politics disrupts negotiations for power-sharing with Musharraf, despite U.S. government support for their accommodation. The removal of Benazir Bhutto from Pakistan's political scene in 2007 was a setback for U.S. efforts to stabilize the country. Political uncertainty and criticism of the military's governance role have increased among ordinary Pakistanis. The electoral process is seen as preserving the power of a corrupt elite, leading to widespread dismay among the public. The judicial crisis in Pakistan began with President Musharraf's dismissal of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in 2007, triggering outrage among lawyers and opposition activists. The move was seen as an attempt to remove a potential obstacle to Musharraf's power as president and army chief, leading to widespread political crisis and anti-Musharraf sentiments. The dismissal of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry by President Musharraf in 2007 led to a political crisis in Pakistan. Chaudhry gained widespread support and was later reinstated by the Supreme Court in July, seen as a major defeat for Musharraf. In May, violent clashes between government-allied MQM party activists and opposition members resulted in at least 40 deaths, with accusations of government complicity. In August, Secretary of State Rice intervened to prevent Musharraf from declaring a state of emergency. The Supreme Court showed independence by allowing former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to return to Pakistan after exile. Sharif was arrested upon his return in September on corruption charges. In October, Pakistan's Chief Justice affirmed Sharif's right to return and accused the Prime Minister of violating a Supreme Court order. In September, the Islamabad government arrested hundreds of opposition members. In September, Islamabad government arrested hundreds of opposition political leaders and activists, including deputies of Nawaz Sharif. The U.S. Embassy and Secretary Rice expressed concern over the arrests. Pakistan's judicial crisis, stemming from controversial changes made by Musharraf under emergency, remains unresolved. Aitzaz Ahsan leads efforts to restore the Supreme Court to its pre-November status, proposing an oath for parliamentary candidates to pledge restoration. President Musharraf won provisional reelection on October 6, 2007, capturing 98% of the votes from Pakistan's Electoral College. Controversy arose over his intention to resign from his military commission and become a civilian president. Opposition leaders, including Bhutto, rejected a proposal for parliamentary candidates to sign an oath pledging to restore the judiciary. Ahsan criticized the U.S. government for not addressing Musharraf's crackdown on the Supreme Court. Controversy surrounded Musharraf's intention to seek reelection while still serving as army chief, leading to legal challenges and political uncertainty. U.S. and Western officials urged him to refrain from declaring a state of emergency. The new Supreme Court upheld Musharraf's reelection, leading to his retirement from the army and swearing in for a second term. Negotiations with Benazir Bhutto for a power-sharing arrangement were encouraged by the Bush Administration to strengthen moderate political forces in Islamabad. The United States reportedly pressured Islamabad to allow Bhutto's return from exile. Bhutto's return from exile was reluctantly allowed by Islamabad under pressure from the United States. Analysts questioned her motives, suspecting a desire for personal power and the removal of corruption charges. An accord with President Musharraf on October 4 included the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO), granting amnesty to politicians from 1988 to 1999, clearing Bhutto of corruption charges. In exchange, Bhutto tacitly agreed to support Musharraf's reelection plans. The NRO, part of a strategy to prevent opposition unity, threatened a Musharraf-Bhutto deal. Many Pakistanis opposed the politically unprincipled arrangement. Bhutto refused to negotiate with Musharraf after the imposition of emergency, ending prospects for a deal. US officials reiterated support for a Musharraf-Bhutto power-sharing agreement despite deteriorating relations. Benazir Bhutto's return to Pakistan after years of exile was met with jubilant support, but her reentry into politics was polarizing. Despite significant public backing, there were concerns about her credibility due to potential deal-making with Musharraf. Benazir Bhutto's return to Pakistan was met with jubilant support, but concerns about deal-making with Musharraf damaged her credibility. Two blasts near her motorcade left 145 people dead, with suspicions linking the perpetrators to Al Qaeda. Bhutto implicated elements of Pakistan's security apparatus in the attack. Observers feared President Musharraf would impose martial law as Islamist-related militancy surged in October 2007. President Musharraf faced warnings from U.S. officials against imposing martial law through an emergency proclamation. Secretary Rice emphasized the need for free and fair elections in Pakistan, while Adm. William Fallon cautioned Musharraf about risking the Pakistan-U.S. relationship. Despite forewarning from Pakistani officials, U.S. diplomats' reaction was muted, with no \"green light\" given for the emergency declaration. President Musharraf declared a state of emergency in Pakistan on November 3, citing existential threats from terrorism and extremism. He compared his actions to Abraham Lincoln's violations of constitutional limits and asked for more time to establish democratic rule. The emergency led to a crackdown on independent media outlets in Pakistan. Following President Musharraf's declaration of a state of emergency in Pakistan, there was a harsh crackdown on independent media outlets. Private television and radio stations were blacked out, and a new government order banned media reports that defame the government or military. Violations of the order could result in a one-year prison sentence or a fine. Thousands of opposition figures, human rights activists, and lawyers were detained, leading to protests and police beatings. The clampdown on media continued, with both domestic and international news stations remaining off the air in Pakistan. Chief Justice Chaudhry, one of the judges dismissed by the Musharraf government, urged Pakistani lawyers to continue protests against police beatings and mass arrests in Pakistani cities. The U.S. government and other world governments expressed grave concern at the crackdown, calling it contradictory to democratic goals. Musharraf amended the Army Act to allow military trials of civilians, raising human rights concerns and potentially sanctioning disappearances linked to security services. The emergency declaration was criticized as a setback to Pakistan's democratization process by the United States and other countries, including Britain and India. Pakistan faced criticisms from India and the international community for the emergency declaration by President Musharraf. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group condemned the abrogation of the Pakistani Constitution and threatened suspension from the Commonwealth unless Musharraf repeals the emergency provisions. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry asked for understanding and reiterated commitment to civilian democratic rule and holding elections. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group condemned Pakistan's emergency declaration and threatened suspension from the Commonwealth unless democracy and rule of law are restored. International human rights groups criticized Pakistan's crackdown on civil society and demanded the return to constitutional rule and human rights protections. The Pakistani public opposed Musharraf's coup, with modest street protests due to crackdowns. The media criticized Musharraf's attempt to maintain power, urging the US to end reliance on him. Musharraf lifted the state of emergency, claiming a complete restoration of the constitution. Musharraf lifted the state of emergency, claiming a complete restoration of the constitution, against skepticism from critics who saw it as a PR exercise. Human Rights Watch called it a \"sham\" that would not restore genuine rule of law. Musharraf made amendments to the constitution to ensure his actions under emergency rule could not be challenged. On December 27, 2007, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated. On December 27, 2007, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in a gun and suicide bomb attack in Rawalpindi. The killing was condemned worldwide, and Bhutto was buried in her ancestral village in Sindh. The circumstances of her death remain controversial, with conflicting reports about the cause. Emergency room doctors who tried to revive Bhutto may have been pressured to conform to the government's accounts and later sought to distance themselves from such accounts, calling for an autopsy. Video and photographs show a gunman firing three shots at Bhutto from close range, followed by an explosion that killed over 20 bystanders. City fire trucks cleared the crime scene with high-pressure hoses, likely destroying vital forensic evidence. Critics blame the Musharraf government for inadequate security for Bhutto, raising questions about her assassination. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto raised demands for an international investigation, with calls for a U.N. probe. Despite initial denial by the Islamabad government, under diplomatic pressure, Musharraf agreed to consider foreign assistance in the investigation. Bhutto's widower supported the idea of an international inquiry. The U.S. government welcomed Musharraf's decision to involve Britain's Scotland Yard in the investigation of Benazir Bhutto's assassination. Pakistani officials blamed Baitullah Mehsud for the killing, but he denied involvement. The U.S. did not take a position on the killers, with some officials questioning Islamabad's quick blame on Mehsud. Al Qaeda or its allies were suspected by a former U.S. counterterrorism official. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto was believed to be orchestrated by Al Qaeda or its Pakistan-based allies. Despite receiving intelligence about potential threats to her safety, Bhutto's security was not bolstered due to fears of infiltration by extremists. Various extremist groups in Pakistan, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, were seen as potential suspects in her assassination. Conspiracy theories implicating government agencies also circulated in Pakistan. President Musharraf imposed martial law, harming Pakistani democratization. The Supreme Court validated his 2007 reelection, leading to his resignation from the military and a second presidential term. Secretary Rice called for free and fair elections. Musharraf promised elections by January but did not specify an end to the emergency, leading to Bhutto ending negotiations with him. Bhutto responded by ending negotiations with Musharraf and declared \"It's over for Musharraf,\" demanding his resignation from both his military commission and presidency. She reached out to other opposition leaders and called on the international community to stop backing the \"dictator.\" Musharraf, in turn, called Bhutto \"too confrontational\" and ruled out further power-sharing negotiations with her. Bhutto accused the ruling PML-Q party of colluding with intelligence agencies to postpone elections, criticizing Musharraf's electoral plans as a \"farce.\" Sharif also criticized Musharraf, calling for restored democracy and U.S. support for Pakistan. Bhutto's assassination changed Pakistan's political landscape. The PPP named Bilawal and Asif Zardari as party leaders following Bhutto's death. Zardari, a controversial figure with a history of legal troubles, will lead until Bilawal finishes studies at Oxford. Makhdoom Amin Fahim is expected to be the PPP's prime ministerial candidate, but lacks the national support Bhutto had. With Bhutto's death, Nawaz Sharif has emerged as a prominent opposition figure in Pakistan, but he is viewed with skepticism by many in Washington due to his ties to Islamist parties. The credibility of recent elections in Pakistan has been questioned following political crises, raising concerns about the country's anti-extremism policies and U.S. interests. The government's credibility in conducting elections in Pakistan was questioned due to controversies over voter disenfranchisement and the lack of a neutral Election Commission. President Musharraf refused to give a firm date for ending martial law, stating elections would not be held under U.S. dictation. Emergency rule was deemed incompatible with free and fair elections by Deputy Secretary Negroponte and Secretary Rice. The government's credibility in conducting elections in Pakistan was questioned due to controversies over voter disenfranchisement and the lack of a neutral Election Commission. President Musharraf suggested lifting the emergency order before scheduled polls, but doubts were raised about the feasibility of conducting credible elections in such a short timeframe. Independent analyses expressed skepticism, with a Pakistani watchdog organization stating that free and fair elections were not possible under the current conditions. Musharraf's actions in stifling civilian rule in Pakistan have raised concerns about the credibility of upcoming elections. The international community is urged to impose aid sanctions targeting the military while increasing development aid. Skepticism surrounds the judiciary's dismantling, with Chief Justice Chaudhry and other judges under house arrest. Reports of government attempts to manipulate the polls have further fueled doubts about the election process. Bhutto was reportedly preparing to present a detailed report to U.S. Congress members on the situation. President Musharraf appointed Mohammadmian Soomro as caretaker Prime Minister during the election period, with concerns about the cabinet being stacked with his supporters. Musharraf promises open and transparent elections despite skepticism about the process. On November 20, Pakistan's Chief Election Commissioner announced that national polls would be held on January 8, 2007. About 13,500 candidates representing 49 parties filed papers to vie for Pakistan's National Assembly seats and provincial assembly constituencies, including serious contenders Benazir Bhutto, Nawaz Sharif, and Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi. Sharif faced a setback when his nomination papers were rejected on December 3, rendering him ineligible to compete in the elections. The rejection of nomination papers disqualified Sharif from competing in the elections, while his brother Shabaz also faced rejection due to pending criminal charges. The MMA coalition weakened as its main figures diverged on participating in elections, leading to a formal split and diminishing its power prospects in Pakistan's western provincial assemblies. Opposition parties in Pakistan faced a dilemma over participating in perceived manipulated elections. Sharif initially planned to boycott, but Bhutto's decision to participate led him to reverse course. Sharif's party eventually decided to participate after failing to convince Bhutto to boycott, with analysts warning against a boycott benefiting the ruling party. The PML-Q, PPP, and Sharif urged full participation in the election to minimize rigging. Zardari expected a sympathy vote for PPP after Bhutto's assassination. The Bush Administration supported holding the election as scheduled. PML-Q sought to postpone the polls, while Sharif demanded a national unity government. The State Department emphasized the importance of continuing the democratic process to honor Bhutto's memory. The U.S. government supported holding the election as scheduled to honor Bhutto's memory. Analysts believe this was to legitimize Musharraf's leadership. Bhutto's death increased U.S. reliance on Musharraf as the main pro-U.S. leader in Pakistan. The Election Commission's decision to delay the polls until February 18 was criticized by opposition parties. The postponement of the election date was defended by Musharraf due to the destruction in Sindh. The opposition parties' response to this decision is still uncertain. Islamist extremism and militancy have been a significant issue in Pakistan since 2001, with a surge in suicide bomb attacks in 2007. \"Militants have carried out numerous suicide bomb attacks, mainly targeting security forces, resulting in over 700 deaths. The \"neo-Taliban\" militants have gained control in western regions like Waziristan and Swat, leading to costly battles for government troops. Despite some successes in Swat, Pakistan experienced ten suicide bombings in December. The state of emergency imposed by Musharraf worsened anti-Musharraf sentiment and civil-military tensions. This move may have hindered the military's ability to combat religious extremists, strengthening authoritarian rule and weakening moderate political forces.\" The International Crisis Group report warns that martial law in Pakistan will lead to more violence and instability. Imprisoning secular leaders boosts jihadi groups, targeting moderate political parties empowers Islamists, and censorship of the media strengthens extremist communication through mosques. Musharraf's emergency declaration did not bring immediate improvements. Musharraf's imposition of emergency in Pakistan did not immediately improve the government's battle with militants. Islamist militants in Swat Valley gained territory initially but retreated after Pakistan army offensives. Western diplomats criticized Musharraf's focus on judiciary and arrests of civil society members. The killing of Bhutto led to country-wide rioting, with 60 people killed and significant damage reported by the caretaker government. Musharraf faced blame for the instability, raising concerns about Pakistan's security apparatus being distracted from crucial counterterrorism operations. Pakistan's political crises have harmed the strong national economy, with the main stock market experiencing significant declines. The country's attractiveness for foreign investors has also been affected by the instability. The emergency proclamation in Pakistan led to rumors of President Musharraf being under house arrest. The army's top leadership, handpicked by Musharraf, is seen as staying united to maintain order. The likelihood of Musharraf being forcibly removed from office is considered low. The security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons is a major concern during the political crisis. While the risk of Islamist extremists obtaining a nuclear device is low, there is a higher risk of rogue scientists or security officials selling nuclear materials. The United States has spent nearly $100 million on a classified program to assist with this issue. The United States has spent almost $100 million since 2001 on a classified program to help secure Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Despite Islamabad's denial of any security issues, concerns remain about the potential leakage of nuclear know-how. India's national security advisor believes Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is mostly secure, but the US's ability to pressure Pakistan diplomatically is currently limited due to internal turmoil. The Bush Administration's Pakistan policy, along with violence and Bhutto's assassination, raised concerns about its effectiveness. Democracy was not a top priority, leading to calls for a review of Washington's Pakistan policy by U.S. Senators. The Senators are calling for a review of Washington's Pakistan policy, including adjustments to aid programs and steps to enhance security along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Senator Joe Biden warned of consequences if upcoming elections are not fair, and Representative Nancy Pelosi raised concerns about the probe into Bhutto's murder. Former U.S. officials insist that military dictatorship in Pakistan is not in the U.S. interest. President Bush urged President Musharraf to restore democracy in Pakistan, with Benazir Bhutto emphasizing the importance of credible elections to combat extremism. The U.S. government believed Pakistan was moving towards democracy after lifting the emergency, but was prepared to take action if Musharraf did not comply. Despite concerns about Musharraf's future in power, the Bush Administration continues to support him, with little indication of withdrawing that support. Some analysts question this stance, especially after the emergency proclamation in Islamabad. The U.S. government is reviewing aid to Pakistan in light of these developments. The U.S. has imposed democracy-related aid sanctions on Pakistan for over eight years due to Musharraf's seizure of power in 1999. Congress waived coup-related sanctions on Pakistan through FY2002 and granted the President authority to waive them through FY2003. Subsequent Congresses provided further annual waiver authority. President Bush has used waiver authority five times to facilitate the transition to democratic rule in Pakistan and respond to acts of international terrorism. Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte called President Musharraf an indispensable ally in the global war on terrorism, warning that cuts to U.S. aid programs for Pakistan would send a negative signal. Pakistan's future is crucial to U.S. interests and national security. Several Members called for suspending aid to Pakistan until anti-democratic developments are reversed. The Administration emphasizes the importance of Pakistan's cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts. President Bush's reaction to the emergency decree was seen as subdued. Some view this as evidence of selective application of the Freedom Agenda. Many believe the United States must support Musharraf's leadership in Pakistan for continuity amidst political instability, while others see him as a liability hindering democratization and counterterrorism efforts. Musharraf's resignation is seen as a necessary step for progress. President Bush has the authority to halt U.S. assistance to Pakistan, but there are no signs of immediate action. Administration officials could place holds on certain items like F-16 combat aircraft. Congress has placed legal conditions on future military aid to Pakistan, with pending legislation for further conditionality. Musharraf has reached out to the U.S. for support. President Musharraf reached out to U.S. congressional leaders to discourage new restrictions on U.S. aid to Pakistan. Conditioning aid is seen as counterproductive and could reinforce negative perceptions of the United States. Over $26 million in aid has been used for democracy-related programs in Pakistan, including ballot boxes and voter roll computerization. Washington also plans to support election observation programs for upcoming parliamentary elections. U.S. officials have emphasized neutrality in Pakistan's elections. Recommendations have been made to adjust funds for military and economic aid programs. Since 2001, funds have been split evenly between economic and security aid, with most economic aid going to a general fund and security aid for defense articles. Only a small portion of the $10 billion provided to Pakistan has been for development and humanitarian purposes. The Bush Administration and Congress may need to target U.S. assistance programs more effectively in Pakistan to benefit its citizens. Analysts suggest making U.S. aid more visible to improve America's image in the country."
