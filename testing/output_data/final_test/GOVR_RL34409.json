    "content": "The Federal Communications Commission conducted a rulemaking in response to a petition by EPIC regarding websites selling personal telephone records. Data brokers offer cell phone call records, including call details and location information, as well as landline and VOIP phone records. They claim to provide this information quickly, within a few hours to a few days. Data brokers allegedly obtained phone records from phone companies without approval, exploiting inadequate security standards. They use three methods: employees selling records, pretexting as the owner, and accessing records without customer consent. Data brokers use pretext calling to obtain customer telephone records by pretending to be the account holder and persuading phone company employees to release the information. This method exploits the public availability of personal identifiers like the Social Security number. Phone companies are urged to stop using easily accessible biographical information for identity authentication and encourage customers to access their accounts online. The federal government and regulatory agencies have taken action to prevent unauthorized disclosure of phone records through pretexting. Legal obligations exist for certain sectors to protect personal information, established through federal privacy legislation. Covered entities are required to implement information security programs to safeguard personal data. In 2006, Congress enacted the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act, making pretexting for telephone records a federal offense. Several federal statutes address illegal conduct related to identity theft and pretext calling, including making false statements to obtain confidential phone records information. The Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006 criminalizes making false statements or providing fraudulent documents to a covered entity, accessing customer accounts without authorization, and buying or selling records obtained without consent. Violations can result in fines up to $500,000 for organizations and imprisonment for individuals. Enhanced penalties may apply in certain situations. Violations of the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006 can result in fines up to $500,000 for organizations and imprisonment for individuals. Enhanced penalties apply in certain situations, including violations in connection with other illegal activities or violent crimes. The Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006 imposes fines and imprisonment for violations, with enhanced penalties for certain situations. The FTC can take legal action against pretexters of telephone records for deceptive practices. Investigations are ongoing regarding data brokers using pretexting to obtain customer telephone records. The Federal Trade Commission took legal action against web-based operations for selling consumers' confidential telephone records, violating the Federal Trade Commission Act. The agency sought to stop the sale of phone records, impose penalties, and ensure telecommunications carriers protect customer proprietary network information. Section 222 of the Communication Act of 1934 requires telecommunications carriers to protect customer proprietary network information (CPNI) from disclosure to third parties without customer consent or as mandated by law. CPNI includes personally identifiable information related to a customer's telecommunications service, regardless of whether it is landline or wireless. It encompasses details such as quantity, technical configuration, destination, and usage of the service provided by the carrier. Section 222 of the Communication Act of 1934 mandates that telecommunications carriers protect customer proprietary network information (CPNI) from unauthorized disclosure. CPNI includes calling activities, billing records, and customer information, but excludes subscriber list details. The act restricts carriers from using customer phone records for marketing without consent and safeguards, and prohibits unauthorized access to this information. Section 222 of the Communication Act of 1934 requires telecommunications carriers to protect customer proprietary network information (CPNI) from unauthorized disclosure. It imposes a duty on carriers to safeguard proprietary information and restricts the use of such information for marketing purposes without customer consent. The confidentiality protections for CPNI are established in Section 222(c), which outlines the core privacy requirements for carriers. Telecommunications carriers must protect customer proprietary network information (CPNI) and can only use it for providing telecommunications services or related purposes. CPNI can be disclosed upon customer request, and aggregate customer information can be used for other purposes. Telecommunications carriers must protect customer proprietary network information (CPNI) and can only use it for providing telecommunications services or related purposes. CPNI can be disclosed with customer approval or as required by law. Carriers can also use CPNI for billing, fraud protection, telemarketing services, and providing call location information for commercial mobile services. Section 222(e) allows carriers to disclose subscriber list information for directory publishing purposes. The CPNI Order governs the use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information by telecommunications carriers. The FCC implemented Section 222 to regulate the use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information by telecommunications carriers. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit struck down rules requiring opt-in consent for using customer phone records for marketing. The FCC amended its CPNI regulations to require opt-in consent for disclosing CPNI to third parties, while allowing opt-out consent for disclosure to affiliated parties. The FCC amended its CPNI regulations to require opt-in consent for sharing customer information with third parties, including joint venture partners and independent contractors. Opt-out consent is still allowed for sharing CPNI with affiliates that provide telecommunications services. Carriers must notify customers of their right to restrict the use of their CPNI before seeking approval. Carriers must establish safeguards to protect customer CPNI and track access to CPNI records. The FCC requires carrier authentication for disclosing call detail information, with a pre-established password needed for customer-initiated requests. If no password is provided, information can be sent to the account's address or verified through alternative authentication methods. Online account access also requires passwords to be set up by carriers. Carriers must establish safeguards to protect customer CPNI, including setting up passwords for online account access. They are required to notify customers of any account changes and have a process for notifying law enforcement and affected customers in case of unauthorized disclosure of CPNI. Carriers must certify their compliance annually and make this certification publicly available, including a list of customer complaints regarding unauthorized disclosure of CPNI. The FCC's recent order extended CPNI regulations to cover Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol (VOIP) service providers. Violations of CPNI requirements can result in various penalties under the act. Section 501 of the act outlines penalties for willful violations, including fines up to $10,000 and imprisonment up to two years for repeat offenders. Section 502 addresses willful violations of FCC regulations, with a maximum fine of $500 per day for each violation. Section 503(b)(1) of the act allows for civil money penalties up to $500 per day for violations, with \"willful\" and \"repeated\" violations defined. Common carriers may face penalties up to $130,000 per violation or per day of violation, not exceeding $1,325,000 for any single act. The FCC can impose a forfeiture penalty of up to $1,325,000 for any single act or failure to act. The person can contest the penalty in writing before it is issued. The NCTA challenged the requirement for carriers to obtain opt-in consent when sharing CPNI, but the court upheld the FCC's order. The court upheld the FCC's order implementing Section 222, stating it was constitutionally permissible and advanced the government's interest in protecting consumer privacy. The court found that the opt-in requirement was no more intrusive than opt-out and that the FCC had not violated the Administrative Procedure Act in its decision-making process."
