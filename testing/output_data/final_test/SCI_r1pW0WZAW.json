    "content": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, but capturing long-term dependencies during training remains a challenge. MIST RNNs introduce direct connections from the distant past, outperforming LSTM in vanishing-gradient properties and efficiency. They also improve performance on tasks requiring long-term dependencies compared to LSTM and Clockwork RNNs. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful for modeling sequential data and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. Long short-term memory (LSTM) addresses the vanishing gradient problem by using nearly-additive connections between adjacent states. In this paper, MIxed hiSTory RNNs (MIST RNNs) are introduced as a new NARX RNN architecture with superior vanishing-gradient properties compared to LSTM and previously proposed NARX networks. MIxed hiSTory RNNs (MIST RNNs) exhibit superior vanishing-gradient properties compared to LSTM and previously proposed NARX RNNs. They improve performance substantially on tasks requiring long-term dependencies and are efficient in parameters and computation. MIST RNNs reduce the decay's exponent by a factor of 2 n d \u22121. The parameters \u03b8 to be learned are formed by weight matrices W and biases b. Long short-term memory (LSTM) was introduced to address the vanishing gradient problem. LSTM with forget gates and without peephole connections has better gradient properties than simple RNNs. Gated recurrent units alleviate the vanishing gradient. NARX RNNs, like LSTM and gated recurrent units, tackle the vanishing gradient problem. They use delays or direct connections from the past, but require more computation and parameters than simple-RNNs. This limitation is present in all NARX RNN variants before MIST RNNs. Clockwork RNNs, like NARX RNNs, split weights and hidden units into partitions with distinct periods. They differ in severing high-frequency-to-low-frequency paths, making it challenging to learn long-term behaviors requiring quick motions from the past for activity recognition. Clockwork RNNs split weights and hidden units into partitions with distinct periods, making it difficult to learn long-term behaviors requiring quick motions from the past for activity recognition. NARX RNNs, like MIST RNNs, do not have this drawback and offer alternative approaches to capture long-term dependencies. Other notable methods include maintaining a generative model over inputs, operating at multiple time scales, using associative or explicit memory, and initializing weight matrices to be orthogonal. Clockwork RNNs partition weights and hidden units with distinct periods, hindering learning of long-term behaviors. NARX RNNs, like MIST RNNs, offer alternative approaches to capture long-term dependencies. The chain rule for ordered derivatives connects gradient components to paths and edges in NARX RNNs, extending results from BID3 to general NARX RNNs. The notation used is disambiguated for clarity, with a focus on the Jacobian of f (x, u(x)) with respect to x. The chain rule for ordered derivatives in NARX RNNs expresses derivatives in terms of previous ones, encompassing LSTM as special cases. The Jacobian with respect to parameters can be written as a transposed gradient, connecting to RNNs in practice. Equations 14 and 15 extend the chain rule for ordered derivatives in NARX RNNs, connecting gradient components to paths and edges for gaining insights into various architectures and solidifying intuitions from backpropagation through time. If the norm of \u2202ht\u2212\u03c4 is extremely small, then h t\u2212\u03c4 has only a negligible effect on the final gradient, making it difficult to learn from events that occurred at t \u2212 \u03c4. The text discusses the importance of short paths between time steps in facilitating gradient flow during backpropagation through time in neural networks. It explains how applying the chain rule for ordered derivatives results in non-zero terms only for hidden states connected to the current state through multiple edges, leading to a sum over gradient components corresponding to different paths. The text discusses the spectral norm of paths in neural networks, highlighting the importance of shortest paths in RNN architectures. Different architectures have varying shortest path lengths, with NARX RNNs utilizing non-contiguous delays to reduce these paths further. An architecture with base-2 exponential delays is introduced to achieve shorter paths for gradient flow. The proposed architecture, called mixed history RNNs (MIST RNNs), utilizes base-2 exponential delays to achieve shorter paths for gradient flow. It incorporates a shared weights mechanism over delays, an attention-like mechanism BID2, and a reset mechanism from gated recurrent units BID5. Comparisons are made with simple RNNs, LSTM, and Clockwork RNNs on tasks like sequential permuted MNIST. The study compares mixed history RNNs (MIST RNNs) with simple RNNs, LSTM, and Clockwork RNNs on various tasks, including sequential permuted MNIST and the copy problem. It also explores tasks involving long-term dependencies like recognizing surgical maneuvers, phonemes from speech, and classifying activities from smartphone motion data. Various architectural variations like variational dropout and layer normalization are noted but not included in the experiments for simplicity. In a study comparing different types of RNNs, MIST RNNs outperform simple RNNs, LSTM, and Clockwork RNNs on tasks like sequential permuted MNIST. The top 5 randomized trials out of 50 were used to compute means and standard deviations for test error rates. LSTM error rates are consistent with previously-reported values, and increasing the hidden unit count did not significantly impact performance. In a comparison of RNNs, MIST RNNs outperform LSTM and other models on tasks like sequential permuted MNIST. Increasing LSTM hidden unit count did not significantly impact performance. Gradient norms were visualized as a function of distance from the loss, showing that simple RNNs and LSTM capture little learning signal from distant steps. When tested on a copy problem task, MIST RNN performance dropped significantly compared to LSTM. The study involves a synthetic task where a network is challenged to store and reproduce information from the past. Experiments are conducted with copy delays of 50, 100, 200, and 400. Results are presented in FIG2, showing validation curves of the top 5 randomized trials out of 50. All methods, except Clockwork RNNs, perform well with a short copy delay of 50. Clockwork RNNs struggle with short copy delays due to limited hidden unit counts, impacting their ability to learn solutions. Simple RNNs and LSTM fail as copy delay increases, while MIST RNNs remain relatively unaffected. The unexpected failure of Clockwork RNNs for short delays suggests a potential issue with hidden unit allocation. In experiments with Clockwork RNNs, using 1024 hidden units with 128 allocated to high-frequency partition, the RNNs solve tasks for delay D = 50 but fail for higher delays. The study focuses on online surgical maneuver recognition using the MISTIC-SL dataset BID12 BID8, mapping robot kinematics to gestures over time. The goal is to achieve state-of-the-art performance following BID8's approach. The study focuses on online framewise phoneme recognition using the TIMIT corpus, collapsing 61 phonemes into 40 classes. LSTM with 100 hidden units is used as a baseline, with MIST RNNs matching LSTM performance with half the parameters. Top 5 randomized trials out of 50 are used for computation of means and standard deviations. The study involves sequence classification from smartphone motion data using the MobiAct dataset. LSTM and MIST RNNs perform similarly and outperform other RNN types. The dataset consists of 3,200 sequences from 67 subjects, with training, validation, and testing split among subjects. Results show that MIST RNNs outperform all other methods. In this work, MIST RNNs outperform LSTM and other methods, showing superior vanishing-gradient properties and improved performance on tasks with long-term dependencies. Future work may explore different NARX RNN architectures and incorporate techniques like variational dropout and layer normalization to enhance MIST RNN performance further. The text discusses enhancements to MIST RNN performance by tracing paths from t - \u03c4 to t, resulting in a single term associated with the path. It also explores NARX RNNs by considering nonzero partials and defining sets Vt\u2212\u03c4 and Vt to apply the process to each term.

The analysis is similar for general NARX RNNs, with differences in the sets of edges considered.

Learning rate is varied in log space between 10^-4 and 10^1 in 50 trials for each experimental configuration, with results reported over the top 10% of trials based on validation set error. Majority of trials yield bad performance for all methods, blurring comparisons. Data preprocessing is minimal, with input images individually shifted and scaled to have mean 0 and variance 1. Training set is split into two parts, with 58,000 used for training and 2,000 for validation. Test set consists of 10,000 images. Training is done by minimizing cross-entropy loss. Symbols are drawn at random from {0, 1, ..., 9}; D is a multiple of 10; and L is chosen to be D/10. Constant error rate is achieved by always predicting the blank symbol. No input preprocessing is performed. 100,000 examples are generated for training and 1,000 for validation in each case. The training data consists of 100,000 examples for training and 1,000 for validation. The experimental setup follows BID8 and includes kinematic inputs, leave-one-user-out test setup, and specific hyperparameters. The primary difference is the replacement of LSTM layer with a simple RNN, LSTM, or MIST RNN layer. Training involves minimizing cross-entropy loss and extracting mel frequency cepstral coefficients. The curr_chunk discusses the process of extracting mel frequency cepstral coefficients for training data splits according to BID17, with emphasis on minimizing cross-entropy loss and computing means and standard deviations. The training data consists of 3696 sequences for training, 400 sequences for validation, and 192 sequences for testing."
