    "content": "The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established statutory restrictions on federal officials receiving gifts from prohibited sources. The law prohibits soliciting or receiving gifts from individuals seeking action from one's agency. Exceptions can be made by designated supervisory ethics offices. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established restrictions on federal officials receiving gifts from prohibited sources. The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) issues regulations allowing exceptions and setting guidelines for accepting gifts in the executive branch. The definition of \"gift\" is broad, covering items, benefits, services, or favors with monetary value. Agencies may also establish additional ethics provisions with OGE approval. The regulations define a \"gift\" as something given without compensation, distinguishing it from payment for services rendered. Gifts to federal employees may also be imputed under certain circumstances, such as when given to a family member with the employee's knowledge and acquiescence. The President and Vice President are generally exempt from statutory gift restrictions and regulations on domestic gifts under OGE regulations. They may accept gifts from the public as long as they are not solicited or coerced, nor accepted in return for an official act. The exception allows them to accept gifts on their own behalf or on behalf of family members, provided it does not violate specific regulations or laws. The OGE regulations exempt the President and Vice President from gift restrictions, allowing them to accept gifts from the public as long as they are not solicited or coerced, nor accepted in return for an official act. The regulations prohibit executive branch employees from accepting gifts from prohibited sources or gifts given because of their official position. The OGE regulations prohibit executive branch employees from accepting gifts from prohibited sources or gifts given because of their official position, unless exempted. An executive branch official may accept a gift without limitation if it is clear that the gift is motivated by a family relationship or personal friendship rather than their position. Relevant factors include the history of the relationship and whether the family member or friend personally pays for the gift. The Office of Government Ethics discusses the exception for gifts based on personal friendship. When accepting a gift, an executive branch official must consider factors like the history of the relationship and who paid for the gift to ensure it is based on personal friendship. Establishing a gift's motivation can be challenging if it relates to official responsibilities. The circumstances surrounding the gift, such as the length and intimacy of the relationship, can indicate a personal connection. The gift prohibition in the executive branch exempts gifts under $20 and certain items like food, drink, greeting cards, and plaques. Executive branch officials can accept invitations and entertainment for social events from non-prohibited sources. An executive branch employee may accept free attendance at a \"widely attended\" gathering or event in which they are to speak or participate in an official capacity, if it is in the interest of the agency or government. This may include the provision of food, refreshments, entertainment, instruction, and materials as part of the event. Acceptance of unsolicited gifts of free attendance may be allowed if it furthers agency programs or operations. Employees attending events may bring a spouse, with travel and lodging not included. They may be on annual leave or granted excused absence if authorized by the agency. The agency must consider the employee's role and make a written determination if the sponsor's interests may affect the employee's official duties. Employees attending events may bring a spouse, with travel and lodging not included. The agency must make a determination if the employee's participation in the event outweighs concerns about improper influence on official duties. Free attendance may be accepted, but not travel expenses, unless authorized separately. Executive branch employees can accept meals, lodging, and transportation related to outside business activities. Honoraria events where employees perform services in a non-official capacity are allowed. Employees in the executive branch can accept honoraria, transportation, food, and lodging for lecturing services in a private capacity based on their expertise. They may also accept awards valued at $200 or less for public service, honorary degrees, and certain long-standing awards with approval from ethics personnel. The Office of Government Ethics regulations provide exemptions from the gift rule prohibition for federal employees, allowing them to receive certain benefits or things of value such as loans at prevailing rates, rewards from contests open to the public, and pension benefits. The United States Constitution prohibits federal employees from accepting gifts from foreign governments without Congressional consent. In 1966, Congress granted general statutory consent for the acceptance of certain gifts and decorations under the \"Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act.\" The Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act prohibits federal employees from accepting gifts from foreign governments without Congressional consent. Amendments in 1977 clarified exceptions and added restrictions, including for spouses and dependent children of federal employees. Agencies must establish rules on receiving foreign gifts, with prohibitions on requesting gifts and limits on acceptance without authorization by law. The Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act prohibits federal employees from accepting gifts from foreign governments without Congressional consent. Exceptions include gifts of \"minimal value\" as souvenirs or marks of courtesy, educational scholarships, and medical treatment. Acceptance of gifts of more than minimal value is allowed if refusal would cause offense or embarrassment, or adversely affect U.S. foreign relations. Travel-related gifts must be turned over to the United States. The Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act prohibits federal employees from accepting gifts from foreign governments without Congressional consent, except for gifts of minimal value, educational scholarships, and medical treatment. Travel-related gifts must be turned over to the United States if they involve expenses for travel outside the country. Restrictions apply to gifts given with donative intent, but if connected to an official act, acceptance is prohibited. The federal bribery law at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201 prohibits government officers and employees from accepting anything of value in exchange for being influenced in the performance of official duties. This includes the illegal gratuities clause, which prohibits receiving anything of value for or because of an official act without requiring a corrupt agreement. Federal law prohibits federal employees from using their official positions to extort something of value for themselves or receiving gifts in exchange for representational services. They are also prohibited from receiving salary supplementation from private sources for their official duties. Federal law prohibits federal employees from giving gifts to supervisors or superiors, and prohibits superiors from accepting gifts from those receiving less pay. Exceptions can be made for special occasions. Procurement officials have similar gift rules. There may also be requirements for public financial disclosure for high-level federal officials regarding gifts. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 requires high-level federal officials to disclose gifts received by them and their immediate family in annual financial statements by May 15. Lower-level federal officers must file confidential disclosure reports with their agency if they are involved in government contracting, procurement, grants, subsidies, licensing, auditing, or other governmental duties. Employees involved in government contracting, procurement, grants, subsidies, licensing, auditing, or other governmental duties must disclose gifts and reimbursements over $375 in confidential reports."
