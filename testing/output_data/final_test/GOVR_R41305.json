    "content": "The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) applies to all agencies, including independent regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, prescribing procedures for agency actions such as rulemaking and adjudication. Barron and Kagan's Chevron nondelegation theory would change judicial deference away from formal procedures outlined in the APA. Agencies issue rules under delegated authority from Congress, with substantive rules having the force of law and creating new rights or duties. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires agencies to follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures for issuing rules that create new rights or duties. Final rules must be published 30 days before becoming effective. Nonlegislative rules, such as interpretive rules, are exempt from these requirements. The APA also outlines procedures for formal adjudications, known as \"on the record\" hearings. When a statute requires an agency adjudication to be determined \"on the record,\" an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) or the agency head must preside over the hearing. ALJs hear cases in enforcement, entitlement, regulatory, and contract categories. The subject matter varies among agencies and includes disability determinations, licensing, sanctions, and civil penalties. Informal adjudications may not follow APA procedures, allowing agencies to create their own procedures and use non-ALJ hearing officers. The Supreme Court emphasizes that an agency's regulatory power must stem from a valid grant of authority from Congress. The relevant APA provision for judicial review of agency action states that a court will set aside agency actions that exceed statutory authority. Courts grant varying levels of deference to agency interpretations of statutes during judicial review. The amount of deference given to an agency's interpretation of its own statute by a reviewing court varies with the circumstances. Two types of deference discussed in a law review article are Chevron (substantial deference) and Skidmore (weak deference). Chevron is the leading case on judicial review of agency interpretations of statutes, involving the Environmental Protection Agency's rules defining \"stationary source\" under the Clean Air Act. The Court established a two-step test for reviewing agency interpretations. The Chevron case established a two-step test for judicial review of an agency's interpretation of its own statute. If Congress has directly spoken to the issue, Chevron deference is not due, but if the statute is silent or ambiguous, the court defers to a reasonable agency interpretation. This has sparked debate on the role of agencies and courts in statutory interpretation and the level of deference courts should apply. The 2001 case United States v. Mead Corporation addressed Chevron deference to agency interpretations. The Court clarified that Chevron deference is warranted only when Congress delegates authority to the agency to make rules with the force of law. This determination, known as Chevron step zero, involves assessing whether the agency has exercised its authority through notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication. The Court clarified in United States v. Mead Corporation that Chevron deference is only warranted when Congress delegates authority to agencies to make rules with the force of law. This can be shown through various ways, such as adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking. In Barnhart v. Walton, the Court found that Chevron deference may apply to agency interpretations reached through informal means. The level of judicial deference to informal procedures depends on whether the court favors Mead-style factors or Barnhart-style factors. If the agency's interpretation does not qualify for Chevron deference, it is entitled to respect only to the extent it has the power to persuade under the standard set forth in Skidmore v. Swift & Co. Courts may give deference to an agency's interpretation of a statute under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., based on factors like thoroughness, reasoning validity, and consistency. This deference is proportional to the agency's power to persuade, even if Chevron deference does not apply. The nondelegation doctrine prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative powers to other branches of government, based on the separation of powers and checks and balances arguments. Before the New Deal, Supreme Court rulings established this doctrine, but modern interpretations allow for more flexibility in delegation. The modern delegation doctrine allows Congress to delegate legislative authority as long as it provides an \"intelligible principle\" for the executive branch to follow. This doctrine originated from the case of J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, where the Court emphasized the need for governmental coordination and the protection of private rights through access to the courts. The Court has struck down two legislative delegations as lacking an \"intelligible principle\" under the nondelegation doctrine. In Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, Congress provided the President with authority to prohibit interstate transfer of petroleum without any standards. Similarly, in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, Congress gave the President authority to enact \"codes of fair competition,\" which was deemed an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority. The Court noted the difficulty in defining \"fair competition\" and the broad scope of the President's authority in this case. The Supreme Court has not struck down a congressional delegation to an executive agency since the New Deal cases in 1935. Despite ongoing discussions on the nondelegation doctrine, the Court has upheld many delegations of legislative power to executive agencies. The Court has also interpreted legislation to impose more requirements than necessary to avoid constitutional nondelegation issues. The nondelegation doctrine has been considered to be \"on life support\" since the Court's 2001 decision in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. The Supreme Court has not struck down a congressional delegation to an executive agency since the New Deal cases in 1935. Despite ongoing discussions on the nondelegation doctrine, the Court has upheld many delegations of legislative power to executive agencies. The Chevron nondelegation doctrine proposed by Barron and Kagan would apply Chevron deference to agency decisions based on internal agency decisionmaking processes. Chevron deference would be accorded to lawful agency decisions made by the agency head after a meaningful review. The Chevron nondelegation doctrine proposed by Barron and Kagan suggests a new method of judicial deference to agency decisionmaking, comparing it to the congressional nondelegation doctrine. It determines whether agency decisions receive Chevron or Skidmore deference based on the number of delegations of legislative power from Congress to agency officials. The article discusses two types of delegation of power within agencies: one from Congress to agency officials and the other from designated agency officials to others within the agency. The first delegation must adhere to the congressional nondelegation doctrine by providing an \"intelligible principle.\" The second delegation is subject to the Chevron nondelegation doctrine, where courts defer to agency decisions if a legislative gap is filled by the designated individual, but not if a lower-level official provides the interpretation. This choice between agency and court resolution is crucial. The article discusses the institutional choice between agencies and courts in resolving statutory ambiguities, dependent on institutional design within agencies. The Supreme Court considers formal vs. informal procedures and general vs. particular applicability of agency decisions to determine the distribution of interpretive power. The article discusses the centralized versus decentralized nature of agency action, focusing on the dichotomies of formal versus informal procedures and general versus particular decision-making. Barron and Kagan criticize the Court's preference for formal procedures in agency decision-making. The examples of Chevron and Mead illustrate these dichotomies in agency rulings. The authors Barron and Kagan propose a new approach to agency decision-making, focusing on whether the decision was centralized or decentralized. They suggest that agencies should receive Chevron deference for decisions made by high-level officials, while lower-level officials' decisions should be subject to judicial review for legislative ambiguities. This contrasts with the Court's preference for formal procedures in agency rulings. The Supreme Court ruled that Chevron deference does not apply to Customs Service tariff classification rulings, as they were issued by lower-level agency officials. Barron and Kagan propose a Chevron nondelegation doctrine for agency decision-making to ensure political accountability and disciplined decision-making. There is potential for the Court to shift towards this approach due to differing views on when agency decisions should receive Chevron deference. The authors suggest a Chevron nondelegation doctrine for agency decision-making to ensure accountability and disciplined decision-making. They discuss the volume of agency actions outside notice-and-comment procedures and question whether courts will accept agency interpretations in forms other than rulemaking. The authors propose a Chevron nondelegation doctrine for agency decision-making to ensure accountability and disciplined decision-making. They question whether courts will accept agency interpretations in forms other than notice-and-comment rulemaking, suggesting a reformulation of the \"institutional choice\" between agencies and courts in resolving statutory ambiguities. Christensen v. Harris County and United States v. Mead Corporation are discussed as cases addressing this issue, with the Supreme Court not according Chevron deference to an agency interpretation in Christensen due to its lack of force of law. The Mead Court held that Chevron deference did not apply to Customs Service tariff classification rulings, as they lacked the force of law. The Court considered these rulings as interpretations similar to policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, deserving Skidmore deference. Congressional intent in the Mead majority and dissent was analyzed in relation to administrative law dichotomies. The Court outlined indicators of congressional intent for agency actions to have the force of law, including formal procedures like notice-and-comment rulemaking. Chevron deference may be granted based on these indicators, with formal procedures establishing a safe harbor. Justice Scalia dissented, focusing on the specificity of cases where Chevron deference is least likely to be granted. The Court outlined indicators of congressional intent for agency actions to have the force of law, including formal procedures like notice-and-comment rulemaking. Justice Scalia, dissenting, focused on whether Chevron deference should be granted based on the agency's \"authoritative\" interpretation. Barron and Kagan suggest a \"constructive\" congressional intent for determining judicial deference to agency decisions under Chevron. In the Chevron decision and its aftermath, Chevron deference to agencies was justified through theories like institutional competencies, statutory theory, and separation of powers principles. This involved making candid policy judgments about whether agencies or courts should resolve questions of statutory interpretation and fill in legislative gaps. The predominant theory for granting Chevron deference to agencies is the statutory theory, which connects congressional intent to agency interpretations. Justice Scalia's emphasis on congressional intent backfired with the Court's decision in Mead. The Mead Court's decision focused on actual congressional intent regarding Chevron deference, reaffirming congressional control. The authors rebut two constitutional arguments questioning Congress's final say over Chevron deference operation. They argue that policymaking and legal interpretation are intertwined in areas of statutory ambiguities, and courts must not possess dispositive power over legal interpretation. The authors argue that congressional choice should guide agencies and courts in resolving statutory ambiguities, critiquing Mead for clouding the role of courts in applying Chevron deference when Congress does not specify. They note that Congress has altered Chevron deference to grant interpretive power to courts instead of agencies. The authors critique the theory of congressional delegations to agencies for interpretive power, arguing that Congress should guide agencies and courts in resolving statutory ambiguities. They rebut the theory by stating that Congress may want judicial review of agency resolutions. The authors critique the theory of congressional delegations to agencies for interpretive power, arguing that Congress should guide agencies and courts in resolving statutory ambiguities. They rebut the theory by stating that Congress may want judicial review of agency resolutions of statutory ambiguities. The authors critique the theory of congressional delegations to agencies for interpretive power, arguing that Congress should guide agencies and courts in resolving statutory ambiguities. They assert that the APA's judicial review provision applies regardless of agency actions, using Mead as an example of unreliable congressional intent for Chevron deference. The authors criticize the Mead Court for not interpreting statutory language properly, leading to an unreliable method for determining Chevron deference. They suggest creating a \"constructive substitute\" for actual congressional intent, such as appealing to constitutional principles, assuming congressional self-interest, or assessing policy judgments based on institutional attributes. The authors propose three options for determining interpretive power placement: appealing to constitutional principles, assessing policy judgments based on institutional attributes, or examining implicit congressional intent. They argue that the third choice, focusing on the Court's own sense of sound administrative policy, is the only workable approach. The third option for determining interpretive power placement involves courts focusing on the policy consequences of allowing agencies or courts to make different decisions when congressional silence exists. This approach emphasizes political accountability and disciplined agency decision-making, as seen in the Court's approach in Mead. The authors analyze the Court's determination of when agencies should receive Chevron deference, offering three potential rationales for attributing policy judgments to congressional intent. They also evaluate the Mead Court's policy judgments based on institutional attributes. The authors discuss the Mead Court's lack of a clear rule for applying Chevron deference, viewing it as a case-by-case inquiry based on administrative law dichotomies. They compare this approach to the pre-Chevron era's consideration of factors like delegation scope and agency expertise. The authors examine different views of the Mead decision regarding Chevron deference. One view sees Mead as creating uncertainty, leading to caution and wasted effort by agencies. Another view sees Mead as establishing a structured safe harbor for when Chevron deference applies. The more specific an agency's decisions are, the less likely they are to retain interpretive control under Chevron. The authors discuss the impact of formal versus informal procedures on agency discretion and judicial deference. They argue in favor of granting Chevron deference to agency decisions made using formal procedures for prophylactic and preferential reasons. The authors argue that granting Chevron deference to agency decisions made using formal procedures is not justified, as it does not address the underlying problems and may lead to agencies not clearly stating their views before taking enforcement actions. Barron and Kagan criticize agencies for not clearly stating their views before enforcement actions, questioning the value of notice-and-comment procedures and highlighting the competition among interest groups in the rulemaking process. They also discuss Mead's suggestion on when informal agency actions should receive Chevron deference. The authors question the assumption that general agency decisionmaking deserves more deference than limited agency decisionmaking, suggesting that case-by-case decisionmaking may promote the sensible development of the law. They also argue that case-by-case decisionmaking does not necessarily show more uncertainty than a court's decision in a particular case. Barron and Kagan criticize Mead's emphasis on general decisionmaking, favoring the Chevron nondelegation doctrine instead. They argue that Chevron deference should be based on the agency actors, not the administrative process. The Chevron nondelegation doctrine proposed by Barron and Kagan shifts the focus of deference from internal agency procedures to the decision-making official within the agency, termed as an issue of \"institutional design.\" This doctrine suggests that courts should defer to the agency's interpretation under Chevron if the decision is issued by the statutory delegatee, and under Skidmore deference if the decision-making authority is subdelegated to another agency official. Under the Chevron nondelegation doctrine proposed by Barron and Kagan, the decisionmaker's identity, mode of decision, and timing are key factors for receiving Chevron deference. The decisionmaker must be the statutory delegatee, the decision must be formally adopted after a meaningful review, and the decision to adopt an agency interpretation must precede the agency decision. The authors argue that Chevron deference should be limited to decisions made by the statutory delegatee for policy reasons, as they believe this promotes accountable and disciplined policymaking. They suggest focusing on the statutory delegatee as they are likely to be an upper-level policy official and easily identifiable. The decision by the statutory delegatee can receive Chevron deference if the interpretation is authored by them or adopted and issued under their name. The interpretation must be authored or adopted by the statutory delegatee after a meaningful review by the delegatee or her close advisors to ensure sound administration. Review can be conducted by senior advisors due to the delegatee's extensive responsibilities and time commitments. Barron and Kagan discuss the distinction between the delegatee's use of senior advisors and subdelegation of authority to lower-level agency officials, emphasizing that senior advisors do not undermine political accountability or disciplined policymaking. They compare the delegatee's staff to congressional staff and argue that the delegatee's decisions remain their own despite the involvement of advisors. The delegatee's decision to adopt an agency interpretation must precede the agency's final issuance. The authors argue for the Chevron nondelegation doctrine, comparing it with the congressional nondelegation doctrine focused on decision-making power delegation. They highlight political accountability and administrative action discipline as key aspects. The authors argue for the Chevron nondelegation doctrine, emphasizing political accountability and disciplined administrative action in agency decision-making. They believe high-level agency officials are more politically accountable, making their decisions more transparent and responsive to public oversight. The authors advocate for the Chevron nondelegation doctrine to ensure political accountability and disciplined administrative action in agency decision-making. They argue that identifying agency officials with final responsibility for interpretations promotes transparency and accountability, leading to more centralized decision-making and coherent agency policies. Barron and Kagan argue that meaningful review by top agency officials enhances lower-level agency preparedness and improves agency actions. They also believe that upper-level agency review ensures consistency in agency actions and promotes the integration of diverse agency actions into a coordinated policy stream. Additionally, they outline arguments against the congressional nondelegation doctrine. In response to arguments against the centralization of decision-making authority in the Chevron nondelegation doctrine, it is noted that this doctrine allows for internal delegations and affects the deference given by courts. High-level agency officials can more easily comply with this doctrine compared to the congressional nondelegation doctrine. The Chevron nondelegation doctrine allows for internal delegations and affects court deference. High-level agency officials can comply more easily with this doctrine compared to Congress. Barron and Kagan argue that the delegatee can monitor the agency effectively, with limited decisions and various processes available for meaningful review. Kagan argues that centralizing decision-making authority in agencies may increase political accountability but outweighs bureaucratic inertia. The Chevron nondelegation doctrine promotes exchanges between upper and lower-level agency perspectives, even if it suppresses expertise. The authors argue that the Chevron nondelegation doctrine's centralizing effects will impact cases where judicial deference is crucial, especially those involving agency expertise. They suggest that this doctrine could be more effectively implemented than the congressional nondelegation doctrine due to courts being able to mandate certain actions. The authors argue that the Chevron nondelegation doctrine could be more effectively implemented than the congressional nondelegation doctrine. Courts can mandate the statutory delegatee to adopt the agency's decision as her own interpretation, making the meaningful review requirement self-enforcing. Court enforcement of the meaningful review requirement may present difficulties, leading to potential issues with evaluating the quality of the delegatee's review. The authors believe that the statutory delegatee will not simply rubberstamp agency interpretations but will conduct a meaningful review due to institutional and political incentives. They argue that the delegatee may choose not to adopt agency interpretations out of a sense of professional responsibility and to avoid political risks associated with unpopular decisions. Additionally, a subdelegatee's decision may still be upheld by a court without Chevron deference. The authors discuss how statutory delegatees may face pressure not to adopt agency interpretations to avoid political risks and maintain professional responsibility. This can lead to internal divisions within the agency and challenges for courts in addressing rubberstamping of decisions. The authors argue that courts should withhold Chevron deference when agencies consistently approve low-level decisions without review. They propose a standard where deference is contingent on meaningful review and responsibility assumed by high-level agency officials, without the need for intensive scrutiny of internal decision-making processes in each case. Instead, courts can rely on political and institutional incentives to enforce the Chevron nondelegation doctrine. The authors argue that courts should shape agency decisionmaking by recognizing nonlegal attributes. They apply the Chevron nondelegation doctrine to Mead, where the majority opinion diverges from the doctrine by favoring decisions of low-level officials over high-level ones, which the dissent finds absurd. The dissent in the case argues against granting Chevron deference to decisions made by administrative law judges, favoring instead authoritative agency interpretations defended in litigation. They believe post-decision ratification would not promote accountability and consideration in agency decision-making, leading to procedural costs and litigation risks. The authors argue that the dissent's focus on agency structure does not meet the Chevron nondelegation test they set forward. They suggest attributing the statutory delegation to the head of Customs in the case of Mead, stating that the decision lacks high-level input for Chevron deference but may qualify for Skidmore deference. Their proposed Chevron nondelegation doctrine would preclude most rulings in Mead from receiving Chevron deference. Barron and Kagan propose criteria for agency involvement to warrant Chevron deference, regardless of administrative law dichotomies. Agency actions must still follow APA procedures to be valid and receive deference. Barron and Kagan propose criteria for agency involvement to warrant Chevron deference, emphasizing the importance of promoting political accountability and disciplined agency action. They argue that the Court's focus on formal procedures may lead to increased ossification and inflexibility in the agency process. The authors advocate for a Chevron nondelegation doctrine approach to ensure accountability and disciplined decision-making within agencies. The agency process must consider institutional elements like authority distribution, budget resources, and the agency's relationship with the President. Barron and Kagan's article has been cited 80 times, focusing on how courts should allocate interpretive authority between themselves and administrative agencies. Their emphasis on the decisionmaker's identity as a trigger for Chevron deference is seen as a significant departure from previous court decisions. The curr_chunk discusses the proposal by Barron and Kagan to alter the Court's application of Chevron and Mead, particularly focusing on the nondelegation doctrine. Vermeule's 2003 law review article critiques this proposal, stating that the normative case for the Chevron nondelegation doctrine is undertheorized and raises issues of political accountability. Vermeule criticizes the authors' proposal to change Chevron and Mead, especially regarding the nondelegation doctrine. He argues that political accountability is already present in ordinary politics, making a special nondelegation rule unnecessary in the agency context. Legislators and agency heads can be held accountable for delegation decisions, as shown in a case involving the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of OSHA. Vermeule criticizes the lack of empirical support for the claim that agency decisions by low-level employees are less transparent. He argues that agency heads can easily bypass the Chevron nondelegation doctrine by delegating decision-making authority while retaining legal authority, leading to courts granting Chevron deference for those delegated decisions. Vermeule questions the need for a substitute for Chevron deference if it is not desirable, as suggested by Barron and Kagan. He argues that if agency officials would rubberstamp lower-level decisions to avoid responsibility, then court review would be as costly as the Mead inquiry it aims to replace. In a 2006 law review article, Amy Wildermuth discussed Vermeule's critique of the Chevron nondelegation doctrine. She highlighted the concern of rubberstamping by statutory delegatees and proposed a solution to deny Chevron deference in cases of wholesale evasion. Wildermuth noted that while the solution sets a high bar, it may be too simplistic. In a 2006 law review article, Amy Wildermuth discussed Vermeule's critique of the Chevron nondelegation doctrine, highlighting concerns of rubberstamping by statutory delegatees. She proposed a solution to deny Chevron deference in cases of wholesale evasion, setting a high bar but possibly being too simplistic. Another law review article compares Barron and Kagan's solution, suggesting potential loopholes for avoiding misbehavior findings. In a 2006 law review article, Amy Wildermuth discussed concerns about rubberstamping by statutory delegatees in relation to the Chevron nondelegation doctrine. She proposed denying Chevron deference in cases of wholesale evasion. On legal blogs, Barron and Kagan's approach to Chevron was compared to Justice Scalia's, with concerns about separation of powers and the desire for politically accountable officials to make policy-laden decisions. The author discusses the potential effects of Barron and Kagan's approach to Chevron deference, emphasizing the shift towards politically accountable officials making statutory interpretations instead of judges. This change could strengthen the presumption of head administrators' decisions, weaken lower agency officials' authority, increase administrative workload, and reduce ad-hoc decision-making within agencies. The proposed change is seen as significant by the author. The proposed change by Barron and Kagan regarding Chevron deference would significantly impact agency actions currently issued by lower-level officials, potentially leading to increased court scrutiny. However, the authors do not address how their doctrine would apply in cases of vacancies in agency positions or temporary leadership. This could affect the level of deference granted by courts in such situations. The Vacancies Act applies to single statutory delegatees, allowing temporary filling of positions like agency heads. Arguments for granting Chevron deference to temporary officials include their ability to perform the same functions as the delegatee and the limited pool of potential appointees under the Act. The Vacancies Act allows for temporary appointment of higher level officers to perform duties of vacant positions. Vacancies on multi-member boards can lead to lack of quorum, hindering decision-making. For example, the FEC faced issues in 2008 due to multiple vacancies. The FEC and NLRB faced operational challenges due to vacancies in their memberships, leading to quorum issues and hindering decision-making processes. In Process Steel, L.P. v NLRB, the Supreme Court ruled that a delegee group must have a membership of three to exercise delegated authority. Vacancies in agency memberships may lead to decisions eligible for Skidmore deference. One solution proposed is to allow Chevron deference for decisions made by upper-level individuals like senior advisors or officials with supervisory authority. Enabling senior advisors or supervisory officials to issue decisions eligible for Chevron deference, while the board or commission cannot, may reduce political accountability. The Chevron nondelegation doctrine shifts focus from public involvement in agency procedures to post-decision political accountability. This shift could make the agency less responsive to the public and more reliant on lower-level officials for issuing decisions. The shift to allowing senior advisors or supervisory officials to make decisions eligible for Chevron deference may reduce political accountability and make the agency less responsive to the public. This raises questions about the value of assigning Chevron deference based on decisionmaker identity versus formal procedures. The accountability of agencies to the public is questioned when decisions are made without soliciting input or meaningful review. The Court, under Skidmore, independently interprets statutes with agency interpretation as a factor. Barron and Kagan's theory on Chevron deference suggests agency control if statutory delegatee meets their tests, potentially reforming Court's jurisprudence. This allows agencies, not courts, to be decisionmakers under Chevron. The potential implications of lower-level agency decisions potentially receiving Skidmore deference include increased court scrutiny and uncertainty among regulated parties and agencies. This could lead to more court decisions without deferring to agency interpretations, while high-level agency decisions may face less scrutiny according to Barron and Kagan's argument. The Chevron nondelegation doctrine raises issues regarding the timing of decisions and the level of deference given to statutory delegatee's adoption of interim final rules. Barron and Kagan argue that delegatees cannot ratify agency decisions after issuance, and interim final rules have binding effect if validly promulgated. Agencies may modify rules based on post-promulgation comments. Congress may delegate its legislative power to an executive branch agency for reasons such as efficiency, expertise, ability to modify the law, transfer of responsibility, and potential for blame. Congress may decide against delegating interpretive authority to agencies for various reasons, including concerns about special interests, marketplace influence, and inefficiency in agency actions. If Congress chooses to delegate legislative authority to an agency, it can control the delegation by writing broad or narrow statutes. If Congress decides to delegate legislative authority to an agency, it can control the delegation by writing broad or narrow statutes. The Chevron nondelegation doctrine could lead Congress to be more specific in its delegations to ensure that agency decision-making at lower levels also receives Chevron deference. For example, Congress could consider delegating authority to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs instead of the Secretary of Health and Human Services for decisions involving the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research."
