    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 226 of the Labor Code is amended to read: 226. An employer must provide an itemized statement to employees with details such as gross wages, total hours worked, deductions, net wages earned, and other relevant information. The itemized statement provided by the employer must include the employee's social security number, employer's name and address, hourly rates, hours worked, deductions, and pay rates for temporary services assignments. Deductions must be recorded in ink, dated, and kept on file for at least three years. The itemized statement provided by the employer in California must include all required information, and a copy can be a duplicate or a computer-generated record. An employer in California must allow current and former employees to inspect or copy their employment records upon request. The employer can verify the identity of the employee and may charge for reproducing the records. An employer in California must comply with a request from a current or former employee to inspect or copy their employment records within 21 days. Failure to do so is an infraction, unless impossibility of performance is proven. This requirement does not apply to employees of residential dwellings whose duties are personal or incidental to the owner's activities. An employee suffering injury due to an employer's intentional failure to comply with wage statement requirements is entitled to recover damages and penalties up to $4,000. The curr_chunk outlines the information required on itemized wage statements, including gross and net wages, deductions, employer details, and employee identification. (f) Failure to allow current or former employees to inspect or copy records promptly may result in a $750 penalty. An isolated unintentional payroll error is not considered a knowing and intentional failure. Compliance may be assessed based on whether the employer has adopted policies that comply with the law. (g) The employer listing the legal entity that secured their services in the itemized statement does not create liability for that entity. An employee can seek injunctive relief for compliance with this section and may be awarded costs and attorney's fees. (i) This section excludes governmental entities from certain requirements regarding employee wage statements, allowing them to use only the last four digits of the employee's social security number or an alternate employee identification number. (j) Employers are not obligated to include total hours worked on itemized wage statements under certain circumstances. The employee's compensation is based on salary and exempt from overtime payment under specific conditions outlined by the Industrial Welfare Commission. Exemptions include executive, administrative, or professional roles, outside salespersons, computer software professionals on a salary basis, and individuals related to the employer. The curr_chunk discusses exemptions for participants in rehabilitation programs, crew members on fishing boats, and individuals in national service programs as outlined by the Industrial Welfare Commission."
