    "content": "SECTION 1. NET METERING. The amendment to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 introduces net metering for electric consumers, requiring electric utilities to offer this service upon request. State regulatory authorities have the option to decide whether to implement this provision within a year of its enactment. The amendment introduces net metering for electric consumers, allowing states to establish incentives for on-site generating facilities. The Secretary must report on the status of implementation by states and list pre-approved systems annually. The amendment introduces net metering for on-site generating facilities with a capacity of 25 kilowatts or less fueled by solar energy, wind energy, or fuel cells. It also requires a report on the public benefits derived from net metering and interconnection standards. The amendment introduces net metering for on-site generating facilities with a capacity of 25 kilowatts or less fueled by solar energy, wind energy, or fuel cells. It also includes a facility for commercial electric consumers with a maximum generating capacity of 1000 kilowatts or less fueled by renewable energy resources, landfill gas, or high-efficiency systems like fuel cells or combined heat and power. The amendment introduces net metering for on-site generating facilities with a capacity of 25 kilowatts or less fueled by solar energy, wind energy, or fuel cells. It allows energy generated on-site to offset energy provided by the electric utility to the consumer. Renewable energy resources include solar, wind, biomass, micro-freeflow-hydro, or geothermal energy. Net metering service is defined as a service provided in accordance with this subsection. An electric utility must charge on-site generating facilities the same rates as other consumers in the same class and cannot impose additional fees. The utility must measure the energy produced and consumed by the facility owner. The electric utility must measure the electric energy consumed by an on-site generating facility owner during a billing period. If the quantity of energy sold exceeds the quantity supplied, the utility may bill the owner for the difference. The electric utility can bill the owner of an on-site generating facility for excess energy consumed, and the owner will be credited with a kilowatt-hour credit or cash refund for excess energy generated. Compliance with standards is required for eligible on-site generating facilities and net metering systems. The on-site generating facility and net metering system must adhere to safety, performance, reliability, and interconnection standards set by various organizations. The Commission will establish additional requirements after considering these standards and consulting with relevant authorities. The Commission will establish requirements for on-site generating facilities and net metering systems to protect public safety and system reliability."
