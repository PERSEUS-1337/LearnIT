    "content": "From April 20 to 24, 2009, U.N. member states will meet in Geneva for the Durban Review Conference Against Racism. Some Members of Congress are concerned about repeating mistakes from the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa, where the focus on Israel as a perpetrator of racism caused the U.S. to withdraw. The U.S. withdrew from WCAR due to concerns about governments targeting Israel while ignoring contemporary forms of racism. The Bush Administration opposed the Durban Review Conference, while the Obama Administration initially participated in consultations but later decided not to engage in future negotiations due to the draft document's focus. The U.S. withdrew from future negotiations at the Durban Review Conference due to concerns about the focus on Israel. Other countries like Canada, Israel, and Italy also announced boycotts. Members of Congress are worried about funding a conference that may promote anti-Semitism. Members of the 111th Congress are considering oversight of the Review Conference and U.S. financial contributions. Some are concerned about the focus on Israel discrediting U.N. efforts to combat racism internationally. The ongoing Review Conference preparations suggest that certain U.N. member states will target Israel. Concerns arise regarding the diplomatic impact of U.S. participation. Some argue that U.S. engagement in the Review Conference is crucial for its reputation and negotiating influence. Opponents believe U.S. participation would legitimize U.N. mechanisms criticizing Israel for racism. This report provides background on previous U.N. efforts to address racism. The report discusses previous U.N. efforts to address racism, the objectives of the Durban Review Conference, charges of bias against Israel, and the impact of U.S. participation or non-participation. The upcoming Durban Review Conference is part of broader U.N. efforts to address racism since the organization's establishment in 1945. The U.N. has integrated racial equality into international documents since 1945, with member states negotiating agreements like the ICERD to eliminate discrimination. The Human Rights Council has also addressed racism through bodies like the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination. The Human Rights Council appointed a Special Rapporteur on racism in 1993 to report on contemporary forms of racism. U.N. member states have focused on raising global awareness of racism through \"Decades Against Racism\" and global anti-racism conferences, including the controversial 1975 General Assembly resolution 3379. In 1975, General Assembly resolution 3379 declared Zionism as a form of racism, which was strongly opposed by the United States. The resolution was revoked in 1991, but its adoption had a lasting negative impact on U.N. efforts to address racism and relations among member states. The United States boycotted the 1978 and 1985 World Conferences Against Racism due to its opposition to resolution 3379, but decided to participate in the 2001 conference. The United States decided to participate in the 2001 World Conference Against Racism due to the revocation of resolution 3379 in 1991. Congressional response to U.N. efforts on racism has varied, with support for mechanisms like ICERD but condemnation of efforts targeting Israel. Members were critical of resolution 3379 and agreed with the U.S. decision not to participate in the first two U.N. Decades Against Racism. The 2001 World Conference Against Racism was held in Durban, South Africa, with objectives including reviewing progress made. The 2001 World Conference Against Racism took place in Durban, South Africa from August 31 to September 7. Objectives included reviewing progress in combating racism, xenophobia, and intolerance, recommending ways to increase U.N. effectiveness in combating these issues, and improving regional, national, and international measures. Unlike previous conferences, WCAR also addressed xenophobia and related intolerance. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights was designated as the preparatory committee, and the Conference secretariat operated out of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Participation was open to all. The 2001 World Conference Against Racism (WCAR) took place in Durban, South Africa. Participation was open to representatives from all U.N. member states, regional organizations, NGOs, and intergovernmental organizations. Approximately 2,300 representatives from 163 countries attended WCAR, funded through the U.N. regular budget and voluntary contributions. Governments held regional meetings to prepare for WCAR, drafting Declarations and Programs of Action. At the second session of the Preparatory Committee, a working group of 21 states, including the United States, was established. The Group of 21, including the United States, synthesized outcome documents for the World Conference Against Racism. The documents were crucial for combating racism internationally. The U.S. initially supported the conference and established a Task Force for coordination. The Bush Administration continued to support the conference and Task Force, covering U.S. costs. The Bush Administration expressed concerns over anti-Israel language and reparations proposals at the World Conference Against Racism. Initial drafts of the Declaration equated Zionism with racism, leading to controversy. Some countries, including the United States, objected to language equating Zionism with racism at the World Conference Against Racism. The Bush Administration announced that Secretary of State Colin Powell would not attend the conference due to concerns over the draft outcome documents targeting Israel. The United States objected to language in the draft WCAR outcome documents addressing reparations for slavery. African governments at a regional meeting in Senegal in 2001 agreed on language requesting apologies, compensation, and reparations for victims of racial discrimination and slavery. The draft documents at Durban included language urging countries to provide remedies and reparations for damage from racial discrimination, as well as offering apologies to victims of slavery and their heirs. The United States objected to language in the draft WCAR outcome documents addressing reparations for slavery, particularly the mention of trans-Atlantic slavery. The Administration stated that there was no consensus in the US on the reparations issue and opposed calls for reparations. They emphasized a \"future-oriented approach\" and expressed support for programs focusing on contemporary manifestations of racism and intolerance. The United States supported programs to address Africa's development challenges at the Conference, but withdrew due to anti-Israel language. Some Members of Congress saw WCAR as vital for combating racism, while others were concerned about language targeting Israel. The US did not pay $250,000 in voluntary contributions to WCAR due to its withdrawal. Some Members urged the Administration to participate in the Conference despite controversial text in the draft outcome documents, believing the US could bring balance to the issue. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus supported WCAR's objectives and full US participation, while some disagreed with the Administration's stance on discussing slavery reparations. Views on the US withdrawal varied, with some arguing against singling out Israel in the outcome documents. After the United States and Israel withdrew from the Conference, remaining member states negotiated intensely, resulting in the creation of the Durban Declaration and Program of Action. These documents established international definitions and new U.N. mechanisms to address racism and discrimination, including the establishment of an anti-discrimination unit within the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The outcome documents from the World Conference Against Racism (WCAR) urged member states to establish national policies to address racism and discrimination. Some observers were concerned that WCAR's focus on Israel and Palestine overshadowed other important aspects of the Conference, such as the rights of indigenous people and specific instances of contemporary racism. Many supported the documents' emphasis on human rights institutions, education, and good governance in combating racial discrimination. Some governments had reservations about specific provisions in the Declaration and Program of Action, particularly regarding the Middle East, historic injustices like slavery and colonialism, and the rights of indigenous peoples. The final WCAR outcome documents expressed concern for the Palestinian people's plight and their right to self-determination. There was a call for an end to violence and a swift resumption of negotiations in the Middle East, but the documents did not equate Zionism with racism. The outcome documents at WCAR did not equate Zionism with racism, with some EU members seeing it as an improvement. Canada distanced itself from mentioning the Middle East, while some countries felt the text didn't address the Palestinian territories adequately. The Declaration recognized slavery as a \"crime against humanity\" and its contribution to poverty. The outcome documents at the World Conference Against Racism recognized slavery as a \"crime against humanity\" and its contribution to poverty. It called for protection against racism, just reparations, and development programs for societies impacted by historic injustices like slavery. Developed countries and the U.N. system were urged to support development mechanisms, especially in Africa. Some African and Caribbean states felt the Conference did not adequately address the issue, as it did not call for reparations or an explicit apology for historical injustices. The outcome documents of the World Conference Against Racism urged U.N. member states to combat slavery, create national action plans, and establish the Anti-Discrimination Unit and a Group of Experts. The resolution was supported by 134 countries, opposed by the United States and Israel, and abstained by Australia and Canada. The United States disagreed with the Durban Declaration and Program of Action, opposed the new mechanisms due to budget concerns, and withdrew from the WCAR. A parallel NGO Forum in Durban resulted in the NGO WCAR Declaration, viewed as unbalanced by some observers. The NGO WCAR Declaration at the parallel NGO Forum in Durban was criticized for its focus on Israel, leading to some NGOs distancing themselves from the final text. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights described the Declaration as \"hateful\" and \"racist,\" causing controversy and overshadowing the Conference. Discussions for a follow-up conference to review progress on the Durban Declaration and Program of Action began after the WCAR. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution to convene the Durban Review Conference in Geneva, Switzerland in 2009. The Conference aims to review progress on the Durban Declaration, assess manifestations of racism, evaluate existing follow-up mechanisms, and share good practices in combating racism. The preparatory process involves the U.N. Human Rights Council as the Preparatory Committee, with all member states invited to join and determine the Conference objectives. The Durban Review Conference aims to review progress on the Durban Declaration, assess manifestations of racism, and share good practices in combating racism. The Conference is funded through assessed contributions to the U.N. regular budget and voluntary contributions from member states and organizations. The Secretary-General estimated additional financial requirements for the Conference to be $3,754,800, with only $570,400 requested from the regular budget. Funding for the Durban Review Conference will be covered by the U.N. regular budget. Participation in the Conference is open to various entities. The U.S. Administration announced its delegation for Review Conference consultations. The U.S. Administration announced its delegation for Review Conference consultations and expressed concerns about the draft outcome document, stating it was not salvageable. They will not engage in further negotiations unless a constructive approach to addressing racism and discrimination is taken. The U.S. Administration announced its delegation for Review Conference consultations and expressed concerns about the draft outcome document, stating it was not salvageable. They emphasized the need for a \"constructive approach\" to addressing racism and discrimination, opposing the reaffirmation of the 2001 Durban Declaration, singling out specific countries like Israel, embracing the concept of defamation of religion, and addressing slavery reparations beyond the DDPA. The Bush Administration opposed the Durban Review Conference but did not announce a boycott, leaving the final decision to a new Administration. The U.S. and Israel voted against resolutions related to the Conference in 2006 and 2007. The U.S. Administration declined to participate in the preparatory events for the Review Conference and announced that the United States would withhold a portion of its 2008 contribution to the U.N. regular budget that would fund the U.N. Human Rights Council. Members of Congress have shown interest in the Review Conference. Some Members of Congress have expressed opposition to U.S. funding or participation in the Review Conference due to concerns about its focus on Israel. However, others see it as an opportunity to address international racism. The House adopted a resolution urging the U.S. to lead diplomatic efforts to ensure the Conference reviews commitments made in 2001, rather than promoting anti-Semitism. Several governments have concerns about the Review Conference, with Canada and other countries boycotting it due to fears of anti-Semitism. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the United Kingdom also expressed reservations about the Conference. Initially, Israel considered boycotting the Conference but later formally announced its decision not to participate. In 2008, Israel and Italy announced they would not participate in the Durban Review Conference, citing concerns of bias against Israel. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights urged countries to reconsider, emphasizing the importance of all countries participating in the anti-racism debate. The Obama Administration and some Members of Congress suggested U.S. participation contingent on the Conference not becoming biased. During the Durban Review Conference, concerns were raised about potential anti-Semitism, reaffirmation of the 2001 Durban Declaration, and defamation of religion. Some countries advocated for focusing on implementing the Declaration instead of reopening controversial issues. Israel and Italy had previously decided not to participate due to perceived bias against Israel. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights urged all countries to join the anti-racism debate. The Obama Administration and some Members of Congress suggested U.S. participation contingent on avoiding bias. The Review Conference Preparatory Committee elected a Bureau of 21 members to determine Conference modalities and objectives, with concerns raised about the composition of the Group including countries with anti-Israel sentiments. Libya and Cuba are the Bureau Chair and Vice-Chairperson Rapporteur, leading to worries about bias. Some governments have attended meetings to plan the Review Conference, including the Intersessional Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group. Concerns were raised about drafts proposed by the Working Group, such as a list of issues mentioning the \"plight of the Palestinian people\" and violations of civil and political rights in the occupied Palestinian territories. U.N. Member States have been negotiating the Conference outcome document. The U.N. Member States have been negotiating a draft outcome document for the Review Conference. A 17-page draft outcome document was published by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which removed controversial aspects from previous drafts. Critics argue that the document does not meet the conditions for U.S. participation due to its reaffirmation of the Durban Declaration and Program of Action. Critics argue that the Review Conference draft outcome singles out Israel as a perpetrator of racism, while supporters believe U.S. participation can influence a positive outcome. The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights sees the shortened text as a good basis for negotiations. Supporters highlight the difference between early WCAR drafts equating Zionism with racism and the final DDPA with more moderate language. Bush Administration officials support U.S. participation in the Conference. The Bush Administration officials indicated that the United States would not fund the Review Conference unless it was assured it would not promote anti-Semitic behavior. The final decision on funding will be made by the Obama Administration or Members of Congress. If Congress does not pass legislation to prohibit funding, the Obama Administration may choose to withhold U.S. contributions. This raises questions about whether funding would be released if the Conference's outcome is acceptable to the United States. Some Members of Congress proposed withholding a portion of U.S. assessed contributions to the UN. The United States proposed withholding a proportionate share of its U.N. assessed contributions for the Durban Review Conference, which would not affect the Conference as assessed contributions fund the U.N. regular budget. The Secretary-General estimated the cost of the Review Conference to be $3,754,800, with only $570,400 in additional funding needed. Some suggest the United States should provide funding for the Durban Review Conference as the final text addressing Israel and Palestine was toned down from previous drafts. The U.S. and Israeli withdrawals from WCAR were seen as a diplomatic turning point, pressuring other governments to adopt more moderate language. However, some still find the language in the Declaration and Program of Action unacceptable to the U.S. Opponents criticize the Bush Administration for voting against resolutions supporting the Durban Review Conference in the U.N. They argue that the Declaration and Program of Action unfairly focus on the Palestinians without mentioning Israel. Supporters believe U.S. participation in U.N. efforts is crucial for the organization's credibility and success. They suggest that the U.S. should engage in U.N. conferences it opposes to build member state coalitions in support of its policies. Some argue that U.S. participation in U.N. efforts is crucial to prevent opposing agendas from dominating. Supporters believe selective engagement weakens U.S. influence within the U.N. system. U.S. involvement in human rights initiatives like the Review Conference is seen as valuable for combating racism globally. However, opponents fear U.S. engagement could legitimize mechanisms targeting Israel within the U.N. Some argue that U.S. participation in U.N. efforts is crucial to prevent opposing agendas from dominating, while opponents fear it could legitimize mechanisms targeting Israel within the U.N. They believe U.S. non-participation sends a clear message that repeatedly targeting one country in U.N. fora is unacceptable. The Bush Administration's decision not to participate until it is proven that the Review Conference will not become a platform for anti-Semitism is supported by these opponents. The possibility of U.S. participation and that of like-minded governments could influence U.N. member states to approach drafting Review Conference outcome documents more fairly for the April 2009 Conference."
