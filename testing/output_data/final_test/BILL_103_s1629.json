They shall also coordinate activities with other national research institutes and agencies to the extent that they have responsibilities related to lupus. The Director of the Institute shall conduct or support research to expand the understanding of the causes of lupus and find a cure for it. Activities under this section include research to determine the reasons for the elevated prevalence of the disease among African-American and other women, as well as the expansion and intensification of research support. The Director of the Institute will conduct or support research on the etiology and causes of lupus, epidemiological studies on disease frequency and natural history, differences among sexes and racial/ethnic groups, improved screening techniques, and clinical research for new treatments. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of appropriations for health care programs, including new biological agents, information, and education programs for healthcare professionals and the public.

The \"Lupus Research Amendments of 1994\" Act emphasizes the need for research on lupus in women, especially African American women.
