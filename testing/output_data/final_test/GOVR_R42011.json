    "content": "Since 1965, federal student aid programs have been available for certain educational programs that prepare students for gainful employment. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Education began developing regulations on gainful employment to address concerns about program quality and student loan debt. The U.S. Department of Education is developing regulations on gainful employment and student loan debt for proprietary institutions, which enroll a significant number of students and rely heavily on Title IV aid programs. Many students at these institutions receive aid in the form of loans that they must repay, including non-Title IV loans. The U.S. Department of Education is concerned about the quality of programs and student loan debt at proprietary institutions. Government reports have highlighted lower completion rates, placement rates, and higher default rates at these institutions. The Secretary of Education has the authority to regulate programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The Secretary of Education initiates a negotiated rulemaking process under HEA, Title IV to develop proposed regulations with stakeholders in the higher education community. If consensus is reached, the regulations are published in the Federal Register; if not, ED may proceed with its own regulatory language. The negotiated rulemaking process under HEA, Title IV FSA programs addressed regulations on gainful employment programs to ensure student loan debt and program quality concerns were met. In 2010, ED published proposed rules in the Federal Register for programs preparing students for gainful employment. The proposed rules aim to address concerns about program quality and student loan debt for gainful employment programs. They include reporting requirements and performance metrics to measure loan repayment and earnings of program completers. The rules would apply to programs preparing students for gainful employment under HEA, Title IV FSA programs. The proposed rules aim to establish reporting requirements and performance measures for educational programs to assess their effectiveness in leading to gainful employment. These rules apply to programs under HEA, Title IV FSA programs and are intended to ensure program quality and address student loan debt concerns. The proposed rules aim to establish performance measures for Title IV FSA programs to assess student loan repayment and the relationship between loan debt and earnings. The measures focus on institutions with high student loan borrowing rates, particularly proprietary schools, to ensure program quality and address student debt concerns. The proposed rules aim to ensure that gainful employment programs produce students with sufficient incomes relative to their debt for debt payments. The proposal received over 90,000 comments, with three-quarters opposed and one-quarter in support. Concerns included increased regulatory burden and potential program eligibility loss for federal student aid. Final rules were published on October 29, 2010, requiring institutions to report information on students in gainful employment programs. The final rules, effective July 1, 2011, require institutions to disclose completion rates, placement rates, student loan debt, and program costs for gainful employment programs. Changes were made based on comments received by ED, and a process for approval of new programs was established. Institutions had to report information by November 15, 2011. Performance measures and thresholds were also established. The final rules, effective July 1, 2011, require institutions to disclose completion rates, placement rates, student loan debt, and program costs for gainful employment programs. Changes were made based on comments received by ED, and a process for approval of new programs was established. Performance measures for gainful employment programs include a loan repayment rate (LRR) of 35% or more, an earnings rate (ER) of 12% or less, and a discretionary income rate (DIR) of 30%. According to regulations, a gainful employment program must meet specific performance measures to remain eligible for HEA, Title IV programs. Failure to meet these measures for three out of four fiscal years will result in ineligibility. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 1 aimed to prevent the implementation of rules on gainful employment. In the 112th Congress, hearings were held on gainful employment regulations, with a focus on potential implications for student choices in higher education and job creation. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions also held a hearing on issues related to for-profit education. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) held a hearing on issues related to for-profit institutions and student loan debt, specifically addressing the gainful employment regulations. In 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated and remanded many aspects of the regulations challenged by the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities (APSCU), citing a lack of rationale for the 35% repayment rate threshold. This decision affected various measures, reporting requirements, and regulations related to gainful employment programs. The U.S. District Court vacated and remanded aspects of gainful employment regulations challenged by APSCU in 2012. The court allowed disclosure requirements to remain, and ED may reinstate reporting requirements. Institutions must meet requirements to participate in FSA programs under HEA, Title IV. Institutions must meet specific criteria to participate in FSA programs, including being authorized by a state, accredited by a recognized agency, and certified by ED. They must offer at least one eligible program and fall into categories such as institutions of higher education, proprietary institutions, and postsecondary vocational institutions. Institutions must meet criteria to participate in FSA programs, including state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. Eligible institutions can offer programs leading to degrees or certifications. Foreign institutions may participate in the DL program if approved by ED. Eligibility criteria for programs at institutions of higher education require that they lead to a degree or certification, be of a certain length, admit students with specific qualifications, and prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The regulations on gainful employment depend on the program type and the institution offering it. The rules on gainful employment apply to programs at various types of higher education institutions, including public and private not-for-profit institutions and proprietary institutions. The rules vary depending on whether the program leads to a degree or not, with exceptions for certain types of programs. The regulations estimate that a significant number of institutions offer programs subject to these rules. The rules on gainful employment apply to programs at different types of higher education institutions, including public, private not-for-profit, and proprietary institutions. These rules require institutions to report information on students enrolled in programs preparing them for gainful employment. Starting October 1, 2011, institutions offering such programs must report student information and program details annually to calculate debt-to-earnings ratios for program completers. The gainful employment rules apply to various higher education institutions, requiring them to report student information and program details annually. This includes data on program completers' earnings, private educational loans received, institutional financing owed, and whether students advanced to higher credentialed programs. Identifying information for students enrolled in gainful employment programs is also reported. Prior to the regulations being vacated, Title IV institutions were required to report gainful employment information for AY2010-2011. Effective July 1, 2011, institutions offering programs for gainful employment must provide prospective students with information on occupations the program prepares students for, including SOC codes and O*NET profiles. The reporting requirements were vacated but ED is seeking reinstatement. The institution must provide information on program costs, on-time graduation rate, placement rate, and median loan debt for students completing the program. Placement rates will be calculated according to a methodology determined by the National Center for Education Statistics. The National Center for Education Statistics requires disclosure of median loan debt for students completing a program, separately for different types of loans. Gainful employment performance measures were vacated in 2012. The Loan Repayment Rate measures the proportion of loans borrowed by students. The Loan Repayment Rate (LRR) tracks the proportion of FFEL and DL program loans borrowed by students for gainful employment programs that have been repaid in full or on which qualifying payments have been made during the most recent fiscal year. It measures the OOPB of loans that entered repayment in a two-year or four-year base period and compares it to the OOPB of loans that have been paid. The Loan Repayment Rate (LRR) measures the performing loan ratio for student loans borrowed for gainful employment programs. It includes loans paid in full (LPF) and loans with qualifying payments (PML) during the measurement year. The LRR is calculated by comparing the original outstanding principal balance of loans in repayment to the total outstanding principal balance. A program is considered successful if the LRR is 35% or higher. The Loan Repayment Rate (LRR) measures the original outstanding principal balance of FFEL and DL program loans borrowed for gainful employment programs. It includes different base periods depending on the program type and enrollment, such as a two-year period (2YP) or a four-year period. The Loan Repayment Rate (LRR) measures the original outstanding principal balance of FFEL and DL program loans borrowed for gainful employment programs. Different base periods are used depending on the program type and enrollment, such as a two-year period (2YP) or a four-year period. The base periods vary for programs with residency requirements and small numbers of borrowers. The Loan Repayment Rate (LRR) measures the outstanding principal balance of loans for gainful employment programs. Different base periods are used based on program type and enrollment, with residency requirements and small borrower numbers affecting the period length. The numerator of the LRR includes the outstanding principal balance of loans that have been paid in full or have payments made. The Loan Repayment Rate (LRR) measures outstanding loan balances for gainful employment programs. Loans included in the numerator must not have been in default and must have payments made. A loan paid in full means the borrower has fully repaid it. Payments made loans require qualifying payments during the most recent fiscal year to reduce the outstanding balance. The borrower must make payments towards the outstanding balance of a Consolidation Loan to ensure the outstanding loan balance at the end of the fiscal year is less than or equal to the beginning balance. This applies to certain degree programs and borrowers qualifying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The borrower must make scheduled payments on the loan according to specific repayment plans, equal to or less than the interest that accrues on the loan during the fiscal year. The Secretary calculates loan repayment rates using different base periods and determines if the program meets the minimum LRR threshold. The Secretary calculates loan repayment rates using different base periods and determines if the program meets the minimum LRR threshold. Certain loans are excluded from the LRR measure, including those in deferment, discharged due to borrower death, assigned to the Secretary, or discharged due to borrower disability. Two debt-to-earnings measures were established: Earnings Rate and Discretionary Income Rate. The Earnings Rate (ER) and Discretionary Income Rate (DIR) measures compare student loan debt to annual earnings of program completers, taking into account higher debt for higher credentialed programs. The ER calculates the annual loan payment amount as a percentage of earnings, while the DIR measures the percentage of discretionary income used for loan payments. The Earnings Rate (ER) and Discretionary Income Rate (DIR) measures compare student loan debt to annual earnings of program completers. The ER is a proxy for the proportion of earnings used for loan payments, while the DIR measures the percentage of discretionary income used for loan payments. A program is considered to provide gainful employment if the ER is 12% or less. The Discretionary Income Rate (DIR) is calculated based on the annual earnings of program completers compared to the poverty guideline income. It determines the proportion of discretionary income that a borrower with student loan debt must allocate towards loan payments. A program is deemed to lead to gainful employment if the DIR is 30% or less. Title IV institutions with programs preparing students for gainful employment were required to provide specific information to the Department of Education (ED) for calculating debt-to-earnings measures. This included student identification, program details, loan amounts, and completion status. ED would also gather loan information from the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) to calculate earnings rates. Institutions providing gainful employment programs were required to submit student information to the Department of Education (ED) for calculating debt-to-earnings measures. Additional data could be provided on program completers' tuition and fees. Exclusions from debt-to-earnings measures included military deferment, student death, or loan assignment to the Secretary. The student's loans were either assigned to the Secretary, discharged due to disability, or the student was in a gainful employment program. Base periods were used to identify program completers for debt-to-earnings measures. Base periods for these measures were different from those for loan repayment rates. The base periods for debt-to-earnings measures align with those for loan repayment rates, except for the absence of a 2YP-A base period. Four-year base periods (4YP and 4YP-R) are utilized for smaller programs with 30 or fewer completers in a two-year base period (2YP or 2YP-R). The calculation involves approximating the annual loan payment owed on the median student loan debt for program completers during the base period. The process for determining the median amount of student loan debt for a program involves two major steps. In the first step, ED calculates the debt amount based on various sources, including FFEL and DL program loans, private education loans, and institutional financing plans. Alternatively, institutions can provide the total tuition and fees charged to the student. In determining student loan debt for programs, the highest credentialed program completed at an institution would bear all debt incurred. Debt from programs at another institution would only be attributed if both were under common ownership. The annual loan payment for the median debt amount would be calculated using a 6.8% interest rate and repayment schedules based on program length. The repayment schedule for different degree programs is based on the median amount of student loan debt owed by program completers. The annual loan payment is calculated using a 6.8% interest rate and program length. Earnings data of program completers are obtained from the Social Security Administration. Social security earnings data for program completers includes wages from employment covered by Social Security, cash pay for agricultural and domestic work, cash tips, pay for work not covered by Social Security in the U.S., and net earnings from self-employment. The gainful employment program measures annual earnings and student loan debt to determine if program completers can afford loan payments. Threshold percentages were established for different levels of earnings and debt. The program passes if the annual loan payment is less than or equal to 12% of the mean or median annual earnings of completers. The gainful employment program measures annual earnings and student loan debt to determine affordability. Threshold percentages are set based on earnings and debt levels. If the annual loan payment is 12% or less of mean or median annual earnings, the program passes. The gainful employment program measures annual earnings and student loan debt to determine affordability. The DIR measure sets a threshold of 30% of discretionary income for program completers. If the intersection of mean or median student loan debt falls below the threshold line, the program passes; if it falls above, the program fails. The gainful employment program measures annual earnings and student loan debt to determine affordability. The DIR measure sets a threshold of 30% of discretionary income for program completers. The program would pass if the mean or median student loan debt is below the threshold line. The ER measure provides an alternative path for programs with lower incomes. The ER measure offers an alternative path for programs with lower annual earnings, where completers should not devote more than 12% of their earnings to student loan debt service. This measure is easier to pass for programs with lower earnings compared to the DIR measure. Different loan repayment schedules affect the calculation of annual loan payment amounts for various program types based on median student loan debt amounts. Different programs are designed to accommodate students with varying levels of student loan debt, which is typically repaid over different timeframes. The maximum student loan debt allowed for passing certificate or associate's degree programs is $50,497, for bachelor's or master's degree programs is $65,465, and for doctoral or professional degree programs is $76,129. Institutions have opportunities to review and correct data used in calculating gainful employment measures. Programs failing all three measures face consequences. In cases where a program fails all three measures, institutions could request a recalculation of debt-to-earnings using alternative data. They had 30 days to review and correct student information for calculating earnings. Updated data would be used to calculate mean and median earnings for gainful employment programs. After ED released draft results for the performance measures, institutions would have had 45 days to challenge the accuracy of certain data used in their calculation, including borrower loan data and median loan debt. They could also challenge the accuracy of the list of borrowers included in the base period for the LRR measure. After institutions received draft results for performance measures, they had 45 days to challenge data accuracy, including borrower loan data and median loan debt. They could also dispute the list of borrowers in the base period for the LRR measure by providing evidence for additions, removals, or corrections. If a program failed and some completers were not included in earnings calculations, ED would adjust the median student loan debt by removing debt from a corresponding number of borrowers with the highest amounts. The final regulations allowed institutions to recalculate performance measures by using alternative earnings data from state-sponsored data systems for students who completed the program. The final regulations allowed institutions to recalculate performance measures using alternative earnings data from state-sponsored data systems for students who completed the program. Earnings data could be obtained from institutional surveys or Bureau of Labor Statistics data, with specific requirements for sample size and accuracy in using state-derived mean or median earnings. The final regulations allowed institutions to use alternative earnings data, such as BLS data, to recalculate performance measures for failing programs. BLS earnings data at the 25th percentile could be used as mean or median annual earnings, but only for specific measurement periods. Institutions had to notify ED within 14 days of intent to use alternative earnings data. The final regulations allowed institutions to use alternative earnings data, such as BLS data, to recalculate performance measures for failing programs. Institutions had to notify ED within 14 days of intent to use alternative earnings data, provide supporting documentation, and await approval of recalculated debt-to-earnings ratios. Programs would be designated as passing, failing, or ineligible based on performance measures, with specific criteria and consequences outlined in the final rule. Performance standards for programs to remain eligible for HEA, Title IV federal student aid programs include a Loan Repayment Rate (LRR) of at least 35% and an Earnings Rate (ER) where annual loan payments are less than or equal to 12% of median earnings. Programs failing to meet these standards may use alternative earnings data for recalculations. The Earnings Rate (ER) measure for program eligibility includes criteria such as having less than 31 completers, no provided earnings data, or zero student loan debt. The Discretionary Income Rate (DIR) measure involves the loan payment being less than 30% of discretionary income, with similar criteria for program eligibility. The failing program for a fiscal year would require the institution to provide warnings to students about debt measures and actions to improve performance until meeting minimum standards for at least one measure. If a program fails for two out of three years, the institution must take further action. The institution offering the program must provide debt warnings to students for failing programs, with explanations of risks and resources available. The warnings must be in written form, displayed on the program's website, and in promotional materials. The institution must provide debt warnings to students for failing programs, explaining risks and available resources. The warnings should be clear and conspicuous, with information on repayment difficulties and options available. If the program is to be discontinued, a timeline and alternative options must be provided. Debt warnings must be given to enrolled students within 30 days of program failure notification and to prospective students at the first contact with the institution. The institution must provide debt warnings to students for failing programs, explaining risks and available resources. If a student intended to use federal student aid, the institution would not enroll them until at least three days after receiving the debt warning. Debt warnings must also be provided in alternative languages, if practicable. Programs failing to meet performance measures for three out of four fiscal years would be ineligible for federal student aid. Initially, ineligible programs would have been limited to the lowest performing 5% of programs in each category of institutional control, weighted by the number of students who were program completers in FY2014. An institution would not have been able to reestablish the eligibility of an ineligible program or of a new. An institution would not have been able to reestablish the eligibility of an ineligible program or a new program similar to an ineligible one until the end of the 3rd fiscal year following its ineligibility. For voluntarily discontinued first-year failing programs, eligibility could not be reestablished until the end of the 2nd fiscal year, and for second-year failing programs, until the end of the 3rd fiscal year. Institutions were required to disclose performance results for gainful employment programs, including LRR, ER, and DIR, upon receiving information from ED. The court vacated new final rules for gainful employment programs, including requirements for notifying ED before adding a new program. Performance measures like LRR, ER, and DIR were to be disclosed for each program. If the institution wanted to offer a new program, it needed approval from the ED. Factors considered included financial responsibility, replacing existing programs, consistency with historic offerings, and sufficiency of the decision-making process. The institution needed approval from the ED to offer a new program based on factors like financial responsibility and consistency with historic offerings. ED could deny the application if the program was not likely to lead to gainful employment. Proposed revisions aimed to streamline the process for establishing eligibility of gainful employment programs. IHEs can self-determine a program's eligibility for Title IV in two cases: for degree programs already approved at that level, and for non-degree programs at least 10 weeks long. All programs must have state and accrediting agency approvals. Certified IHEs can add new non-degree programs that are at least 10 weeks long, have a minimum of 8 semester hours, 12 quarter hours, or 600 clock hours, and prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Approval from the Secretary is required for new Title IV programs in certain instances, such as provisional certification, programs not leading to a degree, and short-term programs of at least 10 weeks. The program is a short-term program of at least 10 weeks and between 300-599 clock hours in length, offered by an IHE that must apply for approval. It leads to a higher level, such as a bachelor's degree program, and is a direct assessment program, specifically a comprehensive transition and postsecondary (CTP) program."
