    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Senior Citizens Health Insurance Standards Act of 1993\" and its purpose is to establish standards for health insurance for senior citizens. The Congress acknowledges that health care costs are a significant concern for the elderly, with Medicare covering less than half of these costs. Many elderly individuals are forced to purchase private health insurance due to their needs, but the lack of consumer information in this area makes it difficult for them to make informed choices. Additionally, many supplemental insurance policies offer inadequate coverage and low returns, while instances of abuse and deception in the marketing of health insurance for the elderly have been highlighted in congressional hearings. The Act aims to establish federal minimum standards for the sale of health insurance for the elderly and provide future benefits to those in need. The Act aims to establish federal minimum standards for the sale of health insurance for the elderly. Each State must submit a plan to the Secretary of Health and Human Services within two years of the Act's enactment, outlining minimum standards for health insurance for the elderly. These standards include returning 75% of premiums as benefits, limiting preexisting condition exclusions, and ensuring policies are written in simplified language. The regulations prescribed by the Secretary for health insurance must prohibit duplicative coverage under Medicare, with a written statement required if duplicative coverage is sold. Disclosure provisions must be in place to protect purchasers, including a simplified written statement on the percentage of premiums returned as benefits. The Secretary must issue final regulations for health insurance within 180 days of enactment, including details on premiums, benefits, renewability, coverage, deductibles, and what is not covered under Medicare. Plans must be approved or disapproved by the Secretary. The Secretary must approve or disapprove state plans within 90 days of submission. If a plan is disapproved, the Secretary must provide detailed reasons, and the state can submit a new plan within 30 days for review. Disapproval of a new plan can be reviewed in a US court of appeals. The Secretary conducts oversight activities in each State with an approved plan to ensure compliance. States must submit annual reports detailing plan operations. Changes to a plan require Secretary approval before implementation. If a State fails to implement an approved plan, the Secretary can intervene. If the Secretary finds that a State is not implementing an approved plan, they will notify the State and provide detailed information. The State can correct any issues or provide evidence to refute the findings. After a final determination by the Secretary, if the plan is still not being carried out, certain provisions will apply to the State. Judicial review is available for final determinations. If a State fails to submit a plan or the Secretary does not approve a plan, the Secretary will implement a plan that meets minimum standards for selling health insurance for the elderly. This plan will be in place until the State agrees to carry it out, with the Secretary having the authority to create necessary regulations. Any State failing to submit or have an approved health insurance plan for the elderly will have a plan implemented by the Secretary with minimum standards. State laws preventing the establishment of such a plan are preempted by this Act. Definitions provided in the text include terms such as \"health insurance for the elderly,\" \"Medicare Program,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State.\" The Social Security Act is amended to require a study on regulating private health insurance for the aged and disabled, including minimum loss ratios, pre-existing condition exclusions, coverage differentiation, policy comparison tools, and potential limitations on certain types of policies. The Social Security Act is amended to require a study on regulating private health insurance for the aged and disabled, including policies banning or limiting, limiting agents' commissions, eliminating misconduct, individualized counseling, claims handling requirements, banning overlapping coverage, and policy standardization for competition. The Secretary must transmit a report to Congress within two years with findings, recommendations, and proposed legislation for regulating health insurance. The Secretary is required to conduct a study on the feasibility of additional health insurance coverage under the Social Security Act, including eligibility requirements, cost estimates, and financing options. The Secretary will conduct a study on alternative methods of financing additional health insurance coverage under the Social Security Act and report findings to Congress within two years."
