    "content": "The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two federal entitlement programs for individuals with severe, long-term disabilities: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSDI provides monthly cash benefits to disabled workers and their dependents based on earnings credits, while SSI provides cash payments to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited assets. Both programs use the same disability definition but serve slightly different populations. The report discusses the eligibility rules and processes for SSDI and SSI, benefit computation, non-cash benefits, program financing, and provides an overview of the programs. SSDI and SSI paid $199 billion in benefits to disabled individuals and dependents in 2017. OASDI, also known as Social Security, provides income protection to workers and their families. Social Security provides income protection to workers and their families through retirement, disability, or death benefits. It is financed through payroll and self-employment taxes and covers about 94% of all workers. The SSDI component offers monthly benefits to disabled workers. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), established in 1956, provides monthly benefits to disabled workers and their eligible dependents. In December 2017, SSDI paid benefits to 10.4 million individuals, including 8.7 million disabled workers and 1.7 million dependents. The Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) component also provides benefits to disabled dependents of retired workers and survivors of deceased beneficiaries. In 2018, SSDI paid benefits to 1.2 million OASI disability beneficiaries who must meet specific criteria to qualify for benefits, including having a qualifying impairment and filing an application. Workers become insured for Social Security by earning quarters of coverage (QCs) through paid employment or self-employment covered by Social Security. To qualify for Social Security disability benefits, individuals must earn quarters of coverage (QCs) through paid employment or self-employment. The amount needed for one QC is adjusted annually based on the Average Wage Index (AWI). Having a certain number of QCs ensures individuals contribute to the insurance system. To be insured for disability, workers must be fully insured for Social Security and meet a recency-of-work requirement. Fully insured workers must have at least one QC for each calendar year after turning 21. To be fully insured for Social Security disability benefits, individuals must earn a minimum number of quarters of coverage (QCs) based on their age. Workers aged 62 or older need 40 QCs, while younger workers need at least six QCs. Disabled workers must also meet a recency-of-work requirement by having QCs in the 40-quarter period before the onset of disability. Workers under 31 years old may require fewer QCs based on their age. In 2017, SSDI provided disability insurance coverage to 154 million workers, with the majority aged 21-64. SSDI provides disability insurance coverage to 154 million workers, with about 89% of covered workers aged 21-64 insured for SSDI. Insured workers must be under Social Security's FRA to be entitled to SSDI, which is age 66 for workers born from 1943 through 1954. Upon reaching FRA, disabled workers transition to retired-worker benefits without affecting the amount of benefits paid. Social Security's FRA increases in two-month increments for workers born from 1955 through 1959 until reaching age 67 for those born in 1960 or later. SSDI is not available to workers who have already attained FRA. SSDI provides benefits to family members of the worker, including disabled dependents of retired workers and survivors of deceased insured workers. Validly married spouses of disabled workers can qualify for benefits if they meet certain criteria. Spouses and divorced spouses of disabled workers can qualify for benefits if they meet specific criteria, including a duration-of-marriage requirement. Eligible minor children of disabled workers can also receive benefits if they meet certain conditions. Eligible children of disabled workers can qualify for benefits if they meet certain criteria, including being unmarried, under 18, and having filed an application. The child must be related to the insured worker and meet dependency requirements. Student children of disabled workers may also be eligible for benefits. For more details, refer to SSA's policy manual. Eligible student children of disabled workers can qualify for benefits if they are unmarried, aged 18-19, full-time students at an elementary or secondary school, and have filed an application. Benefits usually continue until graduation or two months after turning 19. Disabled adult children of disabled workers qualify if they are unmarried, aged 18 or older, have a qualifying impairment before age 22, and have filed an application. Disabled adult children (DACs), also known as Childhood Disability Beneficiaries (CDB) by SSA, must meet the same disability standard as disabled workers to qualify for benefits. They are generally required to be unmarried, but can marry other DAC beneficiaries or most other Social Security beneficiaries. However, this exception does not apply if the marriage is to a minor, student Social Security beneficiary, or SSI-only recipient. Additionally, disabled surviving spouses of deceased insured workers can qualify for benefits under certain conditions, including being at least 50 years old but not yet 60, being unmarried unless the remarriage occurred after age 50 and the claimant was disabled at the time, and not entitled to a retired-worker benefit equal to or larger than the divorced spousal benefit. Disabled surviving spouses of deceased insured workers can qualify for benefits under certain conditions, including being at least 50 years old but not yet 60, being unmarried unless the remarriage occurred after age 50 and the claimant was disabled at the time, and not entitled to a retired-worker benefit equal to or larger than the divorced spousal benefit. Additionally, the disabled surviving spouse must have been married to the worker for at least nine months, with exceptions for certain circumstances. Disabled divorced surviving spouses may qualify if they were married to the deceased insured worker for at least 10 years immediately before the date the divorce became final. Disabled adult children (DAC) of retired or deceased insured workers qualify for benefits if they are unmarried, aged 18 or older, have a qualifying impairment before age 22, and have filed an application. There is no maximum age limit for DAC beneficiaries, with some aged 80 or older in December 2016. Disabled workers receive SSDI benefits until they die, reach full retirement age, or no longer meet the disability criteria. In 2016, the SSDI termination rate was 9.3%, with most terminations due to reaching full retirement age. When a disabled worker's benefits are terminated, dependents and survivors also lose their benefits. Initial Social Security benefits are based on the worker's earnings. The Social Security benefit formula is progressive, replacing a greater share of career-average earnings for low-wage or intermittent workers than for high-wage workers. Annual taxable earnings are indexed to reflect changes in national earnings levels. The worker's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) is calculated by summing the highest earnings in a computation period. This is used to compute the primary insurance amount (PIA), the worker's basic benefit before adjustments. In 2018, the worker's PIA is calculated using a formula based on their AIME, with adjustments for inflation through COLAs. Spouses and dependent children of disabled workers can receive up to 50% of the worker's PIA to account for additional expenses. Disabled widow(er)s, disabled adult children of retired workers, and disabled adult children of deceased insured workers receive a percentage of the worker's PIA. Initial benefits for survivors are higher than benefits for dependents due to the complete loss of the worker's earnings. Monthly benefits are subject to family maximum provisions. The family maximum for disabled workers limits the total benefits paid, with reductions for dependents or survivors. In December 2016, 27% of disabled-worker families received maximum benefits. Different formulas apply for OASI disability beneficiaries and those receiving workers' compensation. The Social Security Act may reduce SSDI benefits for disabled workers with combined disability benefits. The SSDI benefits of disabled workers may be reduced if their combined disability benefits exceed 80% of their average earnings before disability onset. This provision aims to discourage individuals from relying solely on SSDI benefits and encourages them to remain in the labor force. The offset no longer applies once the disabled worker reaches full retirement age. In some states, the offset results in a reduction in workers' compensation or PDB payments. In December 2016, 5.2% of disabled workers were eligible for WC or PDB payments, with 1.2% subject to the offset. The average monthly SSDI benefit was $1,197 for disabled workers, totaling over $11 billion in benefits. OASI disability beneficiaries received an average benefit of $800 monthly. Cash benefits for disabled workers start after a five-month waiting period. The five-month waiting period for disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act starts on the first day of the following month if the onset date is established after the first day of the month. Disabled adult children are exempt from this waiting period and can receive benefits the month after their disability onset date. The waiting period for disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act begins the month after the disability onset date. Former disabled workers and disabled widow(er)s may not have to serve a new waiting period if they become disabled again within a certain timeframe. There are no exceptions to the waiting period for claimants with specific medical conditions. SSDI provides retroactive benefits for up to 12 months before the month of application. SSDI provides retroactive benefits for up to 12 months before the month of application, with the earliest effective date being no more than 17 months before filing. Retroactive benefits are separate from past-due benefits, which include retroactive benefits and benefits owed for months meeting entitlement factors. Beneficiaries like disabled workers, widows, and adult children qualify for Medicare, a federal program that covers healthcare services for individuals aged 65 or older, Social Security disability beneficiaries under 65, and certain others with qualifying impairments. Medicare is earned through working and paying taxes, with entitlement usually linked to Social Security benefits. Disabled workers and beneficiaries under 65 qualify for Medicare after a 24-month waiting period. Annual Medicare spending per disabled beneficiary was $12,776 in 2013. Entitlement to Medicare typically occurs 29 months after the disability onset date. The waiting period for cash benefits is from February 2016 to June 2016, with entitlement to cash benefits starting in July 2016. Claimants become entitled to Medicare on July 1, 2018, after the 24-month waiting period. Disabled adult children are exempt from the waiting period and generally qualify for Medicare 24 months after the onset of disability. Only 68% of disabled beneficiaries under 65 reported Medicare entitlement in 2016. Social Security disability beneficiaries can count previous months of entitlement towards the Medicare waiting period if it ended within 60 months for disabled workers or 84 months for disabled individuals. Disabled beneficiaries who meet the criteria and were previously entitled to Medicare do not have to serve a second waiting period for Medicare. They can count months of previous disability benefit entitlement toward the new waiting period if their current impairment is the same or directly related to the impairment that served as the basis for disability during a previous period of entitlement. Disabled beneficiaries who meet the criteria and were previously entitled to Medicare do not have to serve a second waiting period. Social Security disability beneficiaries aged 65 or older are entitled to Medicare based on age and are not subject to the 24-month waiting period. ALS patients are exempt from the waiting period. Most ALS patients become entitled to Medicare five months after the onset of disability. Individuals with ESRD or certain medical conditions have separate Medicare entitlement provisions. Individuals with ESRD or certain medical conditions can enroll in Medicare without needing Social Security benefits. There is no 24-month waiting period, but ESRD patients may have a three-month waiting period if not self-dialyzing regularly. Social Security disability beneficiaries receive Medicare when entitled to cash benefits. Social Security's funds include the DI Trust Fund and OASI Trust Fund. In the federal accounting structure, trust funds like the DI Trust Fund and OASI Trust Fund track and report receipts for specific purposes, such as benefits for disabled and retired workers. Social Security is primarily funded by payroll taxes and self-employment taxes. Administrative costs are covered by the trust funds, which are separate accounts in the U.S. Treasury and cannot borrow from each other under current law. Social Security is financed by payroll and self-employment taxes, with FICA taxes split between employees and employers. The overall payroll tax rate is 12.4%, with 2.37% allocated to the DI trust fund and 10.03% to the OASI trust fund. In 2017, total receipts to the Social Security trust funds were $997 billion, with $171 billion credited to the DI trust. In 2017, the Social Security trust funds had a total balance of $2.9 trillion in U.S. securities. The DI trust fund held $171 billion (17%) of this amount. The trustees project that the trust funds can pay benefits in full until 2034, but the DI trust fund is projected to be depleted in 2028. The OASI trust fund is projected to be depleted in 2035, with continuing revenues to the DI trust fund sufficient to pay about 93% of benefits scheduled under law, declining to 82% by 2091. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects the DI trust fund to be depleted in early FY2025, with continuing revenues sufficient to pay about 88% of benefits. Established in 1972, SSI is a federal assistance program providing cash payments to needy individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly cash payments to needy individuals and couples who are aged, blind, or disabled. It offers a guaranteed minimum income to adults with difficulty covering basic living expenses due to age or disability, and supplements support for needy children with severe disabilities. SSI is considered a program of \"last resort\" as recipients must first apply for other benefits. The federal SSI payment is the same for all recipients and can be supplemented by some states. In December 2017, 8.2 million SSI recipients, including 1.2 million children, received federally administered payments. In December 2017, 8.2 million SSI recipients received payments, including 1.2 million children, 4.8 million adults aged 18-64, and 2.2 million seniors aged 65 or older. Most recipients enter the program through the disability pathway. Blind or disabled SSI recipients who turn 65 are still classified as such. To qualify for SSI, individuals must meet specific criteria and file an application for payments. Under the SSI program, individuals must be aged, blind, or disabled to qualify for payments. Aged refers to those 65 or older, blind refers to those with limited vision, and disabled individuals must meet SSI's age-specific definition of disability. Additionally, recipients must have limited income and financial resources to be eligible for payments. Income and resources for SSI eligibility must fall within program limits, with certain exclusions. Ineligible family members' income/resources may be considered. Countable income is gross income minus exclusions, equal to the federal benefit rate (FBR). The federal benefit rate (FBR) is the maximum monthly SSI payment available to qualified individuals and couples with no other income. In 2018, the FBR is $750 per month for an individual and $1,125 per month for a couple. Countable income is subtracted from the FBR to determine SSI eligibility. In states with a supplementation program, eligibility is based on countable income being less than the FBR plus the state supplement. Under the SSI program, eligibility is determined by countable income being less than the Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) plus any applicable state supplementary payment. All income is considered unless excluded by federal law or agency regulations. Income is classified as earned or unearned, with examples including wages, self-employment earnings, and certain benefits like Social Security and VA benefits. The SSI program considers various sources of income, such as workers' compensation, pensions, and in-kind support, when determining eligibility. Certain income is disregarded, like the first $20 per month of any income and food assistance from programs like SNAP. The SSI program excludes various types of income, including food assistance from SNAP and WIC, energy assistance from LIHEAP, housing assistance, federal tax refunds, compensation for clinical trials, work expenses for disabled and blind recipients, and income used for self-support. The SSI program excludes various types of income, including food assistance, energy assistance, housing assistance, federal tax refunds, and compensation for clinical trials. Unearned income exclusions include the $20 per month general income exclusion and the $65 per month earned income exclusion, which have remained unchanged since 1972. In-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is defined as food or shelter received from someone else and is treated as unearned income subject to special rules based on living arrangements. If a person receives both food and shelter from others in a household, the FBR is reduced by one third, known as the value of the one-third reduction (VTR), which is $250 in 2018. In 2018, the VTR for ISM is $250 per month for an individual and $375 per month for a couple. The $20 general income exclusion does not apply to ISM reduced under the VTR. If a person receives ISM but not both food and shelter from their household, the FBR is reduced by the presumed maximum value (PMV) rule. The PMV is a regulatory cap on ISM, equal to one-third of the FBR plus $20. Unlike the VTR, the PMV is rebuttable. If the SSI recipient can show that the value of food or shelter received is less than the PMV reduction, then SSA reduces the FBR by the actual value of food or shelter received. Some ISM is disregarded, such as federal housing assistance. The limit for countable resources is $2,000 for an individual and $3,000 for a couple. Individuals and couples are eligible for SSI if their countable resources are less than or equal to the applicable statutory limit at any given time. Claimants and recipients who transfer resources at less than fair market value may become ineligible for SSI for up to 36 months. The countable resource limits have remained unchanged since 1989. Countable resources under the SSI program include cash, bank accounts, stocks, bonds, property, IRAs, 401(k) plans, HSAs, and certain trusts established after January 1, 2000. These resources must be liquidatable to be considered. The resource limits have not been adjusted for inflation since 1989. Certain resources are excluded in determining SSI eligibility, such as primary residence, household goods, one automobile for transportation, PESS, FSAs, PASS resources, federal tax refunds, life insurance policies up to $1,500, burial funds up to $1,500, SNTs or PTs meeting Medicaid requirements, and the first $100,000 in an ABLE account. For a detailed list, refer to \"SI 01130.050 Guide to Resources Exclusions\" in POMS. SSI is a program of last resort. \"SSI is a program of last resort, where close family members are expected to provide support to low-income individuals. Deeming is used to include the income and resources of certain ineligible family members in determining SSI eligibility and assistance amount. Deeming applies to spouse-to-spouse and parent-to-child relationships.\" Deeming is used to include the income and resources of certain ineligible family members in determining SSI eligibility and assistance amount. This applies to spouse-to-spouse, parent-to-child, and sponsor-to-alien relationships. The agency deducts living expenses for ineligible family members and children under 18 (or under 22 if a student) from the income of the deemor. Deeming includes income and resources of certain ineligible family members in determining SSI eligibility and assistance amount. The agency deducts living expenses for ineligible family members and children under 18 (or under 22 if a student) from the income of the deemor. Allocation amounts vary based on the number of ineligible family members. Different income allocation rules apply to sponsors of aliens. Countable resource limits also vary depending on the eligible individual's situation. To qualify for SSI, individuals or couples must reside in the United States, which includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, or other territories are considered ineligible for SSI unless they move to one of the eligible locations and meet the physical presence requirement. To qualify for SSI, individuals or couples must reside in the United States, including the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The physical presence requirement states that individuals must be physically present in the United States to be eligible for SSI. This requirement does not apply to certain groups such as blind or disabled children of military personnel stationed abroad or certain students temporarily studying abroad. Additionally, individuals must be citizens, nationals, or eligible noncitizens to qualify for SSI. Eligible noncitizens are aliens with qualifying legal status granted by the federal government and who meet specific requirements. Noncitizens eligible for SSI must be qualified aliens under federal law, including lawful permanent residents with significant work history, \"grandfathered aliens,\" exempted aliens, refugees, and asylees. Illegal aliens and certain other legal statuses are not eligible for SSI. Eligible noncitizens for SSI include LPRs who have met a waiting period and have qualifying quarters of coverage, qualified aliens in the military or dependents, and those lawfully residing in the US receiving SSI before August 22, 1996. Eligible noncitizens for SSI include LPRs who have met a waiting period and have qualifying quarters of coverage, qualified aliens in the military or dependents, and those lawfully residing in the US receiving SSI before August 22, 1996. Other eligible noncitizens subject to a seven-year limit from the date their status was acquired include refugees, asylees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, Amerasian immigrants, Iraqi or Afghan nationals under special immigrant visa programs, and victims of severe forms of human trafficking. Noncitizen SSI recipients, including victims of human trafficking, made up 6.1% of total recipients in December 2016. About 11% received time-limited payments, with an average payment of $510. 71% were aged 65 or older, and 58% had been in the US for at least 10 years before applying. The number and share of noncitizen recipients have decreased since PRWORA. Residents of public institutions are ineligible for SSI. Noncitizen SSI recipients, including victims of human trafficking, made up 6.1% of total recipients in December 2016. About 11% received time-limited payments, with an average payment of $510. 71% were aged 65 or older, and 58% had been in the US for at least 10 years before applying. The number and share of noncitizen recipients have decreased since PRWORA. Residents of public institutions are ineligible for SSI. To be eligible for SSI, a person must file for all other applicable benefits, not be fleeing to avoid prosecution or custody, and allow SSA to contact financial institutions for eligibility purposes. SSI payments are suspended if eligibility requirements are not met. In 2016, SSI termination rates were 7.7% for children and 10.0% for working-age adults. Most terminations were due to excess income or no longer meeting the disability definition. The federal benefit rate in 2018 is $750 per month for individuals and $1,125 per month for couples. The Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) in 2018 is $9,000 for an individual and $13,500 for a couple. SSI payments are adjusted annually for inflation by the same COLA applied to Social Security benefits. The COLA effective for SSI payments at the start of 2018 was 2.0%, raising the FBR for an individual to $750 per month and for a couple to $1,125 per month. Some states provide state supplementary payments (SSPs) to complement federal SSI payments. States may provide state supplementary payments (SSPs) to certain SSI recipients, with 43 states and the District of Columbia offering optional supplementation programs. Some states self-administer SSPs, while others contract with SSA for distribution. North Dakota, the Northern Mariana Islands, and West Virginia do not have supplementation programs. Since FY1994, SSA has charged participating states a user fee for administering their supplementation programs, based on a fee schedule prescribed in federal law. Optional SSPs are administered by SSA for SSI recipients in California, New Jersey, Nevada, and Vermont, as well as for a small number of recipients in special living arrangements in Delaware and the District of Columbia. In December 2017, almost 1.5 million individuals received federally administered SSP from SSA, with 84% in California. Other SSI recipients live in states that self-administer SSPs or do not provide them. Data on SSI recipients receiving state-administered SSPs stopped in 2011. Only 22 out of 44 areas with optional supplementation programs provided SSPs to SSI recipients living in their own household. Certain income is disregarded in determining SSI eligibility and assistance amount. The SSI program excludes a portion of income and applies different offsets for earned and unearned income. An example calculation is provided for an individual with SSDI benefits and earnings. The SSI program applies exclusions and offsets to income, with a calculation example for an individual with SSDI benefits and earnings. Countable income is determined by applying various exclusions and offsets, resulting in a monthly SSI payment of $297. Ineligibility for SSI occurs when countable income reduces the Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) to $0. The income breakeven point varies based on the type of income received, with different thresholds for earned and unearned income. The SSI program applies exclusions and offsets to income, with a calculation example for an individual with SSDI benefits and earnings. Countable income is determined by applying various exclusions and offsets, resulting in a monthly SSI payment of $297. Ineligibility for SSI occurs when countable income reduces the Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) to $0. The income breakeven point varies based on the type of income received, with different thresholds for earned and unearned income. For individuals with earned income, the breakeven point is $1,585 per month, while for couples it is $2,335. Residents of public institutions are generally ineligible for SSI payments due to their basic needs being provided for by the institution. The reduced SSI payment for individuals receiving institutional care is no more than $30 per month ($60 for couples in certain situations) and is used for personal needs. Countable income affects the payment amount, but eligibility is based on the full Federal Benefit Rate of $750 per month. The payment has not increased since July 1988, with 1.5% of SSI recipients in approved medical facilities in December 2016. The average SSI payment in December 2017 was $542, totaling $6,504 annually, with $4.7 billion in payments made by the SSA that month. The average SSI payment in December 2017 was $542, totaling $6,504 annually. SSI payments are generally lower for seniors due to Social Security income being counted against the Federal Benefit Rate. Payments for children are typically higher as they often have no income. Unlike SSDI benefits, SSI payments do not have a waiting period requirement and begin the month after application or eligibility. Retroactive payments are not available for SSI recipients. Retroactive benefits are only available under the Social Security program for SSI recipients. Claimants may receive past-due payments for eligible months after filing an application. Most SSI recipients qualify for Medicaid, which provides health coverage, including long-term services and supports for those in need. Medicaid helps SSI recipients who cannot work enough to obtain health insurance through an employer or on their own. Medicaid is crucial for SSI recipients, providing health coverage and LTSS not covered by private insurance or Medicare. In FY2015, spending per disabled Medicaid enrollee under 65 was $19,500. Around 94% of SSI recipients aged 18-64 had Medicaid in 2016. SSI is a mandatory Medicaid eligibility pathway, ensuring coverage for recipients. States have flexibility in Medicaid eligibility for SSI recipients, with coverage typically ending when cash payments stop. States have different Medicaid eligibility criteria for SSI recipients, categorized into three groups: \"1634 states\" automatically grant Medicaid, \"SSI criteria states\" use SSI's criteria but require a separate application, and \"209[b] states\" have more restrictive criteria and require a separate application. Section 1634 of the Social Security Act allows states to contract with SSA for Medicaid eligibility determinations. In December 2017, 85.8% of all SSI recipients resided in 1634 states where Medicaid eligibility determinations are performed as part of the SSI application process. Eight states and the Northern Mariana Islands use the same criteria as SSI but require a separate Medicaid application. These states are known as SSI criteria states, with 4.8% of all SSI recipients residing in them. In December 2017, 9.4% of all SSI recipients resided in eight 209(b) states with more restrictive Medicaid eligibility criteria than SSI's. These states may use stricter definitions of blindness or disability, lower income or resource standards, and less generous methodologies. New Hampshire and Virginia have more restrictive Medicaid eligibility criteria than SSI, such as longer impairment requirements and property ownership limits. States with 209(b) status must deduct medical expenses from SSI income for Medicaid eligibility. Three states have dropped 209(b) status post-ACA for Medicaid reform efforts. Oklahoma, Indiana, and Ohio have dropped their 209(b) status as part of Medicaid reform efforts. Oklahoma became a SSI criteria state in 2015, while Indiana and Ohio became 1634 states in 2014 and 2016, respectively. SSI recipients are automatically eligible for SNAP benefits, which are provided on an EBT card for food purchases at authorized retailers. Individuals in pure SSI households are categorically eligible for SNAP, while those in mixed households may also qualify. In 2016, 52% of SSI recipients aged 18-64 lived in households receiving SNAP benefits. Federal SSI payments are funded by the U.S. Treasury, while SSPs are funded by states. Total federal SSI outlays in FY2017 were $58.7 billion, with $54.6 billion for benefits and $4.1 billion for administrative costs. Spending on federally administered SSPs in FY2017 was $2.6 billion, with 93% of it attributed to SSI recipients in California. In December 2016, approximately 12.8 million adults aged 18-64 received SSDI benefits. SSA's actuaries project federal SSI payments to increase from $54.6 billion in 2017 to $61.5 billion in 2041, while CBO projects an increase to $80.8 billion in FY2028. In December 2016, around 12.8 million adults aged 18-64 received SSDI or SSI benefits due to a qualifying impairment. More than 1.3 million received both types of disability benefits, with some beneficiaries receiving both SSDI and SSI concurrently. These individuals, known as concurrent disability beneficiaries, receive health coverage under Medicare and Medicaid. The average combined benefit for concurrent disability beneficiaries in December 2016 was $783, with $538 from SSDI and $245 from SSI. The average benefit amount for concurrent disability beneficiaries in December 2016 was $783, with $538 from SSDI and $245 from SSI. Combined benefit levels for each type of concurrent SSDI beneficiary were about the same, resulting in roughly the same combined disability benefit amount across all three beneficiary types. The purpose of SSI for adults is generally twofold: to provide cash assistance to aged, blind, or disabled individuals who have no income. The purpose of SSI is twofold: to provide cash assistance to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with no income and to supplement the incomes of those with low Social Security benefits. SSI increases the overall monthly disability benefit for SSDI beneficiaries with minimal benefits and other income. Adults qualify as disabled for SSDI and SSI if their impairments significantly interfere with their ability to earn a living. The SSI program defines disability as the inability to perform substantial work due to impairments, considering age, education, and work experience. Children must have severe impairments that limit their ability to engage in age-appropriate activities to qualify for benefits. Children must have severe impairments that limit their ability to engage in age-appropriate activities to qualify for benefits. The SSA uses a monetary threshold to determine if work activity constitutes substantial gainful activity (SGA) for SSDI and SSI programs. In 2018, the SGA earnings threshold for SSDI is $1,180 per month for most individuals and $1,970 per month for statutorily blind individuals. The SGA rules do not apply to statutorily blind individuals under the SSI program. The SGA threshold for blind individuals under the SSDI program is specified in statute and adjusted annually for earnings growth. In contrast, the SGA threshold for non-blind individuals is specified in regulations and adjusted annually regardless of COLA. The SGA threshold for blind individuals under the SSDI program remains the same as the previous year, while the threshold for non-blind individuals is adjusted annually. The Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 amended the Social Security Act to exclude individuals disabled due to drug addiction or alcoholism. SSA's policy on this is detailed in Social Security Ruling 13-2p, defining DAA as a substance use disorder documented by medical evidence. The Social Security Act excludes individuals disabled due to drug addiction or alcoholism, defined as substance use disorder documented by medical evidence. DAA is considered material to disability determination if it affects the ability to work. Approximately 7.0% of working-age SSDI beneficiaries and SSI recipients reported drug or alcohol abuse in the past year. Individuals must follow prescribed treatment to restore their ability to work. The Social Security Act excludes individuals disabled due to drug addiction or alcoholism, defined as substance use disorder documented by medical evidence. DAA is considered material to disability determination if it affects the ability to work. Approximately 7.0% of working-age SSDI beneficiaries and SSI recipients reported drug or alcohol abuse in the past year. Individuals must follow prescribed treatment to restore their ability to work. If an individual fails to follow prescribed treatment without good reason, SSA will not consider them disabled for SSDI or SSI purposes. In some cases, DAA may interfere with treatment adherence, as seen in a 2015 report where an individual's drug use impacted their medication management. The Social Security Act's definitions of disability are total and long-term, denying benefits to those with partial or short-term impairments. This differs from other disability standards like the VA's scale of 0% to 100% disability benefits for veterans. State workers' compensation also provides benefits for total or partial permanent or temporary occupational-related injuries. SSA emphasizes specific eligibility requirements for disability and blindness, distinct from other programs. The process of applying for SSDI or SSI involves filing an initial application through various methods, such as in person, over the phone, by mail, or electronically. Claimants must provide all evidence related to their impairment, and claims representatives screen them to ensure they meet the non-medical requirements. SSA's field offices screen claimants to ensure they meet non-medical entitlement factors for SSDI and SSI. Factors include disability-insured status, work activity test, family relationship, income, resources, living arrangements, citizenship, residency, and other benefit requirements. Claimants not meeting these factors are deemed ineligible and do not receive a disability determination. Approved applications are sent to the DDS office for disability determination. The Disability Determination Services (DDS) are state agencies funded by the federal government that review medical and vocational evidence to issue disability determinations for the Social Security Administration (SSA). DDS workers, although state employees, make determinations based on federal law and regulations. DDS offices are located in various states and territories and employ around 15,000 state workers who evaluate evidence in individual case records with the help of medical consultants. The Disability Determination Services (DDS) review medical evidence to evaluate claimant's impairments. If medical evidence is insufficient, a consultative examination can be scheduled. The DDS issues a disability determination based on all evidence. Approved claims receive an initial award notice, while denied claims receive a personalized explanation. The Social Security Act authorizes the Commissioner of Social Security to establish regulations for disability determinations. SSA uses a five-step evaluation process to assess claimants' medical conditions for disability benefits. If a claimant is found disabled or not disabled at any step, a decision is made. If not determined, the process moves to the next step. The SSA field office evaluates if a claimant's work activity is substantial gainful activity (SGA). In 2018, most claimants are deemed capable of SGA. In 2018, claimants are considered able to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) if their countable earnings exceed $1,180 per month. Blind SSDI claimants have a higher threshold of $1,970 per month. Special conditions of work, such as sheltered employment or government programs, may affect the calculation of countable earnings. Impairment-related work expenses (IRWE) can also be deducted from gross earnings. Impairment-related work expenses (IRWE) like attendant care services or medical equipment can be deducted from earnings. The Social Security Administration (SSA) calculates countable earnings and divides them over the months in the review period to determine monthly average. Claimants with earnings below the SGA limit proceed in the disability determination process, while those above the limit are denied. The Disability Determination Services (DDS) agency assesses medical evidence to determine if the claimant's impairment prevents substantial gainful activity (SGA) for at least 12 months. The DDS agency verifies medically determinable impairments using objective medical evidence from acceptable sources. Once an impairment is established, the severity is evaluated using all available evidence, including symptoms reported by the claimant. Symptoms are considered if they could reasonably be expected based on the medical evidence. The intensity and persistence of symptoms are then assessed to determine their impact on the claimant's ability to work. The DDS agency evaluates the severity of a claimant's impairments by considering the impact on their ability to work, including basic work activities like walking, standing, and understanding instructions. Impairments are considered severe if they significantly limit the ability to work, while they are not severe if they have only a minimal effect on work activities. The DDS agency evaluates the severity of a claimant's impairments by considering their combined effect, regardless of individual severity. Impairments must be expected to last at least 12 months or result in death. Claimants meeting severity and duration requirements proceed to the next step, while those who do not are denied. At Step 3, the DDS agency determines if the impairments meet the medical criteria in the SSA's Listing of Impairments. The SSA's Listing of Impairments, also known as the Blue Book, outlines severe impairments for each body system that can prevent gainful activity. Most listed impairments are permanent or fatal, while others must last at least 12 months. The listings categorize impairments by body system, provide criteria for evaluation, required documentation, and rules for assessing specific impairments. The SSA's Listing of Impairments, known as the Blue Book, outlines severe impairments for each body system that can prevent gainful activity. The listings categorize impairments by body system, provide criteria for evaluation, required documentation, and rules for assessing specific impairment, including symptoms, effects of treatment, and loss of function. Claimants qualify at Step 3 by meeting or equaling the criteria of a specific listing, with a diagnosis alone being insufficient. Claimants can qualify for disability benefits by meeting the criteria of a specific listing in the SSA's Blue Book. If they do not meet a listing, they may still qualify by equaling a listing if their impairment is of equal severity and duration. The DDS will consider impairments that are not listed but closely analogous as medically equivalent. The DDS will find claimants' impairments medically equivalent to a listing if they are of equal significance. Those who meet or equal a listing are awarded benefits, while others proceed to an individual assessment of their ability to work. This assessment includes a residual functional capacity (RFC) evaluation to determine their maximum ability to work despite limitations. The RFC assessment evaluates a claimant's ability to work based on medical evidence, daily activities, and statements. It considers the impact of pain, symptoms, and non-severe impairments on work function. The DDS compares the RFC with past relevant work to determine eligibility for benefits. The Disability Determination Services (DDS) agency evaluates a claimant's ability to work based on medical evidence, daily activities, and statements. If the claimant can perform past relevant work, they are found not disabled. If not, DDS considers if the claimant can adjust to other work based on age, education, and work experience. The claimant must be unable to engage in substantial gainful work that exists in the national economy. The DDS agency uses medical-vocational rules to assess a claimant's ability to work based on age, education, and work experience. They refer to the Department of Labor's Dictionary of Occupational Titles to determine limitations imposed by impairments. Claimants with impairments are assessed based on their ability to adjust to jobs in the national economy. Older individuals with limited education and work experience are more likely to be awarded benefits. The SSI program has a special definition of disability for minors. The SSI program has a special definition of disability for minors under the age of 18, requiring a medically determinable impairment resulting in severe limitations lasting at least 12 months. The disability determination process for child SSI claimants is similar to that for adult claimants, involving assessments of earnings and medical evidence. The DDS agency evaluates the severity of a child's impairment by comparing their functioning to that of peers without impairments. If the impairment is not severe or does not meet specific criteria, it may not qualify as a disability under the SSI program for minors. The DDS agency evaluates a child's impairment by comparing their functioning to peers without impairments. If the impairment is severe but does not meet specific criteria, the case proceeds to Step 3b where limitations are assessed across six domains to determine functional equivalence with listings. The DDS agency evaluates a child's impairment based on functional limitations rather than specific listing criteria. If the impairment results in marked limitations in two domains or extreme limitation in one domain, it is considered to functionally equal the listings. Children may be awarded benefits if their impairment meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the listings. Dissatisfied individuals can appeal SSA's initial determination. The appeals process allows claimants to request further review under the Social Security Act's administrative and judicial review provisions. Claimants can present additional evidence, appoint a representative, and file a request for review within 60 days of receiving notice of the prior determination. Appeals can be filed using SSA forms or online via the iAppeals system. The Social Security Administration's appeals process consists of three levels: reconsideration, a hearing before an administrative law judge, and a request for review by the Appeals Council. Claimants can continue to receive benefit payments during this process under certain conditions. Decision-makers base their decisions on provisions in the Social Security Act and SSA's regulations. After exhausting the administrative appeals process, claimants can file a complaint against the agency in federal court. Reconsideration is the first step in the administrative appeals process for appealing an initial determination by the SSA. It involves a thorough review of all evidence from the initial determination, conducted by a different official. For medical cases, a new adjudicative team reexamines the evidence and may request additional evidence or examinations. The reconsideration level in the administrative appeals process involves a review of the initial determination without a face-to-face meeting. If benefit payments are involved and there is a dispute over medical factors, a disability hearing may be requested for a face-to-face reconsideration. The adjudicator makes a decision based on the evidence in the case record, and the claimant is notified in writing. In 1999, the reconsideration level was eliminated in certain states as part of the Disability Redesign Prototype Model. The Trump Administration proposes to reinstate the reconsideration level in 10 prototype states as part of the FY2019 budget request to Congress. SSA plans to gradually reintroduce the reconsideration step over the next few years. The second mandatory step in the appeals process is to request a hearing before an administrative law judge. During a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) investigates the merits of an appeal by questioning the claimant and any scheduled witnesses. The claimant or representative can present evidence, examine evidence used in the determination, introduce witnesses, question witnesses, and present arguments. All evidence must be submitted to SSA at least five days before the hearing. The proceeding is non-adversarial, and the ALJ issues a decision based on the information presented. The third step in the administrative appeals process involves requesting a review before the Appeals Council (AC), which consists of administrative appeals judges (AAJs) and appeals officers (AO). The AC reviews ALJ decisions and may dismiss, deny, grant, or remand cases for further proceedings. The AC can also review decisions on its own within 60 days. The Appeals Council (AC) can review an ALJ decision on its own motion within 60 days. They may affirm, reverse, modify, or remand the decision. The claimant is notified in writing of the AC's decision. After exhausting the administrative appeals process, a claimant can request judicial review in a federal court. The court may issue a decision or remand the case back to the SSA for further action. After exhausting administrative appeals, a claimant can seek judicial review in federal court. The court may issue a decision or remand the case for further action. Disability cases can be appealed to the U.S. court of appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. The SSA conducts continuing disability reviews to assess ongoing eligibility for disability payments based on medical conditions. The frequency of reviews depends on the likelihood of medical improvement. The SSA conducts continuing disability reviews to assess ongoing eligibility for disability payments based on medical conditions. Reviews are scheduled based on the likelihood of medical improvement, with categories including Medical Improvement Possible (MIP) and Medical Improvement Not Expected (MINE) based on the severity of the individual's condition. Examples of impairments in these categories include traumatic injuries, heart failure, intellectual disabilities, ALS, and Parkinson's disease. The SSA conducts medical reviews for individuals with severe conditions like Parkinson's disease, categorizing them as permanently disabled. Few beneficiaries receive a MIE diary, with two types of medical CDRs conducted when diaries mature: full medical CDRs and mailers. A full medical CDR involves a state DDS agency review, while a mailer gathers additional information. SSA must find substantial evidence of medical improvement during a CDR to determine continued eligibility for SSDI or SSI benefits. The SSA conducts medical reviews for individuals with severe conditions like Parkinson's disease to determine disability status. The agency uses the medical improvement review standard (MIRS) to assess if SSDI or SSI beneficiaries still qualify for benefits based on substantial medical improvement since the last favorable decision. For adults, this includes the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA), while for children, it involves no longer meeting the severity in the listings. When a SSDI beneficiary or SSI disability recipient is found no longer disabled, they may appeal the decision. SSA reevaluates child SSI recipients at age 18 under adult standards. Work CDRs are performed under the SSDI program to assess work activity and SGA. If SGA is detected without approved work incentives, disability benefits may cease. Under the SSI program, SSA conducts reviews as well. The SSA conducts periodic redeterminations of a recipient's non-medical eligibility factors under the SSI program to verify continued eligibility and correct payment amounts. Redeterminations can be scheduled or unscheduled based on changes in circumstances. Scheduled redeterminations occur annually or once every six years, depending on the likelihood of payment error. SSDI beneficiaries and SSI disability recipients may qualify for federal benefits such as Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Accounts, which allow for tax-advantaged savings plans to cover qualified disability expenses. ABLE accounts offer tax-advantaged savings plans for qualified disability expenses, including financial management, legal fees, oversight expenses, funeral costs, and more. To qualify, individuals must meet specific disability criteria before age 26. The benefits of ABLE accounts include tax-free earnings growth, tax-free withdrawals for qualified expenses, and flexibility in asset management. ABLE accounts allow for tax-advantaged savings for qualified disability expenses. Assets and distributions from an ABLE account are not considered for most federal assistance programs, except for SSI where only the first $100,000 is excluded. If excess funds in an ABLE account make a beneficiary ineligible for SSI, cash payments are suspended until the balance falls below $100,000. This suspension does not affect Medicaid eligibility. Distributions for housing-related expenses from an ABLE account are counted against the resource limit unless spent in the same month. ABLE accounts allow SSI disability recipients to save for disability-related expenses without jeopardizing their SSI and Medicaid eligibility. They may also help beneficiaries maintain eligibility for other federal programs like Medicaid or SNAP. Guidance has been issued by SSA, CMS, and FNS on the treatment of ABLE accounts. Additionally, SSDI beneficiaries and SSI disability recipients may have their federal student loans discharged under certain conditions. Student loans can be discharged if borrowers meet the requirements of the Department of Education's Total and Permanent Disability discharge program. This applies to federal student loan programs like Direct Loan, FFEL, Perkins Loan, and TEACH Grant. Borrowers qualify for discharge if they are determined to be totally and permanently disabled under the VA Method. The borrower may qualify for a discharge of student loans if they are unable to work due to a disability, as determined by the VA Method or a physician's certification. This includes individuals receiving SSDI or SSI with a MINE CDR diary. SSDI beneficiaries and SSI disability recipients with a MINE CDR diary may request a Benefits Planning Query (BPQY) statement from SSA to demonstrate to ED that their medical review is scheduled once every five to seven years. About 40% of all SSDI beneficiaries and SSI disability recipients had a MINE CDR diary in July 2017. Borrowers awarded a TPD discharge based on a determination of totally and permanently disabled under the SSA method or the physician's certification method are subject to a three-year monitoring period. During the post-discharge monitoring period, borrowers must have annual earnings at or below the HHS poverty guideline for a family of two. Failure to meet requirements will result in loan reinstatement. The monitoring period does not apply to those granted a TPD discharge under the VA method.

President Barack Obama issued a memorandum in March 2015 to streamline the Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge process for student loan borrowers receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). The plan aimed to proactively identify eligible borrowers and automatically notify them of their potential eligibility for discharge. In April 2016, the Department of Education (ED) conducted a data match with the Social Security Administration (SSA) to identify qualifying borrowers. In April 2016, ED conducted a data match with SSA to identify borrowers eligible for TPD discharge. 387,000 SSDI beneficiaries and SSI disability recipients with a loan balance of $7.7 billion were identified. Customized letters were sent to positively identified borrowers explaining their eligibility and how to apply. About 234,000 borrowers received TPD discharge applications, with over 19,000 applications approved by July 31, 2016. In April 2018, ED announced a data match with the VA to identify borrowers eligible for TPD discharge. Changes to federal income tax treatment of discharged loans were made to prevent high taxable income for borrowers. Section 11031 of P.L. 115-97 excludes discharged student loan indebtedness under the TPD discharge from gross income for federal tax purposes from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2025. State income tax may still consider it as income."
