    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Business Regulatory Improvement Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of small businesses as sources of innovation and job creation. They recognize that current regulations disproportionately burden small entities and call for alternative regulatory approaches. Federal agencies need to consider alternative regulatory approaches to minimize the economic impact on small businesses and other entities. Despite the Regulatory Flexibility Act's requirement to analyze cost-effective options, agencies continue to avoid this responsibility. Significant changes are necessary in how regulations are developed and analyzed by Federal agencies to ensure input is received effectively. Federal agencies must consider all impacts of proposed and final rules, including indirect effects, to minimize economic consequences or enhance benefits. They should assess a full range of alternatives without delaying the regulatory process or impinging on their statutory mandates. SEC. 3 amends Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, to define 'economic impact' in relation to proposed or final rules. SEC. 4 introduces requirements for more detailed analyses. The initial regulatory flexibility analysis required under section 603 of title 5, United States Code, must include reasons for agency action, objectives and legal basis for the proposed rule, types of small entities affected, estimated number of small entities impacted, and projected compliance requirements and costs. The final regulatory flexibility analysis under title 5, United States Code, must include a detailed explanation of the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements of the rule for small entities, including estimated costs and necessary professional skills. The final regulatory flexibility analysis must include a detailed explanation of the projected requirements, costs, and professional skills needed to comply with the rule. Subsection (b) of section 605 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to insert \"detailed\" before \"statement\". SEC. 5. PERIODIC REVIEW OF RULES. Section 610 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to require agencies to publish a plan for the periodic review of rules with significant economic impact on small entities. The purpose is to determine if rules should be continued, amended, or rescinded to minimize economic impacts on small entities. The agency can amend the plan at any time by publishing revisions in the Federal Register and on its website. The plan must include a review of all agency rules within 10 years of the Small Business Regulatory Improvement Act's enactment, with possible extensions of up to 2 years if necessary. Each agency must annually report the results of its rule review to Congress and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Factors considered during the review include the continued need for the rule and nature of complaints received by the agency. The agency must annually report the results of its rule review to Congress and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Factors considered during the review include complaints from small entities, comments from the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and Chief Counsel for Advocacy, rule complexity, overlap with other rules, and changes in technology or economic conditions. The agency must publish a list of rules to be reviewed, including a brief description and reason for significant economic impact. The agency is seeking comments on rules with significant economic impact on small entities, regardless of whether a final regulatory flexibility analysis was prepared. SEC. 6. Changes to the Regulatory Flexibility Act to align with Executive Order 13272. Changes to the Regulatory Flexibility Act to align with Executive Order 13272 include notifying the Small Business Administration of draft rules with significant economic impact on small entities and including responses to comments on certification of proposed rules. The proposed rule seeks to amend section 604(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code, to include certification of the proposed rule under section 605(b). It also requires agencies to respond to comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and provide a detailed statement of any changes made to the proposed rule in the final rule as a result of such comments."
