    "content": "The \"Environmental Justice Act of 1999\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The purposes of the Environmental Justice Act of 1999 include identifying areas with high levels of toxic chemicals, collecting data on health effects, assessing impacts on communities, involving residents in finding solutions, promoting pollution-reducing technologies, and creating green spaces in polluted areas. The Environmental Justice Act of 1999 defines key terms such as Administrator, Environmental High Impact Area (EHIA), Secretary, and toxic chemicals. The Environmental Justice Act of 1999 defines key terms and identifies various pollutants and substances regulated under different environmental laws. The Environmental Justice Act of 1999 defines toxic chemical facilities as those subject to various environmental laws for permits, inspections, or reporting requirements. The Administrator can assess toxic chemical releases from facilities not currently under federal oversight. The Environmental Justice Act of 1999 allows the Administrator to review facilities with high environmental pollution levels if petitioned by individuals or groups within the affected area. The Environmental Justice Act of 1999 allows the Administrator to identify environmental high impact areas for review. Within 12 months of enactment, the Administrator will publish the method for selecting Environmental High Impact Areas (EHIA). Within 18 months, a list of 20 EHIA counties or geographic units with high chemical levels and population exposure will be published, considering suggestions from various federal and state health authorities. The list will be revised and republished periodically. The Administrator will republish a list of Environmental High Impact Areas (EHIA) every 5 years, using updated data and considering factors like toxicity, exposure, and regulatory data. Toxic chemicals will be distinguished based on their presence and impact in each area. The Administrator will republish a list of Environmental High Impact Areas (EHIA) every 5 years, considering factors like toxicity, exposure, and regulatory data. Toxic chemicals will be distinguished based on their presence and impact in different environments. TITLE II--ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES\n\nSEC. 201. MANDATORY INSPECTION.\n\nFacilities with high potential for toxic chemical release must undergo compliance inspections within 1 year of EHIA list publication.\n\nTITLE III--COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION\n\nSEC. 301. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS. TITLE III--COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Administrator will provide technical assistance grants to individuals or groups in an EHIA to consult independent experts on environmental and health concerns. Grants can be renewed for public participation. Within 2 years of publishing EHIAs, the Secretary must release a report for public comment on the health impacts of EHIAs compared to non-EHIAs, including cancer, birth defects, infant mortality, and respiratory diseases. The report will be coordinated by the ATSDR and involve the community being assessed, working with other federal agencies and health experts. The health assessment conducted by scientists aims to isolate the impacts of environmental pollution, evaluate levels of toxic chemicals that must be reduced to avoid adverse health effects, and determine the impacts of uncontrolled releases. Factors such as differential sensitivities, cumulative effects of toxins, and methodological issues are considered during the assessments. The Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry conducts health assessments to identify environmental pollution impacts, toxic chemical levels, and adverse health effects. They provide relevant demographic information to address environmental justice concerns and share information with affected communities in Environmental High Impact Areas. SEC. 402. MORATORIUM. If the report under section 401 identifies significant adverse impacts of environmental pollution on human health in EHIA, there will be a moratorium on new toxic chemical facilities in that area unless certain conditions are met. The moratorium will continue until the conditions are satisfied. The moratorium in an EHIA will remain in effect until health-based levels are achieved, as determined by the Administrator upon petition. Within 1 year of the Secretary's biennial health assessment, a grant program will be established to provide medical screening and treatment for environmentally related illnesses in areas with adverse health outcomes. Treatment will be offered to residents without health insurance as long as necessary. After screening, a review will determine if the area qualifies as medically underserved. TITLE VI--POLLUTION REDUCTION\n\nIn areas with adverse health outcomes related to environmental exposures, the Administrator will work to reduce pollution by providing grants for developing effective strategies involving community representatives, public health experts, local businesses, and government officials. If significant progress is not made within 1 year, regulatory steps may be taken to reduce pollution.\n\nTITLE VII--PROMOTION OF GREEN SPACE\n\nDevelopment of parks or recreational areas will be promoted. Within 1 year of the Secretary's health assessment, a grant program will be established for developing parks and recreational spaces in areas with adverse health outcomes. Funding will be provided as necessary for carrying out this Act."
