    "content": "The Act titled \"Sexual Harassment Prevention Act of 1993\" aims to address and prevent sexual harassment. The Congress finds that sexual harassment in employment persists widely, violating title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Prevention is the most effective tool to eliminate sexual harassment, as highlighted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Surveys show a significant percentage of employees have experienced harassment, with the American Psychological Association estimating that half of all working women have been sexually harassed in their careers. (4) The majority of sexual harassment incidents are not reported to a supervisor or designated individual. Only 5% of Government employees who reported harassment in a 1988 survey filed a formal complaint.\n(5) Sexual harassment has significant costs for employees and employers. A 1988 study by Working Woman Magazine found that it costs a typical \"Fortune 500\" employer $6,000,000 annually, or $292.53 per employee. Ignoring the issue is 34 times more expensive than implementing effective programs.\n(6) Job growth in the next decade is expected to be significant. Most job growth in the next decade is expected to be in small businesses, with a focus on female employees. Programs and policies in small businesses will be key in preventing sexual harassment at a low cost to employers. The Act aims to establish workplace requirements, provide low-cost assistance to employers, and raise awareness about sexual harassment. The Act aims to increase the authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to prevent sexual harassment in employment. SEC. 3. EMPLOYER REQUIREMENTS. Each employer must post a notice in the workplace detailing the definition of sexual harassment, stating that it is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and providing information on how to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Each employer must provide an annual written notice to employees with information on how to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regarding sexual harassment, along with details on the employer's procedures for resolving such allegations. Additional information required by the Commission should also be included in the notice. Employers must provide supervisory employees with information on addressing sexual harassment allegations within 60 days of placement in a supervisory position. Willful violation of this requirement may result in a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation. SEC. 4. DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION. The Commission is required to provide technical assistance materials, including model notices and guidelines for addressing discrimination, within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, a toll-free telephone number will be established for inquiries about compliance with the Act. The states must obtain information on compliance with the Act and the model notices and guidelines provided under subsection (a). SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.\n\nEnforcement of Section 3 is divided between the Commission, the House of Representatives, and the Senate based on the type of violations alleged by different categories of employees. The Act defines key terms such as \"Commission\" as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, \"employee\" as individuals in various employment positions, and \"employer\" as entities responsible for employment. The Act defines key terms such as \"employer\" as entities responsible for employment, including Federal entities and employing authorities of Congress. It also clarifies the term \"instrumentality of the Congress\" to include specific government units. The term \"sexual harassment\" is defined in alignment with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act will take effect on the date of its enactment, with Section 3 becoming effective one year later."
