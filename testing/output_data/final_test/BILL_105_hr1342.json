    "content": "One-year enrollment of land covered by expiring Conservation Reserve Program contracts. Eligible Farm Lands: This section applies to farms with expiring conservation reserve program contracts in fiscal year 1997, meeting specific criteria including crop acreage base and location for fall-seeded crops. Owners/operators had to submit eligible bids by March 28, 1997, to enroll the land in the conservation reserve program. The owner or operator of a farm with expiring conservation reserve program contracts in fiscal year 1997 may enroll in the conservation reserve for a one-year term starting on October 1, 1997, if they notify the Secretary during the special notification period and meet eligibility criteria. The operator can enroll the land in the conservation reserve for one year if the Secretary does not accept the bid before October 1, 1997. The Secretary will provide a special notification period for owners and operators to enter into one-year conservation reserve program contracts. The rental rate for a one-year contract will be determined under subsection (b). The one-year conservation reserve program contract amount is based on the bid submitted by the owner or operator. If the same land is bid for a long-term contract starting in 1998, the one-year contract will be considered the first year of the long-term contract. The maximum enrollment for fiscal year 1998 is limited. The conservation reserve for fiscal year 1998 is limited to 30,000,000 acres. The terms of the one-year conservation reserve program contracts follow the laws of the Food Security Act of 1985. If the Secretary has already processed bids for enrollment by March 28, 1997, the special one-year contracts will not be implemented. Special early termination authority for certain Conservation Reserve Program contracts expiring in 1997 is granted. Special early termination authority is granted to farm owners or operators in the Conservation Reserve Program whose contracts expire in 1997. They can terminate the contract after June 30, 1997, without a reduction in rental payment for that fiscal year. Eligibility criteria apply to qualify for this early termination option. During the enrollment period that ended on March 28, 1997, a person submitted an eligible bid to enroll land in the conservation reserve program. If the bid was rejected by the Secretary of Agriculture and the owner/operator did not request a one-year contract, the bid was not accepted.
