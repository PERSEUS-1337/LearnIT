    "content": "Since 9/11, domestic terrorists drawing inspiration from U.S.-based extremist ideologies have not received as much attention from federal law enforcement as foreign terrorists inspired by Al Qaeda. The FBI reported in 1999 that most deadly terrorist attacks in the U.S. were perpetrated by domestic extremists. The U.S. government enhanced its counterterrorism efforts after 9/11, shaping the landscape largely in response to foreign ideologies. This report discusses how domestic terrorists fit into this new counterterrorism landscape and how they are conceptualized by the federal government. The federal government's approach to domestic terrorism is complex, with varying terminology and definitions used. The focus on international terrorist ideologies makes it challenging to assess the scope of domestic terrorist activity. The Obama Administration's strategy targets individuals inspired by Al Qaeda, but the role of domestic terrorism in this strategy is unclear. Congress may need to address issues related to domestic terrorism, which is not the top federal counterterrorism priority but is a significant concern for some law enforcement agencies. Domestic terrorism is not the top federal counterterrorism priority but is a significant concern for some law enforcement officers. This includes groups like black separatists, white supremacists/sovereign citizen extremists, and animal rights terrorists. Many domestic terrorists do not use traditional tactics like bombings or hijackings, instead relying on theft, trespassing, property destruction, and legal filings to cause disruption. While foreign-inspired homegrown violent jihadists receive more media attention, domestic terrorists are also active. Domestic terrorists, like Timothy McVeigh, have caused significant casualties on U.S. soil, with the Oklahoma City bombing being second only to 9/11. There has been a rise in anti-government extremist activity, often fueled by white supremacy beliefs, and facilitated by internet resources. Prison has been identified as a breeding ground for terrorist radicalization. Domestic terrorists in U.S. prisons are influenced by various ideologies, including sovereign citizen anti-government ideas. They are driven by beliefs such as animal rights, white supremacy, and opposition to abortion. These individuals separate themselves from legal propagandists who share similar views but do not engage in criminal activities. This report provides background on domestic terrorists, detailing the threat as defined by U.S. government sources. It discusses key factors in assessing the threat and potential issues for Congress, excluding details on violent jihadist-inspired terrorism and the federal government's role in counterterrorism investigations. It is meant to be read alongside other related reports. The definition of domestic terrorism is complex, with some considering all terrorist plots within the homeland as domestic terrorism. However, federal sources define domestic terrorism as ideologically driven crimes committed by Americans in the United States without foreign direction. The U.S. government does not provide a precise list of domestic terrorist organizations, but the Department of Justice has identified general threats. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as terrorist activity that occurs within the homeland and is primarily responsible for terrorism investigations at the federal level. Federal Regulations define \"terrorism\" as the unlawful use of force and violence to intimidate or coerce a government or civilian population for political or social objectives. Domestic terrorism, as per 18 U.S.C. Section 2331(5), involves acts dangerous to human life within U.S. jurisdiction intended to intimidate or influence government policy. The FBI's definition of domestic terrorism focuses on Americans attacking Americans based on U.S.-based extremist ideologies, without foreign direction. This definition is also followed by the Department of Homeland Security. Some U.S.-based extremist ideologies driving domestic terrorism have international roots and active followings abroad, such as eco-extremism, animal rights extremism, Nazism, anarchism, and racist skinhead movement originating from the United Kingdom. The FBI's emphasis on U.S.-based ideologies in domestic terrorism framing is unclear. The difficulty in counting terrorist prosecutions post-9/11, ambiguity in defining domestic terrorism, interchangeability of \"terrorist\" and \"extremist\" terms by the federal government, lack of clarity on specific domestic terrorist groups, and the focus on \"threats\" rather than groups in federal definitions of domestic terrorism pose challenges in understanding the scope of the domestic terrorist threat in the United States. In post-9/11 period, federal courts and DOJ may have applied different parameters in categorizing terrorist prosecutions. Different criteria are used by U.S. Federal District Courts, DOJ's National Security Division, and federal prosecutors to determine terrorism involvement. Domestic terrorists may be charged under non-terrorism statutes, making it hard to gauge the extent of the threat. DOJ has specialized statutes for animal enterprise terrorism but domestic terrorism cases often involve other charges. Domestic terrorism cases involve crimes such as firearms, arson, fraud, threats, and hoaxes. FBI supports local partners in investigations, even if suspects may not be federally charged as terrorists. Investigators focus on clarifying suspects' motives, as domestic terrorism differs from ordinary criminal activity. Domestic terrorists are driven by ideology, unlike ordinary criminals motivated by profit. Collaboration between ideologically motivated actors and profit-driven individuals can occur. Distinguishing between hate crimes and acts of domestic terrorism can be challenging for investigators. The distinction between domestic terrorism and hate crimes can be challenging, as it depends on the suspect's intent and ideological affiliations. Suspects linked to domestic terrorist movements may sometimes be charged with hate crimes. This ambiguity raises questions about how the government perceives the threat posed by extremist groups with racist beliefs. The FBI's difficulty in categorizing acts as domestic terrorism is exemplified by the case of Kevin Harpham, a confessed would-be bomber motivated by white supremacist ideology. Despite initial views of domestic terrorism, Harpham ultimately pled guilty to committing a federal hate crime and attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. The FBI's struggle to classify acts as domestic terrorism is highlighted by the case of Kevin Harpham, who pleaded guilty to a federal hate crime and attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. The term \"extremism\" is often used to describe homegrown actors, with some viewing it as synonymous with terrorism. This lack of uniformity in prosecuting domestic terrorist activities in the US allows for flexibility in discussing terrorist-like behavior without labeling it as terrorism. The FBI's struggle to classify acts as domestic terrorism is highlighted by the case of Kevin Harpham, who pleaded guilty to a federal hate crime and attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. The term \"extremism\" is often used to describe homegrown actors, with some viewing it as synonymous with terrorism. This lack of uniformity in prosecuting domestic terrorist activities in the US allows for flexibility in discussing terrorist-like behavior without labeling it as terrorism. The FBI's public formulation of \"extremism\" involves adhering to specific ideologies and engaging in criminal activities to advance these ideologies. Anarchism is cited as an example of an ideology associated with extremism. According to the FBI and DHS, a \"homegrown violent extremist\" (HVE) is someone who has primarily lived and operated in the United States and may be motivated by ideologies of foreign terrorist organizations. This term separates domestic terrorists from those influenced by foreign ideologies. A \"homegrown violent extremist\" (HVE) is a person in the United States who advocates or engages in ideologically-motivated terrorist activities independently of a foreign terrorist organization. The federal government does not publicly list domestic terrorist organizations or individuals due to civil liberties concerns. The lack of official lists or processes to designate domestic terrorists makes it difficult to assess trends and federal efforts to counter such threats. Unlike international terrorism, there are no designated domestic terrorist groups, leading to vagueness about which groups the government considers domestic terrorist organizations. The government includes domestic terrorists in its Terrorist Screening Database but does not provide an official public list of domestic terrorist organizations. The government designates foreign terrorist organizations officially, but does not publicly list domestic terrorist organizations. This lack of official lists complicates understanding of domestic terrorism threats. The DOJ and FBI identify various domestic terrorist threats, including animal rights extremists, eco-terrorists, anarchists, anti-government extremists, black separatists, white supremacists, and anti-abortion extremists. These groups draw upon ideologies protected by the Constitution, but FBI investigations must have a national security or criminal purpose, not solely to monitor First Amendment rights. However, the criteria used by DOJ and the FBI to classify dissent as domestic terrorism threats are unclear. The discussion revolves around the criteria and identification process for domestic terrorism threats by the DOJ and FBI, questioning the threshold for classifying an ideology as a threat. It also raises the issue of public petitioning to prioritize investigative efforts. The prevalence of animal rights extremism and eco-terrorism cases in public records is noted, without implying their significance over other forms of domestic terrorism. The report discusses animal rights extremism and eco-terrorism, which involve criminal acts in the name of animal rights and the environment. These acts are typically carried out by small independent cells or individuals who engage in vandalism, theft, property destruction, and arson. Despite their actions, most extremists avoid direct physical violence towards people or animals. The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) are two movements with similar beliefs and overlapping membership, known for committing crimes in the name of animal rights and the environment. They do not have formal rosters or leadership structures but attract individuals who commit crimes in their name through \"above-ground\" wings. ALF and ELF supporters communicate their shared identity largely through websites. The ALF and ELF movements, along with other entities like SHAC, use websites to publish literature on their philosophies and criminal activities. They share similar agendas and can have overlapping membership, leading to confusion in understanding their operations. In late 2005 and early 2006, the FBI dismantled a network called \"the Family\" that committed violent acts in the name of both the ALF and the ELF. The group disbanded in 2001 after law enforcement pressure and was responsible for criminal incidents totaling $48 million in damages, including an arson attack at the Vail Ski Resort in 1998. The ALF and ELF rely on philosophical beliefs to justify their actions. The ALF believes in animal rights and opposes speciesism, arguing that animals have inalienable rights and cannot be owned. They reject the U.S. legal system's view of animals as property, advocating for a higher moral law that transcends corrupt statutes. The ALF and other animal rights supporters oppose speciesism, viewing it as a discriminatory belief system akin to sexism or racism. They justify actions like theft or destruction of research facilities as \"liberation\" for animals they believe have the same rights as humans. Intimidation of those involved in animal research is seen as confronting oppressors who abuse and murder animals. Eco-terrorists, like the ELF, are driven by a mix of environmental philosophies such as biocentrism, deep ecology, social ecology, and green anarchism. These ideologies advocate for the equality of all organisms, criticize industrialization, reject hierarchical human society, and blame civilization for environmental harm. Anarchist extremists commit crimes in the name of anarchist ideals, which resist hierarchical societal structures and advocate for individual autonomy and collective equality. They oppose government, business, or social interests they view as dangerous, and seek to realign authority and power through revolution. Anarchist activity is decentralized, with affinity groups playing a key role in shaping the work of U.S. anarchists. These groups consist of individuals who share causes and preferred actions, making decisions through an anarchist, egalitarian process. Groups disband once objectives are met, but can join clusters to coordinate efforts if necessary. Anarchist clusters can coordinate legal or illegal, violent or non-violent actions, often using \"black bloc\" tactics. Some anarchists also participate in the ALF and the ELF, sharing opposition to globalization and capitalism. Anarchist extremists are described as \"event driven\" by the FBI, targeting symbols of Western civilization. Anarchist extremists target symbols of Western civilization, engaging in illegal activities like property damage, riots, and small-scale bombings. They have been involved in criminal acts during mass protests at events like the 1999 World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Seattle and the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul. Anarchists formed the \"RNC Welcoming Committee\" to coordinate protests during the convention. Law enforcement is concerned about their potential use of improvised explosive devices. In September 2007, the RNCWC developed a plan to organize affinity groups disrupting the convention. Law enforcement infiltrated and arrested 800 people, including eight from RNCWC. The eight initially faced felony charges but later had them dismissed. In 2012, five men with anarchist sympathies were arrested for planning to blow up a bridge near Cleveland, OH, coinciding with Occupy Cleveland protests. Occupy Cleveland representatives clarified that the alleged bombers were not associated with their movement. The FBI arrested the group in a sting operation where they were supplied with inert bombs they believed were real. Anarchist extremists have been involved in criminal acts like setting fires at development sites in Vancouver, Seattle, and Grand Rapids. Joseph Konopka, known as \"Dr. Chaos,\" was also involved in non-event-driven criminal activities. Joseph Konopka, also known as \"Dr. Chaos,\" led a group called \"The Realm of Chaos\" in committing crimes involving vandalism to towers and storing deadly cyanide powder in a Chicago subway tunnel. He pled guilty to possessing chemical weapons and multiple felonies in Wisconsin, including arson and creating counterfeit software. White supremacist extremism involves criminal acts in the name of the belief in white racial superiority. White supremacist ideology promotes white racial superiority, drawing on activities of hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan and skinheads. Many individuals hold extremist beliefs without formal group membership. White supremacists often view the world as a dichotomy between whites and enemies, with animosity towards Jews and African Americans. They believe in racial separation and feel discriminated against in society. White supremacist ideology promotes white racial superiority, viewing society as discriminatory against them. The \"Fourteen Words\" slogan emphasizes securing the existence of the white race and a future for white children. Neo-Nazism, with its focus on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, is a significant aspect of white supremacist extremism in the United States. George Lincoln Rockwell, considered the father of American neo-Nazism, shaped the movement by broadening the racial notion of \"white\" to include people of Southern and Eastern European descent. White supremacist ideology, influenced by figures like George Lincoln Rockwell, extends the notion of \"white\" to include various European descents, denies the Holocaust, and ties neo-Nazism to religion. It also embraces the inevitability of violent conflict and believes in conspiracies hostile to white supremacy. The FBI notes that white supremacists commonly anticipate waging war against their opponents, with groups like the neo-Nazi Creativity Movement promoting the concept of \"racial holy war.\" Some white supremacists interpret apocalyptic Norse mythology through Odinism, rooted in the Church of the Creator founded by Ben Klassen. Conspiracy theories, such as the belief in Zionist control, can influence the actions of white supremacist extremists. White supremacists believe in the Zionist Occupied Government (ZOG), which they see as controlled by international Jewish interests. They use this belief to justify racist actions and blame personal or social grievances on ZOG, a cabal involving Jews, Illuminati, Freemasons, plutocrats, and multinational corporations. White supremacists believe in the Zionist Occupied Government (ZOG), which they see as controlled by international Jewish interests. ZOG is used to explain various societal issues and personal failures. In the 1980s and 1990s, white supremacist circles were dominated by a few figures with cohesive organizations, but by the early 2000s, these groups fragmented due to leadership losses. A study from 2006 noted a crisis of leadership in the hate movement, and two well-known white supremacist figures died in the last decade. The deaths of Pierce and Butler, leaders of white supremacist organizations, led to the downfall of their groups due to infighting, law enforcement pressure, and other forces. The National Socialist Movement (NSM) has benefitted from their decline and new leadership under Jeff Schoep. The National Socialist Movement (NSM) saw a resurgence under new leadership by Jeff Schoep in the early 2000s, taking advantage of the internet expansion. Initially on the fringes of the neo-Nazi movement, the group had around 500 members by 2008. NSM allows members to join other white supremacist organizations and has had individuals with legal issues associated with it, such as Joseph Benjamin Thomas and Samuel James Johnson in Minnesota in 2012. In 2012, two individuals in Minnesota formed a white supremacist group, planning attacks on the government. Johnson pled guilty to firearms possession, while Thomas pled guilty to methamphetamine possession. William White, a former NSM member, faced charges for making threats online, including kidnapping, torture, rape, and murder. White threatened officials involved in prosecuting suspects tied to the American Front, a white supremacist organization in Florida, in hopes of securing their release. He was convicted of soliciting violence online against a jury foreman in U.S. v. Matthew Hale, with the conviction later reinstated on appeal. White was also convicted of communicating threats in interstate commerce and witness intimidation, including attempting to prevent African Americans from testifying in a discrimination case. Racist skinheads in the United States have a history dating back to the early 1980s, originating from the UK in the late 1960s. The movement has evolved into regional groups rather than a centralized organization since the early 2000s, known for violence and promoting white power through music, literature, and appearance. Skinheads emerged as a non-racist movement among British working-class youth in the late 1960s, embracing Jamaican culture and music. Some white British skinheads later embraced racism and neo-Nazism, leading to the formation of racist skinhead groups in the US in the early 1980s. The Hammerskin Nation (HSN) was formed in the mid-1990s, with chapters in the US and Europe, organizing events like Hammerfest and running a record label. Other groups like Outlaw Hammerskins and Ohio State Skinheads challenged HSN for dominance in the early 2000s. In 2011, 133 skinhead groups were active in the US, with some being the most violent segment of WSE adherents. Between 2007 and 2009, skinheads were involved in 36 of the 53 violent incidents tied to WSE proponents. The FBI stated that violence is integral to the racist skinhead subculture, with criminal acts targeting nonwhites and minorities. An exception involved a Connecticut case with planned illegal activities. Three individuals, including one convicted and two who pled guilty, were involved in the illegal sale of firearms and homemade grenades in Connecticut. The scheme, linked to a skinhead group called Battalion 14, included multiple meetings to negotiate transactions and assemble weapons. They sold the weapons to an FBI informant posing as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Two others in the case were acquitted of charges. The Department of Justice views unauthorized militias and sovereign citizens as anti-government extremists, but membership alone does not equate to terrorism or criminal activity. The militia movement emerged in the 1990s as armed groups formed to resist perceived government intrusions, with fears of firearm confiscation. Some members hold anti-Semitic and racist beliefs, but most engage in constitutionally protected activities. Militia groups train in paramilitary tactics, survival skills, and weapons instruction under specific leaders. Extremists may stockpile illegal weapons and ammunition. Some segments of the militia movement believe in conspiracy theories about the U.S. government being controlled by a \"New World Order\" and international organizations like the United Nations. They fear a \"Shadow Government\" seizing lawfully owned firearms to undermine democracy, while others feel the federal government has exceeded its constitutional limits. Some militia members believe the federal government has overstepped its bounds and assert their right to use firearms against unconstitutional government actions. Militias formed in response to incidents at Ruby Ridge, ID, and Waco, TX in the early 1990s, involving confrontations with federal law enforcement over firearms violations. Randy Weaver's standoff with law enforcement in 1992 resulted in the death of his son and a U.S. Marshal. The events at Ruby Ridge in 1992 led to a standoff where Randy Weaver and a friend were shot, and Weaver's wife was killed by an FBI sniper. Weaver was later found guilty of gun charges and sentenced to jail. He received a $3.1 million settlement in a wrongful death suit against the U.S. government. The incident at Ruby Ridge contributed to the rise of the militia movement, along with the standoff at Waco involving the Branch Davidians. The standoff at Waco involving the Branch Davidians resulted in the deaths of ATF agents and Davidians. Protracted negotiations failed, leading to a federal assault on the compound where 75 Davidians died. Timothy McVeigh's bombing in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, caused a temporary decline in the militia movement, with increased law enforcement scrutiny. The bombing claimed 168 lives and reduced the number of militia groups from 441 in 1995 to 72 by 2000. The militia movement experienced a resurgence post-2008, with the number of militias in the US increasing from 42 in 2008 to 334 in 2011. This resurgence is attributed to a rise in anti-government anger. Social networking sites have facilitated looser organization of smaller, web-based militia cells. Some militia adherents have been involved in criminal activities post-9/11, such as the arrest of four retirees in 2011 for allegedly planning violent acts. In northern Georgia, a fringe militia group planned violent attacks on government officials, discussing murder, theft, toxic agents, and assassinations to undermine the government. Roberts and Thomas met with an undercover FBI agent to buy weapons and explosives for their plot, including a silencer and ricin. They pleaded guilty to conspiring to obtain illegal weapons, while others were found guilty of conspiring to make ricin. In Alaska, members of the Alaska Peacemaker's Militia, with sovereign citizen beliefs, were found guilty of conspiracy and firearms charges related to a plot led by Francis \"Schaeffer\" Cox. The group planned a retaliatory response to law enforcement, codenamed \"241 (two for one),\" intending to kill two government officials for every militia member killed in the operation. In March 2012, members of the Michigan Militia group known as the Hutaree were acquitted of serious charges related to a violent plot against U.S. law enforcement. The group was accused of planning to kill a local law enforcement officer and attack fellow officers, but the judge cleared them of seditious conspiracy, rebellion, and weapons of mass destruction charges. The Hutaree group in Michigan discussed using explosives against a funeral procession and had a hit list that included federal judges. Despite not having a specific plan to attack government targets, three members pled guilty to firearms charges. The FBI defines the sovereign citizen movement as... The FBI defines the sovereign citizen movement as \"anti-government extremists who believe they are separate from the United States. The movement originated in the 1970s and attracted followers in the 1990s. Some African Americans also subscribe to its ideals. The sovereign citizen movement, with an estimated 300,000 members, is diffuse and includes few organized groups. Leaders known as \"gurus\" spread conspiracy theories about a government designed to take away citizens' rights. Followers are roused to believe in this theory, similar to the New World Order and WSE concepts. The sovereign citizen movement, with an estimated 300,000 members, is diffuse and includes few organized groups. Leaders known as \"gurus\" spread conspiracy theories about a government designed to take away citizens' rights, similar to the New World Order and WSE concepts. The interplay between concepts of legitimate and illegitimate rule is seen in the movement, with followers promoting illegal techniques to cut ties to the federal government, reject the legitimacy of the U.S. legal system, and believe that the 14th Amendment ushered in an illegitimate federal government. Sovereign citizens have attempted to sever ties with the government by filing court documents claiming they are not U.S. citizens, creating fake financial documents, and using fraudulent diplomatic credentials and license plates to avoid taxes and law enforcement. They have also created fictitious entities and used counterfeit currency, passports, license plates, and driver licenses. Ronald K. Delorme developed the Pembina Nation Little Shell Band of North America as a sovereign citizen group to avoid taxes and government costs. In 2010, John McCombs used a fraudulent Pembina Nation Little Shell license plate to evade law enforcement. Sovereign citizen fraud includes economic scams like pyramid schemes and tax fraud, not just ideology-driven actions. In November 2011, Monty and Patricia Ervin were convicted of tax fraud and evasion, with Patricia also convicted of structuring transactions to avoid bank reporting requirements. The couple earned over $9 million from investment properties and identified as \"sovereign citizens\" when investigated by the IRS. A group of sovereign citizens in North Georgia was indicted for using schemes to steal real estate. Some sovereign citizens have been involved in violent altercations with law enforcement officers. Since 2000, sovereign citizens have killed six law enforcement officers, posing a growing threat according to the FBI. In a 2010 incident, two sovereign citizens engaged in a violent confrontation with police in West Memphis, TN, resulting in the death of two officers. Joe Kane fired an AK-47 assault rifle during a traffic stop, leading to a shootout where both Kane and his father were killed. The FBI had previously investigated Jerry Kane for promoting a \"debt\" scheme. In June 2012, the FBI warned about sovereign extremists potentially planning conflicts with law enforcement officers during traffic stops. In August 2013, two Sovereigns in Las Vegas were arrested for plotting to kidnap and kill police officers after an undercover investigation. In a series of vehicle stops, Brutsche expressed his Sovereign Citizen beliefs and pled guilty to felony kidnapping conspiracy in 2014. Another case involved James M. Tesi, who shot at a police officer in 2011 and was linked to a sovereign citizen group. Tesi was later found guilty of aggravated assault on a public servant with a deadly weapon. In June 2011, a police officer in Page, AZ, shot and killed William Foust during a domestic violence 911 call. Foust tried to take the officer's Taser during a struggle. Foust had declared his sovereign citizen status in court in Kanab, UT. The DOJ includes black separatism as a potential source of domestic terrorism, but most engage in protected behavior. Little public discussion on federal investigations involving black separatist extremists since 9/11. The New Black Panther Party for Self Defense faced scrutiny over voter intimidation allegations. The New Black Panther Party (NBPP) faced national scrutiny over voter intimidation allegations in Philadelphia during the 2008 federal election. Described as a racist and anti-Semitic organization, the NBPP engages in confrontational rhetoric and displays firearms at rallies. The group denies being a hate group and claims to act on behalf of the disadvantaged. An NBPP representative labeled a 2011 police shooting in Jacksonville as an act of terrorism. The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office described a police shooting of a drug suspect as a violent act of terrorism. The suspect, an alleged drug dealer, was holding a firearm during a confrontation with undercover officers serving a search warrant. In 2008, the Philadelphia chapter of the NBPP was involved in a controversial case where members were accused of voter intimidation at a polling station. In 2008, the Philadelphia chapter of the NBPP was accused of voter intimidation at a polling station. One member was removed while the other, a certified poll watcher, remained. The DOJ dismissed claims against defendants in the case, leading to an investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility. The vast majority of anti-abortion activists engage in constitutionally protected activity, but anti-abortion extremism involves criminal acts. Anti-abortion extremism involves criminal acts committed in the name of the anti-abortion movement, including shootings, bombings, arson, and acid attacks targeting abortion providers and clinics. Since 1993, eight clinic workers have been murdered by extremists in the United States. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act was passed in 1994 in response to a wave of violence in the 1980s and 1990s. The FBI's classification of these acts as terrorism is unclear. The 2009 murder of abortion provider George Tiller by Scott Roeder received public attention. Roeder was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Other incidents targeting abortion clinics have been uncovered, involving individuals operating alone. Bobby Joe Rogers was charged with firebombing a clinic in Pensacola in 2012. Ralph Lang was arrested in May 2011. In May 2011, Ralph Lang was arrested for planning to kill abortion providers in Madison, WI. The Army of God (AOG) is an underground network that openly promotes anti-abortion violence, with members denying they are terrorists. AOG gained notoriety in 1982 for kidnapping a doctor and his wife who ran an abortion clinic. The group disseminates a manual detailing violent methods against clinics and providers. The manual published by Eric Rudolph on the Army of God website contains instructions for illegal activities like blockading entrances, arson, and bomb making, with anti-abortion, anti-government, and anti-gay/lesbian language. The boundary between legitimate protest and terrorism is debated, with animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists being seen as security concerns by law enforcement. In 2008, the FBI identified animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists as a serious domestic terrorism threat due to numerous crimes causing over $110 million in damages. The threat from eco-terrorists may be decreasing, impacting businesses and laboratories, including scientists' work. Animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists have disrupted scientists' work by destroying equipment and research materials. Their actions have led some researchers to quit lab work involving animals, affecting products and procedures that require animal testing. In some cases, harassment by animal rights groups has caused professors to halt their research, driving students away from research programs. Critics argue that the threat posed by animal rights extremism and eco-terrorism may be exaggerated by law enforcement. The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (AETA) was signed into law in November 2006 to combat animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists engaging in criminal activity. Critics argue that the government's pursuit of these individuals perpetuates a \"green scare\" and may conflate property crime with terrorism. The AETA, signed into law in 2006, expanded the Animal Enterprise Protection Act to include intentional damage or threats against individuals involved with animal enterprises. It prohibits placing individuals in fear of death or bodily harm while interfering with operations, with increased penalties for violations. DOJ prosecuted individuals for animal enterprise terrorism under the AEPA before the AETA was enacted. The DOJ prosecuted individuals involved in the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign for inciting threats, harassment, and vandalism against Huntingdon Life Sciences. The group encouraged illegal activities through websites and targeted employees and companies associated with HLS. The AETA was successfully applied in these cases. DOJ successfully applied the AETA in various cases involving animal rights extremists. Scott DeMuth was sentenced to six months for releasing ferrets at a farm, while William James Viehl and Alex Hall received prison terms for releasing minks and vandalizing a ranch. However, there was a setback when four individuals were arrested for violating the AETA by interfering with the University of California's operation. The indictment against four individuals for interfering with the University of California's operation was dismissed in July 2010 due to a lack of specific description of crimes. Critics argue that the case involved an over-broad application of the AETA to First Amendment-protected behaviors. Opponents of the AETA claim it expanded the AEPA too much. Opponents of the AETA criticize its expansion of the AEPA, particularly in prosecuting protest campaigns against secondary or tertiary targets. They are concerned about the inclusion of \"reasonable fear\" in the AETA, which could potentially criminalize protected speech. Critics argue that labeling vandalism or arson as terrorism hinders constitutionally protected protest activity by individuals supporting animal rights or radical environmentalism. The U.S. government's labeling of movements like ALF and ELF as terrorism is criticized for creating a \"green scare.\" Lauren Gazzola, after serving time for involvement with SHAC USA, argued against being labeled a terrorist, stating she had not committed any independent crime. The definition of \"domestic terrorism\" in the U.S. Code is seen as potentially chilling to legitimate animal rights and environmental protest activities. The ALF ideology encourages fear in those who oppose their activities, aiming for personal and economic harm. While not as violent as other extremist groups, animal rights terrorism still instills fear in industries like academia, research, agriculture, and food service. Violent tactics instill fear in academia, research, agriculture, and food service industries when homes and workplaces are firebombed. Domestic terrorist attacks, like Timothy McVeigh's bombing in Oklahoma City, have caused significant casualties. Law enforcement officers are concerned about domestic terrorists, including black separatists and white supremacist extremists. In a 2008 study, state police agencies reported the presence of dangerous domestic extremist groups, including black separatists, white supremacists/sovereign citizen extremists, and animal rights terrorists. Most followers of extremist viewpoints are not considered a threat. Domestic terrorists have been responsible for numerous incidents since 9/11, with a growth in anti-government extremist activity. Many domestic terrorists do not use major tactics like bombings or hijackings, and they often utilize the internet. Domestic terrorists, like violent jihadists, are Internet savvy and operate in a decentralized manner. Radicalization can occur in prisons, with some U.S. prison gangs influenced by white supremacist ideology. There is no official list of domestic terrorist incidents, but a 2011 study identified 114 individuals involved in non-jihadist terrorist acts post-9/11. The study identified 114 individuals involved in non-jihadist terrorist acts in the 10 years following 9/11, including various extremist groups such as animal rights extremists, eco-terrorists, anarchists, sovereign citizens, militias, black separatists, white supremacists, and anti-abortion extremists. Government sources reported levels of domestic terrorist activity, with examples of criminal acts by animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists causing significant damages. The FBI reported a decline in eco-terrorism after successful prosecutions in 2007, attributing it to activists perceiving a Democratic administration as more sympathetic. A bulletin noted 53 acts of violence by white supremacist extremists from 2007 to 2009, targeting victims like other white supremacists, African Americans, and Latinos. Sovereign citizen convictions increased from 10 in 2009 to 18 in 2010 and 2011. Domestic terrorists have been responsible for killing Americans. Domestic terrorists have been responsible for killing Americans, with incidents involving right- and left-wing extremism. Notable cases include Scott Roeder convicted of killing abortion provider George Tiller, and James von Brunn who shot a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Many domestic terrorist incidents are linked to animal rights extremists or eco-terrorists. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has noted a rise in hate groups and militia movements from 2000-2012, with a resurgence of militia groups between 2009 and 2012. The increase is attributed to resentment over changing racial demographics, economic frustrations, and the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories targeting minorities. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has observed a rise in hate groups and militia movements, with the number of hate groups surpassing 1,000 in 2010. Domestic terrorism suspects engage in various crimes, including non-violent activities like direct action by animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists. The ALF and ELF have a significant role in defining direct action, which includes criminal activities like sabotage and arson. Anarchist extremists, animal liberation extremists, and environmental extremists view their actions as direct action, often involving criminality. The Animal Liberation Primer acknowledges criminality within the ALF, stating that anyone involved is a criminal. The ALF and ELF supporters are seen as criminals who engage in direct action, which they view as nonviolent and heroic. They align themselves with historical movements like the Underground Railroad and the Boston Tea Party, supporting actions like economic sabotage and ethical vandalism. ALF and ELF supporters engage in destructive actions against individuals and businesses involved in animal exploitation, including trespassing, theft, and cyber hacking. They justify their actions as \"live liberations\" to rescue animals from exploitation. Economic sabotage is a key tactic for both groups, with the ELF rejecting legal protest tactics as ineffective. The term \"monkeywrenching\" has a history dating back to the 1950s and is associated with economic sabotage in the name of environmentalism. It involves nonviolent actions to disrupt activities that harm natural diversity, as depicted in the novel The Monkey Wrench Gang. A guidebook on monkeywrenching encourages individuals to act heroically to defend the wild by sabotaging destructive machinery. Federal officials are concerned about the use of incendiary devices and explosives by extremists. In 2005, ATF Deputy Assistant Director Carson Carroll expressed concern about animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists using incendiary and explosive devices. Two incidents near San Francisco involved explosive devices, claimed by the Revolutionary Cells of the Animal Liberation Brigade and linked to Daniel San Diego. In 2003, pipe bombs at Chiron caused minimal damage, and a bomb at Shaklee damaged offices but caused no injuries. In 2003, a bomb at Shaklee, a health, beauty, and household product company, damaged offices but caused no injuries. The perpetrator(s) believed both companies did business with Huntingdon Life Sciences. Animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists have histories of using incendiary devices to damage property, with a focus on arson highlighted in a recent example from NAALPO in January 2012. In January 2012, NAALPO claimed responsibility for setting fires at a cattle feedlot in Coalinga, CA using accelerant and digital timers. The fires were a reaction to factory farming injustices. ELF actions have targeted urban sprawl and industrialized society, including torching housing projects and damaging vehicles. The ELF vandalized construction vehicles and fast food restaurants in Virginia, including spray painting \"sprawl\" on homes under construction. In November 2005, they claimed responsibility for fires set in townhomes in Hagerstown, MD. Both the ALF and the ELF have guidelines on their websites for followers, emphasizing avoiding harm to animals and humans. The ALF requires members to be vegetarians or vegans and supports intimidation as a tactic. The ALF supports intimidation as a tactic but does not see it as involving violence. Arson is considered \"violence against property,\" not people. Some animal rights extremists, like Meredith Lowell, have been arrested for soliciting violence. The \"Justice Department,\" an offshoot of ALF, believes in using violence against humans. In 1999, the first incident claimed in the name of the \"Justice Department\" involved mailing over 80 envelopes with razor blades possibly coated in rat poison to animal researchers and hunting guides in the US and Canada. In November 2010, individuals linked to the group sent communiqu\u00e9s threatening to send AIDS-tainted razors to scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, vowing to target the vivisection industry. Sovereign citizens engage in non-violent crimes such as \"paper terrorism,\" including forging documents, fraudulent property liens, and illegal courts targeting officials. Their actions are designed to intimidate or defraud individuals, institutions, or government entities. Some sovereigns engage in \"paper terrorism\" by filing frivolous liens and legal actions against officials, leading to court fees and potential damage to their credit ratings. Kenneth W. Leaming was arrested in 2011 for issuing billions of dollars in fraudulent liens to intimidate public officials enforcing laws against sovereign citizens. Sovereign citizen adherents, like Kenneth W. Leaming, engage in \"paper terrorism\" by filing false liens against federal officials. Leaming was convicted in 2013 for this and harboring federal fugitives. The concept of \"redemption\" suggests that each child born in the U.S. has a Treasury account that can be accessed by filing certain forms with authorities. Redemption involves filing false IRS forms to illegally obtain money from the U.S. government. Some scammers deceive individuals into submitting these forms to access supposed secret government accounts. One guru pleaded guilty to money laundering, while another received a 14-year prison sentence for immigration benefit fraud. Gerald A Poynter was involved in an immigration benefit fraud scheme, selling membership in Pembina Nation Little Shell Band to illegal aliens for $1,500-$2,000. He was permanently barred from preparing tax returns after producing fraudulent IRS forms claiming $64 million in refunds. Concerns exist about domestic terrorists using the Internet, with 657 U.S.-based hate websites in 2010. In 2010, there were 657 U.S.-based hate websites, which extremist groups use to educate members, recruit new adherents, and propagate their ideologies. White supremacists have a long history of utilizing technology for communication and interaction, with some websites serving as effective recruiting tools. Membership forms, multimedia material, and retail items are available on these websites. The Internet allows white supremacist groups to connect, disseminate ideology, and manage their public image. Some sites claim to be non-violent and not racist. Virtual spaces provide a platform for indoctrination, sharing grievances, adopting ideologies, and discussing violence against 'racial enemies.' The online ideological activity of extremist groups involves constitutionally protected speech, with websites connecting like-minded individuals and sharing key texts. Examples include the ALF and ELF guidelines, animal rights extremists publicizing crimes, and the Army of God's website listing supporters of violent opposition to abortion. The National Socialist Movement sponsors a social networking site for white supremacists. The \"New Saxon Social Network\" sponsored by the National Socialist Movement is used by domestic terrorists for cyber attacks. An animal rights extremist cell targeted a research firm by posting personal information of employees online, including names, addresses, and phone numbers. The extremist group also shared suggestions for violent actions, leading to vandalism and cyber attacks against the targeted companies. In January 2009, DHS warned of \"leftwing\" extremists using cyber attacks, including deletion of user accounts and flooding servers. Domestic terrorism involves decentralized threats, with suspects operating independently or in small cells without cohesive leadership structures. The interplay between above-ground extremist groups and independent underground cells is a critical feature of domestic terrorism. Leaderless resistance, popularized by white supremacist Louis Beam, aims to avoid law enforcement infiltration and transform the white supremacy movement. The leaderless resistance strategy aims to avoid law enforcement infiltration of white supremacist groups. It involves underground cells or lone wolves engaging in illegal activities independently, while the above-ground public face propagandizes and disseminates ideology. This system allows for deniability of violence and terrorist activities, as seen in the example of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement. The National Socialist Movement (NSM) condemns illegal actions and violence, advocating for white civil rights through political activism. The Turner Diaries, a novel by William Pierce, has inspired violent acts by white supremacists. The Turner Diaries, written by William Pierce, has inspired violent acts by white supremacist extremists and anti-government extremists. The novel reflects Pierce's racist religious philosophies and emphasizes the destruction of the current racial order in accordance with white supremacist ideals. It has been described as the most widely read book among far-right extremists, with around 500,000 copies sold. The story follows neo-Nazi character Earl Turner leading a terrorist group triggering a race war. The Turner Diaries by William Pierce inspired violent acts by white supremacist extremists. The novel depicts Turner leading a terrorist group triggering a race war and nuclear apocalypse, leading to the rebirth of a revitalized white race. The book influenced domestic terrorists like Robert Mathews, who formed The Order and engaged in violent crimes, including bank robberies and bombings. The Turner Diaries by William Pierce inspired violent acts by white supremacist extremists, including The Order's bombing of a synagogue and murder of a Jewish talk show host. Timothy McVeigh, influenced by the book, carried passages with him during his arrest for the Oklahoma City bombing. The concept of leaderless resistance, seen in the book, has been adopted by other extremist movements like the ALF and ELF, making their activities harder for law enforcement to investigate. The ALF and ELF provide guidelines and an ideological platform for individuals to motivate criminal actions. Above-ground components lawfully communicate shared identities through websites, avoiding conflicts over ideological details. They distance themselves from criminal activity, stating they do not engage in illegal activities. Independent cells are suggested in their literature. The ALF and ELF operate with independent cells to avoid law enforcement infiltration. This leaderless format is akin to franchising in the business world. Lone wolf terrorism involves individuals operating independently without belonging to an organized group, directing their actions without outside command. Lone wolves have been linked to various domestic terrorism movements, including white supremacist extremism. Lone wolves in white supremacist extremism operate independently, often leaving or being dismissed from groups due to violent tendencies or ideological differences. There is no universal definition of lone wolves, but they align with broader terrorist movements while not claiming formal membership. This blurs the line between acting as a lone wolf or part of a larger movement. On January 29, 2010, Scott Roeder was convicted of first-degree murder for killing abortion provider George Tiller. Roeder had connections with militant abortion foes but few formal ties with known groups. Some see his contacts as evidence of conspiracy, while others view him as a lone wolf. Roeder remains the only person convicted of Tiller's murder, presenting challenges for law enforcement in distinguishing lone wolves from individuals committing hate crimes or domestic terrorism. The challenge for law enforcement lies in assessing which radicalized individuals, known as lone wolves, may turn their beliefs into terrorist actions. The FBI struggles to predict when a lone wolf may decide to carry out an attack, as they operate independently without connections to terrorist networks or training camps. Assessing their intent and operational capabilities, such as knowledge of explosives or firearms, is difficult. The FBI is conducting a study on lone offenders to identify behavior predictors for assessing suspects. Lone wolves lack tradecraft and social networks, making large-scale attacks harder, but they can still be lethal. Far-rightists have been responsible for the deaths of 42 law enforcement officers between 1990 and April 2009. Far-rightists have been responsible for the deaths of 42 law enforcement officers, mostly from state and local agencies in the United States. Incidents involved firearms and most assailants acted alone. In 2009, suspected lone wolves with white supremacist beliefs were involved in fatal shooting incidents. Richard Poplawski shot and killed three Pittsburgh police officers, described as a \"white supremacist\" lone wolf. Keith Luke allegedly shot and killed two Cape Verdean immigrants and planned to attack a synagogue. In 2009, lone wolves with white supremacist beliefs were involved in fatal shooting incidents. Richard Poplawski killed three police officers, while Keith Luke shot two immigrants and planned to attack a synagogue. Luke cited the \"demise of the white race\" as his motive. Kevin Harpham was arrested for placing a bomb at a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day March. In 2011, Harpham pled guilty to a federal hate crime and attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. Reports suggest he had ties to white supremacists, including being a member of the neo-Nazi National Alliance in 2004. He was in contact with white supremacist leader Paul Mullet but never joined his group. Harpham made postings on white supremacist websites and read The Turner Diaries. Another case involved Walter Bond, an animal rights extremist who pled guilty to arson in 2010. Walter Bond, an animal rights extremist, set fire to the Sheepskin Factory in Glendale, CO, condemning the business for profiting from the exploitation of animals. Bond, who worked alone, identified strongly with being a lone wolf and used the nickname \"Lone Wolf.\" The ATF recorded Bond discussing the arson and his use of the name \"ALF Lone Wolf\" in a jailhouse letter. Bond expressed the power of acting alone to his ALF brothers and sisters worldwide. Bond's actions highlight the potential for radicalization in prison towards terrorism. Prison can potentially radicalize individuals at risk of becoming terrorists by offering clear solutions to identity and belonging issues. Disaffected prisoners may adopt terrorist ideals and form bonds with like-minded individuals in jail. Studies on government policies in 15 countries, including the United States, emphasize the significance of prisons in the radicalization process. Prisons play a significant role in radicalizing individuals, especially those at risk of becoming terrorists. Some prison gangs adopt radical or extremist ideologies, which can also influence domestic terrorists. However, criminal activities like drug trafficking drive their actions more than radical beliefs. White supremacist prison gangs in America often share these beliefs with domestic extremist groups. White supremacist prison gangs in America, such as the Aryan Brotherhood, Nazi Low Riders, and Public Enemy Number One, have a significant presence in correctional facilities. These groups, while espousing racial hatred, are primarily motivated by profit rather than extremism. White supremacist prison gangs in America, like the Aryan Brotherhood, Nazi Low Riders, and Public Enemy Number One, prioritize profit over extremism. Members often collaborate with non-white gangs for criminal activities, despite committing hate crimes. For example, two ex-cons from the Aryan Brotherhood were involved in the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr. in Texas. Sovereign citizens, another extremist group, have been incarcerated in the US since the 1990s, continuing their beliefs behind bars. Sovereign citizens have been practicing their beliefs in US prisons since the 1990s, with some converting to the ideology and others using sovereign tactics. Examples include Marlon T. Moore, who became a sovereign citizen during a prison stint and James T. McBride, who became a sovereign guru after discovering the ideology in prison. Congress may need to address federal roles in combating domestic terrorism related to sovereign citizens. The federal government faces challenges in assessing the scope of domestic terrorism due to varying terminology, lack of official methods for designating groups as terrorists, and unclear data on investigated plots and attacks. The DOJ uses broad conceptualizations to describe domestic terrorism, discussing general \"threats\" like animal rights extremists, eco-terrorists, anarchists, and anti-government extremists. Terms like \"terrorism\" and \"extremism\" are used interchangeably, allowing flexibility in discussing terrorist-like activity without labeling it as \"terrorism.\" This approach may lead to inconsistencies in the development and application of domestic terrorism laws. The federal government lacks a process for publicly designating domestic terrorist organizations, unlike the well-established regimen for foreign terrorist organizations. Official designation of foreign terrorist groups aids in prosecuting those who support them. The absence of a designation regimen for domestic terrorist groups makes it harder for the federal government to press material support charges against them. FTO designation helps curb terrorism financing, isolates terrorist organizations, deters donations, increases public awareness, and signals concern to other governments. The lack of a designation process for domestic terrorist groups hinders federal efforts to combat the threat and communicate it effectively to agencies and local entities. Federal lawmakers may need to consider formalizing this process for greater oversight and transparency. The lack of a formal process for designating domestic terrorist threats hampers federal efforts to combat the threat effectively. Establishing a transparent process could allow input from various agencies and individuals, but may limit the FBI's flexibility in adapting to evolving threats. A publicly available record of domestic terrorist incidents could aid policymakers in understanding the extent of the threat. The federal government lacks a formal document for tracking domestic terrorism incidents. The National Counterterrorism Center's Worldwide Incidents Tracking System (WITS) used to provide this information from 2004 to early 2012. The absence of a federal record makes it challenging to assess the full scope of domestic terrorism, which can be prosecuted at different levels. The distinction between domestic terrorism and other crimes like tax fraud or hate crimes can be unclear. A comprehensive account of domestic terrorism incidents could enhance prosecutorial strategies. A more detailed accounting of domestic terrorism incidents is needed to assess the full scope and prosecutorial strategies. It is important for federal agencies to release annual statistics on domestic terrorism prosecutions, including individuals and movements involved. Congress should consider requesting a detailed annual report on dismantled plots, investigated attacks, and agencies involved to aid policy makers in oversight and comparison with other forms of violent activity. A detailed public accounting of domestic terrorist activity is crucial for assessing the government's response and allocating federal funding. Unlike efforts against foreign terrorist groups, domestic terrorism is not a priority in the National Intelligence Priorities Framework. This lack of focus hinders the ability to measure and compare different domestic terrorist threats. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is the primary organization for integrating and analyzing all intelligence related to counterterrorism, excluding domestic terrorism. The FBI plays a similar role for domestic terrorism investigations. There is no standardized approach for intelligence collection on domestic terrorism cases, which may be examined by Congress. The FBI's role in collecting and analyzing domestic terrorism information is crucial. Congress should assess if enough resources are allocated for this purpose while safeguarding civil rights. The Obama Administration's strategy for countering radicalization and violent extremism focuses on all potential terrorists, with a key emphasis on violent jihadists. The federal government's national strategy for countering radicalization and violent extremism focuses on all types of potential terrorists, with a key emphasis on violent jihadists. Federal efforts involve cooperation with local groups and a community-based approach. The government acts as a facilitator, convener, and source of information in engaging communities. Congressional inquiry may focus on which domestic terrorists will be targeted and which communities will be engaged in addressing non-jihadist terrorism issues."
