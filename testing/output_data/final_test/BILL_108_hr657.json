    "content": "The \"Emergency Securities Response Act of 2003\" is also known as the Emergency Securities Response Act. It extends the emergency order authority of the Securities Exchange Commission. The Emergency Securities Response Act of 2003 extends the SEC's emergency order authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to take necessary actions in the public interest and for investor protection in emergencies. The SEC's emergency order authority allows for actions to prevent disruption in securities markets or transactions, with orders lasting up to 30 business days and extendable. The SEC's emergency order authority can be extended beyond 30 business days if the Commission determines the emergency still exists and is necessary for public interest and investor protection. Orders cannot exceed 90 calendar days. If involving security futures products, the SEC must consult with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC's emergency order authority allows the Commission to act without complying with certain provisions. It can take action regarding clearing agencies for exempted securities after consulting with the Secretary of the Treasury. Additionally, amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 further define consultation and emergency situations. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include consultation requirements with the Secretary of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before taking certain actions in emergency situations. An emergency is defined as a major market disturbance with sudden and excessive fluctuations in securities prices. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include consultation requirements with relevant authorities before taking actions in emergency situations. An emergency is defined as a major disturbance that threatens fair and orderly markets, disrupts the national system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions, or substantially disrupts the functioning of securities markets or investment companies. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to exclude the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 from the definition of securities laws. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to grant emergency authority to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding government securities. This allows the Secretary to take actions similar to those of the Commission in certain situations. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to grant emergency authority to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding government securities. Attest: JEFF TRANDAHL, Clerk."
