    "content": "The U.S. Constitution prohibits state and local governments from taxing the federal government without clear consent. This protection is based on the Supremacy Clause, which establishes federal laws as supreme. The Supreme Court has recognized that state taxation of the federal government goes against federal supremacy. This immunity applies when the tax burden falls on the U.S. government. The federal government owns about 640 million acres of land in the United States, which is approximately 28% of all land in the country. There is a question of whether the federal government should compensate state and local governments for the tax-exempt status of its lands. State and local governments provide various services and rely on tax payments for funding. In 2008, state and local government expenditures exceeded $2.8 trillion, with state governments focusing on public welfare, higher education, and highways, while local governments emphasized elementary and secondary education, utilities, and public safety. Funding for these services comes from federal funding, fees, and taxes, with property taxes being the largest contributor in 2008. Property taxes are the main source of local government tax revenues, providing 72.3% in 2008. State tax revenues come from individual income taxes (35.6%) and general sales taxes (30.8%). Taxation patterns vary across states, with property taxes being the most significant. General sales taxes and income taxes each contribute nearly 23% of state and local taxes, but their importance varies by state. Some states have no general sales taxes, while others rely heavily on them. State and local taxes in Washington primarily come from general sales taxes. Seven states, including Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming, have no income taxes. Income taxes account for over 40% of state and local taxes in Maryland. Other taxes, such as excise and severance taxes, vary widely among states. Property taxes are crucial for local governments, with rates ranging from 0.40% in Hawaii to 2.57% in Texas. Sales tax rates also vary, with Tennessee having the highest rate at 9.43%. State income tax rates differ across states as well. The average general sales tax rate ranges from 6% to 9%. Seven states have no income taxes, while Hawaii and Oregon have the highest marginal income tax rate at 11%. There is a debate on whether the federal government should compensate state and local governments for the tax-exempt status of federal lands, with two proposed approaches: tax equivalency and cost basis. Private lands owned by nonprofit organizations are also exempt from taxation, raising questions about federal compensation for tax-exempt federal lands. Additional issues include consistency in payments and determining which lands should receive payments. In 1979, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) recommended tax equivalency to replace inconsistent federal land payment programs. A 1999 study by U.S. Forest Service researchers found that federal payments were significantly less than equivalent property taxes overall. In 2010, an independent research group suggested tax equivalency as an option for replacing expiring federal payment programs. The 2010 study suggested tax equivalency as an option for replacing expiring federal payment programs. Total property tax-equivalent payments would increase overall, but two-thirds of counties would receive lower payments. Providing federal tax-equivalent payments to state and local governments faces four major difficulties, including the multiplicity and variability of taxes among jurisdictions. Determining property tax equivalency is complex due to varying tax rates, collections, and valuation methods. The challenge is compounded by different tax approaches for different types of properties. Calculating complete tax equivalency is even more intricate, with the added complication of \"fiscal blood pressure.\" The concept of \"fiscal blood pressure\" in determining tax equivalency involves two variable aspects: tax capacity and tax tolerance among citizens of different states and localities. Citizens vary in their willingness to bear higher taxes for public goods and services, as well as the types of taxes they find fair. States and localities differ in their ability to collect taxes based on personal income and to \"export\" taxes through special situations. States and localities with lower tax capacity may struggle to impose and collect taxes, leading to questions of tax fairness. Estimating tax collections on federal lands if they were privately owned is challenging, especially for income and sales taxes. This is due to uncertainties in private landowner sales and income from the lands. Federal lands often do not closely resemble private lands, with some reserved for their unique and irreplaceable nature. Many federal lands were left over after private investors chose other lands, such as national forests that were available for homesteading. The management of federal lands often focuses on ecological services that private landowners cannot profit from. Assessing federal lands for property tax equivalency is complex and costly due to the vast amount of land owned by the federal government. While some areas may see a modest increase in local tax assessment costs, others, like California, Oregon, Wyoming, Alaska, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada, would face substantial increases. Local tax assessors may have an incentive to overvalue federal lands to boost local payments, creating a potential conflict of interest. The undervaluation of federal lands by tax assessors has been highlighted by the GAO in various reports over the past decade. Some argue that federal payments to state and local governments should be based on the actual costs imposed on or avoided by them due to the presence of federal lands, such as providing public utility services or schooling for federal employees' children. Local governments may benefit from federal lands by avoiding investment costs for infrastructure and services in remote areas. A 1999 Forest Service study found that while there are higher costs for search and rescue, law enforcement, and road maintenance, the overall costs and savings associated with federal lands are generally small. Additionally, local officials noted indirect benefits such as recreational opportunities and watershed protection. The cost approach to payments for federal lands reimburses actual operating and investment costs incurred by state and local governments. It can be implemented through user fees or local agreements on appropriate federal payments for services provided. Apportionment of costs could be based on property acreage in the county. Apportionment for federal lands payments can be based on property acreage, value, population, or other factors. The cost approach faces difficulties as many state and local services benefit everyone or provide special assistance. State and local tax systems reflect decisions on how citizens should pay for social goods and services. State and local governments prioritize consistency and predictability in revenue programs, preferring counter-cyclical revenues during economic downturns. Property taxes tend to be stable, while federal payment programs rely on fixed, annual payments for predictability. Mandatory spending authority ensures payment based on statutory guidance. Mandatory spending authority ensures payments are made based on statutory guidance without further congressional action. However, establishing new programs with mandatory spending authority faces significant hurdles in Congress. New mandatory spending programs require a budget offset to fund guaranteed payments, which poses challenges in finding funding sources and determining the necessary amount. Federal payments to state and local governments also involve deciding which lands to include in the program, with the majority of federal lands administered by various agencies such as the NPS, FWS, BLM, USFS, and DOD. The federal government administers about 19 million acres of land in active and inactive bases, ranges, and other units, with various agencies overseeing additional land. However, including all federal lands in a payment program is complicated due to varying levels of ownership interest and discrepancies in data sets among agencies. The federal government lacks a coordinated system of property records, leading to discrepancies in data on federal lands. This includes issues with the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program and classification of Indian lands. Some Indian lands are exempt from state and local taxation and administered by the DOI Bureau of Indian Affairs as trust lands. The U.S. government established these lands by treaty, leading to debates on who should be responsible for payments from these lands. Congress has created programs to provide funds to state and local governments due to the tax-exempt status of federal lands. Impact aid payments are made to local educational agencies to alleviate financial burdens resulting from federal activities. Impact Aid compensates local educational agencies for the financial burdens caused by federal activities, such as federal ownership of certain lands and the enrollment of children whose parents work or live on federal land. This compensation is provided because these activities prevent LEAs from collecting property or other taxes from these individuals. Impact Aid is a federal program administered by the U.S. Department of Education to compensate local educational agencies for the loss of tax revenue due to federal activities like land ownership. The program, dating back to 1950, provides about $1.3 billion in annual funding and includes payments to LEAs under sections 8002 and 8003 for federal land ownership and enrolling children of military personnel. Section 8003 of Impact Aid provides payments to LEAs for enrolling federally connected children, including those living on federal property with military or foreign military parents, on Indian lands, in low-rent public housing, or with parents working or living on federal land. Payments include basic support for these children and additional support for those with disabilities. Section 8007 offers funds for construction and facilities upgrades to LEAs with high percentages of children from these groups. The Impact Aid payments programs were created before federal income taxes and were funded by selling or leasing federal resources. These receipt-based payment programs had mandatory spending authority and varied in payments to state and local governments from federal lands and resources. Some federal lands provide no payments, while others receive a portion of gross or net receipts. The payment shares under 13 receipt-sharing programs vary widely, ranging from 4% to 90%. Payments are made to states, counties, or other recipients, with some being geographically narrow and others broad. All payments have mandatory spending authority. The USFS and BLM payment programs historically accounted for the majority of receipt-based payments, with USFS payments being 25% of gross receipts to states for roads and schools, and BLM payments being 50% of gross receipts to counties for O&C lands in western Oregon. USFS payments exceeded $300 million annually, while O&C payments were over $100 million annually, both largely based on timber. The O&C payments, exceeding $100 million annually, were largely based on timber receipts. Due to declining timber harvests since 1990, these programs have been temporarily replaced by the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. With the expiration of this legislation in FY2011, the historic receipt-sharing programs will resume, but with lower payments in many areas. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, enacted in 1976, is the only payment program solely based on federal acreage. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, enacted in 1976, specifies fixed payments per acre for eligible lands, adjusted annually for inflation. It includes a complex formula to reduce payments in certain counties and requires annual appropriations. Amendments in 1994 adjusted the authorized payments for 18 years. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program was amended in 1994 to adjust payments for inflation and future indexing. From FY1995 to FY2007, appropriations were lower than authorized levels. Mandatory spending authority of 100% for PILT was enacted for FY2008-FY2012, increasing payments by over $100 million in FY2008. Without extension, future PILT payments will rely on annual appropriations. Additional payment programs exist for specific federal lands. The Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) lands in Oregon were granted in 1869 for a military wagon road. Congress terminated litigation in 1919, reconveying the lands to federal ownership. These lands are often grouped with O&C lands but have a separate payment program established in 1939. The 1939 act established a separate payment program for the CBWR lands, similar to the O&C payments. Counties receive up to 50% of receipts as county tax bills. In 1948, Congress enacted the Thye-Blatnik Act to acquire private lands within the Superior National Forest for wilderness protection. Congress enacted the Thye-Blatnik Act to authorize the acquisition of private lands within the Superior National Forest for wilderness protection. The act led to concerns about USFS payments to states for county roads and schools, with a provision included to pay counties 0.75% of appraised land value based on local tax rates. Payment programs like the National Wildlife Refuge Fund and Secure Rural Schools Act combine different payment bases for calculating payments. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund (NWRF) pays counties for acquired refuge lands based on three alternative payment approaches: 25% of net receipts, $0.75 per acre of FWS land, or 0.75% of the fair market value of the land. NWRF has mandatory spending authority and annual appropriations to supplement payments. Receipts plus appropriations have decreased from 58% to 22% of the total payment since 2000. The Secure Rural Schools Act was a temporary payment program for USFS national forests and O&C lands. Counties receiving payments greater than $100,000 were required to use 15%-20% of the payments for projects on federal lands, rather than for roads and schools (national forests) or for county purposes (O&C lands). Additional funds were authorized for counties to use for specified purposes. The optional payments were reauthorized in 2008 for four years, calculated using a complex formula based on historic payments and national forest and O&C land acreage. The Secure Rural Schools Act included optional transition payments for eight states and expired after the last payments in FY2011. Comparing federal payment programs to state and local taxation is challenging, with debates on tax equivalency or cost recovery. Various federal payment programs were enacted by different congressional committees. The plethora of federal payment programs enacted by various congressional committees has led to confusion, inconsistency, and inequality among recipients. Some counties have been compensated at levels greater than private taxation, while others have received less. The perpetuation of these inequitable programs is likely due to differences in committees of jurisdiction. The perpetuation of numerous federal payment programs is due to shifts in leadership and membership of committees, as well as mandatory spending authority for many programs. This inertia leads to ongoing payments without Congress needing to take additional action. The comparison between federal payment programs and state/local taxation is complicated due to the variety of taxes used by state and local governments, including income, sales, property, excise, and severance taxes. Different states have different tax approaches, with varying tax rates and reliance on property taxes. Citizens' willingness to tax themselves also varies among states and localities. The Impact Aid program pays local educational agencies for students associated with tax-exempt lands, but it is unclear if the payments approximate the tax payments that would have been obtained if the lands were taxable. The uncertainties in federal payment programs reflect the wide variation in property tax rates and differences in local educational costs per pupil. Revenue-sharing payments to state and local governments are similar to severance or yield taxes, but vary widely in rates. These payments fund county-provided services and can be based on acreage or appraised land value. PILT payments, based on acreage, have no parallel in state and local taxes. PILT payments are reduced by revenue-sharing payments, similar to the effect of severance or yield tax payments on property taxes. The federal payment programs, including the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS) Program and the Payments In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Program, provide annual payments to counties based on appraised land values. The mandatory spending authority for these programs expires in FY2011 and FY2012. Congress is debating their reauthorization and considering fair compensation for state and local governments for the tax-exempt status of federal lands. Property taxes are based on the value of assets and are intended to reflect the property owner's benefit from government services. The market value of property is defined as the highest price in a competitive market. In assessing property values, a competitive market is essential, with buyers and sellers acting prudently. Market value can be determined through recent transactions or valuation methods like replacement cost, sales comparison, or income approach. Different rates apply to land and structures in property assessments by local governments. Property taxes vary among jurisdictions, with different rates for land, structures, residential, and commercial properties. Farmland is typically valued based on current agricultural use. Property taxes are more significant for local governments, accounting for $397 billion (72.3%) of local tax collections in 2008. The wide variation in property tax collection is due to multiple base definitions, rates, exemptions, administration, assessment practices, and state-specific constraints. This results in significant differences in average property tax rates. Table 2 displays the average property tax rates ranging from 0.4% in Hawaii to 2.57% in Texas. Sales and use taxes are collected on products sold, with state and local sales tax rates varying from 4.35% in Hawaii to 9.43% in Tennessee. Some items are exempt from sales tax, complicating discussions on taxation. State and local tax collections in 2008 totaled $241 billion for state governments and $63 billion for local governments. Mail-order, catalog, and internet sales pose challenges for collecting sales taxes. Use taxes are collected based on where products will be used, not where they are purchased. Income taxes are collected based on where income is earned, with some states having reciprocal agreements. In 2011, 44 states and the District of Columbia levied income taxes, with varying rates. Individual and corporate income taxes made up a significant portion of state tax collections in FY2008. Other state and local taxes accounted for 23.4% of all state and local tax collections. Excise taxes, including \"sin taxes\" and \"sumptuary taxes,\" are significant state and local taxes, accounting for 23.4% of all tax collections. They are imposed on products like gasoline, tobacco, alcohol, hotel accommodations, and restaurant meals. These taxes can also be used to generate revenue for specific purposes, such as maintaining roads and highways. Rates vary widely among states. In 2010, excise tax rates varied widely among states, with cigarette taxes ranging from $0.07 to $3.46 per pack and gasoline taxes from 8\u00a2 to 46.6\u00a2 per gallon. Sales of motor fuel, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco products accounted for $58 billion of state tax collections in 2008. Severance taxes are state taxes based on natural resource extraction, primarily on minerals, oil, gas, coal, and timber. Severance taxes are significant in resource-rich states like Alaska, Wyoming, and Texas, accounting for a large portion of state tax collections. Charges and fees also play a crucial role in funding state and local governments, providing over 30% of their revenues in 2008. Charges and fees, covering a variety of goods and services, contribute 30% of state and local revenues. Federal payments to state and local governments are diverse, including programs related to federal lands and resources. The Impact Aid program compensates local educational agencies for the financial burden of tax-exempt federal land ownership and certain enrollments. Administered by the U.S. Department of Education, it offers various payments to LEAs under Title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The Impact Aid program compensates local educational agencies for tax-exempt federal land ownership and enrollments. Payments are made under Section 8002, Section 8003(b), Section 8003(d), and Section 8007, with the majority going to LEAs through Section 8003(b). Section 8002 compensates LEAs for federal property ownership acquired after 1938. Section 8003 compensates LEAs for enrolling \"federally connected\" children, including those living on federal property, Indian lands, low-rent public housing, or with parents working on federal land. Payments are used for general operating expenses like teacher salaries and supplies. Two types of payments are made under Section 8003: basic support payments for federally connected children and payments for federally connected children with disabilities. Under Section 8003, LEAs receive payments for enrolling federally connected children, with funds not limited to specific uses. Additional payments are authorized for children with disabilities. Accountability requirements for fund usage are minimal. Payments under Section 8003(d) of IDEA are limited to eligible children with disabilities whose parents are in the Armed Forces or live on Indian lands. LEAs must use these funds to provide a free appropriate public education to these children. Section 8007 provides funds for construction and facilities upgrades for LEAs with high percentages of children from these backgrounds. 40% of the funds under Section 8007 are used for construction payments by formula. 40% of Section 8007 funds are allocated for construction payments to LEAs with high percentages of students from Indian land or military backgrounds. The remaining 60% is used for school facility emergency and modernization grants, with emergency grants prioritized for health and safety repairs. Emergency grants are prioritized over modernization grants in the grant competition. Federal payments to state and local governments from federal receipts vary widely, with rates ranging from 4% to 90%. Some federal lands provide no receipt-based payments, such as National Park System lands and hardrock/locatable minerals. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, enacted in 1976, administers payments per acre of eligible federal lands based on a complex formula. These payments do not cover all federal lands and are subject to a population-based ceiling on total payments to a county. The definition of \"entitlement\" lands under 31 U.S.C. \u00a76901(1) includes federal lands in various categories such as National Park System, National Forest System, lands administered by the BLM, lands dedicated to water resource development projects, semi-active or inactive installations for mobilization, dredge disposal areas, and specific locations like Purgatory River Canyon and Pin\u0303on Canyon, CO. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program provides funding for federal lands such as National Park System, National Forest System, and lands administered by the BLM. Lands eligible for PILT payments include those acquired by the U.S. Government to expand military installations, reserve areas, and lands acquired under specific acts. Lands not eligible for PILT payments include acquired lands in the National Wildlife Refuge System, active military installations, and lands administered by other agencies. The PILT Program, authorized by Congress in 2008 for five years, will require annual appropriations after FY2012. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 was reauthorized in 2008, providing optional payments based on a complex formula. The PILT Program, authorized by Congress in 2008 for five years, will require annual appropriations after FY2012. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 was reauthorized in 2008, providing optional payments based on a complex formula. Calculate average payments, proportion in each county, USFS and O&C lands proportion, base share, and income adjustment for eligible counties. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 was reauthorized in 2008, providing optional payments based on a complex formula. Counties could choose payments under the historic USFS 25% payments to states or O&C 50% payments to counties. The reauthorization included a total (\"full funding\") payment, declining by 10% annually over four years (FY2008-FY2011), to be allocated among the counties opting for the SRS payments under the formula. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 was reauthorized in 2008, providing optional payments based on a complex formula. Counties in eight states could receive a transition payment for the first three years of the reauthorization. The payments under this program expired at the end of FY2011, and unless the SRS Act is reauthorized, USFS payments will revert to 25% of gross receipts for FY2012 and beyond."
