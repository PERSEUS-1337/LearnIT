    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE. The \"Federally Impacted School Improvement Act\" recognizes Congress's obligation to provide school construction funding for local educational agencies impacted by Federal activities. The deteriorating conditions of these school facilities compromise the health and safety of children, leading to severe overcrowding and inadequate learning environments. Local educational agencies in areas with significant Federal presence lack the capacity to raise funds for school construction due to Federal land being nontaxable. The need for Federal support to modernize school facilities for federally connected agencies is greater in 2000 than since 1950. These agencies and communities are willing to contribute resources but struggle due to the nontaxable status of Federal land. The purpose of this Act is to provide matching grants to local educational agencies for urgently needed modernization of school facilities due to disrepair and increased enrollment. Congress needs to renew its obligation to assist federally connected local educational agencies with their facility needs.

The Secretary of Defense receives 45 percent of funds to award grants to local educational agencies meeting certain criteria, and 10 percent is used for grants under section 8. The Secretary of Education provides funds to the Secretary of Defense for grants through the Office of Economic Adjustment.

SEC. 6. BASIC GRANTS. The Secretary awards grants to local educational agencies based on specific criteria, including the percentage of nontaxable property or number of children in the district, and the agency's fiscal capacity. The local educational agency's fiscal capacity to undertake modernization projects without Federal assistance is evaluated based on the threat to student safety, ADA requirements, costs like asbestos removal and energy conservation, and overcrowding conditions. Additionally, the facility needs of the agency are considered. The Secretary determines grant amounts for modernization projects based on factors like relative costs, local prevailing costs, and limiting the Federal share to 50% of the total cost.
