    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce, and Telecommunications Act\" or the \"FASTNET Act.\" The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. It recognized the unique position of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, enabling them to accelerate the deployment of services in less populated regions. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will enable them to deploy advanced services and competitive initiatives in less populated regions of the Nation, benefiting consumers. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in the telecommunications industry for the benefit of consumers nationwide. It reduces regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to redirect resources towards increasing investment in initiatives. The Communications Act of 1934 defines a 'two percent carrier' as a local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers, reducing their regulatory requirements to promote investment in initiatives. The Commission must consider differences when applying rules to incumbent local exchange carriers, providing separate and less burdensome requirements for two percent carriers due to their limited resources. If a rule is adopted without such considerations, two percent carriers can seek waivers or reconsideration. According to the Commission's rules, enforcement will not be applied to carriers unless less burdensome requirements are adopted. No additional regulations are required for two percent carriers, and no extra regulations are needed for commercial mobile radio service. Differentiation based on carrier size is allowed, and these provisions are effective immediately. The provisions of this section shall apply to any rule adopted on or after the date of enactment. SEC. 282 states that the Commission will not require a two percent carrier to submit cost allocation manuals or Automated Reporting and Management Information Systems (ARMIS). SEC. 283 addresses the integrated operation of two percent carriers. SEC. 283 prohibits the Commission from regulating to hinder a two percent carrier's ability to integrate its operations across various services. It includes common carrier and noncommon carrier services, without mandating separate operations for different services. SEC. 284 allows a two percent carrier to participate in tariff pools and price cap regulation for specific study areas without being obligated to do so for others. SEC. 285 pertains to the review of mergers. SEC. 285 states that the Commission cannot interfere with mergers between two percent carriers if the resulting entity remains a two percent carrier. Two percent carriers can introduce new interstate telecommunications services by filing a tariff on one day's notice without needing approval from the Commission. The Commission does not have authority to approve or disapprove the rate structure for such services. Additionally, competing carriers are allowed to enter the market. Two percent carriers can deaverage their interstate rates, file tariffs with one day's notice, and deregulate their rates upon certification of competition in their service area. The Commission cannot regulate rates for interstate services provided by two percent carriers upon certification of competition by a local exchange carrier. Two percent carriers meeting certain requirements can participate in the common line tariff by including their study areas. Facilities-based entry in the service area involves providing local telephone exchange switching capability and service to at least one unaffiliated customer. The term 'resale-based entry' refers to providing telecommunications service using resale within the service area of a two percent carrier. The term 'contract-based tariff' is a tariff based on a service contract between a two percent carrier and one or more customers, including contract terms, service descriptions, volume commitments, and prices. The curr_chunk discusses the details required in a contract-based tariff, including service commitments, volume discounts, and regulations affecting the contract rate. The term 'service area' is defined as in section 214(e)(5). SEC. 288. SAVINGS PROVISION: Preserves rights of rural telephone companies under existing rules and standards. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON MERGER REVIEW. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 sets a deadline of 45 days for the Commission to make a public interest determination for mergers involving two percent carriers. If no action is taken within the specified period, the application is deemed approved. The Communications Act of 1934 amendment establishes a 45-day deadline for the Commission to decide on mergers involving two percent carriers. If no action is taken within this period, the application is automatically approved without conditions. This provision applies to applications submitted after the Act's enactment date, treating pending applications as if they were filed on that date. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions for reconsideration or waiver within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in the relief sought being deemed granted. The new amendment requires the Commission to issue a final order on petitions for reconsideration or waiver within 90 days. Any pending petitions will be subject to these new requirements."
