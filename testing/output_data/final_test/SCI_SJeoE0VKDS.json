    "content": "The new approach for efficient exploration leverages a low-dimensional encoding of the environment using intrinsic rewards based on nearest neighbors in representational space for sample-efficient exploration with planning routines. Our approach focuses on performing more gradient steps between environment steps to improve model accuracy. Testing on maze tasks and a control problem shows our exploration method is more sample-efficient. Efficient exploration in Reinforcement Learning involves gathering informative experiences through intrinsic rewards incentivizing state space exploration. Novelty heuristics, like count-based or prediction-error rewards, aid in this process. In this work, a method of sample-efficient exploration is proposed by leveraging novelty heuristics in a meaningful abstract state space. A low-dimensional abstract representation of states is learned by fitting model-based and model-free components, ensuring that states close temporally in dynamics are brought together in the representation space. Additional constraints are added to make the distance between states meaningful, facilitating efficient exploration in Reinforcement Learning. In this work, a novelty heuristic inspired by the Novelty Search algorithm is used to generate intrinsic rewards for efficient exploration in Reinforcement Learning. By ensuring a good low-dimensional representation of states, the policy based on planning with the novelty heuristic explores with high sample-efficiency. The training scheme involves more gradient steps between environment steps to maintain model accuracy and learn a meaningful state space representation efficiently. The agent interacts with its environment in discrete time steps using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with state space S, initial state distribution S0, action space A, transition function \u03c4, reward function R, and discount factor G. The agent selects actions based on policy \u03c0, receives rewards, and discount factors, with the objective being efficient exploration in Reinforcement Learning. In Reinforcement Learning, the objective is to maximize future rewards by exploring the environment efficiently. This paper focuses on exploration tasks with sparse rewards and strategies to explore the state space in as few steps as possible. It involves learning a lower-dimensional representation of high-dimensional states using an encoder parameterized by \u03b8\u00ea. The dynamics in reinforcement learning are learned through functions like transition, reward, and discount factor. An off-policy learning algorithm samples transition tuples from a replay buffer. The Q-function is learned using the DDQN algorithm, minimizing a specific loss function. The encoder's weights are jointly learned with the dynamics of the environment. The abstract representation in reinforcement learning is shaped by jointly learning the encoder weights and different components according to the environment's dynamics. Soft constraints on entropy and distance between consecutive states are added to prevent collapse of abstract representations.

Soft constraints on entropy and distance between consecutive states are added to prevent collapse of abstract representations. The hyperparameter \u03c9 estimates the accuracy of transition loss for novelty estimates. A function of \u03c9 and transition loss sets a cutoff point for accuracy to determine when to take the next environment step. The slack ratio \u03b4 is used to ensure transitions are within a certain radius of the target state before taking a new step. Gradient descent with learning rate \u03b1 is used to minimize all losses, allowing the agent to learn effectively. The agent learns a low-dimensional representation of the environment through losses in gradient descent with learning rate \u03b1. Planning techniques combine model knowledge and value function to maximize intrinsic rewards. Rollout estimates of next states are calculated based on the transition model\u03c4, with expected returns from discounted rewards of d-depth rollouts. Our approach focuses on estimating optimal actions using discounted rewards from d-depth rollouts. We simulate b-best options at each step based on Q-values and use a sum of these values up to depth D. The agent follows an \u03b5-greedy strategy, balancing between estimated optimal actions and random choices. Our method incorporates intrinsic motivation inspired by Novelty Search algorithm, rewarding interesting experiences. In high-dimensional spaces, proximity concepts are vague, leading to an ill-defined nearest neighbor problem. Instead of measuring novelty in pixel space, we adopt a different approach. To calculate novelty in abstract representations, a weighted version of the novelty measure is applied to the current state using an encoder. The novelty measure considers the distance between the current state and its k nearest neighbors in abstract space, weighted by their ranking based on distances. This compensates for biases towards state-action pairs with fewer direct neighbors. The algorithm described in Algorithm 1 focuses on the Novelty Search in abstract representational space. It involves initializing a transition buffer and agent policy, sampling initial random transitions, updating dynamics model and Q-function, and conducting experiments on environments of varying difficulty. In experiments on environments of varying difficulty, the agent's state representation is trained using optimized losses before each environment step. Two 21x21 grid-world versions are considered: an open labyrinth with no walls except for borders, and a grid-world split into four connected rooms. The goal is to explore without rewards or terminal states, with metrics measuring the ratio of states visited only once and the proportion of total states visited. In open labyrinth experiments, variations of a policy outperform random and count-based baselines. The agent reaches 100% of possible states in 700 steps and 80% in less than 400 steps, including initial random steps. Highly interpretable abstract representations are learned in few environment steps. In open labyrinth experiments, variations of a policy outperform random and count-based baselines by reaching 100% of possible states in 700 steps and 80% in less than 400 steps. Highly interpretable abstract representations are learned in few environment steps, with the agent able to disentangle states with and without keys in a 3-dimensional representation. The encoder compresses high-dimensional input to a low-dimensional representation, creating an interpretable representation of the environment. The representation in the labyrinth environment incorporates primary features like the agent's position in 2-dimensions. Secondary features, such as agent surroundings, are learned through the transition function. The dynamics model tends to over-generalize for walls between rooms, leading the agent to visit all reachable states within known rooms uniformly. The -greedy policy ensures exploration of passageways. Our approach ensures exploration of passageways in the labyrinth environment, even when the agent has over-generalized to surrounding walls. Experiments show our method outperforms random and count-based baselines, with the agent uniformly exploring its state space after visiting most unseen states. Testing on harder dynamics environments like Acrobot and a multi-step maze, our method with planning depth d = 5 is compared to strong exploration baselines. In experiments, the approach outperforms random and count-based baselines, using the same model architectures and model-free methods for consistency. The method is tested on Acrobot with a continuous state space, utilizing less samples compared to most model-free RL algorithms within the same episode. Multiple training iterations are run between each environment step for a fair comparison with baselines. The approach is tested on Acrobot, a control task with a continuous state space. Each episode is limited to 3000 environment steps, with the agent receiving rewards of -1 until it reaches the goal state. Performance is measured by the average number of steps taken to move the second joint above a specified line. The method demonstrates learning a low-dimensional abstract representation from pixel inputs using 4 consecutive frames.

Results show efficient goal state reaching in experiments with a maze environment. The environment includes a sub-goal of picking up a key before reaching the final reward. Intrinsic rewards are focused on, ignoring extrinsic rewards. The environment is built using the Pycolab game engine. The agent learns an interpretable representation of the environment using intrinsic rewards and a -greedy policy. It efficiently explores the state space, guided by past interactions, reaching the end goal in fewer steps compared to baselines. Inspired by the Novelty Search algorithm, the exploration strategy leverages a nearest-neighbor scoring function in behavior space. In Bellemare et al. (2016) and Ostrovski et al. (2017), exploration strategies using model-free algorithms incorporate novelty through a pseudocount from a density model. Hester and Stone (2012) and Haber et al. (2018) optimize models of the environment and predict uncertainty. Burda et al. (2018a) uses intrinsic rewards based on uncertainty in dynamics models for exploration. Savinov et al. (2018) mention seeking actions challenging the agent's knowledge of the environment. Shyam et al. (2018) utilize multiple forward models for exploration. In this paper, an interpretable abstract representation of states is used to create a novelty metric that serves as an intrinsic reward for efficient exploration. The method combines model-based and model-free approaches for planning, showing efficiency in multiple environments. However, limitations exist, such as the reduced effectiveness of the novelty metric in high-dimensional spaces despite efforts to address this issue. The novelty metric may lose effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces. Exploration benefits from meaningful abstractions and internal models, but over-generalization can lead to loss of crucial information. Future work could focus on incorporating secondary features. A local constraint is used for representation magnitude, suited for the novelty metric. Intrinsic reward calculation requires consistent distance between states as history grows. In the context of exploration and intrinsic rewards, a global constraint on representation magnitude can affect an agent's motivation to explore further as the number of states in its history increases. The novelty metric, while effective in some cases, may have limitations in high-dimensional spaces. The bias towards states with fewer direct neighbors can impact the calculation of novelty in predicted states. The bias towards states with fewer direct neighbors affects the novelty metric in high-dimensional spaces. Entropy maximization loss ensures maximal distance between random states, while consecutive distance loss minimizes distance between consecutive states. The combination of these losses shapes the state space for leveraging distance measures. In high-dimensional spaces, the novelty metric is influenced by a bias towards states with fewer direct neighbors. The novelty heuristic score for each state is determined using a distance measure, with a batch size of 64 and 64 random steps taken before training. The discount factor is set at 0.8 for all experiments, with a freeze interval for target parameters at 1000. The discount factor is low due to non-stationary intrinsic rewards. Hyperparameters for model-based training are constant. Novelty metric experiments use k = 5 for k-NN calculations. Neural network architectures include Dense and Conv2D layers trained with RMSProp optimizer. The encoder architecture consists of Dense layers with tanh activation. In the context of neural network architectures, the model uses Dense and Conv2D layers with tanh activation. The Bootstrap DQN implementation includes 10 separate heads for actions. Hyperparameters for the labyrinth environments include n iters = 30000 and \u03b1 = 0.00025. In the Acrobot environment, the agent's input consists of 4 stacked consecutive values. In the Acrobot environment, the agent's input is 4 stacked consecutive pixel frames reduced to 32x32 pixels. The abstract representation dimension is 4, with a learning rate of \u03b1 = 0.00025. Training is done for n iters = 30000 for model-free experiments and n iters = 50000 for experiments with model-based components. In the multistep maze environment, the input is a single 15x15 frame. The abstract representation dimension is 3, with a learning rate of \u03b1 = 0.00025 for model-free algorithms and \u03b1 = 0.000025 for experiments with model-based components. In an ablation study, unweighted and weighted nearest neighbor heuristics were compared in open and 4-room labyrinths. The weighted approach slightly improves bias towards fewer-neighbor states."
