    "content": "The report provides information and analysis on Afghanistan and the U.S. project there, covering topics such as military engagement, regional context, reconciliation efforts, Afghan politics, foreign assistance, and social and economic development. It includes a historical timeline and background on the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Lawmakers can use this information to consider budget requests, oversee military operations and aid programs, and examine the U.S. role in South Asia and the world. The U.S. and Afghan governments, along with partner countries, are engaged in combat with a robust Taliban-led insurgency. Insurgents are in control of or contesting more territory today than at any time since 2001. The conflict also involves other armed groups, including active affiliates of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. NATO-led mission \"Resolute Support Mission\" focuses on training Afghan forces, while U.S. counterterrorism forces operate under Operation Freedom's Sentinel. The United States is engaged in combat with a Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan, with NATO focusing on training Afghan forces. Diplomatic efforts are underway to end the war, including direct talks with Taliban representatives. Negotiations involve a draft framework where the Taliban would prohibit terrorist groups in exchange for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces. Concerns exist that the U.S. may prioritize military withdrawal over a political settlement that preserves gains made since 2001. The Afghan government faces challenges in politics, security, and corruption despite progress in reducing corruption and implementing budgetary commitments. The United States has provided significant reconstruction aid to Afghanistan, but stability remains elusive. Some hope that the country's natural resources and strategic location could improve its prospects for the future. The United States faced terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, by Al Qaeda based in Afghanistan. President George W. Bush sought a friendly regime in Kabul to combat terrorism, leading to the authorization of military force by Congress. Afghanistan's economic and political future remains uncertain despite its strategic resources and geographic position. The authorization of military force was granted by Congress after the September 11 attacks, allowing the President to use necessary force against those responsible. The United Nations also expressed readiness to respond to the attacks, leading to military operations against the Taliban when they refused to extradite Osama bin Laden. Military operations in Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001, with the launch of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) to disrupt the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. U.S. air strikes, supported by special operations forces and CIA operatives, targeted Taliban positions to assist Afghan forces, including the Northern Alliance. Marines were deployed to pressure the Taliban in Kandahar, but there were few direct battles. Northern Alliance forces entered Kabul despite initial promises not to do so. The Taliban regime in Afghanistan ended on December 9, 2001, when Taliban leaders fled Kandahar. A provisional government was established, and U.S. officials declared an end to major combat on May 1, 2003. From 2003 to mid-2006, U.S. and international troops trained Afghan forces and fought insurgent violence mainly in the south and east. By late 2005, NATO took over security responsibility in Afghanistan. NATO assumed security responsibility in all of Afghanistan during 2005-2006, but violence increased in mid-2006. Despite NATO-led operations clearing some areas of Taliban fighters from 2006-2008, subsequent reinfiltration occurred. The United States and partners increased force levels due to deteriorating security. The Obama Administration prioritized the Afghanistan mission but planned to eventually reduce U.S. efforts. In response to a review by Richard Holbrooke and Michele Flournoy, President Obama announced a strategy in 2009 requiring 21,000 additional U.S. forces in Afghanistan. General McChrystal became the top U.S. and NATO commander, recommending a population-focused approach over combatting Taliban fighters. He suggested the need for 44,000 more troops for success, sparking debate within the Administration. President Obama announced a troop surge in 2009, sending 30,000 additional U.S. forces to Afghanistan to reverse the Taliban's momentum. This decision sparked debate within the Administration about the potential risks of increased U.S. occupation. The surge brought U.S. force levels to 100,000, with most of the additional forces deployed to the south. The Taliban's control over districts and the appointment of \"shadow governors\" were key concerns at the time. The Taliban had named \"shadow governors\" in 33 out of 34 of Afghanistan's provinces. Operations by U.S., NATO, and Afghan forces in 2010 and 2011 reduced Taliban control. President Obama announced a decrease in U.S. force levels from 100,000 to 90,000 by the end of 2011, and to 68,000 by September 2012. By February 2014, U.S. force levels dropped to 34,000. Most partner countries followed a similar drawdown pattern. In 2010-2012, the Netherlands, Canada, and France ended combat missions in Afghanistan but continued training Afghan forces until 2014. NATO and Afghanistan announced Afghan forces taking the lead on security in 2013. President Obama announced a post-2014 plan with a U.S. military contingent of 9,800 in 2015 for training in the NATO-led \"Resolute Support Mission.\" The U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would decline to about 5,000 by the end of 2016, consolidating in Kabul and at Bagram Airfield. After 2016, around 1,000 military personnel would remain under U.S. Embassy authority to protect installations, process Foreign Military Sales, and train Afghan forces on weaponry. In 2014, preparations were made for the end of the ISAF mission, with reduced U.S. airpower, turnover of bases to Afghan forces, and transition of provincial reconstruction teams to Afghan institutions. Hamid Karzai signed an Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between Afghanistan and the United States, focusing on Afghan control over detention centers and nighttime raids by U.S. forces. The agreement designated Afghanistan as a Major Non-NATO Ally and led to negotiations for a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA). The BSA was approved by a loya jirga in 2013 but signed by President Ashraf Ghani in 2014, governing U.S. presence in Afghanistan until 2024 without congressional approval. The Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) governs the United States' post-2014 presence in Afghanistan through 2024 and beyond, allowing for U.S. military mission parameters, access to Afghan bases, and jurisdiction over U.S. persons in Afghanistan. It does not commit the U.S. to defend Afghanistan from external aggression. Some Afghan figures, including Karzai, advocate revising the BSA, but lack support. The NATO-led ISAF ended in 2014, replaced by Resolute Support Mission (RSM) in 2015 based on a Status of Forces Agreement. U.S. forces continued combat operations in support of Afghan forces. Concerns about Taliban gains led to changes in the U.S. mission in the final years of the Obama Administration, with forces remaining at about 9,800 in 2015. In 2015, U.S. forces remained at a level of about 9,800 instead of being reduced to 5,500 as originally planned. In January 2016, the Obama Administration authorized attacks on the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan. President Obama also allowed preemptive combat in June 2016. U.S. forces were enabled to anticipate battlefield dynamics and deploy together with Afghan forces to prevent deteriorating situations. By the end of 2016, U.S. force levels were adjusted to 8,400. The NATO summit in Warsaw announced continued support for RSM beyond 2016. President Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia in 2017 did not specify troop numbers or military plans, drawing mixed reactions. President Trump's strategy for Afghanistan in 2017 included options like full withdrawal of U.S. forces or increased use of contractors. The strategy also granted broader authority for U.S. forces to target various aspects of the Taliban, including drug labs. Operations against these labs aimed to disrupt a key revenue source for the Taliban, but their impact has been questioned. The complex web of militant groups in Afghanistan, including the Taliban, Islamic State, and Al Qaeda, operate in a landscape of instability and weak government control. Despite heavy casualties, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have performed well, but the Taliban retains the ability to contest territory and launch high-profile attacks. Taliban militants briefly overran provincial capitals in Farah and Ghazni in 2018, with hundreds dead in the assault on Ghazni. The Taliban assault on Ghazni was described as a failure by Defense Secretary James Mattis, as they were unable to hold the city. Despite U.S. military officials stating the conflict is stalemated, Taliban control and influence in Afghanistan has generally grown since 2016. SIGAR began assessing Taliban control and influence at the district level in 2015, showing a gradual increase in territory and population. The U.S. military has stopped producing district-level stability assessments in Afghanistan, citing limited decision-making value. The Taliban's tactical capabilities are growing, leading to high casualties among Afghan forces, prompting the Trump Administration to urge withdrawal from isolated outposts. ANDSF fatalities have been averaging 30-40 a day. Reports indicate that Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have suffered significant casualties, with an average of 30-40 fatalities per day in recent months. Insider attacks on U.S. and coalition forces by Afghan nationals, known as \"green on blue\" attacks, remain a sporadic but persistent issue. In October 2018, a Taliban infiltrator attacked the Kandahar governor's compound, resulting in casualties including the police chief Abdul Raziq. The death of Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in a U.S. drone strike in May 2016 highlighted Taliban vulnerabilities to U.S. intelligence and combat capabilities. The Haqqani Network, a semiautonomous wing of the Afghan Taliban, poses a significant threat to U.S. and allied forces. Founded by Jalaluddin Haqqani, the group's operations were taken over by his son Sirajuddin, who plays a key role in setting insurgency strategy. The death of Mullah Mansour in 2016 showed Taliban vulnerabilities to U.S. capabilities. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and later by his son Sirajuddin, became increasingly influential in insurgency strategy. Jalaluddin's death was announced in 2018. The network is responsible for major attacks, including a 2017 bombing in Kabul that killed over 150 people. It has targeted Indian interests in Afghanistan, leading some to believe it acts as a tool of Pakistani foreign policy. Reports suggest it is closely linked to Pakistan's ISI. The Haqqani Network, closely linked to Pakistan's ISI, holds captive two professors and a journalist. Its participation in a political settlement may be complicated by its designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. U.S. operations also target the Islamic State-Khorasan Province. The Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP), also known as ISIS-K, has been active in Afghanistan since mid-2014 and was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department in 2016. The group's presence in Afghanistan grew from various Taliban factions affiliating with ISKP, with estimates of 1,000 to 3,000 fighters. U.S. commanders have had authorization since 2015 to combat ISKP. Since 2015, U.S. commanders have been authorized to combat ISKP fighters affiliated with the Islamic State in Afghanistan, regardless of immediate threat. Several ISKP leaders have been targeted and killed, including Hafiz Saeed Khan, Abdul Hasib, and Abu Sayed. ISKP remains a significant factor in U.S. and Afghan strategic planning, surviving leadership losses. The group was hit with a GBU-43 bomb in April 2017, marking its first combat use. U.S. military and CIA personnel have been casualties in anti-ISKP operations, while conflicts with Taliban forces have occurred over territory and ideological differences. In April 2018, a U.S. air strike killed the ISKP leader in northern Afghanistan, Qari Hekmatullah. ISKP has claimed responsibility for large-scale attacks targeting Afghanistan's Shia minority and has ambitions beyond Afghanistan, with concerns of potential attacks in the U.S. or Europe. Despite being a minor player on the Afghan battlefield, ISKP remains a significant factor in U.S. and Afghan strategic planning. The relationship between Al Qaeda and the Taliban has important implications for U.S.-Taliban negotiations and a potential settlement. Al Qaeda's presence in Afghanistan was initially minimal but was later found to be stronger than previously understood, with estimates of 100-300 fighters. The United Nations reports that Al Qaeda remains active in the region. Al Qaeda, while degraded in Afghanistan, remains a longer-term threat. U.S. efforts focus on finding senior leaders like Ayman al-Zawahiri. Successful strikes on Al Qaeda operatives have occurred in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Al Qaeda is allied with the Taliban, seeing Afghanistan as a safe haven for its leadership. Al Qaeda views Afghanistan as a safe haven due to its ties with the Taliban, complicating U.S. demands for the Taliban to renounce terrorism. Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) is an affiliate based in South and Central Asia, designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the State Department in 2016. The U.S. military attributed a large terrorist training camp in Kandahar in 2015 to AQIS, a designated global terrorist group. The NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan aims to train and assist the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in their fight against the Taliban and other armed groups. The U.S. has provided about $4.5 billion of the estimated $6 billion annual funding for the ANDSF, with partners pledging an additional $1 billion annually at the 2016 NATO summit. Afghanistan has pledged $500 million towards the ANDSF despite budgetary challenges, with a goal for full financial responsibility by 2024. The Department of Defense, SIGAR, and others have reported deficiencies in the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), including absenteeism, high casualties, illiteracy, inconsistent leadership, and logistical deficits. There are also allegations of human rights abuses within the ANDSF. Some metrics related to ANDSF performance have been classified, such as casualty rates and personnel strength. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have faced challenges such as high casualties and inadequate capabilities. Reports show that casualties have been high, with President Ghani mentioning over 45,000 security personnel killed since 2014. To address this, Afghan forces are consolidating checkpoints to larger bases for better security. The Afghan National Army (ANA) has been built from scratch since 2002. The Afghan National Army (ANA) was established in 2002 and is not a continuation of the previous national army. It currently has about 190,000 personnel, with a special operations component called the Afghan Special Security Forces (ASSF) numbering nearly 21,000. The ASSF is trained by U.S. Special Operations Forces and is considered one of the most proficient special forces in the region. They have been instrumental in reversing Taliban gains, with their efforts making up 70% to 80% of the fighting in recent years. The Afghan Air Force (AAF) has increased its bombing operations in support of coalition ground forces since 2014, using the Brazil-made A-29 Super Tucano. Despite receiving significant funding from the United States, the AAF still faces challenges with equipment, maintenance, logistical difficulties, and defections. The Afghan Air Force, with 104 aircraft, faces challenges with shortages of engineers and pilots. The Afghan National Police is crucial in combating insurgency, but faces criticism for corruption. The U.S. has provided $21.4 billion to support the ANP since FY2005. The U.S. police training effort in Afghanistan, led by DOD since April 2005, has been highlighted as needing greater interagency cooperation. The Afghan National Police (ANP) aims for 124,000 personnel but currently has 116,000. Women have a higher presence in the ANP compared to the Afghan National Army. The Afghan Local Police (ALP) was established in 2008 to support local forces in protecting communities. The ALP concept in Afghanistan, despite past human rights abuses, involves organizing local militias selected by elders. With around 28,000 members, they have the authority to detain criminals but have been criticized for various abuses. Discussions have arisen about integrating ALP elements into the national defense forces. The ALP, funded by the US at $60 million a year, may be integrated into the ANDSF. Regional dynamics, including relationships with key states like Pakistan and Iran, influence events in Afghanistan. Pakistan's role in Afghan affairs is debated, with concerns about its ties to insurgent groups. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have been strained due to Pakistan's alleged support of the Taliban and interference in Afghan affairs. Afghan leaders have accused Pakistan of waging an \"undeclared war\" on Afghanistan, with some analysts suggesting Pakistan sees Afghanistan as a strategic asset against India. Pakistan is concerned about India's activities in Afghanistan, accusing India of recruiting anti-Pakistan insurgents and building influence through aid programs. President Trump's focus on strengthening the US-India partnership in South Asia has heightened these concerns. There are around 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan, along with possibly 1 million unregistered refugees, many of whom are Pashtuns. Pashtuns make up a significant portion of both Afghanistan's and Pakistan's populations. Afghanistan-Pakistan relations are strained due to disputes over the Durand Line border, with Afghanistan contesting its validity and calling for renegotiation. Tensions have escalated in recent years, including clashes at the Chaman border in 2017. President Ghani's statements on Pakistani Pashtuns' protest for rights have been condemned by Pakistan. Pashtuns are a significant minority in Pakistan but a majority in Afghanistan. The Durand Line border disputes between Afghanistan and Pakistan have led to clashes at the Chaman border crossing in 2017, resulting in civilian and military casualties. Despite efforts to deconflict the situation, bilateral mechanisms have been insufficient. Pakistan has established nearly 1,000 border posts along the Durand Line, while tensions have arisen due to traditional support for the Taliban by elements of the Pakistani government and security establishment. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have been strained due to various incidents, including the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan and a U.S. airstrike that killed Pakistani soldiers. Despite some improvement in relations, tensions remain, with President Trump calling out Pakistan for providing safe haven to terrorist organizations. The Trump Administration announced plans to suspend security assistance to Pakistan, impacting hundreds of millions of dollars of aid. Speculation includes reexamining Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO ally, increasing drone strikes, and imposing sanctions. Pakistani officials warn of potential counterproductive measures and highlight the geopolitical costs of increasing pressure on Pakistan. Iran's historic influence in western Afghanistan and protection of the Shia minority have led to tensions with the U.S. Iran's reported support for the Taliban, its former enemy, may be driven by concerns over U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Iran has a history of opposing the Taliban and supporting the Northern Alliance. In 1998, Iranian and Taliban forces nearly clashed over the killing of Iranian diplomats by the Taliban. Iran has had diplomatic contacts with the Taliban since at least 2012, allowing a Taliban office to open in Iran. Some analysts view these contacts as Iranian support for the insurgency, while others see them as an effort to influence reconciliation efforts and prevent U.S. forces from using Afghanistan as a base to pressure or attack Iran. Since early 2017, U.S. officials have reported increased Iranian support for Taliban elements in western Afghanistan, including providing rockets. This support contrasts with Iran's traditional backing of non-Pashtun Persian-speaking and Shia factions in the country. Iran has also funded armed groups in the west and supported Hazara Shias in Kabul and central Afghanistan. Additionally, there are allegations of Iran funding Afghan candidates in areas with Persian-speaking and Shia minorities. Iran's actions are seen as a way to pressure the United States while building ties with anti-government groups. Iran funds anti-government groups to pressure the United States and has ties to the Afghan government. President Ghani supports Iran, while Karzai called Iran a \"friend\" of Afghanistan. Disputes have arisen over Iran's expulsion of Afghan refugees. Iran recruits Afghan Shias to fight for the Asad regime in Syria. India's involvement in Afghanistan is driven by concerns about Pakistani influence and Islamic extremism. India's involvement in Afghanistan is driven by concerns about potential Pakistani influence and Islamic extremism. India supported the Northern Alliance against the Taliban and sees Afghanistan as a trade gateway to Central Asia. Afghanistan seeks ties with India for economic benefits without causing tensions with Pakistan. India's involvement in Afghanistan is focused on development issues, with India being a significant donor to Afghan reconstruction. They have trained thousands of ANDSF personnel since 2011 and have a formal role in Afghan security through a Strategic Partnership with Afghanistan. India aims to avoid direct involvement in the conflict and Pakistani reprisals. India's involvement in Afghanistan focuses on development, with significant contributions to Afghan reconstruction. President Trump called for India's assistance in economic development in Afghanistan. India has sponsored major projects in Afghanistan, including the Afghan-India Friendship Dam. The Chahbahar Agreement with Iran and Afghanistan aims to boost trade, bypassing Pakistan. The Trump Administration granted India a waiver to continue developing the Chahbahar port. Russia has recently taken a more active role in the conflict in Afghanistan, providing support for the Taliban and working towards a negotiated end. In the past, Russia supported the Northern Alliance against the Taliban and cooperated with the US in developing supply lines to Afghanistan. About half of all ground cargo for U.S. forces in Afghanistan went through the Northern Distribution Network from 2011 to 2014, despite higher costs compared to the route through Pakistan. Russian-U.S. collaboration in Afghanistan has deteriorated since late 2015, with Russia taking a more assertive role. U.S. officials view Russia's actions as a challenge to American goals, with differing opinions on Russia's motivations. Former Secretary Mattis and General Nicholson believe Russia aims to undermine the U.S. and NATO in Afghanistan. Russia's renewed interest in Afghanistan is seen as a reaction to the growth of ISKP, with Russian support for the Taliban possibly overstating the threat. Reports suggest Russia provided weapons to the Taliban, claiming it was to fight ISKP, but the weapons were found in areas not controlled by ISKP. Russia has denied claims of providing weapons to the Taliban, stating their contacts are for political purposes only. General Nicholson reported Afghan leaders giving weapons allegedly from Russia to the Taliban. Russia's involvement in Afghanistan includes hosting Taliban officials for talks, excluding Afghan representatives. In 2016, Russia hosted a meeting with China and Pakistan, excluding Afghan officials, drawing criticism from the Afghan government. China's involvement in Afghanistan is driven by interests in countering Islamist militants and accessing Afghan resources. Since 2012, China has increased its role in Afghan security and mediation efforts. In 2014, China provided $330 million in aid to Afghanistan. China has provided $330 million in bilateral aid to Afghanistan over the next three years, denying plans to build a military base in the Wakhan Corridor. They agreed to help establish a \"mountain brigade\" to combat Islamist fighters returning from the Middle East, fearing potential attacks in Xinjiang. Taliban figures visited China with Pakistani officials to promote an Afghan political settlement. China may be seeking a larger role in Afghan reconciliation efforts, with influence through Pakistan. They participate in peace talks and have met with Taliban representatives. Experts view China's activities in Afghanistan as economically driven, with potential for new investments. China's investment in Afghanistan focuses on sectors like mining and energy, with the Aynak copper mine project facing challenges. Prospective trade routes align with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Gulf States have contributed funds and have influence in Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia has a history of involvement in Afghanistan, providing financial support to mujahideen in the 1980s and recognizing the Taliban government. The UAE also supported the Taliban regime and contributed over $250 million to Afghanistan for various projects since 2002. The UAE provided over $250 million to Afghanistan for housing, health care, and education projects. Qatar became involved in the Afghanistan issue in 2011 when senior Taliban figures opened a political office in Doha. Qatar has hosted U.S.-Taliban talks overseen by Special Representative Khalilzad. The United States has encouraged Afghanistan's neighbors to support a stable and economically viable Afghanistan. Afghanistan has increased integration with neighboring states through participation in regional security and economic organizations. This includes observer status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and summit meetings with countries like Pakistan, the U.S., and China. Russia also convened a meeting with Pakistan and China to discuss Afghanistan, drawing condemnation from the Afghan government. The U.S. has emphasized the development of a Central Asia-South Asia trading corridor to stabilize Afghanistan economically. Efforts have been made to reach a political settlement with insurgents, with U.S. officials engaged in direct talks with the Taliban. However, the Taliban refuse to negotiate with the Afghan government. The Afghan government has made efforts to end the war, including forming the Afghan High Peace Council in 2010. Despite reorganization in 2016, the council has been seen as a \"side-show\" in the peace process, with little role in negotiations with the Taliban. The Afghan government's efforts to negotiate with the Taliban excluded the High Peace Council. A reconciliation agreement was reached in 2016 with Hizb-e-Islami-Gulbuddin, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a former mujahideen commander. In February 2017, U.N. sanctions against Hekmatyar were lifted. In May 2017, he returned to Kabul and criticized the Afghan government. Hekmatyar announced his candidacy for the 2019 presidential election in January 2019. The Taliban refuse to negotiate with the Afghan government, calling it corrupt. Some critics argue that excluding the Afghan government from U.S.-Taliban talks delegitimizes it. A meeting between Afghan delegates and the Taliban in Doha collapsed in April 2019 due to objections over group size. A subsequent meeting in July 2019 included government officials in a personal capacity. Afghan President Ghani vowed not to accept any settlement that limits Afghan rights. President Ghani expressed concerns about being excluded from talks on U.S. forces withdrawal, warning of potential catastrophe based on past civil strife. The Afghan government accused Khalilzad of undermining them, leading to tensions with the State Department. Initial U.S.-Taliban meetings in 2010 focused on a prisoner exchange and opening a Taliban office in Doha. In 2013, a Taliban office opened in Doha, Qatar, following a prisoner exchange. However, the office was closed due to violations of the agreement. In 2014, Qatar facilitated the release of U.S. prisoner Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for Taliban officials. Talks between the U.S. and Taliban ceased under the Obama Administration. President Trump's 2017 speech outlined a new strategy for Afghanistan, mentioning a \"political settlement\" resulting from an \"effective military effort.\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson emphasized the need for Afghan and Taliban representatives to negotiate without U.S. interference. In 2018, the Trump Administration decided to engage in direct talks with the Taliban, excluding Afghan government involvement. This shift came after a year of no progress on the battlefield following the announcement of a new strategy for South Asia. The Trump Administration reversed the U.S. position on Afghan peace talks, leading to direct U.S.-Taliban negotiations in 2018. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad was appointed as Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, holding numerous meetings with regional stakeholders and Taliban representatives. After successful negotiations in January 2019, Khalilzad stated that the Taliban had committed to preventing Afghanistan from becoming a terrorist platform. After successful negotiations, an agreement \"in draft\" was reached on counterterrorism assurances and U.S. troop withdrawal in Afghanistan. Ambassador Khalilzad emphasized the need for intra-Afghan dialogue and a complete ceasefire to achieve a political settlement. The details of a political arrangement that satisfies both Kabul and the Taliban remain unclear. The Taliban's intentions for power in Afghanistan are unclear, with conflicting statements about their goals. Many Afghans, especially women, are wary of the group due to their past policies. Political contention in the country reflects both democratic development and a fractured past, posing challenges to peace efforts. After the collapse of the Taliban government in late 2001, a U.N.-led effort in Bonn, Germany resulted in the signing of the \"Bonn Agreement\" by major Afghan factions, excluding the Taliban. This agreement established an international peacekeeping force and called for a loya jirga to form a Transitional Authority. Hamid Karzai was elected as president in June 2002. The Afghan Interim Administration elected Hamid Karzai as president in June 2002, and a subsequent jirga approved a new constitution in January 2004, establishing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The constitution sets up a presidential system with an elected president, bicameral national legislature, and a 259-seat lower house (Wolesi Jirga) that is popularly elected. The president serves a five-year term with a two-term limit and has the power to appoint high-ranking officials, subject to confirmation by the National. The National Assembly in Afghanistan, consisting of upper and lower houses, plays a role in checking the president's powers. It has the authority to pass laws and the national budget. The upper house, composed of established Afghan figures, tends to be more traditionalist in its political views. The National Assembly has asserted its strength by requiring individual approval of cabinet members and has the power to propose votes of no-confidence against ministers. Several ministers appointed by past presidents have been blocked or removed from office through these mechanisms. The upper house in Afghanistan is more politically conservative and supportive of the president, who appoints a third of its members. The country's complex ethnic makeup is a sensitive political issue, with the constitution referencing 14 ethnicities and designating six possible third official languages. Ethnic breakdown figures are difficult to obtain and heavily politicized. The World Factbook does not provide estimates on ethnicity in Afghanistan. The four dominant ethnic groups are Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks, with Pashtuns being the largest and traditionally holding power in Afghan governance. Tajiks are the second largest group and generally speak Dari. The Tajik-dominated Jamiat-e-Islami party in Afghanistan features key figures like Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani and former Balkh governor Atta Mohammad Noor. The Hazara people, representing the Shia minority, have faced discrimination and persecution in central Afghanistan. Uzbeks, the largest Turkic minority, are concentrated in the north and have sometimes clashed with Tajiks. Vice President Abdul Rashid Dostum leads Afghanistan's Uzbek community, often in conflict with Tajiks. Hamid Karzai won presidential elections in 2004 and 2009, clouded by fraud allegations. The election system favors Pashtun presidents, as seen in Abdullah Abdullah's loss to President Ghani in 2014. The 2014 Afghan presidential election was a major test as the U.S. and international partners drew down. The first round had low violence and fewer fraud complaints. The second round was contentious, with Abdullah alleging fraud. U.S. involvement led to a power-sharing agreement in September 2014, with Ghani as president and Abdullah as CEO. The national unity government in Afghanistan, with powers similar to a prime minister, has faced challenges. Abdullah accused Ghani of acting unilaterally in 2016, leading to tensions. Ethnic and ideological divisions are increasing, causing concerns. Vice President Dostum criticized Ghani for favoring Pashtuns over Uzbeks and left for Turkey in 2017. In 2017, Vice President Dostum left Afghanistan for Turkey amidst accusations of engineering a kidnapping. He returned in 2018, facing indictment but no legal action. Ghani's dismissal of Governor Noor in 2017 highlighted political divisions, possibly along ethnic lines. Elections for the lower house of Afghanistan's legislature were held in October after multiple delays. The 2018 elections for the 249-seat Wolesi Jirga in Afghanistan faced challenges including a lack of candidates for district council elections, disputes over electronic identity cards, and criticism of the Independent Election Commission for logistical issues. The process was described as chaotic, with instability in election results due to delays and violence, including assassinations of candidates and civilian casualties. Hundreds wounded in election-day violence, with voter enthusiasm noted in urban areas. Turnout estimated at 4 million out of 9 million registered voters. Final nationwide results released in May 2019, with presidential election scheduled for September 2019. President Ghani's mandate expired on May 22, 2019, leading to calls for him to step down. The Afghan Supreme Court extended President Ghani's term until the election, citing a similar ruling from 2009. Delays in the election may be related to U.S.-Taliban talks. Speculation about an interim government to accommodate Taliban figures has been denied by U.S. officials. Ghani has rejected the idea of an interim government. The Taliban aims to replace the Afghan constitution with an Islamic system, while President Ghani defends the current Islamic republic framework. Some suggest a more decentralized system to reduce ethnic conflict. International aid has been significant since the US intervention in 2001. The United States provided significant economic and development assistance to Afghanistan, with donor aid accounting for over 75% of the country's GDP at one point. Currently, donor aid still makes up about 60% of Afghan government expenditures. The debate around aid to Afghanistan includes discussions on amounts, delivery mechanisms, donor coordination, and distribution within the country. The US had a cross-border aid program for Afghanistan between 1985 and 1994, and was the largest single provider of assistance to the Afghan people in the 1990s. Since 2001, the United States has been the largest international donor to Afghanistan, providing over $132 billion in development assistance. U.S. aid has focused mainly on security assistance, accounting for nearly 63% of the funds. Efforts have been made to transition assistance from off-budget to on-budget expenditures managed by the Afghan government. Since 2001, the United States has been the largest international donor to Afghanistan, providing over $132 billion in development assistance, with $14.5 billion directly to the Afghan government. Concerns have been raised about the Afghan government's ability to effectively manage on-budget assistance. Laws have been enacted to withhold aid until Afghan compliance is certified on various issues. The US has provided significant development assistance to Afghanistan since 2001, with concerns about the Afghan government's ability to manage aid effectively. Legislation has been enacted to condition funding on the Afghan government meeting certain benchmarks related to corruption, democratic development, and women's rights. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction issues reports and audits on Afghan governance and security. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) issues quarterly reports and audits on Afghan governance and security, focusing on the use of U.S. funds. Some executive branch agencies have criticized SIGAR audits, with the Department of Defense (DOD) disputing a 2013 audit on risk management of $3 billion in DOD funds for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). SIGAR's annual operations are funded at around $55 million. The curr_chunk discusses a detailed plan for the drawdown of operations in Afghanistan by the end of fiscal year 2021, with funding from non-U.S. donors such as the EU and the Asian Development Bank. Major international funds supporting Afghanistan's development include the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan, and Afghan National Army Trust Fund. Donor conferences like Tokyo, Berlin, and Brussels have seen significant pledges towards Afghanistan's development. At the 2012 Tokyo conference, the United States and its partners pledged $16 billion in aid to Afghanistan through 2015. The Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework set requirements for the Afghan government in governance, anti-corruption, elections, and human rights. Donors met in Brussels in October to assess progress on the TMAF benchmarks and pledged more funds for Afghanistan. At a donors meeting in Brussels in October 2016, pledges of $15.2 billion were announced for Afghanistan for the period of 2017-2020. In November 2018, 61 countries and 35 international organizations met in Geneva to review progress on development and reform in light of the Brussels pledges. Economic development is crucial for Afghanistan's long-term stability, with some sectors developed through private investment. The economic sectors in Afghanistan have been developed with private investment, including by well-connected Afghan officials. U.S. development assistance, mainly by USAID, aimed to promote economic growth. The DOD Task Force for Business and Stability Operations (TFBSO) tried to attract private investment but yielded little result. Decades of war have hindered domestic industry development, and a decrease in aid since 2014 has also impacted the economy. Afghanistan's GDP grew by an average of 7% per year since 2003 but slowed to 2% in 2013 due to aid cutbacks and political uncertainty. Since 2015, Afghanistan has seen a slight economic recovery with growth between 2% and 3% in 2016 and 2017. However, the poverty rate has increased to 55% in 2016-2017 from 38% in 2012-2013. The Afghan government has made progress in revenue generation, but remains highly aid dependent. U.S. aid has been crucial for infrastructure projects. U.S. aid has been crucial for infrastructure projects in Afghanistan, particularly in road construction, electric grid improvement, and telecommunications development. The Ring Road, linking the country's major cities, has been completely repaved with funds from various donors, costing about $4 billion. Some observers warn of Afghan government's lack of resources to maintain roads built with international funds, leading to disrepair and major potholes. USAID has no ongoing roadbuilding projects as of July 2019. U.S. efforts in the energy sector since 2001 have had mixed results, with over $2 billion disbursed for power projects. Despite increased access to electricity, a majority of Afghans still lack grid-connected power. Afghanistan's power system operates in nine separate grids, importing 80% of its energy. The US has assisted in developing indigenous power production and connecting grids. Afghan telecommunications firms have seen over $2 billion in private investment, with cellular networks reaching 90% of the population. The telecommunications sector in Afghanistan has experienced rapid growth, with over 89% of households owning a mobile phone in 2018, up from 52% in 2009. This development, supported by millions of dollars from DOD, State, and USAID, has become a key driver of the Afghan economy. Agriculture, although only 12% of land is arable, contributes about 25% of GDP and is seen as a potential growth area. Agriculture in Afghanistan is identified as a key growth area, employing 40% of the labor force. Policies to promote subindustries like livestock production and horticultural crops could double agriculture GDP and create over a million jobs in the next decade. USAID has invested over $2 billion in agriculture programs since 2002 to boost market access and reduce poppy cultivation. In 2019, USAID programs facilitated over $845 million in increased sales of agriculture products, supporting 647,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Afghanistan's mining sector has been dormant since the Soviet invasion, with untapped minerals worth over $1 trillion. Some experts question the sector's potential due to instability, poor infrastructure, and legal concerns. Years of war have hindered the development of Afghanistan's hydrocarbons energy sector, with no export industry and only a small refining sector. However, in 2006, it was announced that Afghanistan has significant oil and gas reserves that could make the country self-sufficient or even able to export. USAID has funded projects to develop gas resources in northern Afghanistan, including the Sheberghan Gas Development Project. Afghanistan is building a 200 megawatt gas-fired thermal plant and transmission lines in the north. The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project aims to transport gas through Afghanistan to Pakistan, with potential extensions to India. Despite security concerns, Afghanistan could benefit from gas access and transit fees. Security concerns along the pipeline's route through Afghanistan raise skepticism. Strengthening the education system is crucial for Afghanistan's future, with around 6 million students attending classes despite challenges like Taliban attacks on schools. In 2018, attacks on schools in Afghanistan tripled, hindering efforts to enroll Afghan students. Despite security concerns, Afghanistan has made progress in building trade relationships, joining the World Trade Organization in 2016. USAID-funded projects have helped increase the competitiveness of Afghan products, leading to a rise in exports from $600 million in 2016 to an estimated $1 billion in 2018. The United States and Afghanistan signed a bilateral trade agreement in 2004, with most Afghan exports eligible for duty-free treatment. In 2018, Afghanistan's exports were eligible for duty-free treatment under the GSP program. U.S. exports to Afghanistan totaled $1.2 billion, while imports from Afghanistan were just $29 million. U.S. assistance aimed to enhance human rights in Afghanistan, addressing issues like lack of security, corruption, and cultural norms affecting human rights practices. Afghanistan has a free press with various independent media outlets, allowing for criticism of the central government. Journalists have been targeted by insurgent groups, and there have been peaceful protests demonstrating the government's respect for freedom of assembly. Women's freedoms have expanded since the fall of the Taliban, with U.S. assistance efforts focused on advancing Afghan women's rights. Despite U.S. assistance efforts to advance women's rights in Afghanistan, the sustainability of these gains is uncertain due to ongoing U.S.-Taliban negotiations. Despite a $1 billion expenditure on women's programs, Afghanistan ranks low on the gender development index. Changes to women's status under a potential political settlement are being closely watched. Key metrics show improvements in female literacy and girls' education, but challenges remain in achieving gender equality in civil service and parliament. The Afghan government implements policies to promote gender equality, including quotas for women in parliament and efforts outlined in the National Action Plan for Women of Afghanistan. The Ministry of Women's Affairs plays a crucial role in raising awareness of women's rights. Additionally, there are 4,735 women serving in the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces. The Ministry of Women's Affairs in Afghanistan raises public awareness of laws protecting women's rights and operates 29 women's shelters to combat domestic abuse. Despite progress since 2001, issues like denial of education, forced marriage, and honor killings persist due to conservative traditions. President Karzai issued the \"Elimination of Violence Against Women\" law in 2009, but efforts to enact it in 2010 and 2013 faced opposition. Prosecutions for abuses are increasing, but many cases go unreported or do not proceed to trial. President Ghani has shown support for addressing these issues. President Ghani has shown support for women's rights by appointing female governors and cabinet ministers. In February 2018, Afghan women urged his government to protect women's rights in any peace deal. Women make up a significant portion of peace councils in Afghanistan. In July 2019, women participated in talks between Taliban and Afghan representatives. SIGAR audits identified issues with U.S.-funded programs for Afghan women, with millions allocated but unclear outcomes. USAID's Promote initiative faces challenges with evaluation efforts and sustainability by the Afghan government. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has identified Afghanistan as a \"Tier 2\" country with serious violations of freedom of religion. Minority religions like Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, and Baha'i's face discrimination, with their numbers dwindling. In a July 2018 attack, Hindus and Sikhs were targeted, resulting in over 20 deaths. In July 2018, ISKP attacked a campaign rally in Jalalabad, killing over 20 people, including a Sikh candidate for parliament. The group has also targeted Afghanistan's Shia minority, mainly ethnic Hazaras. Afghan Shia leaders welcomed the 2009 \"Shia Personal Status Law\" for legal recognition, but some rights groups criticized it for discriminating against Shia women. Afghanistan was ranked as \"Tier 2\" in the 2018 State Department Trafficking in Persons Report, showing improvement from previous years. The 2018 State Department Trafficking in Persons Report noted that Afghanistan had not shown increased efforts against trafficking and lacked prosecutions or convictions of officials involved in trafficking. Afghanistan is a source, transit, and destination country for trafficked persons, with prevalent abuses including forced labor, sex trafficking, bacha bazi, and the recruitment of children for combat by insurgents and terrorist groups. Insurgents and terrorist groups in Afghanistan have shown significant capabilities in recent years, highlighting the security challenges faced by the Afghan government and its international partners. While there is potential for a negotiated settlement, uncertainties remain as talks focus on counterterrorism and troop withdrawal. The U.S. aims to facilitate dialogue between the Taliban and the Afghan government, but the methods to achieve this are unclear. Observers are uncertain about the Taliban's future actions post-U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Changes in U.S. troop deployments and funding for the Afghan military could challenge the government. Political instability and ethnic tensions also threaten Afghanistan's stability. The collapse of the Afghan military or government would have significant implications for the U.S. The potential implications for the United States post-U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan include the breakdown of social order, fracturing of the country into fiefdoms controlled by paramilitary commanders, evolving alliances among extremist groups, deteriorating human rights conditions, and reassessment of what success in Afghanistan looks like for U.S. interests. The current situation in Afghanistan is at a stalemate, with debates on the sustainability of U.S. commitment. Some view it as an \"insurance policy\" against government collapse, while others argue that the threat does not justify the costs of a continued military presence. The Trump Administration's objective is to prevent terrorist attacks on the U.S. originating from Afghanistan. Some analysts challenge the idea of terrorists in Afghanistan posing a threat to the United States, calling it a \"myth\" and arguing against a military-focused strategy. Congress faces key issues in authorizing funds for military activities and aid in Afghanistan. Members may explore leveraging assets and international cooperation to address the situation. Congress could play a role in shaping the U.S. approach to talks with the Taliban and altering the Afghan political system. Afghanistan's place in broader U.S. strategy, amid strategic competition with other powers, is also a key issue. Some argue against U.S. retrenchment in Afghanistan, emphasizing the importance of military efforts and overseas contingency operation funding for future contingencies. Appendix A provides a historical timeline of Afghanistan from the Durrani Empire to the U.S. invasion in 2001. Appendix B discusses the Soviet Union's invasion and withdrawal from Afghanistan, drawing parallels and differences with the U.S. experience in the country. The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan involved over 100,000 troops who partnered with Afghan government forces to combat mujahideen groups supported by Pakistan, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. The conflict included sabotage operations, attacks on military and government sites, and some civilian targets. The USSR also sent technical specialists and political support. The USSR sent technical specialists and political advisors to Afghanistan to stabilize the government and broaden its support base. By 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev decided to withdraw from Afghanistan due to substantial military losses, international isolation, economic costs, potential political unrest, and focus on his reform program. Soviet attention shifted to unifying Afghan leaders and strengthening the military, plagued by desertion and casualties. U.N.-mediated talks in Geneva between Afghan and Pakistani delegations led to the signing of the Geneva Accords in April 1988. The Soviet withdrawal, as per the Accords, began in May 1988 and concluded on February 15, 1989. Despite brief considerations for a residual force, the withdrawal continued due to the perceived Soviet commitment to leave Afghanistan. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, the mujahideen forces were excluded from U.N. negotiations and continued to receive support from the United States and Pakistan. The Afghan government, led by Najibullah Ahmadzai, defied expectations of collapse and received support from Moscow. In September 1991, both Soviet and U.S. officials announced a final cutoff in support to their respective clients, effective January 1992. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, mujahideen forces displaced Najibullah in April 1992, leading to a civil war. The Taliban emerged and took control of the country, torturing and publicly hanging Najibullah upon entering Kabul in September 1996."
