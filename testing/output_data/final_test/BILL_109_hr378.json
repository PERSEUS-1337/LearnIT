    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Homeowners' Emergency Mortgage Assistance Act\" and includes a Mortgage Emergency Assistance Program. The Secretary will establish a program to make mortgage payments on a 1- to 4-family residence when certain conditions are met, including unpaid installments and financial hardship beyond the mortgagor's control. The Secretary will establish a program to make mortgage payments on a 1- to 4-family residence under specific conditions, including the mortgagor's ability to resume full payments within 36 months, the property being the mortgagor's primary residence, no ownership of other mortgaged property, application for assistance to the Secretary, and not being more than 60 days in arrears on a residential mortgage within a 2-year period. The mortgagor must demonstrate financial hardship for delinquency assistance. If found ineligible, reapplication is prohibited for 6 months unless financial circumstances change. Financial hardship is assessed based on income reduction or expense increase. The Secretary may consider various circumstances such as job loss, salary reduction, injury, divorce, or death of a household member when assessing financial hardship for delinquency assistance. Nonprofit housing counseling agencies in each State are designated to assist in implementing the program. Nonprofit housing agencies approved under this subsection must assist eligible mortgagors for the entire duration of their assistance under this Act. SEC. 3. LEGAL ACTION. Legal action regarding an insured mortgage for a 1- to 4-family residence is prohibited without prior notice to the mortgagor and meeting requirements. The Secretary shall issue regulations for a uniform notice to inform mortgagors of potential temporary assistance for mortgage payments. The Secretary will issue regulations for a standard notice to inform mortgagors about temporary assistance for mortgage payments, including details on the mortgage assistance program, required meetings, legal actions, approved counseling agencies, mailing requirements, and any additional Secretary-prescribed requirements. SEC. 4. APPLICATION FOR ASSISTANCE. To apply for assistance under this Act, a mortgagor must attend a face-to-face meeting with the mortgagee or an approved counseling agency within 30 days of receiving notice. The meeting aims to restructure the mortgage payment schedule to prevent legal action. If the mortgagor meets with the counseling agency, the agency must notify the mortgagee within 5 business days. If the mortgagor is unable to resolve the default within 30 days of the meeting, they can file for mortgage assistance under this Act. An approved counseling agency will help prepare and submit the application to the Secretary within 30 days. The Secretary may pay fees to counseling agencies for their assistance. The approved counseling agency must notify the mortgagee within 5 business days of submitting the application for assistance under this Act. The application must include a financial statement disclosing all assets, liabilities, and household income. Intentional misrepresentation of financial information may result in denial of assistance and repayment requirements. The mortgagee can take legal action to enforce the mortgage without further restrictions if assistance is received and not repaid. An application for assistance can be obtained from an approved counseling agency. The Secretary must determine eligibility within 60 days and notify the mortgagor and mortgagee within 5 days of approval or disapproval. SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS BY SECRETARY. The Secretary will pay the mortgagee the full amount due to bring the mortgage current, including principal, interest, taxes, insurance premiums, and attorneys' fees. Monthly assistance payments will also be made to the mortgagee on behalf of the mortgagor. The mortgagor must pay monthly payments to the Secretary, ensuring their total housing expense does not exceed 35% of their net income. The Secretary then sends the total mortgage payment directly to the mortgagee. If the mortgagor fails to pay, the Secretary will pay the mortgagee to bring the mortgage current. The Secretary will review the mortgagor's financial circumstances if there are any delinquencies in payments. If the delinquency is not due to a change in financial circumstances, future mortgage assistance payments will be terminated. If it is due to a change, the Secretary will modify the required payments. Payments under this Act have a specified period for assistance. Payments under this Act have a maximum duration of 36 months, with the Secretary conducting periodic reviews of the mortgagor's financial situation to determine the need for continued, adjusted, or terminated assistance. SEC. 6. REPAYMENT OF ASSISTANCE. The Secretary provides assistance payments to the mortgagee, with any excess becoming a loan to the mortgagor. A repayment agreement is made between the Secretary and mortgagor for the loan amount plus interest, with monthly payments starting once mortgage assistance is no longer needed. The Secretary provides assistance payments to the mortgagee, with any excess becoming a loan to the mortgagor. A repayment agreement is made between the Secretary and mortgagor for the loan amount plus interest, with monthly payments starting once mortgage assistance is no longer needed. Repayment of the mortgage assistance is determined based on the mortgagor's total housing expense compared to their net effective income. If the housing expense is less than 35 percent, the mortgagor pays the difference to the Secretary. If the housing expense is more than 35 percent, repayment is deferred until the expense is less than 35 percent. Interest accrues on mortgage assistance at a rate determined monthly by the Secretary of the Treasury. The mortgagor must make repayments until the assistance is fully repaid. Repayment is secured by a lien. Repayment of assistance to the Secretary is secured by a mortgage lien on the property. The lien does not take priority over other existing liens. Repayments must be made within 14 days after each mortgage payment is due. Subordination of the mortgage lien may be allowed for home improvement loans. After the mortgage has been paid in full, repayments must be made within 14 days after each mortgage payment is due. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, definitions include approved counseling agency, gross household income, and household. An approved counseling agency is a nonprofit housing counseling agency approved by the Secretary. Gross household income refers to the total income of a mortgagor, their spouse, children, and any other dependent living in the same residence. Household includes the mortgagor, their spouse, children, and any other dependent living in the same residence.
