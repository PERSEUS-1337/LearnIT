    "content": "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to provide health care coverage to low-income, uninsured children. SCHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children and 335,000 adults in FY2008, with federal spending totaling $7.0 billion. Congress authorized funds for FY1998-FY2007, leading to legislative attention during the 110th Congress. The report describes the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA 2009, H.R. 2) passed in the House and Senate in January 2009. It summarizes changes to current law and legislative actions during the 110th Congress related to SCHIP. The 110th Congress made substantive changes to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), including addressing funding shortfalls, providing temporary appropriations, and considering reauthorization legislation. Several bills were introduced, but two that passed (H.R. 976 and H.R. 3963) were vetoed by President Bush. The 110th Congress passed two major SCHIP reauthorization bills in 2007, H.R. 976 (CHIPRA I) and H.R. 3963 (CHIPRA II), with common elements such as national allotment appropriations totaling $61.4 billion over five years. This included a new formula for distributing funds to states based on past and projected federal SCHIP spending, a contingency fund for shortfalls, and performance bonus payments for states exceeding child enrollment levels. The SCHIP reauthorization bills in 2007, H.R. 976 and H.R. 3963, included provisions for funding, outreach grants, enrollment barriers, benefits, premium assistance, quality of care, program integrity, and tobacco tax changes. Cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office indicated an increase in outlays by $34.9 billion over 5 years and $71.5 billion over 10 years for H.R. 976, and a similar increase for H.R. 3963. The SCHIP reauthorization bills in 2007 aimed to increase funding through a federal tobacco tax hike. Approximately nine million children lacked health insurance, with most coming from two-parent families and having working parents. The bills would have expanded Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment by 5.8 million, totaling 34.1 million projected enrollees. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA 2009, H.R. 2) aimed to increase enrollment among current eligibility groups. Cost estimates indicated an increase in outlays by $32.3 billion over 5 years and $65.4 billion over 10 years, offset by federal tobacco tax hikes. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA 2009, H.R. 2) aimed to increase enrollment among current eligibility groups. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated it would increase on-budget revenue by $32.5 billion over 5 years and by $65.6 billion over 10 years. CBO cost estimates indicated the Senate version would increase outlays by $32.8 billion over 5 years and by $66.1 billion over 10 years, offset by federal tobacco tax hikes. CBO projected a total of 37.7 million enrollees with 6.5 million increased average monthly Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment in FY2013, mainly among current eligibility groups. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was created under BBA97, with $40 billion appropriated for original allotments. MMSEA provided additional funding to prevent states from running out of federal SCHIP funds before March 31, 2009. The SCHIP appropriation for FY2007 was $5.04 billion, with MMSEA providing the same amount annually for FY2008 and FY2009. MMSEA also allocated up to $275 million to cover any shortfalls of federal SCHIP funds for the first half of FY2009. The MMSEA allocated up to $275 million to cover shortfalls in federal SCHIP funds for the first half of FY2009. States would still need an additional $1.9 billion to prevent shortfalls for the second half of FY2009. The national appropriation for FY2009 was $5 billion, with territories receiving 0.25% and the remainder divided among states based on a formula using survey estimates of low-income children. The federal SCHIP allotments under CHIPRA 2009 are structured differently from previous laws, with allotments calculated based on state-specific factors. The national appropriations for SCHIP allotments in FY2009 to FY2013 are outlined, with varying amounts allocated each year. The Senate version of the bill includes a semiannual amount of $2.85 billion and a one-time appropriation of $11.706 billion for FY2013. These provisions aim to reduce future allotments assumed by the Congressional Budget Office. Federal SCHIP allotments under CHIPRA 2009 are available for two years, with unspent funds redistributed to states in need. States' FY2009 federal SCHIP allotments are based on specific state factors. For FY2009, states' federal SCHIP allotments are calculated based on three factors: federal SCHIP spending, state's FY2008 federal SCHIP allotment, and state's projections for FY2009. The largest amount is increased by 10% to determine the final allotment, with adjustments made if necessary. For FY2010, the allotment includes four components multiplied by a growth factor: FY2009 SCHIP allotment, unspent funds from FY2006 redistributed to states in need, spending of funds provided to shortfall states in FY2009, and Contingency Fund payments. For FY2011 and FY2013, state allotments would be \"rebased\" based on prior year spending by multiplying the state's growth factor with the new base. A Child Enrollment Contingency Fund would be established and funded initially by 20% of the available national SCHIP allotment in FY2009. The appropriation for payments to eligible states for the fiscal year would not exceed 20% of the available national SCHIP allotment. States exceeding their allotments and enrollment targets would receive payments from the Contingency Fund. Bonus payments would be given to states increasing Medicaid enrollment among low-income children, contingent on implementing specific outreach and enrollment activities. Under the House version, states would need to implement four out of seven outreach and enrollment activities, including continuous eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP children, elimination of assets test, and use of joint application. The Senate version adds an eighth activity of premium assistance, with states required to implement five out of eight. Funding would come from an initial appropriation of $3.225 billion in FY2009, along with transfers from various sources. For FY2009 through FY2013, unused amounts for allotments and redistribution; Excess amounts in CHIP Contingency Fund exceeding cap on October 1 of FY2010 through FY2013; Unspent amounts in transitional coverage block grant for non-pregnant childless adults on October 1 of FY2011. Medicaid bonus baseline calculation based on state child population growth and percentage point increases. For FY2010 to FY2012, there are 3.5 percentage point increases, for FY2013 to FY2015, 3 percentage points, and FY2016 onward, 2 percentage points. Bonus payments for child Medicaid enrollees are based on growth above the baseline, with different tiers receiving different percentages of the state share of projected per capita Medicaid expenditures. Eligibility expansion does not qualify a state for additional bonus payments. The bonus payment section of the Senate version of CHIPRA 2009 specifies that children enrolled in Medicaid through presumptive eligibility would only count for a state's bonus payments if the child meets the state's eligibility criteria in place on July 1, 2008. If funding for bonus payments is insufficient, payments would be reduced proportionally. Presumptive eligibility allows children to be enrolled for up to two months while final eligibility is determined. Medicaid through presumptive eligibility would only count for a state's bonus payments if the child was ultimately enrolled through a final determination. States faced a maintenance of effort under BBA97, preventing them from drawing federal SCHIP funds for child populations already covered under Medicaid. Some states expressed that this was a penalty against their early expansion efforts. Later, a provision in SCHIP allowed 11 early expansion \"qualifying states\" to draw some SCHIP funds for Medicaid children above 150% of poverty, with a limit on the amount spent. CHIPRA 2009 would permit spending for Medicaid children above 133% of poverty without the 20% limitation. The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for Medicaid service expenditures is state-specific, with a minimum of 50% and maximum of 83%. The enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) for SCHIP reduces the state's share by 30%. CHIPRA 2009 would reduce federal SCHIP payments for higher-income SCHIP children, using the regular FMAP for enrollees with family income exceeding 300% of poverty. CHIPRA 2009 would allow states to cover pregnant women under SCHIP through a state plan amendment when certain conditions are met. States can cover pregnant women under SCHIP through a state plan amendment if certain conditions are met, such as meeting the Medicaid income standard for pregnant women, no pre-existing conditions or waiting periods, and applying SCHIP cost-sharing protections. Coverage would be from pregnancy through the postpartum period, with the option to temporarily enroll pregnant women for up to two months. Benefits would include all services available to SCHIP children, prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these pregnant women would be eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP. Pregnant women can be covered under Medicaid or SCHIP up to age one year, with states having the option to provide postpartum services through waivers. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act allows for modifications to Medicaid and SCHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to certain populations. Waivers for adult coverage under SCHIP funds are initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. CHIPRA 2009 would phase out SCHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults, with waivers for adult coverage under SCHIP funds initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to use SCHIP funds to extend coverage to certain childless adult populations, and 7 states have such authority to cover parent populations. The Senate version of CHIPRA 2009 would phase out SCHIP coverage for nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers could apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage, subject to budget neutrality standards. The waivers would be tied to state spending on this population in previous fiscal years. The Senate version of CHIPRA 2009 would phase out SCHIP coverage for nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers could apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage, subject to budget neutrality standards. In FY2010, childless adult spending under the waiver would be tied to the state's 2009 waiver spending on this population. Starting in FY2012, allowable spending under the waivers would be subject to a set-aside amount from a separate allotment and would be matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP unless certain coverage benchmarks were met. States meeting the benchmarks in FY2013 would receive an amount between the regular and enhanced FMAPs for parents. The provision in CHIPRA 2009 prohibits waiver spending for parents with family income above eligibility thresholds. Legal immigrants are ineligible for Medicaid or SCHIP benefits for the first five years in the US. Sponsor's income is considered for eligibility, and sponsors must ensure immigrants do not become a public charge. The CHIPRA 2009 provision allows states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or SCHIP coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States. The Senate version includes provisions to ensure that the cost of care will not be deemed against an individual's sponsor and to include redetermination processes for eligibility. CHIPRA 2009 requires individuals with expired legal residence documentation to provide further proof of lawful residency. It prohibits federal funding for those not lawfully residing in the US and allows for disallowance of erroneous expenditures. The provision also includes measures to enhance access and enrollment in Medicaid and SCHIP, with $100 million allocated for outreach and enrollment grants from 2009 to 2013. CHIPRA 2009 allocates funds for outreach campaigns targeting rural areas and underserved populations, with a focus on addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. The House version allows grants for specific outreach efforts to Native Americans and requires the Secretary of HHS to report on their cost-effectiveness. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2 allow states to use Express Lane agencies to determine eligibility for medical assistance under Medicaid or SCHIP for children under 19 (or up to 21). The Senate version allows consent for enrollment to be obtained through various means. The Senate version of H.R. 2 allows states to determine eligibility for Medicaid or SCHIP through various means, including electronic signature. States can rely on reported income from tax records and inform families about potential Medicaid coverage. CHIPRA 2009 removes the requirement for signatures on Medicaid applications under penalty of perjury. CHIPRA 2009 introduces new provisions for SCHIP, including using Social Security Numbers for verification, adding citizenship documentation requirements, and ensuring minimum benefits and cost-sharing ceilings for employer-based health insurance plans funded by SCHIP. Under Medicaid and SCHIP, states can implement premium assistance programs for employer plans that meet minimum benefit and cost-sharing requirements. States must ensure employer plans are cost-effective by comparing premiums and out-of-pocket costs to the state's expected Medicaid service costs. To pass the comprehensiveness test, states must provide \"wrap-around\" benefits for services not covered by private plans. Meeting all requirements has been challenging for many employer plans and states, leading to the use of alternative strategies. CHIPRA 2009 would allow states to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and SCHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The subsidy would cover the difference between the worker's out-of-pocket premium and only covering the child(ren). States cannot require SCHIP-eligible individuals to enroll in an employer's plan under this program. CHIPRA 2009 allows states to provide premium assistance for Medicaid and SCHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance. A separate test is established for family coverage, where if the cost of covering the entire family in the employer plan is less than regular SCHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone, the premium assistance subsidy can be used to pay the entire family's share of the premium. States offering premium assistance must conduct outreach and may establish an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for smaller employers. CHIPRA 2009 includes provisions to improve the quality of care under Medicaid and SCHIP, directing the Secretary of HHS to develop child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. Initiatives include grants to develop evidence-based measures and demonstrations to evaluate ideas for improving children's health. CHIPRA 2009 includes demonstrations to evaluate ideas for improving children's health care quality under Medicaid and SCHIP, a program to reduce child obesity, and encourage the creation of a model electronic health record format for children in these programs. It also aims to improve public information on children's enrollment in Medicaid and SCHIP through added reporting requirements for states. CHIPRA 2009 aims to improve enrollment and eligibility data for Medicaid and SCHIP children, enhance managed care safeguards, and provide premium assistance for employer-sponsored coverage. States have the option to provide SCHIP coverage under their Medicaid programs or create a separate SCHIP program with three benefit options. The Secretary of HHS can approve benchmark-equivalent plans for appropriate coverage under CHIPRA 2009, which must cover basic benefits and at least 75% of the actuarial value of the selected benchmark plan for additional benefits. The bill also addresses payment of premiums and related issues. Under CHIPRA 2009, dental services would be a required benefit for children under SCHIP, including preventive, restorative, and emergency care. States can offer dental services through benchmark packages based on existing medical plans. The bill also includes provisions for dental education, services at health centers, and public access to information on providers and covered services. Under CHIPRA 2009, dental services are mandated for children under SCHIP, including preventive, restorative, and emergency care. GAO will study children's access to dental care under Medicaid and SCHIP, providing recommendations to address barriers and explore the use of mid-level providers. Medicaid beneficiaries with private coverage may be eligible, while SCHIP cost-sharing rules vary by income level. The Senate version of H.R. 2 would allow states to offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children enrolled in group or employer coverage who meet SCHIP eligibility criteria. States can provide dental coverage based on new benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections under SCHIP, with an upper income limit set by the state's SCHIP program. States must meet certain conditions to offer this coverage, including implementing the highest income eligibility level allowed under federal SCHIP law as of January 1, 2009. States may offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children meeting SCHIP eligibility criteria without enrollment caps or waiting lists. Benefits must be provided to all eligible children, with no more favorable coverage for dental-only plans than full SCHIP benefits. Medicaid and SCHIP state plans can define mental health benefits, and group health plans cannot impose stricter limits on mental health benefits than medical benefits. Under Medicaid, individuals under 21 receive comprehensive screening services and dental, vision, and hearing services through EPSDT. CHIPRA 2009 ensures equal coverage for medical, surgical, mental health, and substance use disorder benefits in state SCHIP plans. State SCHIP plans must ensure that financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health or substance use disorder benefits comply with the Public Health Service Act. These requirements must be no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. Additionally, plans must adhere to mental health parity provisions for plan information and out-of-network providers. State SCHIP plans that cover EPSDT services are deemed to meet mental health parity requirements. Payments to FQHCs and RHCs are based on a prospective payment system, with per visit payments adjusted annually. In managed care contracts, states must make supplemental payments to facilities to cover cost differences. CHIPRA 2009 requires states with separate SCHIP programs to reimburse FQHCs and RHCs based on the Medicaid prospective payment system starting October 1, 2009. $5 million would be appropriated for FY2009 to help states transition to this payment system. The Secretary must report to Congress on the effects of the new payment system. No grace period is specified for SCHIP premium payments, but states must describe consequences for non-payment in their SCHIP plans. The state must provide disenrollment protections for individuals who do not pay required premiums, including notice and opportunity to pay past due premiums, opportunity to show decline in income for lower cost-sharing, and impartial review process. CHIPRA 2009 also requires states to give SCHIP enrollees a 30-day grace period for premium payments before coverage termination. The state must notify individuals that failure to pay premiums within the grace period will result in coverage termination and provide the right to challenge termination. The provision is effective for new coverage periods. SCHIP covers benefits like clinic services and ambulatory care. CHIPRA 2009 allows states to offer SCHIP through school-based health centers. The Senate version defines a school-based health center as a clinic near a school facility. The Senate version of CHIPRA 2009 proposes the establishment of a new federal commission called MACPAC, which would review program policies under Medicaid and CHIP. This commission would oversee school-based health centers that provide primary health services to children through health professionals. MACPAC would review program policies under Medicaid and SCHIP affecting children's access to benefits, including payment policies, interaction with health care delivery, and other related policies. The commission would make recommendations to Congress and submit annual reports on these reviews and recommendations. MACPAC would review issues affecting Medicaid and SCHIP, create an early warning system for provider shortages, and submit comments and recommendations to Congress on access policies within six months of receiving reports from the Secretary of HHS. MACPAC would be required to submit reports to Congress, consult with congressional committees, and transmit reports to the Secretary. Each recommendation made by MACPAC would require a vote by commission members, and budget consequences must be examined before making recommendations. MACPAC, composed of 17 members appointed by the Comptroller General, would have the power to obtain official data from any U.S. government department or agency. The commission can establish a paid, professional staff to assist in its work and must examine budget consequences before making recommendations. MACPAC, composed of 17 members appointed by the Comptroller General, has the authority to conduct original research, receive information from external sources, and be subject to audits. Funding requests must be submitted separately from the Comptroller General, with appropriations authorized as necessary. The Comptroller General appoints initial members by January 1, 2010, and the Secretary of HHS collaborates annually. The Secretary of HHS, in consultation with other agencies, must submit an annual report to Congress on Medicaid's financial status, enrollment, and spending trends. Federal agencies are required to review programs for erroneous payments and report estimates to Congress. CMS issued a final rule for PERM for Medicaid and SCHIP in response to comments on an interim rule. Payment error rates for fee-for-service and managed care services are assessed. The PERM system is used to assess payment error rates in fee-for-service and managed care services for both Medicaid and SCHIP. Requirements include clearly defined criteria for errors, a process for appealing error determinations, and deadlines for implementing corrective action plans. The Secretary is also required to coordinate the implementation of PERM and MEQC requirements to reduce redundancies. The Secretary must establish state-specific sample sizes for PERM requirements in SCHIP, starting in FY2009 in the House version of CHIPRA 2009 and in the first fiscal year after the new final rule is in effect in the Senate version. The new final rule must be promulgated within six months of CHIPRA 2009 enactment. The federal matching rate for PERM requirements in SCHIP is 90%, excluding these expenses from the 10% cap on administrative costs. The 10% cap on SCHIP administrative expenses includes all expenditures related to administration of PERM requirements. $20 million annually is provided for producing data on low-income children without health insurance coverage for SCHIP purposes. The Secretary of Commerce would adjust the CPS for more accurate state-specific estimates of children enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, improve survey estimates for child population growth factor, include health insurance survey info from ACS, and assess reliability of ACS estimates for child population growth factor in new SCHIP financing structure. The Commerce Secretary would recommend using ACS estimates alongside CPS estimates for SCHIP evaluation. The HHS Secretary was required to evaluate 10 states with SCHIP plans and report to Congress by December 31, 2001. $10 million was allocated for this evaluation in FY2000. The evaluation included surveys of target populations, assessment of outreach strategies, and enrollment identification. The CHIPRA 2009 required a federal evaluation of 10 states with SCHIP plans, focusing on outreach strategies, enrollment barriers, coordination between Medicaid and SCHIP, effects of cost-sharing, and retention issues. $10 million was allocated for this evaluation in FY2010, with a report due to Congress by December 31, 2011. In the third fiscal year, the Secretary must audit states with approved SCHIP plans that do not provide health benefits coverage under Medicaid. The Comptroller General must monitor these audits and submit a report to Congress by March 1 each fiscal year. Access to relevant documents is granted for evaluating and auditing the SCHIP program. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to offer Medicaid to specific groups through benchmark coverage similar to SCHIP plans. EPSDT ensures individuals under 21 have access to comprehensive screening and necessary services. CHIPRA 2009 expands on the Medicaid benchmark benefit coverage under DRA, preserving EPSDT services for children under 19. It also includes provisions for territories to receive federal match for data reporting improvements and eliminates counting Medicaid child presumptive eligibility costs against SCHIP allotments. CHIPRA 2009 expands Medicaid benchmark benefits, preserves EPSDT services for children under 19, and excludes Medicaid child presumptive eligibility costs from SCHIP allotments. It aims to improve outreach and enrollment for Indians under Medicaid and SCHIP, streamline coordination between public and private coverage, and require employers to notify families of potential premium assistance eligibility. The Act aims to make technical corrections to selected Medicaid provisions, change references to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and provide adjustments in the computation of the Medicaid federal medical assistance percentage. The Act aims to make technical corrections to selected Medicaid provisions, change references to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and provide adjustments in the computation of the Medicaid federal medical assistance percentage. It also includes provisions to extend special disproportionate share hospital allotment arrangements for Tennessee and Hawaii, require a report on Medicaid managed care organization payment rates, and establish a task force for small business education and outreach. The Act includes provisions for small business education and outreach on health insurance coverage options for children, as well as restrictions on physician referrals for Medicare patients. The House version of H.R. 2 requires hospitals with physician ownership to meet specific requirements to be exempt from self-referral bans. The legislation in CHIPRA 2009 requires hospitals with physician ownership to comply with conflict of interest requirements, limit asset percentage held by owners, and restrict expansions. Revenue for CHIPRA 2009 would come from increased tobacco excise taxes and a revision in corporate estimated tax payments. The legislation in CHIPRA 2009 includes a revision in corporate estimated tax payments and increased tobacco excise taxes, with the majority of tobacco tax revenue coming from cigarettes. Various tobacco products have specific excise tax rates imposed. The House version of H.R. 2 would increase taxes on cigarettes and tobacco-related products, with specific rates for different products such as small cigars, large cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco. The definition of roll-your-own tobacco would be expanded to include tobacco for making cigars. Taxes on cigarette papers and tubes would increase significantly. CHIPRA 2009 includes provisions for floor stock taxes, with liability on items held before April 1, 2009. A $500 credit per person is available, with the tax also applying to products in foreign trade zones to prevent stockpiling before the effective date. The floor stock tax in CHIPRA 2009 aims to prevent stockpiling of tobacco products before the April 1, 2009 effective date. It also imposes regulatory requirements on manufacturers and importers of processed tobacco. The Senate version proposes tax increases on small cigars and federal cigarette taxes. The tax rates on various tobacco products would increase significantly, with large cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco all facing higher taxes. The definition of roll-your-own tobacco would be expanded to include tobacco that could be used to make cigars. Additionally, taxes on cigarette papers and cigarette tubes would also rise. The House version of H.R. 2 would adjust quarterly estimated corporate tax payments. The House version of H.R. 2 would increase the ratio for corporate tax payments, shifting $600 million from FY2014 to FY2013. The Senate version would increase the ratio to 120.5% and shift $300 million from FY2014 to FY2013. The current-law withholding provision does not apply to firms with assets under $1 billion."
