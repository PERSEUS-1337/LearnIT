    "content": "The slow labor market recovery post-recession has reignited interest in income inequality trends. Economic growth benefits have been unevenly distributed among U.S. households for years. Inequality in income distribution is a common issue, with the top 20% of households holding over 50% of total income in 2011. Economic theory does not favor a specific income equality level, but emphasizes efficient market operations for fair income distribution. Theoretical arguments for a more equal distribution of income are based on propositions like the diminishing marginal utility of income, which suggests that transferring money from high-income individuals to low-income individuals can increase overall economic well-being. The debate over income redistribution in the U.S. revolves around the trade-off between economic growth and income equality. Policy discussions include topics like income tax rates, social insurance, welfare benefits, and the federal minimum wage, reflecting differing views on how to enhance economic well-being. The report analyzes income distribution and mobility in the United States, comparing it with other advanced economies. It discusses initiatives promoting equality in opportunity and addresses income inequality development and explanations. Explanations for cross-country differences in income dispersion are also presented. The report examines income distribution and mobility in the United States and other developed nations, focusing on the factors influencing income equality and policies promoting opportunity. Data sources include the Annual Social and Economic supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) and federal income tax returns. The curr_chunk discusses the distinction between money income and market income, with market income derived from federal tax data. Researchers like Saez and Piketty use tax data to study income distribution. Market income includes wages, salaries, business income, and capital income, excluding cash government benefits but including realized capital gains. This information is crucial for understanding the distribution of economic well-being. The curr_chunk highlights the limitations of income measures in reflecting overall economic well-being, citing examples of families with equal wealth but different income indicators due to home ownership and implicit income. It also mentions the oversight of not accounting for the implicit income of homemakers in existing income measures. The curr_chunk discusses how changes in household income, such as a spouse quitting to care for children, can impact measured income and living standards. It also mentions how the business cycle and individual lifetime income variations affect relative income comparisons. The curr_chunk discusses the influence of age mix on household incomes and the challenges of comparing income across households. It also highlights the impact of economies of scale on income distribution among households. The distribution of income across households is complicated to judge economic well-being. The Census Bureau provides measures dividing total money income into quintiles, indicating income inequality. In 2011, the bottom fifth of households received much less than their proportionate share of total income. In 2011, income was unequally distributed across U.S. households, with the top 20% accounting for more than twice their share in an equal distribution. The middle quintiles saw a decrease in income share from 1968 to 2011, while the bottom 20% stagnated at less than 4.0% since 1990. Income inequality in the United States has been steadily increasing, with the top 20% and top 5% of households seeing a rise in their income shares over the years. The Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has also shown a continuous increase from 1968 to 2011. The ratio of income at the 90th percentile to income at the 10th percentile is used as an alternative measure of overall inequality. Changes in inequality are driven by different parts of the income distribution. The 50-10 ratio indicates that those near the bottom are falling behind, while the 90-50 ratio shows those near the top are pulling ahead. Increased inequality in the upper half of the distribution may have been the main cause of overall inequality growth between 1961 and 2002. The increase in overall inequality between 1961 and 2002 may have been mainly driven by increased inequality in the upper half of the income distribution. Top-coding in the Census Bureau's data presents challenges when estimating the extent of inequality. Top-coding in Census Bureau data poses challenges for estimating income inequality due to constraints on the actual distribution of income and varying top-code thresholds over time. Economists turned to other data sources, like Piketty and Saez's time series based on federal income tax returns, to study changes in market income among the top 10% of earners. They found that 40-45% of total income went to this group. Between the two World Wars, 40-45% of total income went to the top 10% of earners, dropping to about 30% during World War II. This share remained around 31-32% until the 1970s, then began increasing. By the mid-1990s, the top 10% accounted for over 40% of income, reaching over 46% in 2010. The top 1% saw fluctuations, with their share peaking at almost 24% in the late 1920s, dropping to about 8% from the late 1950s to the 1970s, and then rising again to over 17% in 2010. The top 10% of earners accounted for over 17% of total market income in 2010, similar to their pre-World War I share. Tax returns have limitations for analyzing income inequality, such as time-shifting income and reporting income differently based on tax treatment. Studies have attempted to reconcile differences in income inequality trends using Census Bureau data to estimate income shares of different percentiles. Studies have shown that income inequality in the United States increased between 1979 and 2007, with the rich getting richer at a faster rate than the middle and poorer quintiles, particularly in the 1980s. Absolute income growth was substantial in all quintiles once government tax and transfer policies were taken into account. Income inequality in the United States increased between 1979 and 2007, with the top 1% seeing a 275% increase in real income compared to a 37% increase for the middle three quintiles and an 18% gain for the bottom fifth. In 2007, the top 20% of households had a greater share of income after taxes and transfers than the other 80% combined. Globalization is one of the explanations for this trend towards greater inequality in labor income distribution. Globalization and technological advances have contributed to income inequality in the United States by making less skilled workers more vulnerable to competition from abroad. This has led to a reduction in demand for these workers, putting downward pressure on their wages and widening the wage gap between lower and higher skilled workers. However, there is little empirical evidence to strongly support globalization as a major contributor to increasing income inequality. Analyses of globalization's impact on employment have found it insufficient to explain the earnings gap. Some jobs are vulnerable to offshoring due to technological advances, leading to increased inequality. Economists attribute the rise in inequality to technological change, evidenced by the growing wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers since 1979. The increase in the \"skill premium\" since 1979 is attributed to technological advances favoring high-skilled workers. Information technology serves as a substitute for low-skilled workers, reducing demand and wages, while complementing high-skilled workers, increasing demand and wages. Autor, Katz, and Kearney suggest that computerization has polarized the labor market, increasing demand for high-skilled workers performing non-routine cognitive tasks and stable demand for low-skilled workers performing non-routine manual tasks. This pattern has led to substantial earnings gains for workers in the top quartile, while workers in the bottom quartile have experienced slower gains but still exceeded those in the middle of the earnings distribution. The increase in U.S. income inequality is attributed to factors like the declining role of labor unions, changing demographics, and shifts in economic institutions and social norms. Cross-country comparisons highlight the extent of inequality in the United States. Researchers analyzing data from the mid-1970s to 2000 using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) project and OECD data found that the United States has had a high level of inequality for a long time. Scandinavian and Central European countries had the most equal distributions of income, while English-speaking countries had the highest levels of inequality. Sweden, Finland, and Norway had the smallest increases in inequality during this period. In the mid-2000s, Finland and Norway had the smallest increases in inequality, while the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy experienced the largest increases. The United States showed the most persistent increase in inequality from the mid-1970s to 2000, with a high degree of income inequality compared to other industrialized nations. In the late 2000s, the United States had a high degree of income inequality, with those at the top having significantly more income than those at the bottom. The country ranked among the most unequal nations in terms of disposable household income, surpassing the OECD average. Income inequality in the United States has generally increased since the mid-1980s, surpassing the OECD average. Reasons for international differences in income inequality include varying levels of income transfers, tax progressivity, and earnings distribution among countries. Smeeding found that transfer payments in the US and UK do not benefit low-income households as much as in other countries. OECD data shows that public cash transfers and household taxes reduce income inequality by one-fourth on average in the mid-2000s. In the mid-2000s, public cash transfers and household taxes had a smaller redistributive effect in the United States compared to OECD countries. Income tax payments and social security contributions were more effective in reducing inequality in the US. A study of 36 countries confirmed this pattern, with social transfers making up a low percentage of the US budget and not well-targeted at low-income individuals. The Earned Income Tax Credit was suggested as a solution. The US tax system is considered rather progressive due to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Changes in the federal tax system, including the EITC and child tax credit, have had little impact on rising household income inequality. In-kind benefits and indirect taxes help reduce inequality at the low end of the distribution. Cross-country differences in inequality at the low end of the distribution are reduced due to various factors such as differences in cash transfers and in-kind benefits. Labor market institutions and policies also play a role in shaping the earnings distribution, with wage compression towards the bottom seen in countries with centralized wage-setting processes like Germany. Higher private sector unionization rates in some countries contribute to this wage compression compared to the United States. The decrease in union density in the United States and United Kingdom between 1973 and 1998 may have contributed to an increase in male wage inequality. Greater union bargaining power in other countries led to firms paying low skilled workers higher wages, prompting the adoption of technologies that increased productivity for less skilled employees. Income equality resulting from policy decisions rather than market forces may come at a cost. The willingness to incur costs for achieving income equality may vary across countries. A study comparing perceptions of well-being and income inequality in the US and Europe found that Americans are less concerned about income distribution due to the belief in social mobility. Americans may overestimate their chances of moving up the income ladder. Intergenerational elasticity (IGE) measures the persistence of income distribution across generations. In the United States, there is a strong positive relationship between parent and adult child income, with an estimated IGE of 0.5. This suggests that if a child's parents had income 30% higher than the average, the child's income will be 15% above the average for their generation. This indicates that about 50% of the advantage or disadvantage of growing up in a high or low-income family may be perpetuated. In the United States, about 50% of the advantage or disadvantage of growing up in a low high-income family may be inherited. Empirical analyses suggest that children born into low-income families have not become more likely to surpass their parents' position at the bottom of the income distribution, indicating that mobility in the United States has not offset the increase in inequality in recent decades. Lee and Solon used data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for children born between 1952 and 1975. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) was used to estimate intergenerational earnings (IGEs) for children born between 1952 and 1975. Researchers found no significant change in parent income's influence on adult sons' incomes over two decades. Different methodologies were used by Hertz, Levine, and Mazumder to study mobility among cohorts of children born between 1952 and 1975. The correlation between brothers' incomes doubled from 0.21 for the older group to 0.42 for the younger group, indicating a decrease in intergenerational mobility between 1983 and 1995. Aaronson and Mazumder used census data to show increased movement between income distributions from 1940-1980. Intergenerational mobility increased from 1940-1980 but decreased substantially in the 1980s and remained unchanged in the 1990s. Research suggests that children in the US had lower opportunities to exceed their parents' incomes after 1980. Various studies have shown that intergenerational mobility has been relatively flat since 1990, with estimates based on different statistical approaches and data sources. Cross-country estimates typically focus on earnings of fathers and their adult sons. Intergenerational mobility in advanced economies, including the United States, has been relatively low. Studies show that the United States, the United Kingdom, and France are among the least mobile countries, with high-earning young men often benefiting from coming from more affluent families. In contrast, countries like Canada, Finland, Norway, and Denmark have lower effects of fathers' influence on their adult sons' earnings. Studies in southern European countries have shown lower intergenerational economic mobility compared to advanced economies. In Spain, income elasticity for sons and daughters was estimated at 0.40, making it less mobile than countries like Germany and Sweden. In Italy, the intergenerational earnings elasticity was 0.435, indicating that half of the economic advantage of fathers is passed on to their sons. Mocetti found higher elasticities for Italy than Piranio, indicating less economic mobility compared to the United States. Jantti et al. studied intergenerational mobility in six countries, showing the US has less upward mobility from the bottom quintile compared to the UK and Nordic countries. Up to 30% of children with fathers in the bottom earnings quintile remain in low-income as adults. The United States has lower upward mobility from the bottom income quintile compared to other advanced economies. A study by the Pew Economic Mobility Project found that 43% of children with parents in the bottom quintile remained in the bottom as adults. Despite this, Americans perceive living in a mobile society due to middle-class moves associated with significant changes in living standards. The Economic Mobility Project (EMP) found that children raised by parents in the top quintile tended to remain in the top quintile as adults (40%). In contrast, children from the middle class had higher rates of mobility, with only 25% of children born to parents in the second fifth staying in the same place as adults. Intragenerational mobility in the United States has decreased or remained unchanged in recent decades, according to empirical analyses using data from the PSID. The analysis of family income mobility using PSID data showed a decline in mobility between 1969 and 2006, especially since the 1980s. Families were less likely to move up or down the income ladder during their working lives. Bradbury concluded that this insufficient mobility has contributed to increasing income inequality. Acs and Zimmerman found that intragenerational mobility among 25-44-year olds has been stable since the 1980s, with a significant portion remaining in the lowest income quintile over different time periods. In both the 1984-1994 and 1994-2004 periods, there was stable income mobility with about one-fourth moving up from the bottom quintile to the second quintile. Similarly, around 10% moved from the bottom quintile to the middle quintile, 7% to the fourth quintile, and 4% to the top quintile. Mobility rates from higher quintiles to the bottom quintile remained consistent as well. Acs and Zimmerman concluded that despite rising income inequality, stable mobility rates indicate a growing unequal distribution of lifetime income. The distribution of lifetime income is becoming more unequal, as shown by stable mobility rates over the past two decades. Auten and Gee found a slight decrease in overall mobility, mainly due to less downward mobility from the top 20%. Diaz-Gimenez et al. also observed little change in income mobility but noted a decrease in mobility over a six-year period. The recent period suggested a decrease in mobility, with less income mobility among households at the bottom and top of the income distribution compared to those in the middle three quintiles. The high intragenerational mobility of the majority of U.S. households may contribute to the misperception that the U.S. is a very mobile society. Burkhauser and Couch's meta-analysis found no clear relationship between income inequality and intragenerational income mobility in the U.S. and other countries. Most studies show that short-term income inequality tends to persist over time, with high-income households benefiting more from economic growth. The distribution of income in the U.S. has become increasingly unequal compared to other developed countries. Moving from poverty to wealth is rare, as one's starting point in the income distribution greatly influences their final position."
