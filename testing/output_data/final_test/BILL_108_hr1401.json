Congress finds that mentoring can positively impact children's lives, with mentored teens showing lower drug use, better academic performance, and higher goal achievement. Children with mentors have improved relationships with adults, fewer disciplinary issues, and increased confidence. In 2001, a significant number of young children were in the foster care system or removed from their parents. The International Day of the Child is recognized as a valuable tool for recruiting mentors. Children United Nations has been effective in recruiting mentors for foster care children, with as many as 3,000 children being matched with mentors on the International Day of the Child. States, like California, should incorporate mentor programs into their foster care services. These programs are unique and require specialized training and support for consistent, long-term relationships. Mentor programs are cost-effective in addressing social issues among teens.
