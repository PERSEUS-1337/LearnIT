    "content": "The \"Dirty Bomb Prevention Act of 2003\" is also known as the \"Sensitive Radioactive Material Security Act.\" It amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to enhance security measures for sensitive radioactive materials. The \"Sensitive Radioactive Material Security Act\" defines sensitive radioactive material as any radioactive material, regardless of licensing, that is source material, byproduct material, or special nuclear material. The \"Sensitive Radioactive Material Security Act\" defines sensitive radioactive material as any radioactive material that warrants improved security against sabotage or theft, excluding nuclear fuel or spent nuclear fuel. A security threat includes sabotage, theft, or use of sensitive radioactive material in a radiological dispersal device. The \"Sensitive Radioactive Material Security Act\" establishes a task force to address security threats involving sensitive radioactive material that could harm public health or safety. The task force established by the \"Sensitive Radioactive Material Security Act\" is comprised of key government officials and agencies, including the Chairman of the Commission, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Transportation, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Secretary of Homeland Security. The task force's duties include evaluating the security of sensitive radioactive material. The task force established by the \"Sensitive Radioactive Material Security Act\" evaluates the security of sensitive radioactive material against security threats and recommends administrative and legislative actions for maximum security. Recommendations include classifying sensitive radioactive materials and developing a classification system based on the potential for terrorist use and threat to public health. The task force evaluates the security of sensitive radioactive material against threats to public health and safety, considering radioactivity levels, dispersibility, chemical form, availability of pharmaceuticals, and other factors. The task force evaluates the security of sensitive radioactive material against threats to public health and safety, considering various factors such as radioactivity levels, dispersibility, and chemical form. Additionally, they develop a national system for recovery, storage, tracking, and proper disposal of sensitive radioactive material, as well as modifying export controls. The task force aims to improve the security of sensitive radioactive materials by modifying export controls and establishing procedures for their use, transportation, and storage. This includes ensuring that exports are made only to recipients capable of controlling the materials like those in the United States and implementing security measures such as audits and inspections. The Commission ensures proper security and accountability of sensitive radioactive material through evaluations, increased fines for violations, background checks for individuals with access, physical security measures for storage facilities, and screening of shipments. The task force will submit a report to the President and Congress every 3 years, detailing recommended administrative and legislative actions for securing sensitive radioactive material. The Commission will then take appropriate actions based on these recommendations to enhance the licensing system within 60 days of receiving the report. The task force will recommend revisions to the licensing system for radioactive materials, and states must establish compatible programs promptly. A technical amendment will be made to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The task force will recommend revisions to the licensing system for radioactive materials, including uranium supply and sensitive radioactive material security. A technical amendment will be made to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954."
