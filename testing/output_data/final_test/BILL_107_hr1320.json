    "content": "The Act titled \"Preserving Social Security Act of 2001\" addresses interest and increases in par value of special obligations issued to the Social Security Trust Funds. The Social Security Act is amended to adjust the interest rate and par value of special obligations issued to the Trust Funds. The obligations shall have fixed maturities and bear interest at a rate of 6 percent, paid semiannually. The Managing Trustee will adjust the par value of each obligation to equal the product derived by multiplying. The Social Security Act is amended to adjust the par value of special obligations issued to the Trust Funds based on the CPI adjustment factor. The adjustment period for an obligation may differ from the computation period, resulting in a proportional adjustment to the par value. The Social Security Act is amended to adjust the par value of special obligations issued to the Trust Funds based on the CPI adjustment factor. The actual adjustment period for an obligation is determined from the date of the last adjustment or issuance to the date of the increase in par value. The computation period starts from the adjustment reference month. The CPI adjustment factor is calculated as the ratio of the Consumer Price Index for the adjustment computation month to the Consumer Price Index for the adjustment reference month. The adjustment computation month is determined based on when the obligation occurs. The term 'adjustment reference month' for an obligation is the last adjustment computation month with respect to which an adjustment in par value has occurred, or the first of the 2 months preceding the month in which the obligation was issued. The Consumer Price Index refers to the Consumer Price Index. The term 'Consumer Price Index' refers to the CPI-W issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITIONAL RULE. The amendments made by this Act apply to special obligations issued on or after January 1, 2002. On that date, the Secretary of the Treasury will redeem certain obligations held by the Trust Funds and issue new obligations with the same par value and maturity date."
