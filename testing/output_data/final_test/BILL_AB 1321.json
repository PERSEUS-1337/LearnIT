    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that scaling up the Market Match program in California benefits local economies, improves the health of vulnerable families, and encourages the purchase of fresh produce from local farmers' markets. The Market Match program in California has boosted local agricultural economies by increasing loyal customers' purchasing power, especially in food deserts. Data from 2009 to 2012 shows a significant increase in CalFresh redemption at farmers' markets, with a six-fold return on investment in market sales. Various areas in the state have seen high rates of return on investment, such as 132 percent in East Bay and San Francisco, 257 percent in Long Beach, 403 percent in Huntington Park, and 390 percent in Davis. The 2014 federal Farm Bill includes $100 million in grants to states for programs that promote healthier eating. The first round of grants in 2015 showed that a statewide framework is effective in accessing these funds. California should act quickly to access this funding. A statewide Nutrition Incentive Matching Grant Program, modeled after the successful Market Match program, aims to increase access to fresh healthy foods and boost local economies. The California Nutrition Incentives Act establishes the program to connect producers with nutrition benefit clients, focusing on promoting California fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables. The California Nutrition Incentives Act defines a consumer incentive program as a way to increase the purchasing value of nutrition benefit client's benefits when used to buy California fresh produce. Nutrition benefit clients are individuals receiving services from specific programs like CalFresh and WIC. The federal WIC Farmers\u2019 Market Nutrition Act of 1992 and the Senior Farmers\u2019 Market Nutrition Program are implemented, along with the Supplemental Security Income program. A \"qualified entity\" includes certified farmers\u2019 markets, associations of certified producers, or nonprofit organizations authorized to accept federal SNAP benefits at farmers\u2019 markets. Certified producers must be certified by the county agricultural commissioner. The Nutrition Incentive Matching Grant Program supports small businesses selling California-grown fresh produce authorized to accept nutrition benefits. It collects matching funds from various sources to provide grants, administered in accordance with specific guidelines. The Nutrition Incentive Matching Grant Program awards grants to qualified entities for consumer incentive programs, following regulations set by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The Office of Farm to Fork establishes standards and procedures for grant awards in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The department allocates one-third of Nutrition Incentive Matching Grant Program funds for consumer incentive programs with qualified entities. Grants are awarded based on criteria like serving underserved populations, demographic conditions, and community characteristics related to nutrition benefit program services, diabetes, obesity, and access to fresh produce. The department allocates funds for consumer incentive programs with qualified entities based on criteria like serving underserved populations, demographic conditions, and community characteristics related to nutrition benefit program services. Criteria also include demonstrated efficiency in program administration and access to fresh produce."
