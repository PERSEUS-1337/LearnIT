    "content": "The Department of Defense has historically relied on contractors for military support, including during the Revolutionary War. Advances in warfare have expanded the roles of contractors, especially after the Cold War when DOD cut logistic personnel. Analysts believe DOD now heavily depends on contractors for successful mission execution, as seen in recent operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Balkans where contractors made up 50% of DOD's support. Contractors have comprised approximately 50% of DOD's workforce in recent years, providing operational benefits by freeing up uniformed personnel for combat missions and offering expertise in specialized fields. Hiring contractors as needed can save money compared to maintaining a permanent in-house capability. Using local nationals as contractors could also benefit the local economy and workforce. The use of local nationals as contractors can help develop the local economy and workforce, contributing to stability and counter-insurgency operations. Insufficient contract management can hinder troop support and lead to wasteful spending. Analysts warn that lax oversight of contractors may result in abuses that undermine U.S. counter-insurgency efforts. Concerns have been raised about DOD's ability to effectively manage contractors during contingency operations, with Secretary of Defense Roberts Gates admitting to a lack of planning and supervision in contractor use. Inadequate oversight and lack of coherent strategy in managing contractors have been highlighted, particularly in combat environments. The Commission on Army Acquisition found that contracting officer representatives lack experience and training in managing contractors effectively. Concerns have been raised about overspending on contractors in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Commission on Wartime Contracting raised concerns about DOD overspending on contracts due to managerial shortages and limited oversight. Analysts suggest a culture shift is needed in the military to improve contracting outcomes. The Gansler Report highlighted the Army's lack of value for the skill and experience required for acquisitions, warning that without systemic change, contracting processes will remain below-mediocre. The DOD's current approach to managing service contracts is reactive and lacks key factors for success. Analysts recommend understanding the use of contractors, improving management structures, and committing to a strategic approach. Issues for Congress include the role of contractors in contingency operations, data analysis, contract management improvements, and contractor inclusion in military doctrine and strategy. The report will discuss contracting trends in Afghanistan and Iraq. This report discusses current contracting trends in Afghanistan and Iraq, focusing on the steps taken by the DOD to improve contractor oversight and management. Contractors provide various services and products to support DOD operations in the region, including base support, construction, security, and transportation. Data on contractors in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility was not collected until the second half of 2007, with analysis covering the period from September 2007 to December 2010. DOD is implementing the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) to track contractor personnel within a contingency operation. SPOT was chosen as the primary system for collecting data on contractors in January 2007. The transition to SPOT has been delayed and is expected to be completed by Q4 FY2011. Concerns have been raised about the reliability of the data gathered by DOD. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in October 2010 that the quarterly contractor reports are only a rough approximation of the number of contractors and should not be relied upon for precise analysis. DOD officials have acknowledged data shortcomings and are working to improve reliability. Data on local nationals in Afghanistan has been difficult to gather, with reported numbers fluctuating due to reporting challenges, particularly with day laborer personnel. SPOT system does not require. SPOT system does not require registration of contractors working on contracts less than 30 days. Some contracting activities include these contractors in their manual census count, leading to inconsistencies. OSD, USCENTCOM, and SPOT PM have published guidance to clarify reporting requirements. As of March 31, 2011, there were approximately 174,000 DOD contractor personnel in CENTCOM AOR, making up 45% of DOD's combined contractor and uniformed personnel workforce in the region. Contractors in Iraq make up 45% of DOD's workforce in the CENTCOM AOR, with a .81:1 ratio between contractors and uniformed personnel. Lessons learned from past operations are crucial for developing a strategic plan for future contractor involvement. Understanding the role of contractors in DOD operations can help determine support requirements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Contracting with local nationals is important for counter-insurgency strategy, injecting money into the local economy and building support among locals. General Raymond Odierno issued a memorandum in January 2009 emphasizing the importance of employing local nationals in Iraq to strengthen the economy and combat insurgency. Despite this policy, the percentage of local national contractors in Afghanistan and Iraq decreased from 49% in December 2009 to 36% in March 2011. The use of contractors in Afghanistan differed from Iraq, with 51% being local nationals. In Afghanistan, 51% of contractors are local nationals compared to only 15% in Iraq. Understanding these differences could help DOD strategically plan for future operations. DOD obligated approximately $27.2 billion on contracts in Afghanistan and Iraq in FY2010, representing 17% of total war obligations. From FY2005 through FY2010, DOD obligated approximately $146 billion on contracts in the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters of operations. DOD spent approximately $146 billion on contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan, with contractors making up 48% of the workforce in Afghanistan. Services provided by contractors include logistics, construction, linguistic services, and transportation. As of March 2011, there were approximately 90,000 contractors in Afghanistan, with 51% being local nationals. General Petraeus emphasized the importance of hiring Afghans and using local products. DOD utilizes more local nationals than U.S. citizens in Afghanistan. The DOD in Afghanistan has seen a decline in the percentage of local nationals among contractor personnel, despite efforts to prioritize hiring Afghans. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of an Afghan First policy, as local communities prefer hiring workers from their region to build relationships. Awarding contracts to local nationals may also pose challenges in certain circumstances. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has limited visibility into local national contractors working for DOD, raising concerns about empowering bad actors. NATO-ISAF aims to reduce corruption and criminal patronage networks through initiatives like CJIATF Shafafiyat. General H.R. McMaster addresses corruption through CJIATF Shafafiyat, which includes specialized units like Task Force Spotlight, Task Force 2010, and CJIATF Nexus focusing on various aspects of corruption in Afghanistan. DOD obligated $11.8 billion on contracts in FY2010, representing 15% of total obligations in the area. Additionally, from FY2005-FY2010, DOD obligated $33.9 billion on contracts in Afghanistan, accounting for 16% of total DOD obligations in the region. As of March 2011, there were approximately 64,000 DOD contractor personnel in Iraq, making up 58% of DOD's workforce in the country. Base support functions and security were the main services provided by contractors, accounting for almost 80% of DOD contractors in Iraq. Both contractor and troop levels have decreased over the past two years as the overall number of troops in Iraq has also decreased. Since June 2008, contractor numbers in Iraq decreased as troop levels dropped. Base support and construction contractors decreased significantly, while security contractors increased. This reflects changes in services required by the DOD. The percentage of contractors in Iraq performing base support has remained constant, while those in construction have decreased and security roles have increased. As of March 2011, there were approximately 64,000 contractors in Iraq, with 18,000 being U.S. citizens, 9,000 local nationals, and 37,000 third-country nationals. The number of Iraqi contractor personnel dropped by 87% from June 2008 to March 2011, with a 31% decrease in U.S. personnel. Local nationals typically make up over 80% of construction workers, but their percentage among contractors has been steadily decreasing since September 2007. The percentage of local national contractors in Iraq has steadily decreased since September 2007, despite DOD's policy to increase their numbers. DOD spent $15.4 billion on contracts in Iraq in FY2010, representing 20% of total spending in the region. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the lack of supervision and strategy in using contractors in Iraq. DOD has made efforts to improve contractor management in Afghanistan and Iraq, including organizational changes, regulatory and policy changes, increased training for personnel, and expanding the acquisition workforce. Senior officials are emphasizing the importance of contracting and the role of contractors in contingency operations. General Petraeus emphasized that contracting should be a 'commander's business' in Afghanistan, aligning with other senior leaders' efforts to address contractor reliance in contingency operations. Legislative actions, such as the establishment of the Joint Contingency Acquisition Support Office, have been taken to enhance contingency contracting support for military operations. Additionally, Congress mandated contingency contracting training for non-acquisition military personnel in the FY2008 NDAA. In response to legislative mandates, DOD has made improvements in managing contractors in Afghanistan and Iraq, including establishing Contractor Operations Cells and the Armed Contractor Oversight Directorate. Despite progress, challenges remain in managing contractors, as noted by various oversight bodies. Significant challenges remain in DOD's contracting efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, including criticism for not knowing where U.S.-funded money is going. Congress has held hearings and passed legislation to address issues such as tracking contracts, contractor personnel, and oversight. Legislation is typically included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Key congressional activity related to contingency contracting has focused on private security contractors, comprising 10-20% of DOD contractors in Afghanistan and Iraq. Hearings have been held in various committees, including the Senate Committee on Armed Services and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. This issue has also been raised in other hearings, such as the House Committee on the Judiciary's hearing on Enforcement of Federal Criminal Law to Protect Americans Working for U.S. Contractors in Iraq. The National Security and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conducted a hearing on armed private security contractors providing convoy security along the Afghan supply chain. The Senate Armed Services Committee found evidence of U.S.-funded prime contractors supporting the Taliban and subcontracting to warlords. Congress required regulations for screening, equipping, and managing private security personnel in combat zones. The FY2009 NDAA mandates reporting requirements for security contractors involved in incidents, prohibits them from performing inherently governmental functions, and prohibits outsourcing interrogation. Congress is also examining contractors training local security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, focusing on oversight, behavior, and costs. The Senate Committee on Armed Services held a hearing on the Blackwater-Paravant contract and the need for oversight. The Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a hearing on the shooting of Afghan civilians by Paravant employees and the issue of waste in $6 billion spent on training the Afghan national police force. Congressional interest in management and oversight of contracting personnel in contingency operations has been significant, with hearings held in various committees on these issues. In the FY2008 NDAA, Congress mandated a memorandum of understanding between key agencies to improve contingency contracting practices. The Commission on Wartime Contracting was established to study contracting in Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY2009 NDAA added requirements for reporting crimes involving contractor personnel. Testimony highlighted the need for increased training for non-acquisition military personnel. In response to concerns about insufficient training for DOD contractors and personnel in contingency contracting, Congress passed legislation mandating training requirements for contingency contracting personnel. This included specific training for contract management personnel and the incorporation of contractors in mission-readiness exercises. Additionally, a government-wide Contingency Contracting Corps was established for deployment in emergencies or contingency operations. The Contingency Contracting Corps was authorized by Congress for deployment in emergencies or contingency operations. Specific training in contingency contracting was mandated for this corps. The Department of Defense posts quarterly CENTCOM census reports on their website. Data from previous census reports is provided by CRS in tables. Comparisons of methodology for determining DOD contract obligations in Afghanistan and Iraq were made by CRS, CBO, and GAO. The CRS, CBO, and GAO used FPDS-NG data to analyze contract obligations in Afghanistan and Iraq. GAO's reports focused on contracts in these theaters but also included performance in other countries. GAO couldn't isolate obligations specific to Afghanistan or Iraq due to how DOD reported the data. Contracts performed outside these countries but within the theaters were not included in the analysis. The GAO, CRS, and CBO analyzed contract obligations in Afghanistan and Iraq using FPDS data. The data may show contracts performed in one country but could involve performance in other countries as well. Differences in methodologies may result in contract obligations being allocated to different countries by the GAO, CRS, and CBO."
