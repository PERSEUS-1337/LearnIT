    "content": "U.S.-Turkey ties have reached crisis levels in 2018 due to policy differences and public acrimony, with sanctions imposed by the Trump Administration exacerbating the situation. Turkey's currency has depreciated significantly against the dollar as a result. The crisis in U.S.-Turkey relations has deepened with retaliatory sanctions and increased tariffs. Congress has mandated reports on the relationship and proposed limiting arms sales and imposing sanctions on Turkish officials. Erdogan has criticized U.S. policies, raising questions about Turkey's status as an ally and its ties with Russia. The U.S. public debate on Turkey's alliance status and its relationship with Russia has intensified due to the possible acquisition of an S-400 air defense system from Russia, which could lead to U.S. sanctions. Concerns have been raised about Turkey's ties with Russia and its implications for NATO. U.S. officials are trying to prevent the deal by offering alternatives like Patriot air defense systems. Tensions between the U.S. and Turkey have also been fueled by Turkey's actions in Syria, particularly regarding Kurdish-led militias. President Erdogan's authoritarian rule and Turkey's financial distress are also contributing factors. Turkey's economy has faced challenges including a significant currency devaluation and concerns about rule of law. Erdogan's power was strengthened through elections and constitutional changes. Turkey's strategic position and large economy make it a key regional power, with significant socioeconomic changes since the 1980s contributing to the rise of a Sunni Muslim middle class. The rise of a Sunni Muslim middle class from Turkey's Anatolian heartland fueled political transformation led by the Islamist-leaning Justice and Development Party (AKP) and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan reduced the political power of the \"secular elite\" and clashed with other rival power centers, including the Fethullah Gulen movement. Since 2013, domestic polarization in Turkey has intensified with nationwide protests and corruption allegations against Erdogan's colleagues. After becoming president in 2014, Erdogan sought to increase his power through a \"presidential system\" of governance. He has been described as a pragmatic populist, protector of the vulnerable, budding authoritarian, indispensable figure, and Islamic ideologue. Erdogan's consolidation of power continued despite challenges such as the 2016 coup attempt, winning victories in constitutional referendums and elections. U.S. and European Union officials have expressed concerns about rule of law and civil liberties in Turkey, including government influence on media and high number of journalists in prison. Turkey's economy lacks significant natural resource rents like Russia or Iran, and does not possess nuclear weapons like Russia and China. Turkey's institutions and traditions have strong ties with the West. In June 2018, President Erdogan was reelected with 53% of the vote, solidifying his power with expanded presidential authority. His party, AKP, formed a parliamentary majority with the nationalist MHP, known for its anti-Kurdish stance and support for constitutional changes. This alliance may impact government policies towards the Kurds. The government's policy towards the Kurdish militant group PKK may be influenced by Erdogan's expanded powers following the constitutional changes in June 2018. These changes include eliminating the position of prime minister, allowing the president to appoint ministers without parliamentary approval, and increasing the president's control over senior judges. The 2018 elections in Turkey saw allegations of voter fraud and manipulation, with Muharrem Ince of the CHP noting unfair campaign practices. Despite these claims, the AKP's political success has been supported by strong economic growth since the early 2000s. Turkey's economy, led by key businesses like Koc and Sabanci, ranked 17th in global GDP in 2017. Despite a 7% GDP growth rate, indicators suggest potential economic volatility and crisis ahead, with concerns about the sustainability of past economic success. Turkey's large current account deficit makes it vulnerable to higher borrowing costs. Turkey's large current account deficit increases vulnerability to higher borrowing costs. Uncertainty surrounds the economy and foreign investors' response to Erdogan's new government. Erdogan's recent power grab in appointing central bank rate-setters and his son-in-law as finance minister raises concerns about politicization of monetary policy. Speculation arises about Turkey potentially seeking IMF assistance if investment dries up, posing a sensitive challenge for Erdogan given his past success in gaining independence from IMF interventions. The Turkish lira has significantly depreciated as of August 2018, even before facing U.S. sanctions. Turkey's lira had been declining since 2015 due to various factors including a strengthening U.S. dollar, concerns about central bank independence, and high corporate debt. The U.S. sanctions related to Pastor Andrew Brunson's case have further accelerated the lira's decline, depreciating by 40% against the dollar in 2018. President Erdogan urged Turks to convert savings to lira to combat the crisis. Turkey's importance as a regional energy transport hub makes it relevant for world energy markets. Turkey's dependence on other countries for energy, particularly Russia and Iran, may somewhat constrain its foreign policies. Construction on the Turkish Stream pipeline, carrying Russian natural gas through Turkey into Europe, is progressing, with first gas deliveries projected for the end of 2019. Turkey is diversifying its energy imports to reduce dependence on foreign actors. Turkey and Azerbaijan signed deals for natural gas transit via the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) in 2011. TANAP was inaugurated in June 2018, potentially setting a precedent for non-Russian, non-Iranian energy transport to Europe. The consortium controlling Azerbaijani gas fields elected to connect TANAP with the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) to Italy in June 2013. Turkey aims to increase energy independence by importing gas from the Eastern Mediterranean and boosting domestic production. Relations with Cyprus, Israel, and Egypt could complicate these efforts. Turkey has agreements with Rosatom to build its first nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, with construction starting in 2018 and operations expected by 2023. Japan is assisting with a second plant in Sinop, and Turkey is discussing cooperation with China for a third plant in Thrace. Kurds make up around 19% of Turkey's population, mainly in the southeast but also in urban areas. Since 1984, the Turkish military has been combating a separatist insurgency and urban terrorism by the PKK, a Kurdish group seeking cultural and political autonomy. The PKK funds its activities through criminal means, including drug trafficking. Tensions between Kurds and the Turkish government have existed since the country's foundation in 1923. The PKK, a Kurdish group seeking autonomy, has been in conflict with Turkish authorities since the 1990s. The Turkish military's harsh tactics against the PKK have been criticized, leading to imprisonment and displacement of Kurds. Erdogan initially favored negotiations but shifted to a confrontational stance in 2015 due to PKK's success in Syria and domestic politics. In 2015, Erdogan took a confrontational stance against the PKK, leading to renewed violence. Hundreds died, and infrastructure in southeastern Turkey was damaged. U.S. officials urged Turkey to show restraint. After the 2016 coup attempt, Turkey cracked down on its Kurdish minority, removing elected mayors. In November 2016, the pro-Kurdish HDP leaders were arrested along with other parliamentarians. The future of Turkey-PKK relations depends on various factors, including influential Kurdish figures, Erdogan's approach, and possible incentives for mitigating violence. Many Members of Congress monitor the status of religious minorities in Turkey. Many Members of Congress are concerned about the status of religious minorities in Turkey, particularly the rights of Christian and Jewish communities. The Turkish government controls religious activities in the country, with some observers noting a shift towards an Islamic-friendly worldview since 2015. Adherents of non-Muslim religions and minority Muslim sects rely on legal appeals and support from Western countries to protect their rights in Turkey. The Jewish community in Turkey expresses concerns about anti-Semitism and threats of violence. Members of Congress advocate for the reopening of the Halki Theological School, supported by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. President Erdogan's meeting with Patriarch Bartholomew in April 2018 raised optimism for the seminary's reopening in the fall. Turkey may convert historic Christian churches into mosques, including the Hagia Sophia. President Erdogan recited a Quran prayer at Hagia Sophia in a cultural event. The Alevi community, with ties to Shiism, makes up 10 to 20 million Turkish Muslims. The Alevi community in Turkey, with ties to Shiism and Sufi mysticism, has long been supportive of secularism as a form of protection from the Sunni majority. Despite a court decision in 2015, the government still does not financially support Alevi houses of worship. Arab Alawites in Syria and southern Turkey are a Shia-related religious community, leading to tensions in the US-Turkey alliance. Many Members of Congress are active in proposing legislation on U.S.-Turkey matters, including arms sales and strategic cooperation. Turkey may seek greater foreign policy diversification through stronger relationships with other countries. Turkey's location is valuable for the United States and NATO for arms, cargo, and personnel transport. NATO has traditionally helped mitigate Turkey's concerns about encroachment by neighbors. Turkey's strategic importance to the West stems from its historical alliance with the U.S. and NATO, including key military sites like Incirlik air base, early warning missile defense radar, and NATO ground forces command. Recent tensions have raised concerns about the continued use of Turkish bases by the U.S. and NATO, with some officials considering permanent reductions in the American presence. This is not unprecedented, as there have been instances in the past where the U.S. has withdrawn military assets from Turkey or faced restrictions on its use of Turkish territory. The United States has faced challenges with its military presence in Turkey, including the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the Cyprus conflict in 1975, and the Iraq war in 2003. Recent tensions, such as the 2016 coup attempt using Incirlik air base, have raised concerns about Turkey's stability and the safety of U.S. and NATO assets in the region. Some suggest exploring alternative basing arrangements due to these issues. The United States has faced challenges with its military presence in Turkey, including recent tensions like the 2016 coup attempt at Incirlik air base. Finding alternatives to Incirlik, including in Romania and Jordan, is being considered, but the U.S. is not currently planning to leave Incirlik. Calculating the costs and benefits of a U.S./NATO presence in Turkey revolves around questions of strengthening Turkey relative to other regional actors and the extent of reliance on Turkish territory. Turkey has historically been a major recipient of U.S. arms due to its NATO ally status and strategic position. However, Turkey is now focusing on developing its domestic defense industry and reducing arms purchases from the U.S. The U.S. has provided Turkey with significant military assistance since 1948. Turkey is reducing arms purchases from the U.S. and focusing on developing its domestic defense industry. Current military assistance from the U.S. to Turkey is limited, with a reported finance agreement with Russia for the purchase of the S-400 defense system worth $2.5 billion. Turkey is also exploring a co-development arrangement for a long-range air defense system with the Eurosam consortium. Turkey's planned acquisition of the S-400 has raised concerns within NATO and the U.S. about interoperability and potential Russian influence. NATO officials worry about Russian personnel gaining intelligence on NATO assets in Turkey. Turkey's decision to acquire the S-400 system from Russia has raised concerns about potential Russian influence and intelligence gathering on NATO assets in Turkey. Despite justifying the decision based on cost and technology sharing, concerns remain about the lack of technology transfer and ballistic missile defense capabilities with the S-400 deal. Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 system from Russia has raised concerns about potential Russian influence and intelligence gathering on NATO assets in Turkey. Despite justifying the decision based on cost and technology sharing, there are worries about the lack of technology transfer, ballistic missile defense capabilities, and increased Turkish dependence on Russia. Turkey may take steps to address U.S. concerns, such as allowing Turkish technicians to operate the S-400 without Russian involvement and considering purchasing U.S.-origin Patriot systems. In April, Secretary of State Pompeo asked Turkey to consider NATO interoperable systems, but Cavusoglu stated the S-400 deal was final. Air Force Secretary Wilson mentioned discussions to prevent the F-35 from being near the S-400. Talks with Turkey about the Patriot system were confirmed by a State Department official in July. The planned S-400 acquisition could lead to sanctions under U.S. law. In September 2017, Senators McCain and Cardin warned of possible sanctions under CAATSA for Turkey's S-400 purchase from Russia. Assistant Secretary Mitchell also mentioned potential sanctions in April 2018. Turkey had previously considered a Chinese defense system but withdrew in 2015 due to NATO concerns and technology issues. The U.S.-Turkey relationship has become strained due to various issues, including Turkey's potential acquisition of the S-400 missile system from Russia and its actions in Syria. Turkey's foreign policy decisions, such as its dealings with Russia and China, have raised concerns about its commitment to NATO and the West. President Erdogan has also played a role in opposing Western officials. President Erdogan has been vocal in opposing President Trump's decision on Jerusalem and U.S. support for Israel. Turkey's interactions with Greece and Cyprus have also become contentious. In August 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Turkey's justice and interior ministers. Turkey reacted with reciprocal sanctions against U.S. officials due to their involvement in the arrest of Pastor Andrew Brunson. This led to a crisis in bilateral relations, with President Trump doubling tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports. The tensions stem from various cases related to the 2016 coup attempt, including the extradition request for Fethullah Gulen. Turkish authorities have detained U.S. citizens, including Pastor Brunson, amid increased criticism of U.S. actions related to Gulen's case. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders differentiated between Treasury Department sanctions and steel tariffs, stating the former were specific to Pastor Brunson's case. Two Turkish citizens with government ties were arrested by U.S. authorities for conspiring to evade. Two Turkish citizens with government ties were arrested by U.S. authorities in 2016 and 2017 for conspiring to evade sanctions on Iran. Reza Zarrab received immunity for cooperating with prosecutors, while Mehmet Hakan Atilla was convicted and sentenced to 32 months in prison. Turkish leaders denounced the case, fearing potential implications for Turkey's economy. Erdogan's security detail has been involved in physical confrontations with his critics during trips abroad. Members of Congress expressed concern over an incident in Washington, DC involving Turkish security guards and Kurdish protestors outside the Turkish ambassador's residence. The House passed a resolution condemning violence against protesters, and Congress prohibited the use of US funds for arms sales to Erdogan's security detail. Bilateral tensions led to legislative proposals and debates on sanctions against Turkey. The most significant congressional action was an arms embargo in response to Turkish citizens evading sanctions on Iran. The FY2019 NDAA includes a provision that requires a report on the status of U.S.-Turkey relations, prohibiting the delivery of F-35 aircraft to Turkey until the report is submitted. The report will assess military and diplomatic presence in Turkey, Turkey's potential S-400 purchase from Russia, and its effects on the U.S.-Turkey relationship. Turkey is a cooperative partner in the F-35 program, with plans to purchase 100 F-35s. Turkish companies are involved in developing and manufacturing F-35 components. The first aircraft was handed over in Texas, with training for Turkish pilots underway in the U.S. Turkey is also considering alternative air and missile defense systems. Turkey is considering purchasing F-35 aircraft, with the first delivery scheduled for 2020. There are concerns about Turkey acquiring the S-400 missile defense system from Russia, with some Members of Congress seeking to prevent the F-35 sale due to this issue. The Senate Armed Services Committee has stated that a Turkish purchase of the S-400 would be incompatible with their NATO commitments. The report expressed concerns about U.S. citizens detained in Turkey, including Pastor Brunson, and called upon Turkey to uphold its NATO obligations. Senator Jeanne Shaheen highlighted hesitancy in transferring F-35 planes to Turkey due to their purchase of the Russian S-400 system. Unwinding Turkey's involvement in the F-35 program could be costly and complicated, as the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin $3.7 billion for the production of aircraft earmarked for non-U.S. customers. In May, concerns were raised about Turkey's involvement in the F-35 program, but some Members of Congress opposed excluding Turkey. Turkey has invested over $1 billion in the program and manufactures critical components. Secretary of Defense Mattis opposed Turkey's removal from the program, citing concerns about human rights and rule of law in Turkey. The authoritarian drift in Turkey is impacting human rights and the rule of law. Disrupting the Turkish supply chain for the F-35 could cause delays in aircraft production. Turkey may retaliate if the US ends their involvement in the F-35 program. The Senate's FY2019 Appropriations Act includes a provision to withhold F-35 aircraft transfer to Turkey until certain conditions are met. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed a provision for FY2018 appropriations legislation that would deny entry into the US to senior Turkish officials responsible for wrongful detention of US citizens. Senators Shaheen and Lankford dropped the provision to allow for diplomacy on various issues between the US and Turkey. In April 2018, Senators criticized President Erdogan for holding U.S. citizens in Turkey on fabricated charges. They planned targeted sanctions against Turkish officials. In June 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee included a similar provision in the FY2019 appropriations act. In July 2018, six Senators introduced a bill to oppose future loans to Turkey from international financial institutions. Turkey's involvement in Syria's conflict since 2011 has been complicated and costly, with its chief objective being to thwart the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) from establishing an autonomous area along the northern Syrian border. Turkey views the YPG and its political counterpart, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), as a top security threat due to the potential boost to the PKK's insurgency within Turkey. The YPG, part of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has been a key U.S. partner against ISIS since 2014. U.S. support for the SDF has strained relations with Turkey, which sees the YPG as a threat. The U.S. has armed the YPG but announced an end to direct arming in 2017. Turkey's actions in northern Syria aim to prevent the YPG from gaining control along the border. Turkey launched an offensive against the YPG in the Afrin district in January 2018, causing a manpower drain from the anti-IS mission. By March, the YPG had abandoned control to Turkish forces. Turkey has set up local councils in occupied areas, with questions about future governance. Observers predict a YPG insurgency, potentially leading to an extended Turkish military presence. The U.N. OHCHR report in June 2018 alleged violations of international laws by de facto authorities preventing Kurds from returning home. Manbij, seized by SDF with U.S. support, is a point of tension between U.S. and Turkey due to YPG presence. Concerns of clashes between Turkish and U.S. forces led to a deconfliction agreement endorsed on June 4. The roadmap endorsed aims to move the YPG east of the Euphrates in a way that ensures security and stability in Manbij, with cooperation from the YPG being a key factor. Turkish priorities in Syria have shifted, with a mix of coordination and competition with Russia and Iran, despite still calling for Assad to leave power. Turkey, part of the Astana process with Russia and Iran, has inserted troops into northern Syria to establish \"de-escalation zones.\" It is uncertain if Turkish-supported forces will hold their positions or advance further into Syrian territory, with or without U.S. support. Turkey's history as a regional power and object of great power aggression drives complicated dynamics in its international relationships. Nationalistic sentiment in Turkey may lead to wariness of reliance on other countries for security, trade, and energy. Maintaining cooperative relationships with conflicting interests requires a delicate balance, especially with threats from Syria and Iraq. Involvement in Syria and Iraq by the United States, Russia, and Iran adds pressure on Turkey to manage this balance effectively. Turkey's Middle Eastern profile expanded in the 2000s as Erdogan sought to build economic and political linkages with neighbors, but efforts to increase influence have been hindered by regional conflict and instability since 2011. Turkey's efforts to expand its influence in the Middle East have been hindered by regional conflict and instability. Despite sharing some interests with Sunni Arab powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt in countering Iran, Turkey is viewed suspiciously due to its government's Islamist sympathies and close ties with Qatar. Relations with Israel have become distant under Erdogan's rule, while Turkey-Russia relations have improved significantly since a rapprochement in 2016. Since the rapprochement in 2016, Turkey and Russia have cooperated in various areas, including a possible S-400 air defense deal, military and political coordination in northern Syria, and energy dealings. Views on the significance of this relationship vary, with some seeing it as a strategic partnership and others as a \"marriage of convenience\" with relations alternating between cooperation and competition. Turkey's policy changes towards Russia are seen as a balancing act between East and West, influenced by Russia's leverage through sanctions and airspace closures. Some analysts suggest that Turkey's favoring of Russia may stem from feeling abandoned by the West and intimidated by Russia, rather than a preference for Russia over the West. There are concerns that Russia's closer ties with Turkey could be part of a strategy to undermine NATO and U.S. relationships. In February 2018, General Joseph Votel stated that Russia, along with Iran, aims to weaken the U.S.-Turkey partnership. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison also mentioned Russia's attempts to sway Turkey and other allies. Turkey and Iran collaborate on regional issues, including access to Iranian oil. Despite working together in Syria through the Astana process, Turkey remains cautious of Iran's ambitions in the region. Erdogan and Turkish officials have criticized Iran for destabilizing the region with sectarian interests. Turkey's relationship with the US and regional actors is a concern. Turkey plans to defy US sanctions on Iranian oil imports. President Trump's withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement may complicate relations further. Turkey's priority in Iraq is countering threats from Kurds, particularly the PKK. Concerns also exist about Iraqi Kurdish moves towards independence and strained relations with Iraq's central government over Shia influence from Iran. The US is unlikely to offer waivers for sanctions on countries reducing imports. Relations between Turkey and Iraq are strained due to Turkish dam construction impacting Iraqi communities. Turkey has military posts in northern Iraq and a base near Mosul. Turkey developed a partnership with the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in 2008, including oil transportation to Turkish ports. Turkey opposed the KRG's 2017 independence referendum and halted oil exports through KRG pipelines. Talks are ongoing to restart exports. Turkey conducts airstrikes against PKK in Iraq with US intelligence assistance. Turkey conducts airstrikes against PKK in Iraq with US intelligence assistance. The KRG generally does not object to these strikes, but remains sensitive to pan-Kurdish sympathies. Turkish forces moved into KRG territory in preparation for a possible ground operation against the PKK in the Qandil Mountains. Ties between Turkey and Israel have deteriorated during Erdogan's rule, reflecting the military's declining role in Turkish society. Despite growing trade between Turkey and Israel, their bilateral relationship remains tense. Turkey has used Israel's port at Haifa for exports during Syria's civil war. Diplomatic ties were fully restored in 2016, but Israelis criticize Turkey's ties with Hamas, while Turks criticize Israel's treatment of Palestinians. Erdogan opposes the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Opposition to the 2017 U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital has led to increased Turkish financial investment and political activism in East Jerusalem. President Erdogan and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu have traded public accusations, leading to the temporary expulsion of diplomats in Ankara, Istanbul, and Jerusalem. Erdogan's criticisms of Israel have been labeled as anti-Semitic, although he insists they are not directed at the Jewish people. Israel has raised concerns with U.S. officials over the tensions. Turkey has raised concerns with the U.S. over Turkey's acquisition of the F-35 and has considered limiting Turkish influence in Jerusalem. Israel has strengthened ties with Greece and Cyprus as a response. Turkey's EU membership negotiations have stalled, with resistance rooted in fears of cultural change and Turkey's unwillingness to normalize relations with Cyprus. Turkey's EU membership negotiations have stalled due to concerns over trade relations with Cyprus and Turkey's qualifications for membership, including issues with Kurds, religious minorities, media freedoms, women's rights, and democratic systems. President Erdogan's anti-European rhetoric has fueled domestic support but has also led to intensified debate over Turkey meeting EU standards. Despite declining domestic expectations for full EU accession, some polls show continued support for joining the EU. The European Commission's Turkey 2018 report highlighted \"serious backsliding\" in membership criteria, particularly in the judiciary. Turkey's EU membership negotiations have stalled due to concerns over trade relations with Cyprus and Turkey's qualifications for membership, including issues with Kurds, religious minorities, media freedoms, women's rights, and democratic systems. Despite the lack of significant progress in accession negotiations, the EU provides Turkey with financial and technical assistance. Since 2011, nearly four million refugees or migrants have come to Turkey, posing humanitarian, socioeconomic, and security challenges. Turkey and the EU reached an arrangement in 2016 for the return of irregular migrants from Greece to Turkey in exchange for resettling Syrian refugees and providing financial support. The Turkey-EU deal in 2016 led to a significant decrease in crossings from Turkey to Greek islands, with concerns raised about its long-term viability due to disputes and human rights issues. Turkey's historical events with Armenia influence its foreign policy, with stalled efforts to normalize relations since 2009. In 1975 and 1984, the House passed resolutions referring to the Armenian genocide, but they did not come to a vote in the Senate. Various proposed resolutions have characterized the events as genocide, with recent resolutions introduced in the 115th Congress. All U.S. Presidents since Jimmy Carter have acknowledged the events, with President Reagan specifically mentioning a \"genocide of the Armenians\" in 1981. President Trump acknowledged the Armenian genocide as \"one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century\" during a speech in 2018. The Armenian National Institute states that 25 countries, including 15 EU member states, have recognized the events as genocide. Turkey sees itself as the protector of Turkish-Cypriots since Cyprus gained independence in 1960. Turkey's military intervened in 1974 to control the northern third of Cyprus in response to Greek annexation concerns, leading to a lasting ethnic and political division. The Republic of Cyprus is recognized internationally as having jurisdiction over the entire island, while the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is only recognized by Turkey. Turkey's EU membership aspirations are hindered by its refusal to normalize relations with Cyprus, which joined the EU in 2004. This has also reduced incentives for Greek Cypriots to pursue reunification. Turkey and Turkish Cypriots oppose Republic of Cyprus' offshore energy exploration without unification. Turkey's relations with Greece have historical tensions, with recent spikes in violations. Despite efforts to reduce tensions, the Aegean remains a potential flashpoint. Turkey aims to strengthen ties with non-Western countries through political involvement and economic influence. Turkey has strengthened ties with various countries through political involvement, trade, investment, and humanitarian projects. The Gulen movement had previously facilitated some of these connections before being labeled a terrorist organization by Turkey. Concerns arise about the future of these relationships following changes in Turkey. Recent developments include the establishment of a military base in Somalia and economic initiatives in the Horn of Africa region. Turkey's close ties with Qatar have raised concerns among Arab countries in the strategic Horn area. Turkey has deployed troops to Qatar since 2015 and provided political support. Turkey has deployed troops to Qatar since 2015 and supported it politically and economically during tensions with other Gulf Arab states."
