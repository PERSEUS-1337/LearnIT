    "content": "The \"Reciprocal Market Access Act of 2018\" is the short title of this Act. The purpose of this Act is outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that the fundamental tenet of the WTO is reciprocal market access, as stated in the Marrakesh Agreement. The American people expect promises of market access opportunities to be realized in trade agreements. Future trade negotiations should be based on a verification-oriented approach to ensure promised market access and reciprocal trade benefits. Tariffs have been reduced or eliminated in trade negotiations, leaving nontariff barriers as the main challenge for US exports. The US market is known for being open with low tariff rates and limited nontariff barriers. The US often uses leverage to address nontariff barriers in trade agreements. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that US trade negotiations result in expanded market access for exports, not just the elimination of tariffs. Currently, negotiations focus on reducing tariff and nontariff barriers separately, which may not address the real barriers hindering US businesses in foreign markets. The Act aims to secure expanded market access for US exports, not just the removal of tariffs on imports into the country. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RATES OF DUTY PURSUANT TO CERTAIN TRADE AGREEMENTS. The President is restricted from agreeing to reduce or eliminate duty rates on products in trade agreements with foreign countries until a certification is provided to Congress. This certification must confirm the reduction of barriers for US exports of similar products. The President must certify the reduction of barriers for US exports of similar products before agreeing to modify duty rates on products in trade agreements with foreign countries. Violations of trade agreement provisions are immediately enforceable. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS. If the President agrees to modify tariffs and the U.S. Trade Representative finds barriers not reduced or new ones imposed, the modification will be withdrawn until Congress receives a certification. The Trade Representative will investigate if a petition is filed by an interested party. The United States Trade Representative will investigate a petition filed by an interested party alleging elements for the withdrawal or modification of an existing duty. An interested party is defined as a manufacturer, producer, wholesaler, certified union, recognized union, or group of workers in the United States. The United States Trade Representative will investigate petitions filed by interested parties, such as manufacturers, producers, wholesalers, unions, or workers, seeking the withdrawal or modification of existing duties on domestic products. The USTR must make a determination within 45 days of the petition being filed. Upon receiving a petition under subsection (b), the United States Trade Representative will assess if it meets the criteria for withdrawing or modifying existing duties under subsection (a). The petitioner will be informed of this determination along with the reasons for it. SEC. 5. Market access assessment by United States International Trade Commission. The United States International Trade Commission will investigate and report on market access opportunities for US industries if the President seeks to modify existing duties in a trade agreement with a foreign country. The report will identify tariff and nontariff measures for similar products and expected export opportunities. Consultation will be conducted during the report preparation. The United States International Trade Commission will gather information from various sources and submit a report to relevant parties and Congress within a specified timeframe when the President intends to enter into trade negotiations. The report will be unclassified but may include a classified annex if needed."
