    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Building upon Unique Indian Learning and Development Act\". It includes an In-School Facility Innovation Program Contest. The \"Building upon Unique Indian Learning and Development Act\" establishes an in-school facility innovation program contest for institutions of higher education, including Tribal Colleges and Universities, to improve school facilities for tribal schools and those served by the Bureau of Indian Education. An advisory group for the contest includes students from Tribal Colleges, a Bureau of Indian Education representative, and engineering and fiscal advisors. The Secretary of the Interior will submit finalists to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. Winners of the program contest will be determined and awarded recognition and reward. The Department of the Interior and Department of Education will establish a Joint Oversight Board to coordinate assistance and resources for Native American students. The Board will facilitate communication and collaboration on education policies, resource access, budgeting, and leadership development. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to improve support for teachers and administrators of Native American students by establishing a teacher and administrator pipeline specifically for this group. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities to create or expand a teacher or administrator pipeline for Native American students. Eligible entities include local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and nonprofit organizations. Priority will be given to Tribal Colleges and Universities in grant awards. The program funded by the grants will prepare, recruit, and provide continuing education for teachers and administrators of Native American students. The grant program aims to provide continuing education for teachers and administrators of Native American students in subjects like STEM, health professions, and green skills. Incentives such as scholarships, loan forgiveness, and housing allowances are offered to those serving high-need tribal schools. Additionally, a culturally-based school and community orientation is developed for new educators and administrators.

Additionally, a culturally-based school and community orientation is developed for new educators and administrators. Native American student support is emphasized. (a) Standards-Based Assessments.--Section 1111(b)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to require States to develop standards-based education assessments to accommodate diverse learning styles, in consultation with Indian tribes or Tribal Colleges and Universities. These assessments may be used in place of general assessments.\n(b) Support.--The Secretary of Education will expand programs to provide support for Native American school children's learning. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct research on culture- and language-based education to improve education and health outcomes. Section 1119 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to exempt Native language teachers from the requirements of highly qualified teachers. Each State may use alternative licensure or certification for Native language teachers. Each State educational agency must collaborate with Indian tribes or Tribal Colleges to develop a licensure or certification process for Native language teachers. The Grant Program for Native American Languages is reauthorized until 2019. Increased access to resources for tribal schools, schools served by the Bureau of Indian Education, and Native American students is addressed in Section 6. The Secretary of Education ensures that Department of Education programs providing grants, contracts, or assistance for schools must reserve funding for Bureau-funded schools or schools operated by a tribe or tribal organization. The Secretary of Education reserves funding for Bureau-funded schools or schools operated by a tribe or tribal organization under the Education Amendments of 1978. This includes prekindergarten, early childhood programs, elementary, and secondary schools. The Department of Education reserves funds for prekindergarten and early childhood programs. If the existing reservation is less than 0.5 percent, it will be increased to 0.5 percent; if it is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, it will be maintained. The Department of Education reserves 0.5 percent of funds for elementary, secondary, prekindergarten, and early childhood programs. These reserved funds must align with specific grant, contract, or assistance program uses as determined by the Secretary of Education. The Secretary of Education may allocate funds for technical assistance or capacity building to help schools or programs compete for grants. This is done regardless of other laws. Additionally, a new section is added to ensure safe and healthy schools for Native American students. SEC. 4131. Safe and healthy schools for Native American students. The Secretary shall establish programs to improve school environments and student skill development for healthy choices for Native American students, including prevention of alcohol and drug misuse, suicide, violence, pregnancy, and obesity, as well as nutritious eating, anger, and conflict management programs. Additionally, a program for school dropout prevention and collaboration with the Secretary of Agriculture to establish tribal-school specific school gardens and nutrition programs within the tribal cultural context will be implemented. Funds for Impact Aid are authorized and appropriated for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018. Additionally, forward funding is allocated for Tribal Colleges. Authorized funds of $31,500,000 for fiscal year 2016 are allocated for various programs including those under title V of the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development, institutional operations grants for specific universities, scholarships, and adult education. These funds will be available from July 1, 2016, through September 30, 2017. Scholarships and adult education funding allocated under the Snyder Act of 1921. SEC. 9. DEFINITION OF TRIBAL SCHOOL. The term 'tribal school' is defined as a school funded by the Bureau, operated by an Indian tribe or organization, located on Indian lands, or with a predominance of Native American students. The term \"tribal school\" refers to a school with a majority of Native American or Alaska Native students, as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
