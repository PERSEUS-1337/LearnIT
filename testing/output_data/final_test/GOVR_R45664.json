    "content": "The federal AML regime requires \"financial institutions\" to comply with AML regulations and criminalizes money laundering. The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) is central to this regime, mandating AML programs, transaction reporting, and recordkeeping for covered institutions. Financial institutions must establish AML programs with internal policies, a compliance officer, employee training, and independent audits. They must report large currency transactions and suspicious activities to FinCEN. Regulations require them to maintain records, including for large transactions and taxpayer identification numbers. Money services businesses are also required to register with FinCEN and comply with AML regulations. MSBs, including money transmitters, must register with FinCEN and comply with AML regulations. Operating an unlicensed money transmitting business is a federal crime. Federal law imposes various Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements on financial institutions, including the criminalization of money laundering and related conduct. Specifically, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1) makes it illegal to conduct financial transactions involving proceeds from unlawful activities with the intent to promote illegal activities or engage in tax evasion or fraud. Failure to comply with registration requirements for money transmitting businesses or involvement in the transmission of funds derived from criminal activities is also prohibited. The \"Spending Statute\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957 prohibits monetary transactions involving criminally derived property valued over $10,000. It aims to prevent the concealment or disguise of proceeds from unlawful activities and avoid transaction reporting requirements. Section 1957 of the Spending Statute prohibits spending proceeds from unlawful activities over $10,000, even if not for promoting illegal activities or concealing origins. FinCEN has not updated BSA regulations for virtual currencies, leading prosecutors to analyze transactions under existing legal categories. FinCEN's 2013 guidance clarified that virtual currency \"users\" are not MSBs, while \"administrators\" and \"exchangers\" may be subject to federal registration requirements. Virtual currency users are not considered MSBs, while administrators and exchangers may qualify as MSBs subject to federal registration requirements. Administrators are those who put virtual currency into circulation and have the authority to withdraw it, while exchangers are involved in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency or other virtual currency. They may be classified as money transmitters and MSBs if they accept or transmit convertible virtual currency. Federal prosecutors and regulators have pursued cases involving federal AML law applied to virtual currencies, bringing money-laundering charges against operators of online marketplaces and virtual currency payment systems. FinCEN has taken civil enforcement actions against virtual currency exchangers for non-compliance with AML program requirements. Federal prosecutors have charged creators of online marketplaces for money laundering involving virtual currency transactions. One notable case involved the shutdown of Silk Road in 2013, a criminal marketplace facilitating illegal transactions. The site's creator was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering for transactions related to narcotics trafficking and computer hacking. The creator of Silk Road was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering for facilitating illegal transactions involving narcotics trafficking and computer hacking. The defense argued that Bitcoin transactions on the site did not qualify as \"financial transactions\" under Section 1956, but the court disagreed, ruling that transactions involving Bitcoin can be considered as such. The court ruled that transactions involving Bitcoin can qualify as \"financial transactions\" under Section 1956 because they involve the movement of funds, which includes money used to buy things. This allows for money laundering using Bitcoin, as seen in the case of the creator of AlphaBay facing money-laundering conspiracy charges. The prosecutors alleged that AlphaBay's creator facilitated the exchange of virtual currencies for illegal goods and services, leading to charges of money laundering and operating unlicensed money transmitting businesses. However, these charges were dropped after the creator's death in 2017. Federal prosecutors have also targeted developers of virtual currency payment systems designed for illicit transactions and money laundering. Federal prosecutors have charged e-Gold and its founders with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business due to its use in various illegal activities. The system was widely accepted for fraudulent transactions and child exploitation due to its user anonymity. The prosecutors alleged that e-Gold operated as an \"unlicensed money transmitting business\" by lacking a state money transmitter license, failing to comply with federal registration requirements, and being involved in transmitting funds derived from criminal activities. The defendants argued that the law only applies to businesses facilitating cash transactions, not virtual currency. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the defendants' argument that e-Gold was not a \"money transmitting business\" under Section 1960, stating that it must comply with federal registration requirements and is involved in transmitting funds derived from criminal activities. The court rejected the defendants' argument that e-Gold was not a \"money transmitting business\" under Section 1960, stating that it must comply with federal registration requirements. It also determined that e-Gold qualified as a \"money transmitting business\" under Section 5330, as it transferred funds on behalf of the public. The court concluded that e-Gold was considered a \"money transmitting business\" under Section 5330, despite not processing cash transactions, as it was required to file CTRs and met the statutory definition. In May 2013, federal prosecutors charged the founder of Liberty Reserve with conspiracy to commit money laundering, international money laundering, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Liberty Reserve facilitated criminal activity by helping criminals conduct illegal transactions and launder proceeds. Liberty Reserve allegedly facilitated a broad range of criminal activities, including identity theft, credit card fraud, computer hacking, child pornography, and narcotics trafficking by allowing users to set up accounts using fake names and hide their account numbers. Prosecutors claimed it laundered over $6 billion between 2006 and 2013. The founder argued against operating an unlicensed money transmitting business charge, but the court rejected the argument. The Southern District of New York rejected the argument that virtual currencies are not \"funds\" under Section 1960, citing their use in financial transactions. Liberty Reserve's founder was convicted of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and money laundering. FinCEN has taken enforcement actions against virtual currency exchangers for AML program failures and failure to report suspicious transactions, including a $700,000 penalty against Ripple Labs, Inc. in 2015. Ripple Labs, Inc. faced a $700,000 civil penalty for failure to register as a MSB and implement an effective AML program. Despite being the second-largest virtual currency by market capitalization at the time, Ripple sold XRP without proper registration until 2013. While its subsidiary eventually registered with FinCEN, it allegedly did not fulfill its AML obligations under the BSA, leading to inadequate controls and failure to adhere to know-your-customer requirements during transactions. In response to FinCEN's allegations, Ripple and its subsidiary agreed to a settlement, paying a $700,000 civil penalty for failing to adhere to know-your-customer requirements and not filing suspicious activity reports. FinCEN also took enforcement action against BTC-e for facilitating illegal transactions and violating MSB registration and AML program requirements. Virtual currencies like BTC-e have attracted criminals due to features such as anonymity, lack of regulations, and ease of international transfers. FinCEN imposed a $110 million penalty on BTC-e for failing to file SARs on suspicious transactions. The Treasury Department's 2018 Money Laundering Risk Assessment identified virtual currencies as a vulnerability in U.S. AML efforts. The 116th Congress introduced bills to address the challenges of virtual currencies in U.S. AML efforts, including commissioning agency analyses and clarifying FinCEN's powers. Legal uncertainty is also a challenge for prosecutors, regulators, and participants in virtual currency transactions due to applying traditional financial institution regulations to novel business models. Some judges require more explicit indicia of congressional intent for applying existing law to virtual currency business models. Legal certainty is needed to maintain the US's position as a leader in technological innovation. A legislative proposal aims to exempt blockchain developers from certain money transmitter requirements. The House passed bills in January 2019 to study the use of virtual currencies for illicit purposes. The Financial Technology Protection Act proposes the establishment of an Independent Financial Technology Task Force to combat terrorism and illicit financing. The Task Force would conduct research on terrorist and illicit use of new financial technologies, develop legislative proposals, and report findings to Congress annually. Additionally, the bill includes programs to incentivize the public to assist in combating the illicit use of virtual currencies, offering rewards for information leading to convictions. The bill H.R. 56 aims to detect terrorist and illicit use of digital currencies through a grant program. It has passed the House and is now with the Senate Committee on Banking. Another bill, H.R. 428, focuses on assessing terrorists' use of virtual currencies by conducting a threat assessment. H.R. 502, the FIND Trafficking Act, directs a study on virtual currencies' role in sex and drug trafficking. H.R. 56 and H.R. 1414 also passed the House and are under Senate review for combating terrorist financing and improving FinCEN. In 2019, the House passed H.R. 1414, the FinCEN Improvement Act clarifying FinCEN's power to coordinate with foreign financial intelligence units on antiterrorism and AML initiatives involving emerging technologies. H.R. 528, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, introduced in January 2019, aims to create a safe harbor for certain blockchain developers from money transmitter licensing requirements. The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, H.R. 528, aims to provide a safe harbor for blockchain developers from licensing requirements. It clarifies that developers who do not control users' digital currency qualify as noncontrolling providers. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services and the House Committee on the Judiciary in January 2019."
