The Congress finds that millions of Americans have eye diseases and vision problems, with refractive errors affecting many adults. Despite the belief that half of blindness cases can be prevented, the number of visually impaired individuals is expected to double by 2030. Vision loss can greatly impact daily activities without proper rehabilitation and skills training. Vision impairment in preschoolers can affect learning ability, personality, and adjustment in school. Blindness and visual impairment incur significant costs to the Federal Government and the US economy annually. Vision rehabilitation helps individuals with vision loss live independently and safely at home and in the community. The Department of Health and Human Services focuses on reducing medication errors, improving daily activities, and preventing accidents for older individuals with vision loss. Efforts are needed at all levels to raise awareness about vision loss, early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. The Congress emphasizes the need for a comprehensive public health strategy to address vision loss, including communication, education, research, and policy changes. SEC. 3. VISION LOSS PREVENTION. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include preventive health measures for vision loss. The Secretary will expand programs to increase awareness of vision problems, emphasizing early diagnosis and prevention strategies through public service announcements and partnerships with eye-health organizations. The Secretary will expand programs to increase awareness of vision problems, emphasizing early diagnosis and prevention strategies through public service announcements and partnerships with eye-health organizations. Professional organizations conduct community disease prevention campaigns, testing, evaluation, and model training for vision screeners, and evaluate strategies to reduce barriers to access to treatment by optometrists and ophthalmologists. The Secretary will establish appropriate measurements for public awareness of vision problems, determine the effectiveness of existing campaigns, and set quantitative benchmarks. The Secretary will expand surveillance, epidemiology, and health services research activities to establish a scientific knowledge base on vision problem prevention, control, and rehabilitation. This includes creating a national surveillance system and testing screening modalities. Additionally, quantitative benchmarks will be established to determine the effectiveness of these activities, with a report to Congress due within 12 months of enactment. The Secretary will expand research to establish a knowledge base on vision problem prevention, control, and rehabilitation. This includes creating a national surveillance system, testing screening modalities, evaluating strategies to reduce barriers to treatment access, assessing efficacy and cost-effectiveness of interventions, updating knowledge on costs of vision problems, and requiring the Surgeon General to assess vision care in the US. The Secretary may build partnerships with various organizations, work with healthcare systems to address vision problems, and award grants for community outreach on vision loss. Expansion of vision programs under the Maternal and Child Health Service Block Grant Program includes introducing core performance measures on eye health by incorporating vision screening and examination standards into State programs based on scientific studies. Additionally, there is a focus on prevention and treatment for underserved, minority, and other populations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will expand and intensify vision programs to prevent vision loss, treat eye conditions, and rehabilitate individuals who are blind or partially sighted in underserved communities. This includes providing vision care services at community health centers and vision rehabilitation programs at agencies, clinics, and hospitals. Additionally, voluntary guidelines for vision screening quality and appropriate referrals will be developed in consultation with professional organizations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will expand vision programs to prevent vision loss, treat eye conditions, and rehabilitate individuals in underserved communities.
