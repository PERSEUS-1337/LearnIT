    "content": "The Immigration and Nationality Act allocates 140,000 visas annually for economic immigrants, with over 120,000 allocated to three employment-based preference categories. These categories include individuals with extraordinary abilities, advanced degree holders, and skilled workers. The competition for talent in STEM fields has intensified globally, with concerns about brain drain. In recent years, concerns about brain drain from developing nations due to educational and career opportunities are not frequently expressed. Instead, there are warnings of a \"reverse brain drain\" in the US due to insufficient visas for high-skilled immigrants. STEM job growth has outpaced non-STEM jobs, leading to a record number of STEM graduates entering the US labor market. Analysts note negative wage growth in technology-related occupations. Wage growth in recent years has been negative in technology-related occupations, where highly-educated foreign nationals often work. Two-thirds of STEM degree holders in the US are employed in non-STEM fields. The definition of STEM varies, with the National Science Foundation broadly including various fields. The Department of Homeland Security's definition of STEM excludes economics, sociology, and political science. International students pursuing STEM degrees in the United States are part of a long tradition of foreign students studying at U.S. institutions of higher education. Congress has strengthened reporting requirements for educational institutions with foreign students, who are known as nonimmigrants. The most common visa for foreign students is the F-1 visa. The F-1 visa is for international students pursuing full-time academic education in the US. Spouses and children can accompany F-1 visa holders on F-2 visas but cannot work. Students on F visas are generally not allowed off-campus employment but can engage in practical training related to their degree program. The number of foreign graduate students in science, engineering, and health fields has been increasing, with a significant rise after 1999. The percentage of STEM graduate students with temporary visas in 2009 was comparable to 1990 despite the increase in foreign student enrollment. Engineering fields have shown the most growth in recent years, with a significant number of foreign students earning doctoral and master's degrees in STEM fields. Engineering is the leading field for both MA and Ph.D. recipients, followed by computer science for MA degrees and mathematics and physical sciences for Ph.D. degrees. In 2009, India was the top sending country for STEM graduates enrolled in masters degree programs, representing 56% of all STEM students. Chinese students placed second at 15% and were more evenly distributed across STEM fields. China sent the most STEM students for doctoral degrees, making up 35% of all foreign nationals. In 2009, Chinese Ph.D. students made up almost half of all foreign nationals in mathematics and physical sciences, and roughly a third in other STEM fields. Indian doctoral degree students represented 16% of STEM doctorates. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 authorized visas for highly skilled foreign workers, enabling employment-based temporary admissions. Today, various temporary visa categories allow foreign workers to perform work ranging from professional to jobs requiring extraordinary ability. F-1 foreign students can participate in employment after completing their studies. F-1 foreign students can participate in Optional Practical Training (OPT) related to their major field of study for up to 12 months. In STEM fields, the OPT work period was extended to 29 months in 2008. To qualify for the 17-month extension, students must have a STEM degree, work for E-Verify employers, and have already completed 12 months of OPT. In FY2010, 92,465 F-1 visa holders were engaged in OPT, making up 18% of all active F-1 foreign students. STEM graduates on OPT are among the 82,206 F-1 students in the \"Post-Completion\" category. An additional 10,022 F-1 students received a 17-month OPT extension in STEM fields. Many F-1 visa holders, especially those on OPT, transition to H-1B professional specialty worker status. The H-1B visa has an annual cap of 65,000, but exemptions exist for certain categories like returning workers and those working for universities or nonprofit research facilities. H-1B visas are common in STEM fields but not limited to them, requiring applicants to demonstrate education and work qualifications to USCIS. H-1B nonimmigrants must demonstrate education and work experience for posted positions. The labor attestation, a three-page form, is the first step for an employer to bring in an H-1B foreign worker. It is a statement of intent regarding wages and working conditions. An alien can stay up to six years on an H-1B visa. In FY2011, 218,500 H-1B professional specialty worker petitions were approved, down from a high of 288,000 in FY2004. The law sets a numerical limit of 65,000 H-1B workers each year, with exceptions for certain categories like those working for universities and nonprofit research facilities. Up to 20,000 aliens holding a master's or higher degree are also exempt from the cap. Over the past decade, more H-1B workers were approved outside the 65,000 cap. Not all approved H-1B workers use the visa. In FY2010, 91,000 H-1B workers were in computer-related occupations, making up 47% of all beneficiaries. Other occupations included architectural/engineering, education, administrative, and health/medicine. Total H-1B beneficiaries in FY2010 were 192,990. In FY2010, 192,990 H-1B beneficiaries were approved, with computer systems design employing 34% of them. Colleges and universities employed 10% of the beneficiaries, while other sectors like management consulting and architecture employed around 3% each. 38% of beneficiaries were not employed in the top sectors, indicating a diverse distribution across industries. The TN and E-3 visas are similar to H-1B visas, designated for temporary professional workers from specific countries based on trade agreements. TN visas are for Canadian and Mexican workers under NAFTA, while E-3 visas are for Australian citizens. These visas require employment in a specialty occupation but do not need a labor attestation. Other nonimmigrant visas for foreign students with STEM degrees include J visas for cultural exchange workers, L visas for multinational executives, and specialists. Foreign students with STEM degrees often transition to employment-based LPR status through H-1B visas or OPT extensions. Employers may hire these graduates during their programs and extend their visas to allow for H-1B petitions in successive years. If the temporary workers meet expectations, employers can also petition for them to become LPRs. Foreign workers meeting expectations can be petitioned by employers to become LPRs through employment-based immigration categories. Most LPRs annually adjust status within the United States, with many originally entering as foreign students or temporary workers. H-1B visa holders can petition for LPR status concurrently with their H-1B visa application, under the dual-intent policy exception. Admissions and adjustments for LPR status are subject to numerical limits and preference categories based on family relationships, skills, and geographic diversity. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes an annual worldwide level of 140,000 employment-based preference immigrants, including accompanying family members. The employment-based preference categories include priority workers, members of professions with advanced degrees, skilled workers, and special immigrants like religious workers. The Immigration and Nationality Act sets an annual worldwide level of 140,000 employment-based preference immigrants, including priority workers, advanced degree holders, skilled workers, and special immigrants like religious workers. The employment-based visas make up 14.2% of the total 1 million LPRs in FY2010. Foreign nationals with STEM degrees may qualify under various preference categories based on talent, education, expertise, and experience. Employers must petition DOL for prospective employment-based immigrants in the second and third preference categories. Foreign nationals with STEM degrees may qualify under various preference categories based on talent, education, expertise, and experience. DOL issues labor certification if a shortage exists in the occupation, otherwise extensive recruitment efforts are required. From FY2000-FY2009, 145,390 foreign nationals qualified as first preference principals, with 21% in STEM occupations. Almost half of them were in executive, administrative, or managerial professions. 61% of second preference principals were in STEM occupations during the same period. During FY2000-FY2009, STEM occupations were dominant among foreign nationals admitted as professionals or persons of exceptional ability. 45% of third preference principals worked in STEM fields, making up 44% of all employment-based principals in the first, second, and third preference categories. In total, 297,668 LPRs reported working in STEM occupations during this decade. During FY2000-FY2009, 52% of LPRs in STEM occupations entered as third preference principals. The volume of pending employment-based immigration cases is crucial in the STEM debate. USCIS maintains an I-485 Inventory of approved applications, providing data on approved employment-based LPRs adjusting status in the US. This data excludes new arrivals from abroad. STEM graduates seeking LPR status often face waiting times. STEM graduates seeking LPR status may face long wait times, but those with extraordinary ability or advanced degrees have shorter waits. USCIS has not approved many third preference I-485 applications since 2007 visa retrogression. Legislative proposals for STEM visas emerged in the mid-2000s to retain STEM graduates and enable them to adjust to LPR status without waiting in the queue. Legislative action on STEM visas stalled in 2007 along with Comprehensive Immigration Reform efforts. Senate-passed legislation (S. 2611) included provisions for STEM visas, allowing foreign nationals with advanced STEM degrees to adjust to LPR status. In 2007, legislative proposals in the 110th Congress aimed to create STEM visas for foreign students with advanced STEM degrees to become LPRs without needing to show intent to leave the US. This was part of Comprehensive Immigration Reform efforts that ultimately failed. In the 112th Congress, there is renewed interest in establishing STEM visas for foreign students with advanced degrees in STEM fields. Several bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate, including H.R. 399, H.R. 2161, H.R. 3146, H.R. 5893, H.R. 6412, H.R. 6429, S. 1965, S. 1986, S. 3185, S. 3192, and S. 3217. These bills aim to allow foreign students to pursue Optional Practical Training for up to 24 months after completing their degree and require employers to pay them the prevailing wage. The IDEA Act of 2011, American Innovation and Education Act of 2011, and STEM Visa Act of 2011 include immigration provisions for STEM visas. They establish a priority worker immigrant visa for those with a STEM degree from a U.S. institution and an employment offer. These bills also eliminate the foreign residency requirement for certain foreign students and allow extensions of stay based on labor certification or priority adjudication. The bills S. 1986, H.R. 2161, and H.R. 3146 propose a $2,000 fee for employers filing to hire foreign workers, with exemptions for certain organizations. The collected fees would fund a STEM scholarship program for low-income U.S. students. The STAPLE Act (H.R. 399) aims to exempt Ph.D. degree holders from numerical limitations in immigration. The INA may exempt aliens with a Ph.D. in a STEM field from numerical limitations for employment in the U.S. The Startup Act of 2011 and Startup 2.0 Act of 2012 propose a new visa for 50,000 foreign students with a master's or higher degree in STEM fields from U.S. institutions. Conditional residence status would be granted for five years in a STEM field, leading to permanent resident status. The Securing the Talent America Requires for the 21st Century Act of 2012, or STAR Act (S. 3185), aims to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery and allocate those visas to foreign STEM graduates with job offers in related fields. It also includes provisions for employers of foreign STEM master's and doctoral degree recipients to demonstrate that the alien is more qualified than any U.S. worker who applied for the job. Graduates with doctoral degrees in STEM fields would be considered shortage occupations not requiring certification from the Department of Labor under the Attracting the Best and the Brightest Act of 2012 (H.R. 6412). This bill would add 55,000 visas for foreign STEM graduates with job offers in related fields, defining STEM based on the Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs. Foreign STEM graduates would need an advanced degree from an accredited university classified by the National Science Foundation as excelling in STEM instruction. Unused visas would roll over to other employment-based categories. H.R. 6412 would amend labor certification provisions to require employers of foreign STEM graduates to submit job orders and offer wages that meet or exceed those of U.S. workers. The STEM Jobs Act of 2012 would eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery and allocate 55,000 visas to foreign STEM graduates with job offers, prioritizing those with Ph.D. degrees. The STEM Jobs Act of 2012 allocates 55,000 visas to foreign nationals with Ph.D. degrees in STEM fields from U.S. institutions. Any unused visas would go to those with M.A. degrees in STEM fields. Unused visas would not transfer to other visa categories. STEM is defined based on the Department of Education's classification. Graduates must come from research-active universities. The STEM Jobs Act of 2012 aims to allocate visas to foreign STEM graduates from research-active universities. The legislation requires employers to submit job orders for these graduates and has faced bipartisan support and opposition. A revised version of the bill has been passed by the House. The House-passed legislation, H.R. 6429, would allow unused STEM visas from fiscal years 2013-2016 to be used in future years, eliminate the requirement for STEM visa recipients to work in the US for five years, and expand the \"V\" visa for family members of LPRs. The House passed H.R. 6429 on November 30, 2012, creating additional pathways for STEM graduates to stay in the US permanently. Policymakers debate whether to establish STEM visas to retain talented individuals and address concerns about high-skilled immigrant admissions. The policy debate focuses on creating expedited immigration pathways for STEM graduate students to free up visas for other prospective immigrants. Two competing perspectives on the immigration prospects of international students with STEM degrees are discussed, along with four themes of debate: U.S. labor market needs, definitions of STEM fields, the role of colleges and universities, and broader immigration reforms. The legislative debate questions whether this policy is in the national interest, with divergent findings from two widely cited studies due to different research designs and STEM populations studied. The curr_chunk discusses two distinct approaches to studying STEM populations in the context of immigration. One approach looks at the wait times for foreign nationals with STEM degrees to become LPRs, while the other analyzes the retention rates of foreign STEM doctorates in the US. The NFAP study in 2011 examined prospective LPRs waiting for numerically limited visas. The NFAP study in 2011 estimated long wait times for foreign nationals with STEM degrees to become LPRs, with Indian and Chinese professionals facing significant delays. A worker from India applying for a third preference visa could wait up to 70 years, while a worker from China could wait up to 24 years. NFAP's analysis projected the maximum wait times for LPR visas based on petition filing dates. The NFAP study projected long wait times for foreign nationals with STEM degrees to obtain LPR status, with Indians and Chinese facing significant delays. For third preference visas, Indians could wait up to 70 years and Chinese up to 24 years. The study also highlighted shorter wait times for advanced degree holders, with Indians and Chinese facing approximately six years of wait time. NFAP suggested that exempting 50,000 visas annually for STEM graduate degree holders could eliminate the backlog within two years. Michael G. Finn's research for the National Science Foundation (NSF) shows that the stay rate for foreign nationals with science and engineering doctorates is around 64-66% after 5-10 years. The stay rate for doctorate recipients on temporary resident visas varied slightly among different cohorts. Finn's research for the National Science Foundation found that stay rates for foreign nationals with science and engineering doctorates have been increasing. Specifically, the stay rate for those graduating 10 years earlier reached an all-time high in 2009. Finn also studied prospective immigrants from China and India, noting that despite visa restrictions, there is no evidence that these restrictions have reduced stay rates for individuals from these countries. From Finn's perspective, science and engineering doctorates have the opportunity to become LPRs through extraordinary ability or advanced degrees categories. There is a consensus warning of STEM workforce shortages in the U.S., which could lead to a decline in global economic competitiveness and innovation. Proponents of STEM visas advocate for retaining more STEM graduates to prevent these potential losses. Proponents of STEM visas argue that keeping skilled immigrants in the US after they are educated here is crucial for innovation and economic competitiveness. They believe that skilled immigrants create jobs rather than take them. However, some researchers caution against creating STEM visas due to the soft labor market for some STEM occupations, pointing out higher unemployment rates in certain fields. In 2010, the unemployment rate for college graduates was 4.7%, while in 2011, chemists and material scientists faced a 6.1% unemployment rate, the highest in 40 years. Research from 2007 suggested that STEM shortages were overstated. Employers were found to use high-skilled temporary visas to recruit foreign workers at below-market rates, giving them undue control. Universities in the US graduate more STEM students than are hired each year. A policy researcher in 2011 described the science and engineering labor force as having a substantial supply, indicating a loose labor market. The debate on US labor market needs for STEM occupations continues. The debate over U.S. labor market needs for STEM fields, particularly in computer sciences, is ongoing. Microsoft projected a shortage of workers in computer science occupations, while the Economic Policy Institute critiqued this analysis. There is no consensus on the definition of STEM fields, which could lead to unintended consequences. Recent revisions in federal occupational classifications have resulted in a significant reclassification of employees. Recent revisions in federal occupational classifications have led to a significant reclassification of employees, with roughly 5% of U.S. jobs considered STEM positions. The definition of STEM fields is debated, with concerns about omitting critical disciplines in broad definitions. The engineering profession, for example, has evolved into various sub-specialties over time. Engineering has evolved into various sub-specialties, including telegraph, telephone, radio, television, and radar engineers, as well as fossil-fuel and nuclear engineers. Mining engineers are divided into metallic-ore and fossil-fuel mining engineers, with the latter further divided into coal and petroleum engineers. Today, engineering also includes computer engineers designing microchips using light pulses and biomedical engineers researching human cell structures for tissue growth. The debate over defining STEM fields includes the perspective that competency in STEM-based capabilities is more important than specific degrees. STEM competency is increasingly valued in non-STEM occupations, allowing individuals with these skills to pursue higher-paying career options. Despite the demand for STEM competencies, only a small percentage of graduates with STEM degrees end up working in STEM fields. Advocates of STEM visa legislation argue that retaining graduate students in STEM fields from U.S. institutions is crucial to prevent a brain drain and maintain competitiveness in the global economy. The United States is facing challenges in retaining foreign students with STEM degrees due to concerns about obtaining work visas. Policymakers are divided on the idea of linking LPR status to student visas, with some warning about potential consequences such as creating incentives for schools to recruit foreign students for financial gain. This issue is highlighted by reports from Australia where some institutions were criticized for \"selling education for visas.\" The consequences of Australia linking its skilled migration program with international students include concerns about former students not finding suitable employment or meeting skill needs. Experts suggest defining institutional eligibility to prevent abuse of STEM visas. Designing an immigration system that reflects the country's values and needs is a challenge. Designing an immigration system that reflects a country's values and needs is a challenge, with STEM visas being seen as merit-based options. The legislation for STEM visas has support but raises debates on what qualities prospective immigrants should bring. The J visa category, including professors and research scholars, is the broadest for cultural exchange. The J visa category for cultural exchange includes various types of participants such as professors, students, teachers, resort workers, camp counselors, and au pairs. The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs approves these programs, allowing J visa holders to work as part of their exchange program. The visas have expanded to cover a wide range of activities beyond education and research, including child care, resort work, and camp counseling. Many J visa holders come to work in the United States, with some employed in STEM fields. J visa holders come to work in the United States, with some employed in STEM fields. L visas are for multinational executive and specialist employees who must demonstrate qualifications for the job and have been employed by the firm for at least six months in the preceding three years. The alien must be employed in an executive, managerial, or specialized knowledge capacity to be eligible for the L visa, with STEM graduates likely fulfilling the specialized knowledge requirement. Firms bringing L intracompany transfers to the US must show no adverse impact on US workers to obtain a visa. International investors can enter on E-1 or E-2 visas for trade or investment purposes, requiring a treaty between the US and their country. Entrepreneurial STEM graduates often use the E-2 visa. Persons with extraordinary ability in various fields can be admitted to the United States on O visas. The O visa is reserved for those who have reached the highest level of accomplishment in their field, including sciences, arts, education, business, and athletics. In FY2010, 8,589 O-1 visas were issued by the State Department."
