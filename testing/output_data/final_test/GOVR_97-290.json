Attention has shifted to controlling pollutants from diffuse sources like urban runoff as traditional sources are better regulated. Stormwater is now recognized as a significant source of pollution. Studies have shown that stormwater discharge carries organic and toxic pollutants like oil, grease, heavy metals, and pesticides, harming water quality. Urban development removes vegetation cover and creates impervious structures, altering natural drainage patterns and causing increased runoff during wet weather. This urbanization has led to degraded conditions in downstream waterbodies, with stormwater discharges being a significant source of surface water quality issues. Stormwater discharges, including overflows from sewer systems, are a major source of surface water pollution. Congress directed EPA to implement a permit program for stormwater discharges in 1987. Despite regulatory challenges, EPA had not developed a comprehensive process for regulating stormwater discharges before. In 1987, Congress established a phased approach to permitting stormwater discharges, redesigning the Clean Water Act's approach. EPA issued regulations in 1990, with Phase I targeting large dischargers like industrial activities and municipal storm sewer systems serving over 100,000 people. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program regulates storm sewer systems serving over 100,000 people and construction projects disturbing more than 5 acres. Smaller sources may be regulated under Phase II, including cities with smaller storm sewer systems, commercial operations, and smaller construction projects. EPA manages the NPDES stormwater program in several states and territories. The NPDES program regulates storm sewer systems for large populations and construction projects over 5 acres. The 1990 permit rules covered 123,000 industrial facilities and 220 municipalities. The 1987 CWA amendments required stormwater permits to be issued within four years, but delays occurred. Regulated sources must comply with permits within three years of issuance. Permits mandate pollution prevention plans. The NPDES program regulates storm sewer systems for large populations and construction projects over 5 acres. Permits require dischargers to implement pollution prevention plans, with municipalities also needing to develop stormwater management programs. The number of stormwater permittees exceeds half a million, outnumbering wastewater permittees more than five-fold. Industries involved in manufacturing, processing, or storing raw materials are included in the regulatory program. Industries manufacturing, processing, or storing raw materials must apply for NPDES permits under the Phase I program. Specific industries identified in EPA's 1990 regulation include mining, lumber, paper, printing, chemicals, metals, and powerplants. Facilities can comply by obtaining individual or group permits, with deadlines for submission. The EPA implemented a two-step process for industrial facilities to comply with stormwater management requirements. Facilities had the option to submit a list of facilities to be covered by a certain date and provide more detailed information by a later date. A third option was available through a general permit procedure, which covered discharges from multiple facilities. This approach aimed to streamline the permitting process and reduce costs by requiring less extensive testing and control requirements. Permits for stormwater discharges from industrial and construction activities require a pollution prevention plan and compliance within six months. EPA issued general permits for activities disturbing 5 acres or more in four states. Most states with permitting authority follow similar general permits to reduce administrative burden. Congress extended deadlines for stormwater permitting for industrial facilities twice. The EPA regulations for stormwater requirements focus on municipalities with separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) and industrial activities. The Phase I regulations apply to medium and large cities, requiring them to develop stormwater management programs and submit periodic reports. EPA regulations required cities to provide information on stormwater discharges, with Phase I covering 173 cities and parts of 47 urban counties. Smaller cities were exempt until 1992, leading to delays in issuing regulations. EPA formed an advisory committee in 1995 to develop rules by 1999. EPA issued a final Phase II rule in 1999, extending Phase I to require permits for two additional classes of dischargers nationwide. This rule aimed to make 3,000 more river miles safe for boating annually and protect up to 500,000 people a year from illness due to swimming in contaminated waters. The 1999 Phase II rule extended permits to cover construction activities disturbing 1-5 acres of land and separate storm sewer systems serving specific facilities. Small cities and construction activities causing no water quality impairment can get waivers. Covered facilities had to apply for NPDES permit coverage by March 2003. Facilities had to apply for NPDES permit coverage by March 2003 under the Phase II rule, implementing stormwater management programs with minimum controls to reduce pollutant discharges. Municipal industrial activities needed permit coverage on the same schedule as other facilities. EPA aimed for a nationally applicable program with administrative flexibility, encouraging the use of general permits for most dischargers. The EPA's decision to exclude construction sites smaller than 1 acre and industrial facilities with \"no exposure\" to stormwater reduced coverage by 76,000 facilities. Despite efforts to provide flexibility, many regulated entities criticized the stormwater program's scope, citing underestimated costs of compliance. Cities of all sizes have complained about the difficulties and expenses of adhering to EPA regulations. Cities of all sizes struggle with complying with EPA regulations due to lack of financial assistance for stormwater programs. The main source of funding is the state revolving fund loan program, but competition for funds is intense. Many municipal and industrial dischargers covered by the Phase I and Phase II programs are reaching the end of their initial permit terms. The agency is implementing a streamlined reapplication process for permit renewals, focusing on managing stormwater runoff using best management practices (BMPs) to prevent water quality degradation. The GAO criticized the EPA for not evaluating the effectiveness and costs of the stormwater pollution program, which includes nonstructural and structural measures. Implementation of Phases I and II has been slow, with delays in permitting and disputes causing issues for many communities. The GAO criticized EPA for not evaluating the effectiveness and costs of the stormwater pollution program. Implementation of Phases I and II has been slow, with delays in permitting and disputes causing issues for many communities. EPA's regulations provide flexibility but lack complete and consistent cost data, hindering assessment of program burden. Litigation in 2003 challenged the Phase II rules, which allowed general permits for MS4 stormwater discharges. The court directed EPA to revise Phase II rules to address procedural shortcomings regarding the review and availability of NOIs. EPA issued revised MS4 rules in 2016, allowing states to choose between two options for increasing scrutiny of compliance with MS4s' plants. The final rule on MS4 permits allows permitting authorities flexibility in establishing requirements through a two-step process. States generally support the flexibility but some express concerns about increased time and costs. Environmentalists have mixed reactions, with some seeing tighter controls while others worry about reduced public oversight. In 1999, Congress directed EPA to submit an impact analysis before issuing the final Phase II rule on stormwater management. Legislation was introduced in the 106th Congress to exempt small construction sites and drainage ditches from permitting requirements, but EPA opposed it citing water pollution concerns. The 107th Congress enacted legislation to address program impacts and costs. In response to concerns about program impacts and costs, the 107th Congress allowed states to use Section 319 grant funds for Phase II stormwater program projects in FY2003. Legislation to extend this authority was introduced in the 108th Congress but not enacted. EPA proposed a two-year extension for small oil and gas construction sites to assess economic impact. EPA initially assumed most facilities would be exempt from Phase II rules, but newer data showed up to 30,000 new sites. In March 2005, EPA extended the exemption for small oil and gas construction sites until June 2006 for further study. The postponement did not affect other industries, construction sites, or small cities covered by the 1999 rule. Legislation in the 109th Congress addressed the exemption of oil and gas exploration and production facilities from compliance with stormwater runoff regulations. The legislation in the 109th Congress amended the Clean Water Act to exempt construction activities at oil and gas sites from stormwater rules, aiming to exclude uncontaminated stormwater discharges during drilling setup. Oil and gas officials supported the provision, citing burdensome permitting requirements, while opponents argued it was unnecessary and lacked evidence of reduced pollution compared to other construction activities regulated by the EPA. EPA implemented a rule to enforce this section. In 2006, EPA implemented a rule under Section 323 of the Clean Water Act, which was later deemed arbitrary and capricious by a federal court and vacated. The rule broadened the scope of contamination exemptions to include sediment in stormwater discharges. EPA planned to issue a revised rule to comply with the court's decision but has not proposed any revisions yet. Legislation to repeal Section 323 was introduced in the 109th Congress. Legislation to repeal Section 323 of the Clean Water Act was introduced in the 109th Congress, but no further action occurred. In subsequent Congresses, similar bills were introduced to repeal the exemption for oil and gas operations, but none were enacted. Congress often relies on federal agencies to test new policy approaches, as seen in legislation passed in 2007 requiring strict stormwater runoff requirements for development. The legislation mandates federal agencies to enforce strict stormwater runoff requirements for development projects involving federal facilities to reduce runoff and pollutants. Agencies must use strategies to maintain or restore the property's predevelopment hydrology. EPA issued guidance offering two options: retaining the 95th percentile rainfall event or conducting site-specific hydrologic analysis. The EPA issued guidance in response to an executive order, allowing flexibility in selecting stormwater control practices. In 2010, Congress passed legislation requiring federal agencies to pay local fees for managing stormwater runoff, amending CWA Section 313. In 2010, federal agencies refused to pay stormwater fees in DC, arguing it was a tax they were exempt from. Legislation clarified that agencies must pay local stormwater fees, signed by President Obama in January 2011. A dispute arose over retroactive fees, leading to a federal court case with the Bonneville Power Administration. In 2012, a federal district court ruled that a Clean Water Act amendment clarifying \"service charges\" was retroactive. The government did not appeal. EPA requested a review of stormwater regulations in 2006, leading to a report in 2009 calling for major changes. The 2009 report recommended major changes to EPA's stormwater control program, focusing on regulating stormwater runoff volume and quality through direct land use controls and monitoring of waterbodies. The current regulation of stormwater is hindered by a statute that overlooks discharge volume. The NRC report suggested adopting a watershed-based permitting system for all discharges affecting waterways in a drainage basin. The 2009 report recommended changes to EPA's stormwater control program, suggesting a watershed-based permitting system for all discharges in a drainage basin. The proposed strategy would require MS4 permittees to control all stormwater discharges and implement watershed-based permits. The report criticized EPA's current approach for lacking enforcement and adequate resources, leading to limited water quality benefits. EPA has started information-gathering and public dialogue activities for possible regulatory changes. EPA initiated information-gathering and public dialogue activities in response to the NRC's criticism of inconsistency in stormwater requirements nationally. The agency proposed collecting data on current regulatory programs, management practices, pollution prevention technologies, and BMPs for stormwater discharges from newly developed and redeveloped sites. This effort was part of developing a rule to revise the existing stormwater regulatory program, following a 2010 settlement agreement with environmental litigants. EPA committed to revising stormwater rules to control discharges from newly developed sites, with a focus on the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Public input was sought through listening sessions and surveys, despite criticism from industry groups. Industry groups criticized possible expansion of EPA's stormwater regulation program, arguing that regulation should be done at the state and local level. Some states have their own stormwater management programs, particularly in the Northeast and Northwest. Commenters urged EPA to ensure flexible performance standards for reducing storm runoff. Cost concerns were also raised by states and municipalities. Cost concerns have been raised by some states and municipalities regarding the potential economic burden of mandatory retrofit requirements for stormwater management. While some government representatives support a national rule for uniformity, the EPA is exploring options to strengthen regulations for stormwater discharges from new development and redevelopment. Existing rules for MS4s lack specific management practices or standards. The EPA is considering a \"post-construction rule\" to regulate stormwater discharges from developed sites like subdivisions, roadways, and industrial facilities. The rule aims to ensure that runoff levels post-development are equivalent to pre-construction levels by setting stormwater retention standards. This would prevent pollutants from entering sewer systems by retaining rainfall on-site. The EPA is working on a post-construction rule to regulate stormwater discharges from developed sites, aiming to prevent pollutants from entering sewer systems by retaining rainfall on-site. Republican members of Congress have shown interest in the stormwater rulemaking process, urging EPA to seek input from small businesses. Despite missed deadlines, EPA is still working towards proposing national stormwater regulations. The environmental plaintiffs notified the EPA of a breach in the legal settlement regarding the post-construction stormwater rule. EPA and the plaintiffs were at a legal impasse, with the agency continuing work on the rule while environmental groups considered further legal action. Finalizing the rule was complicated by analytic issues such as calculating costs and benefits, incorporating flexibility, and allowing states with equivalent stormwater programs to regulate in lieu of EPA. In March 2014, EPA announced deferring action on the rule and instead providing incentives and technical assistance for cities to address stormwater runoff themselves. The EPA will strengthen municipal stormwater permits by promoting green infrastructure. While a national stormwater rule was discontinued, the agency continues to emphasize on-site retention of stormwater and green infrastructure in individual MS4 permits. States with delegated permitting authority are being encouraged to strengthen their permits. Groups are pursuing a permit-by-permit approach to encourage states to strengthen new and reissued MS4 permits."
