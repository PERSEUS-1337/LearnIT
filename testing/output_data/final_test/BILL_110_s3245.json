    "content": "The \"Justice Integrity Act of 2008\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. Congress acknowledges the need for fair application of the law and recognizes racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system. Various factors contribute to these disparities, including differences in criminal activity levels and potential racial discrimination or bias. Understanding these factors is crucial for addressing the disparate impact on the criminal justice system. Programs promoting fairness can address disparities in the criminal justice system, increase public confidence, enhance safety, and support justice. The pilot program is established. The Attorney General will establish a pilot program in 10 US districts to promote fairness in the Federal criminal justice system and determine if legislation is needed. 10 US Attorneys will implement plans to gather racial and ethnic data on investigations and prosecutions to address disparities. The pilot program in 10 US districts aims to address disparities in the criminal justice system by analyzing community perceptions of bias, reducing unwarranted disparities, and ensuring law enforcement decisions are not influenced by racial or ethnic bias. Recommendations will be made to increase confidence in the system. The 10 pilot districts for the program will vary in size, case load, geography, and racial composition. At least 3 of the designated US Attorneys will be in metropolitan areas. SEC. 4. PLAN AND REPORT. Each United States Attorney must develop and implement a plan with an advisory group appointed within 90 days after designation by the Attorney General, in consultation with the chief judge and criminal justice professionals. The advisory group should include senior social scientists. The advisory group for each United States Attorney's plan should include senior social scientists and individuals involved in the criminal justice process such as prosecutors, defenders, judges, and law enforcement officials. The advisory group for each United States Attorney's plan should include various representatives such as parole and probation officers, correctional officers, victim's rights representatives, civil rights organizations, business and professional representatives, and faith-based organizations involved in criminal justice work. Members of the advisory group are subject to a 5-year term limit, with certain members being permanent. The advisory group for each United States Attorney's plan includes the chief judge, Federal defender, and United States Attorney for the judicial district. A reporter may be designated by the United States Attorney, and members are considered independent contractors. The advisory group appointed by the United States Attorney's Office are independent contractors when performing official duties and are not prohibited from practicing law before any court. The group is responsible for collecting and analyzing data on the race and ethnicity of defendants and victims at each stage of prosecution. The advisory group appointed by the United States Attorney's Office collects data on racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system, including charges, diversion, plea offers, sentencing recommendations, fast-track sentencing, and alternative sanctions. They aim to analyze cumulative racial or ethnic disadvantage and determine if disparities are due to discrimination, insensitivity, or unconscious bias. The advisory group appointed by the United States Attorney's Office collects data on racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system, including law enforcement and prosecutorial priorities, legislation provisions, penalty schemes, and demographic data on defendants charged by race and ethnicity. The advisory group appointed by the United States Attorney's Office collects data on racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system, including substantial assistance motions at sentencing or post-conviction, charging policies, racial and ethnic composition of Federal prosecutors, and training in the district. The advisory group appointed by the United States Attorney's Office collects data on racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system, including training in the exercise of discretion and cultural competency for prosecutors. They consult with an educational or independent research group if necessary and submit a report with factual findings on disparities and public confidence in the criminal process, along with recommended measures.
