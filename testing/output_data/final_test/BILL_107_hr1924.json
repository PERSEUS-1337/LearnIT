In 1999, 36 States had programs to bring individuals from non-education careers, military, retirees, and liberal arts graduates into teaching through alternate routes. Compared to traditional teacher preparation graduates, those entering teaching through alternate routes have degrees in non-education majors, work experience in non-education occupations, and are typically older.
