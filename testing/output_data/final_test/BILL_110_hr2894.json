During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key visited the British fleet to secure the release of Dr. William Beanes. Key was held overnight during the shelling of Fort McHenry but was delighted to see the American flag still flying after a 25-hour bombardment. He then began a poem to commemorate the occasion, which later became the \"Star-Spangled Banner\". In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" to be played at military and naval occasions. In 1931, it became our National Anthem. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins in commemoration of the bicentennial of the Star-Spangled Banner and the War of 1812. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the War of 1812, specifically the Battle for Fort McHenry. Each coin will feature a value designation, the year \"2012\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with relevant commissions.
