    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Voluntary Environmental Self-Evaluation Act.\" The \"Voluntary Environmental Self-Evaluation Act\" emphasizes the importance of voluntary compliance with Federal environmental laws to protect public health and welfare. It provides limited protection for individuals who voluntarily disclose information during environmental self-evaluations. This protection does not hinder regulatory authorities from enforcing mandatory environmental laws. The \"Voluntary Environmental Self-Evaluation Act\" defines key terms such as Administrator, Entity, Federal agency, and Federal environmental law, which includes specific acts like the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, and Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The curr_chunk lists various environmental laws including the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act, and Oil Pollution Act. The curr_chunk defines terms related to environmental laws, including voluntary disclosure and voluntary environmental self-evaluation. An assessment, audit, investigation, or review initiated by a person or entity to determine compliance with Federal environmental laws. SEC. 4. ADMISSIBILITY OF REPORTS, FINDINGS, OPINIONS, OR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS. In essence, a voluntary environmental self-evaluation report made in good faith is protected from being used as evidence in legal actions or administrative procedures under Federal law, unless waived by the initiator or if noncompliance with a Federal environmental law is indicated after a court hearing. The person or entity failed to initiate efforts to achieve compliance with environmental law within a reasonable time period. Compelling circumstances may require the admission of an environmental audit report as evidence or subject it to discovery procedures. The exclusion under this subsection is being asserted by the person or entity. The exclusion under this subsection applies if the environmental audit report was not used for a fraudulent purpose or to avoid disclosure in an imminent or ongoing investigation. Exclusions to this subsection include documents required by federal environmental laws, information needed by federal or state agencies for regulatory activities, and information obtained by federal or state agencies. The exclusion under this subsection applies to environmental audit reports not used fraudulently or to avoid disclosure in investigations. It includes information obtained by federal or state agencies through observation, sampling, or monitoring, or from independent sources. SEC. 5. TESTIMONY.\n\nA person or entity conducting a voluntary environmental self-evaluation cannot be compelled to testify in a Federal court or administrative proceeding without their consent. This includes any communication related to the self-evaluation covered by section 3(a).\n\nSEC. 6. DISCLOSURES. The disclosure of information under a Federal environmental law to the appropriate official of a Federal or State agency responsible for administering the law is considered voluntary if it arises from an environmental self-evaluation, is made promptly, and actions are taken to address identified issues within a reasonable time frame. The disclosure of information to a Federal or State agency under a Federal environmental law is considered voluntary if it arises from an environmental self-evaluation, is made promptly, and actions are taken to address identified issues within a reasonable time frame. Additionally, the person making the disclosure must provide any further relevant information requested by the appropriate official of the agency. If a person or entity discloses a violation of a Federal environmental law to an appropriate official of a Federal or State agency responsible for administering the law, there is a presumption that the disclosure is voluntary if the person or entity provides supporting information at the time of disclosure. This presumption does not apply if the person or entity has a history of significant violations of environmental laws within the past three years. The person or entity disclosing a violation of a Federal environmental law is presumed to have made a voluntary disclosure if supporting information is provided at the time of disclosure. The person or entity will be immune from penalties until the presumption is rebutted by the head of the agency. If the presumption is not rebutted, no administrative penalties or cease and desist orders can be issued. The person or entity disclosing a violation of a Federal environmental law is presumed to have made a voluntary disclosure if supporting information is provided at the time of disclosure. The person or entity will be immune from penalties until the presumption is rebutted by the head of the agency. If the disclosure is not voluntary, the appropriate official must demonstrate this to the satisfaction of the head of the agency. The head of the Federal or State agency must use the factors from subsection (a) to rebut the presumption of a voluntary disclosure. Their decision will be final. This section does not affect the authority of agencies to enforce environmental laws based on disclosed information."
