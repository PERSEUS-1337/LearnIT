    "content": "The Act titled \"United States-Mexico Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Act\" directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to assess priority transboundary aquifers and provide a scientific foundation for addressing water resource challenges in the US-Mexico border region. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as aquifer, Border State, and Indian tribe, with specific criteria outlined for each. The curr_chunk defines terms such as priority transboundary aquifer, program, reservation, and Secretary in relation to the United States-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program. The curr_chunk defines terms related to transboundary aquifers, a Tri-Regional Planning Group, and water resources research institutes in the Border States. Establishment of program. The Secretary will work with various entities to conduct the US-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program to characterize groundwater along the border. The program aims to identify and prioritize transboundary aquifers for further analysis. The US-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program aims to prioritize aquifers based on population density, usage, contamination susceptibility, and other relevant criteria. Data evaluation, study plans development, GIS database creation, and field studies are key components of the program. The US-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program aims to prioritize aquifers based on various criteria. Field studies are conducted to develop additional data and groundwater flow models for water management. Joint scientific investigations are expanded through agreements between relevant authorities in the US and Mexico. The US-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program prioritizes aquifers like the Hueco Bolson and Mesilla aquifers. Scientific investigations are conducted, data is shared, and scientific products are produced for water managers on both sides of the border. The US-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program prioritizes aquifers like the Hueco Bolson, Mesilla, Santa Cruz River Valley, and San Pedro aquifers. The Secretary will evaluate and designate additional priority transboundary aquifers. Cooperation with Mexico is essential for a comprehensive assessment, and grants and cooperative agreements may be provided. The Secretary may provide grants or enter into cooperative agreements with water resources research institutes and Border State entities to carry out the program. SEC. 5. IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAM. The Secretary must coordinate activities with water resource agencies in Border States, affected Indian tribes, and other entities conducting monitoring of priority transboundary aquifers. No new field studies can be initiated without consulting Border State water resource agencies. The Secretary will work with relevant entities to develop study plans and cost estimates. The Secretary will collaborate with water resource agencies, research institutes, and other entities to create study plans, timelines, and cost estimates for priority transboundary aquifers. The study plan should integrate existing data, improve groundwater flow models, and align with State guidelines and goals. SEC. 6. EFFECT.\n\nThis Act does not impact the jurisdiction of Border States over surface or groundwater resources, nor does it affect the water rights of those using water from transboundary aquifers.\n\nSEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\nWithin 5 years of enactment, the Secretary must submit interim and final reports to Border States' water resource agencies detailing program activities, conclusions on aquifer status, and Mexican entity participation.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2006 through 2015. 50% of the funds will be allocated to water resources research institutes for activities in Border States and Mexico, including scientific data exchange."
