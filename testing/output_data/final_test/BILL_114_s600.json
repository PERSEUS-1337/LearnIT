    "content": "ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFIT PILOT PROGRAM. The curr_chunk defines \"applicant\" as a nonprofit organization applying for a grant and \"energy-efficiency improvement\" as a measure reducing energy use in a nonprofit building. The curr_chunk lists eligible improvements for nonprofit buildings, including roofs, windows, doors, HVAC systems, and renewable energy systems like solar or wind. The curr_chunk defines a nonprofit building as one owned and operated by a nonprofit organization, including hospitals, youth centers, schools, social-welfare program facilities, faith-based organizations, and other nonresidential buildings. The Secretary of Energy will establish a pilot program to award grants for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements. Grants may be awarded if applicants meet specified criteria and submit required information. The Secretary will award grants for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements based on performance-based criteria prioritizing energy savings, cost-effectiveness, evaluation plan, financial need, and matching contribution percentage. Each grant awarded shall not exceed 50% of the energy-efficiency improvement or $200,000. Cost sharing is required for grants awarded under this section. The grant awarded under this section requires a 50% non-Federal cost-sharing minimum. The non-Federal share can be in the form of in-kind contributions. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020. An offset of $150,000,000 is allocated for fiscal year 2015. The grant funding amounts are set at $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2015 and $200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2018."
