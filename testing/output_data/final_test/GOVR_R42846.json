    "content": "The Lifeline program, established in 1984, assists eligible individuals with monthly service charges for wireline or wireless telephone usage. Eligible households can receive up to $9.25 per month in discounts through their designated telecommunications service provider. The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) administers the program as part of the Low Income Program supported by the Universal Service Fund. The Lifeline Program, part of the Universal Service Fund (USF), covers usage minutes for eligible subscribers. Providers may offer a free wireless phone with prepaid options, but the cost is not covered by the program. The program also includes wireline or postpaid wireless options, covering usage minutes but not the device. The Lifeline program covers minutes of use for eligible low-income consumers in various locations and requires income eligibility or participation in specific assistance programs. Consumers must recertify their eligibility for Lifeline assistance annually to remain in the program. They can use the Lifeline Pre-Screening Tool to determine eligibility and apply through their local telephone company or state agency. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners provides a list of state utility commissions for assistance. Telecommunications carriers must contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund (USF) based on a percentage of their revenues. This charge may appear on consumers' bills, but companies decide whether to pass it on to customers. The USF does not receive federal funding. The Lifeline program allows eligible low-income consumers to receive a discount on either wireline or wireless service, but not both. Households can only receive one Lifeline discount, and if found violating this rule, they will be de-enrolled and may face penalties."
