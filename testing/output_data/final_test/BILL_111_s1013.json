    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Sequestration Program Amendments Act of 2009.\" It amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include a Large-Scale Carbon Storage Program. The section defines key terms related to carbon dioxide storage, such as industrial source and large-scale injection. It also specifies the authorities responsible for overseeing the program on different types of land. The Secretary will carry out a program to demonstrate commercial application of integrated systems for carbon dioxide storage from industrial sources. Up to 10 demonstration projects may receive financial and technical assistance through cooperative agreements. Recipients must provide sufficient geological site information for long-term storage capability. The unit must have the capacity to store injected carbon dioxide long-term, including geological storage details, potential failure modes, retention ability, and monitoring requirements. Land ownership for injection and storage is also required. The recipient of financial assistance must comply with all necessary permits and regulations for the injection, storage, closure, monitoring, and long-term stewardship of the geological storage unit. Compliance with applicable Federal and State laws is required, including certification by the regulatory authority. The project must comply with Federal and State requirements to protect drinking water supplies, inject only captured carbon dioxide from industrial sources in compliance with the Clean Air Act, meet construction and operating requirements for deep injection wells, monitor to prevent carbon dioxide escape or migration, and follow well-plugging and site closure requirements. The project must comply with site care, closure requirements, and long-term care requirements, including maintaining financial assurances, undertaking remediation activities for leaks, complying with applicable requirements, and maintaining financial protection acceptable to the Secretary, land jurisdiction Secretary, and the EPA Administrator. The project must demonstrate continuous compliance with site closure requirements over a period of at least 10 years after carbon dioxide injection has ceased. This includes ensuring the project footprint remains stable and the plume of carbon dioxide does not substantially change. The project must show ongoing compliance with site closure rules for at least 10 years post carbon dioxide injection, ensuring stability and no significant changes in the carbon dioxide plume. Leakage of carbon dioxide or displaced fluids must not endanger public health or natural resources, and injected fluids should not migrate in a way that could lead to leaks. Injection wells must be properly plugged and abandoned according to federal or state laws. Liability includes legal responsibility for bodily harm or death. The Secretary may agree to indemnify the recipient of a cooperative agreement from liability arising from a demonstration project, except for gross negligence and intentional misconduct. This liability includes bodily injury, property damage, and harm to natural resources. The Secretary may indemnify the recipient of a cooperative agreement from liability, excluding gross negligence and intentional misconduct. A fee will be collected based on the net present value of payments made by the United States for indemnification. The Secretary may enter into agreements of indemnification in advance of appropriations, allowing for obligations without regard to certain Acts. Fees collected under this paragraph will be deposited in the Treasury. The Secretary can enter into agreements of indemnification with terms deemed appropriate. The agreement must involve collaboration with the recipient and approval by the Attorney General for indemnity payments. The Attorney General has final authority to settle claims under the indemnification agreement on a fair basis, excluding recipient expenses. The Secretary concerned may authorize the siting of a project on Federal land in accordance with applicable laws and land management plans. The decision will consider the framework for geological carbon sequestration on public land. Acceptance of title and long-term monitoring is also required. The Secretary may accept title to land for monitoring and remediation activities to ensure site integrity and prevent endangerment of public health or safety. Funding is appropriated for these purposes. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include definitions for \"industrial source\" and \"large-scale\" carbon dioxide injection. The Secretary may accept land title for monitoring and remediation activities funded by the Treasury. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to update sections related to energy independence and security. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to establish a training program for State agencies involved in carbon capture projects. The program provides grants for employee training and is authorized $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2020."
