    "content": "This report compares drug- and crime-related policy restrictions in federal programs for low-income individuals: TANF, SNAP, and federal housing assistance programs. They serve similar families but have different restrictions and levels of administration. The report compares drug- and crime-related policy restrictions in federal programs for low-income individuals, such as TANF, SNAP, and federal housing assistance programs. These restrictions are intended to deter criminal activity, punish undesirable behavior, and protect vulnerable communities. The report also provides a brief overview of the history and evolution of these policies. The curr_chunk discusses the historical evolution of policies related to determining the worthiness of individuals receiving government assistance, focusing on judgments of economic need and character. It highlights how states considered \"moral character\" in eligibility determinations, reflecting societal expectations at the time. The curr_chunk discusses controversial policies in the late 1960s and early 1970s that included \"suitable home\" and \"man in the house\" rules, which were criticized for racial bias and disproportionately affecting black families. These policies were eventually struck down by federal rulings and courts. At the same time, concerns about rising crime and drug use were increasing nationwide. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, rising crime and drug use rates led to the declaration of a \"War on Crime\" and a focus on drug abuse as a major issue in the United States. The federal government intensified its efforts with the \"War on Drugs\" during the Reagan Administration, particularly targeting crack-cocaine. Policymakers grappled with addressing crime and drug use, especially in poor African American communities, and distinguishing between drug use as a crime and addiction as a public health concern. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 added drug-related sanctions to federal assistance programs for the first time, aiming to create a drug-free America. Certain federal benefits were denied to individuals convicted of drug-related crimes, but exemptions were made for Social Security, welfare programs, and veterans' benefits. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 added drug-related sanctions to federal assistance programs, excluding Social Security, welfare programs, and veterans' benefits. The act aimed to create a drug-free America by imposing user accountability provisions, which were debated as deterrents to drug use or post-conviction penalties. It allowed local administrators to restrict individuals involved in drug-related criminal activity from receiving federal public housing assistance and terminate tenancy based on drug-related or other criminal activity. Clinton signed the PRWORA in 1996, ending decades of welfare reform debates. The law included provisions to address crime and drug addiction, imposing a lifetime ban on receiving assistance for those convicted of drug felonies under TANF and SNAP programs. This provision was added during Senate floor consideration with limited debate. The PRWORA, signed by Clinton in 1996, imposed a lifetime ban on receiving assistance for those convicted of drug felonies under TANF and SNAP programs. The law also authorized states to drug-test TANF recipients and added prohibitions on assisting \"fleeing felons\" in federal assistance programs. Congress passed a housing law that expanded crime- and drug-related restrictions in assisted housing programs. The Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1998 (QHWRA; P.L. 105-276) expanded crime- and drug-related restrictions in assisted housing programs following the enactment of PRWORA in 1996. President Clinton highlighted the need to address crime, drugs, and gangs in his 1996 State of the Union address, leading to stricter regulations on drug-related activities in assisted housing. The QHWRA of 1998 expanded crime- and drug-related provisions in assisted housing programs. It included restrictions on housing assistance for those involved in crimes like methamphetamine production and sex offenses. The amendments were added during Senate and House floor debates, citing dangers associated with these crimes in assisted housing. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides grants for a wide range of benefits and services to address economic disadvantage, including funding basic assistance for low-income families with children. In addition to cash assistance, TANF funds activities to alleviate child poverty and offers competitive grants for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provides aid to very poor families with children, including those headed by single mothers or non-parent relatives. States set the financial eligibility and benefit rules, with maximum benefits ranging from $170 to $923 per month in different states. The maximum benefit is typically for families with no other income who comply with program requirements. The TANF program provides cash assistance to families with children for up to 60 months, with work participation requirements. In June 2016, 1.5 million families received TANF cash assistance. Besides cash aid, TANF also funds services like child care, tax credits, and early childhood education, with states having flexibility in program design. The TANF program provides cash assistance to families with children for up to 60 months, with work participation requirements. States have flexibility in program design, and the federal government appropriated $17.3 billion for the block grant in FY2016. SNAP provides benefits to low-income recipients to supplement food purchasing power. Benefits vary by household size, income, and expenses. In FY2015, SNAP had an average monthly participation of approximately 45.8 million individuals in 22.5 million households. Eligibility criteria include income tests and asset limits. Recipients of TANF cash assistance, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or state-funded General Assistance are categorically eligible for SNAP. Broad-based categorical eligibility allows for modification of SNAP rules, with most states not using an asset test due to TANF-funded benefits. SNAP is administered by USDA-FNS and state agencies, with state options and waivers leading to variation in program implementation. In FY2015, USDA-FNS obligated approximately $74.5 billion for SNAP, which is 100% federally funded. The federal government shares state administrative costs 50/50. Three primary direct housing assistance programs for low-income individuals and families are funded by the federal government. These programs serve more than 4 million low-income households, including elderly persons, individuals with disabilities, families with and without children, and single individuals. Three primary direct housing assistance programs for low-income individuals and families are 100% federally funded. They serve elderly, persons with disabilities, families with and without children, and single adults. Due to resource constraints, only one out of every three or four eligible families are served. The programs offer housing that costs no more than 30% of family income, but the form of assistance varies. The programs are administered at the federal level by HUD, but local administration differs. Public housing offers low-rent housing units subsidized by the federal government and administered by local public housing authorities. The Section 8 voucher program provides rental vouchers for families to secure housing. In the Section 8 housing assistance program, rental vouchers are provided for families to secure housing in the private market. The program is federally funded but administered locally by Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Additionally, the Section 8 project-based rental assistance program offers low-rent housing units subsidized by the federal government and owned by private property owners. Federal policies govern income eligibility and subsidy levels, while PHAs and owners have discretion in setting their own screening policies for tenants. Suitability for housing assistance programs is determined by PHAs through screening policies outlined in administrative plans. Landlords can also screen tenants for tenancy suitability. Private landlords have discretion in screening tenants for voucher programs, while PHAs can conduct additional screening for public housing developments. In the Section 8 project-based rental assistance program, property owners screen tenants for program and tenancy suitability. In FY2015, the combined housing assistance programs received over $35.5 billion. In FY2015, federal housing assistance programs received over $35.5 billion in appropriations. This section discusses federal policies on drug testing and criminal activity for TANF, SNAP, and housing assistance recipients. States have flexibility in structuring non-cash benefits and services, which may include drug-related restrictions. The 1996 welfare reform law allowed states to require drug tests for TANF recipients, leading to many states implementing such policies. However, court challenges have arisen regarding the constitutionality of mandatory drug testing without suspicion. Recent cases in Michigan and Florida resulted in favorable rulings for TANF beneficiaries. State policies for drug testing TANF applicants or recipients can be found in Table A-1. State policies for drug testing TANF applicants or recipients vary among 25 states, with some requiring testing only for those with past drug convictions. Positive drug tests generally result in ineligibility for TANF assistance, although some states allow recipients to. Some states allow TANF recipients to retain or regain eligibility by completing a substance abuse treatment program, despite a ban on assistance for those convicted of drug felonies. States can opt-out or modify this ban through legislation. According to a search of state legislation, most states have modified or opted out of the lifetime ban on drug felons in their TANF programs. As of August 2016, 27 states had modified the ban, 13 states and the District of Columbia had opted out entirely, and 10 states maintained the lifetime disqualification for drug felons in TANF. The ban only applies to TANF assistance. The ban on drug felons in TANF only applies to ongoing cash assistance benefits, not other TANF services. Fugitive or fleeing felons are also ineligible for assistance. HHS regulations are vague on enforcement, but states may adopt SNAP procedures for TANF cash assistance programs. The TANF law includes a 10-year prohibition on assisting those who have committed welfare fraud by applying for benefits in more than one state. States have flexibility in applying drug- and crime-related restrictions on benefits. TANF provides benefits to families with dependent children, with eligibility and benefit amounts determined by the states. The federal drug felon ban, fleeing felon provisions, and welfare fraud provisions give states flexibility in applying restrictions on benefits. USDA generally does not allow drug testing for SNAP eligibility, except for two exceptions related to SNAP's interrelationship with TANF. New additions to SNAP law were added in the 2014 farm bill. The PRWORA law created TANF and included a provision disqualifying applicants with a felony drug conviction from TANF or SNAP. Some states have modified this ban by implementing drug testing for eligibility. Five states currently use drug testing for SNAP benefits, while Pennsylvania has the option but has not implemented it. Noncompliance with drug testing requirements in other programs can also lead to disqualification from SNAP. SNAP state agencies may disqualify recipients who fail to comply with drug testing requirements from other means-tested programs like TANF. This policy applies to ongoing SNAP cases, not new applicants. States can choose to waive the ban on drug felons participating in SNAP. As of August 1, 2016, most states have modified or eliminated the ban on SNAP benefits for convicted drug felons. States have implemented various changes such as drug testing, limiting types of drug felonies, and requiring participation in drug treatment. The Federal Interagency Reentry Council ensures that SNAP remains accessible to formerly incarcerated individuals, emphasizing support during the transition period post-incarceration. The PRWORA prohibits \"fugitive felons\" from receiving SNAP benefits, with specific criteria for ineligibility. USDA-FNS established rules for state agencies to implement these provisions, giving them two options for enforcement. The PRWORA prohibits \"fugitive felons\" from receiving SNAP benefits. State agencies have two options for implementing the fleeing felon ban, including a four-part test or accepting an outstanding felony arrest warrant as proof of fleeing felon status. The PRWORA prohibits \"fugitive felons\" from receiving SNAP benefits, with state agencies having two options for implementing the fleeing felon ban. An outstanding felony arrest warrant for Escape can affect a household's SNAP benefits, as factors like household size and income play a role in benefit calculation. Drug testing and criminal justice disqualifications can impact all household members, even those not disqualified, highlighting the significance of individual assets and income in determining eligibility and benefits for the entire household. SNAP benefits are significant for the entire household. Those who live together and prepare meals together are considered a SNAP household. Elderly or disabled members may qualify as a separate household if their income is below 165% of the federal poverty guidelines. Ineligible household members, like certain legal immigrants, may impact SNAP benefit calculations. Disqualified drug-related felons are excluded from household size but the household still remains. SNAP law defines income sources and excludes many, including assets of disqualified individuals. State agencies must count all assets and only a portion of income from disqualified individuals. This applies to drug-related felons and comparable disqualifications. For example, if a disqualified mother is the only one with income in a household, two-thirds of her income will be used for SNAP benefit calculations. The USDA-FNS regulations allow states to align SNAP income requirements with TANF or Medicaid policies. 38 states have chosen this alignment, impacting how disqualified individuals' assets or income are treated. Federal housing assistance programs do not have explicit policies on drug testing applicants or recipients, which could lead to legal challenges without specific authorization. Several Public Housing Authorities have implemented or considered drug testing policies for applicants and residents. The Norwalk Housing Authority in Connecticut conducts suspicionless drug testing, leading to legal challenges. The ACLU of Connecticut has argued the policy is unconstitutional. The Chicago Housing Authority dropped a proposal for suspicionless drug testing after opposition from the ACLU. The Flint Housing Commission in Michigan was also considering implementing drug testing for public housing residents. The Michigan Housing Commission considered drug testing all public housing residents in 2010, but the ACLU urged them to reconsider due to potential legal issues. While the Flint Housing Authority has not adopted a drug testing policy, some private property owners have implemented drug testing for tenants, especially in Section 8 programs. Fourth Amendment protections are relevant in these cases. Fourth Amendment protections do not apply to purely private actions, but may be triggered with governmental involvement in a private landlord's drug testing program. State laws may offer additional protections beyond the Fourth Amendment, limiting a landlord's ability to test tenants for drugs. Drug testing by private landlords could also raise concerns under laws like the Fair Housing Act. In mixed-income public housing developments managed by private entities, suspicionless drug testing may occur. In partnership with local PHAs, suspicionless drug testing policies have been adopted in some Chicago Housing Authorities' mixed-income public housing communities. The ACLU of Illinois challenged these policies in court, but the federal courts ruled that the drug-testing policy was private and not subject to the Fourth Amendment. Federal policies on drug-related criminal activity in federally assisted housing are complex and governed by various laws. Federal policies and regulations regarding housing are complex, with different laws and levels of discretion. PHAs and property owners have the authority to deny admission or terminate assistance under certain circumstances. These policies vary across different programs and may include optional criteria set by PHAs and property owners. In 2011 and 2012, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan reminded PHAs and property owners of their discretion in considering individuals' circumstances for admissions and terminations. In 2015, HUD issued formal guidance emphasizing this discretion and providing best practices for crime-related policies. PHAs and property owners are required by federal law to deny admission to individuals on a sex offender registry. In public housing and Section 8 voucher programs, PHAs must deny admission to those convicted of producing methamphetamines on federally assisted housing premises. This rule does not apply to the project-based Section 8 program. PHAs and property owners in all housing assistance programs must establish policies denying admission to households with tenants engaging in illegal drug use or alcohol abuse that interferes with the safety or peaceful enjoyment of other residents. The administrator can deny admission to individuals who pose a threat to the health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of other residents, or who were evicted for drug-related criminal activity in the last three years. Owners and PHAs have some discretion in implementing these rules, and may consider completion of a drug rehabilitation program. Unlike prohibitions for methamphetamine producers and lifetime sex offenders, these denials leave room for interpretation. Federal law explicitly lists categories of criminal activity that may be grounds for denial of admission to housing programs. Administrators can deny admission if a household member has been involved in violent or drug-related crimes. PHAs and owners can also set their own screening criteria, such as barring felons from receiving assistance. These criteria must comply with fair housing laws and be supported by evidence. Federal law requires Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to terminate assistance to tenants convicted of producing methamphetamines on federally assisted housing premises. While termination is not mandatory for Section 8 project-based rental assistance, PHAs are encouraged to adopt policies for persons on a sex offender registry. PHAs must also have policies to terminate assistance for households with tenants engaged in illegal drug use. The administrator can terminate assistance for tenants engaging in illegal drug use or alcohol abuse that interferes with the health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of other residents. Rehabilitation completion may be considered. Criminal activities can also lead to termination of assistance, with specific rules varying by program. Engaging in criminal activity, including drug-related offenses, by a tenant or their household members can result in termination of tenancy in both project-based Section 8 and Section 8 voucher programs. This includes activities that threaten the safety or peaceful enjoyment of other residents. Engaging in criminal activity, including drug-related offenses, by a tenant or their household members can lead to termination of tenancy in federal housing assistance programs. Discretion is given to program administrators to decide on termination of assistance based on specific circumstances, such as fugitive felon status. HUD regulations do not mandate termination of tenancy for fugitive felons or probation/parole violators. Current HUD regulations do not mandate termination of tenancy for fugitive felons or probation/parole violators. Housing assistance eligibility considers the background of all household members, and if one member is deemed ineligible, the entire household may be affected. Administrators have discretion to terminate assistance if any household member engages in behavior warranting termination. President Clinton's 1996 State of the Union speech introduced the \"One Strike\" policy for public housing residents involved in criminal activities. This policy allowed for eviction based on the actions of household members or guests, as outlined in HUD guidance to PHAs. The policy aimed to combat drug-related criminal activity and gang violence, emphasizing a zero-tolerance approach towards crime in public housing. The \"One Strike\" policy allowed public housing eviction for criminal activities of household members or guests. The Supreme Court upheld HUD's no-fault eviction rules in 2002, allowing eviction for drug-related incidents outside the assisted unit. The case involved tenants facing eviction due to drug activities by their relatives or caretakers. The Court ruled that federal law permitted eviction of tenants under these circumstances. The federal law allows eviction of tenants for actions of third parties regardless of their knowledge of drug or criminal activity. Some states have proposed drug testing policies for recipients of federal assistance. Laws conditioning benefits on passing drug tests without individualized suspicion are constitutionally vulnerable. Two state laws requiring suspicionless drug tests for TANF benefits have faced litigation with favorable rulings for the plaintiffs. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on such laws. Constitutional challenges to suspicionless governmental drug testing often focus on personal privacy and Fourth Amendment protections against \"unreasonable searches.\" The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that drug tests are searches under the Fourth Amendment, requiring individualized suspicion unless a \"special need\" is demonstrated. Government benefit programs like TANF, SNAP, and housing assistance do not typically meet the criteria for a special need, making policies requiring drug testing of public assistance recipients constitutionally questionable. Governmental drug testing procedures that only require individualized suspicion of drug use are less likely to violate the Fourth Amendment. Restricting the sharing of test results and minimizing negative repercussions of failed tests will also be more constitutionally sound. Despite federal laws prohibiting marijuana, over 20 states have established medical marijuana regulations, with four legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The conflict between federal and state marijuana laws does not necessarily require resolution. The legal status of marijuana is contradictory between federal and state laws. State courts have ruled that the conflict does not require preemption of state medical marijuana laws. TANF benefits, paid in cash, have raised concerns about potential use to purchase marijuana. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 4137 was passed to prohibit TANF recipients from using benefits to buy marijuana. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 4137 was passed by the House to prohibit TANF recipients from accessing benefits in establishments that sell marijuana. The bill did not distinguish between recreational and medical uses of marijuana. SNAP benefits are redeemable only for SNAP-eligible products at authorized retailers, with deductions for medical expenses. Recent amendments to SNAP regulations make expenses for medical marijuana ineligible for the medical expense deduction. \"Illegal drug users\" are ineligible for federally assisted housing. Public housing agencies and owners of federally assisted housing can prohibit admission or terminate tenancy of illegal drug users based on established standards. This includes individuals with a pattern of illegal controlled substance use that could interfere with the safety and well-being of other residents. HUD mandates denial of admission to applicants using marijuana, whether for medical or recreational purposes. Housing agencies must deny admission to applicants using medical marijuana but can choose whether to evict current tenants for marijuana use. Federal policies on drug and crime restrictions in assistance programs vary in goals and administration. These policies aim to deter undesirable behavior, allocate resources to deserving individuals, and protect vulnerable communities. The report summarizes the similarities and differences between TANF, SNAP, and major housing assistance programs, highlighting how they may impact drug- and crime-related policies. Policymakers may need to consider the discretion given to state or local decisionmakers in administering these programs, as well as the funding differences that affect how assistance is provided. SNAP benefits are federally financed, leading to variations in how assistance is distributed. SNAP benefits are federally funded entitlements, while TANF is funded by both federal and state sources. Limited federal funding for TANF may incentivize states to restrict benefits. Assisted housing, although federally funded, serves only a fraction of eligible families due to resource constraints. Administrators prioritize assistance based on need and worthiness. SNAP and housing assistance programs serve a broader population compared to TANF. SNAP and federal housing assistance programs serve a wider population than TANF, including elderly, disabled, families with children, and childless adults. TANF mainly serves families with children headed by able-bodied adults and tends to serve the poorest families. Administrators of SNAP and housing programs have different considerations regarding crime and drug policies compared to TANF administrators. The goals and benefit structures of SNAP and housing assistance programs differ from TANF. SNAP provides food assistance, housing assistance provides subsidies for housing expenses, while TANF cash assistance can be used at the recipient's discretion. Limiting access to SNAP and housing assistance may lead to hunger and homelessness, making it challenging for administrators to apply sanctions. Policymakers and program administrators may find it harder to regulate TANF cash spending. Cash assistance recipients may face increased scrutiny to prevent misuse of federal funds, especially in housing programs where administrators have a responsibility to ensure tenants do not engage in harmful activities. This is particularly evident in public housing where safety and well-being of all tenants are paramount. Unlike TANF and SNAP programs, housing assistance programs have place-based considerations. This report highlights variations in federal crime- and drug-related restrictions in TANF, SNAP, and housing assistance programs, influenced by program goals, design, and governing laws. Geographic differences may exist due to local policymakers' discretion. The devolution of social programs aims to empower states and localities in policy design. The devolution of social programs aims to empower states and localities to design programs reflecting their interests. Inconsistencies in crime- and drug-related policies may lead to confusion and limit access to federal assistance. Some states are increasing drug-related sanctions while others are modifying federal drug felon bans, raising questions about current federal policy. The federal policy debate questions whether state and local administrators should prioritize drug- and crime-related sanctions over federal intentions. Understanding state policy choices, such as the default drug felon ban, raises concerns about states actively choosing or passively opting out. Factors influencing state policies include budget constraints and value judgments, but evidence on the impact of crime- and drug-related restrictions in federal assistance programs is lacking. The challenge lies in identifying the objectives of crime-related restriction policies and their impact on the population, particularly racial minorities. Incarceration rates have risen, raising questions about the disproportionate implications of these restrictions. More research is needed in this area for policymakers to make informed decisions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the lack of data to fully assess the impact of current crime- and drug-related restrictions. They questioned how these restrictions may conflict with federal initiatives supporting prisoner reentry and responsible fatherhood. With crime rates lower than in the past, policymakers may need to reevaluate these policies to address current concerns. Additionally, the legality of current drug testing policies may need to be reviewed for potential modifications."
