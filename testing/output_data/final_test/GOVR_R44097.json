    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main federal aid source for K-12 education, with Title I-A being the largest program funded at $14.4 billion for FY2015. It aims to provide educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. Title I-A grants are determined by the U.S. Department of Education based on four funding formulas. The ESEA was reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015 with minimal changes to the Title I-A formulas, effective from FY2017. In FY2015, Title I-A funds were allocated to LEAs through four formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). Approximately 45% of appropriations were allocated through Basic Grants. Annual appropriations bills specify allocations to LEAs and states under each formula. Approximately 45% of Title I-A appropriations were allocated through the Basic Grants formula, 9% through Concentration Grants, and 23% through each of Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas. Funds are combined at LEAs and calculated based on formula child count and expenditure factors. Grants are adjusted to match available appropriations, considering state and LEA minimum grant provisions. LEAs must meet minimum criteria to be eligible for Title I-A grants. The U.S. Department of Education calculates grants for LEAs under different Title I-A formulas, including Basic, Concentration, Targeted Grants, and EFIG. State grants are adjusted for minimum grant provisions, and final FY2015 grants were calculated by the ED. The percentage share of funds allocated under each formula was calculated by CRS for each state. Table 1 shows each state's grant amount and percentage share of funds allocated under Title I-A formulas for FY2015. California received the largest total grant amount ($1.7 billion) and the largest percentage share (11.81%), while Wyoming received the smallest total grant amount ($33.1 million) and the smallest percentage share (0.23%). Grant amounts vary among states due to different allocation amounts for the formulas, with the Basic Grant formula generally receiving a greater share of funds than the Concentration Grant formula. States receive varying Title I-A grant amounts and percentage shares based on different formulas. For example, Texas has a larger population of children, leading to a higher grant amount compared to North Carolina. The allocation of funds within a state can also vary by formula, with some formulas favoring certain types of states. If a state's share of a formula exceeds its overall share of Title I-A funds, it indicates that the formula is more favorable to that state. In states with minimum grants under all Title I-A formulas, Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas provide higher shares than Basic or Concentration Grants due to higher state minimums. States like New York and Nevada receive a higher percentage share of Targeted Grants compared to their overall Title I-A funds, indicating the formula's favorability. Conversely, they receive a smaller share of Basic Grants, showing less favorability. States with minimum grants are denoted with an asterisk in Table 1."
