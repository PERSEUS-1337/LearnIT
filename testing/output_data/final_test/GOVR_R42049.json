    "content": "Recent legislation and decisions by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims have addressed jurisdiction over orders issued under civilian agency contracts. President Obama signed legislation in 2011 that overturned previous decisions, clarifying that protests challenging task and delivery orders under civilian agency contracts must increase the scope, period, or maximum value of the underlying contract to be eligible for jurisdiction. Recent legislation and decisions by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims have addressed jurisdiction over orders issued under civilian agency contracts. GAO and the court rejected the interpretation that limitations on their jurisdiction expired in 2011, allowing protests of orders of any size under civilian agency contracts. This could have led to different treatment of protests under civilian agency contracts compared to defense contracts and potentially increased bid protests. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims addressed jurisdiction over orders issued under civilian agency contracts, rejecting limitations on their jurisdiction. Recent legislation and decisions could have led to increased bid protests under defense contracts. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) aimed to simplify the federal procurement process by recognizing task and delivery order contracts and limiting contractors' protest rights. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) aimed to simplify the federal procurement process by recognizing task and delivery order contracts and limiting contractors' protest rights, including protests under TO/DO contracts for services or goods. These contracts, also known as indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, allow for the issuance of orders without specifying the time of delivery or quantity of goods/services. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) simplified the federal procurement process by recognizing task and delivery order contracts. These contracts allow agencies to issue orders without following the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, reducing procurement time. FASA also limited contractors' protest rights, including protests under TO/DO contracts for services or goods. FASA simplified federal procurement by limiting bid protests on task or delivery order contracts. Protests are only allowed if the order increases the contract's scope, period, or value. Title 10 applies to defense agencies, while Title 41 applies to civilian agencies. Congressional concerns shifted in 2008 due to alleged waste, fraud, and abuse in military contracts. In 2008, concerns about waste, fraud, and abuse in military contracts led to a shift in congressional views on federal procurement. Some believed agencies were evading competition and other requirements. The Acquisition Advisory Panel recommended allowing contractors to protest the issuance of \"large\" orders. In response to concerns about waste and abuse in military contracts, the NDAA for FY2008 amended FASA to promote competition for orders under TO/DO contracts by setting limits on single-award contracts and expanding protesters' ability to challenge order issuances. The 2008 NDAA amendments expanded protesters' ability to challenge order issuances under TO/DO contracts, setting limits on single-award contracts and granting GAO exclusive jurisdiction over protests of orders valued over $10 million. This provision was to be effective for three years from January 28, 2008. The 2008 NDAA expanded protesters' ability to challenge order issuances under TO/DO contracts, granting GAO exclusive jurisdiction over protests of orders valued over $10 million. Congress intended to temporarily authorize protests of \"large\" orders to assess their impact before permanently authorizing such protests. The Ike Skelton NDAA for FY2011 extended the sunset date for protests of \"large\" orders and clarified GAO's exclusive jurisdiction over them. The 2008 NDAA expanded protesters' ability to challenge order issuances under TO/DO contracts, granting GAO exclusive jurisdiction over protests of orders valued over $10 million. Congress intended to temporarily authorize protests of \"large\" orders to assess their impact before permanently authorizing such protests. The provisions in Title 41 differed slightly from those in Title 10 at the time when GAO and the Court of Federal Claims issued their decisions. The 2008 NDAA expanded GAO's jurisdiction over protests of orders valued over $10 million. In a decision on June 14, 2011, GAO found jurisdiction over a civilian agency contract order that did not expand the contract's scope, period, or value. The DOD argued that GAO's jurisdiction expired on May 27, 2011, but GAO disagreed based on the provisions of FASA. The GAO's jurisdiction over protests of civilian agency orders expanded under the NDAA for FY2008. The expiration of limitations in May 2011 allowed GAO to hear protests regardless of order value or impact on the underlying contract. The Court of Federal Claims also confirmed its jurisdiction over protests in a subsequent decision. The Court of Federal Claims affirmed its jurisdiction over protests of orders issued under civilian agency contracts, rejecting the government's argument that GAO's jurisdiction was a temporary experiment. The court interpreted the statutory text as unambiguous, extending its authority to all provisions of FASA regarding protests of task and delivery orders. The expiration of GAO's jurisdiction over \"large\" orders would allow Congress to review and make necessary adjustments. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress regarding the sunset date was not relied upon. This could have led to protests of civilian agency contract orders being treated differently than defense contract orders, potentially increasing bid protests. The legislation resolves questions about the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council. The Acquisition Regulatory Council will amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to limit protests on task-order contracts. Protests on order scope, value, or exceeding $10 million are allowed. The authority to protest orders expires on specific dates for different agencies. The FAR Council's authority to regulate protests on task-order contracts was in doubt after a court decision. The amended regulation could have limited protests on orders increasing scope, value, or exceeding $10 million. Chevron deference may not apply to such interpretations. The NDAA for FY2012 amended Title 41 of the United States Code to restrict protests on task or delivery orders, except for specific circumstances. The Comptroller General of the United States has exclusive jurisdiction over protests valued over $10,000,000. These amendments may impact the application of Chevron deference to agency interpretations. The NDAA for FY2012 amended Title 41 to restrict protests on task or delivery orders over $10,000,000. GAO and the Court of Federal Claims may lack jurisdiction over orders not increasing contract scope after September 30, 2016, without congressional action. Differences in civilian and defense agency order treatment could arise if Title 10 is amended without Title 41, or vice versa."
