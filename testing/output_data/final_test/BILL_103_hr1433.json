    "content": "The \"Aviation Enhancement Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress declares the severe financial distress of the US commercial airline industry, with record losses and debt burden leading to the cancellation of new aircraft orders. The industry faces downsizing due to excess capacity and struggles to obtain financing for new equipment, jeopardizing the phase-out of older aircraft. The quieter Stage 3 aircraft may impact the phase out of noisier Stage 2 aircraft. States, local communities, the traveling public, airline employees, and shareholders would benefit from stronger, healthier air carriers operating modern, fuel-efficient, quieter aircraft. The Federal Government, as the owner and operator of the air traffic control system, must support the commercial aviation industry. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund is projected to have an unobligated surplus of over $4.3 billion on October 1, 1993. A prudent shift of this surplus into modernizing the commercial aviation industry is recommended. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund surplus should be used to guarantee loans for acquiring new aircraft to phase out older, less fuel-efficient, and noisier planes, providing economic stimulus and ensuring competitiveness in the aviation industry. Title XI of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 is amended to include a new section providing loan guarantees for the acquisition of Stage 3 aircraft. The Secretary can guarantee lenders against loss on loans for eligible air carriers to acquire new Stage 3 aircraft. Terms include a maximum 20-year loan term, interest rate below the Secretary's determined maximum, and no prepayment penalty. The loan for acquiring Stage 3 aircraft has no prepayment penalty. The aircraft must be manufactured in the US and delivered within 3 years. At least 50% of the aircraft parts must be made in the US to be considered domestically manufactured. The Secretary can guarantee loans for air carriers with aging or Stage 2 aircraft if they agree to retire them. The loan guarantee program allows air carriers to acquire Stage 3 aircraft without prepayment penalties. The aircraft must be US-manufactured and delivered within 3 years, with at least 50% of parts made domestically. Air carriers with aging or Stage 2 aircraft must agree to retire them upon acquiring a loan. If there is a default, the carrier must transfer title of equipment to the Department of Transportation. The Secretary determines the percentage of available seat miles for eligible air carriers certificated before October 1, 1992. 95% of funds are allocated for guaranteeing loans to these carriers based on their seat mile percentage. The Secretary allocates 5% of funds for guaranteeing loans to eligible air carriers certificated after October 1, 1992, based on a fair formula. Eligible carriers can transfer their loan guarantees to other carriers. The Secretary is authorized to enforce these provisions. The Secretary is authorized to enforce loan guarantees under this section, which must be secured by equipment and other assets. $4.3 billion is authorized for appropriations for fiscal years after September 30, 1993. Definitions include \"aging aircraft\" as those in service for at least 15 years. The text chunk discusses definitions related to aircraft, including \"eligible air carrier,\" \"Stage 2 aircraft,\" and \"Stage 3 aircraft.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding regulations regarding aircraft noise levels. The text chunk amends the table of contents in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 by adding information related to title XI of the Act. The text chunk introduces loan guarantees for the acquisition of Stage 3 aircraft, including terms and conditions, requirements for domestic manufacture, retirement of aging and Stage 2 aircraft, default provisions, distribution of loan guarantees, enforcement measures, authorization of appropriations, and definitions."
