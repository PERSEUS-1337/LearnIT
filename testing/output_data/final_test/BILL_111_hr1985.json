    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iran Diplomatic Enhancement Act of 2009\". The Congress acknowledges that Iran is a party to the NPT and a member of the IAEA. Iran has violated UNSC Resolutions 1696 and 1737, leading to economic sanctions until compliance is achieved. Iran is in violation of multiple UNSC resolutions, leading to economic sanctions until compliance is achieved. Iran has installed next-generation centrifuges at Natanz FEP, including the IR-2 and IR-3. IAEA inspectors were unable to verify design information at the Arak Heavy Water Reactor. Iran has produced 1,010 kilograms of low enriched uranium hexafluoride, exceeding IAEA estimates. Iran has over 5,400 centrifuges installed and is producing fuel rods for its IR-40 heavy water reactor. Iran continues to expand its ballistic missile development, with the IAEA expressing concerns about Iran's refusal to allow inspections at the IR-40 heavy water reactor. Additionally, Iran has not provided answers to the IAEA's questions regarding the military dimensions of its nuclear program. Up to 40 percent of Iranian gasoline is imported, with the majority being purchased from just six companies. In February 2009, six companies, mostly European, supplied the majority of Iran's gasoline imports, with Swiss firms Vitol and Trafigura leading the way. Concerns arise as Swiss companies provide over 80 percent of Iran's gasoline imports, while Lloyds of London insures most tankers delivering gasoline to Iran. An interruption in gasoline supply to Iran would have a significant impact on the country. The restriction of gasoline exports to Iran would greatly impact the Iranian economy and bolster diplomatic efforts. Barack Obama proposed working with allies to isolate Iran by cutting off gasoline imports, which would increase pressure on the regime. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE IRAN SANCTIONS ACT OF 1996. Expansion of Sanctions to Refined Petroleum under the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 includes imposing sanctions on investments of $40,000,000 or more that contribute to Iran's petroleum resources development. The Iran Diplomatic Enhancement Act of 2009 imposes sanctions on investments of $20,000,000 or more that enhance Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources, provide refined petroleum resources to Iran, or engage in activities that support Iran's petroleum imports. The Iran Diplomatic Enhancement Act of 2009 imposes sanctions on investments that enhance Iran's ability to import refined petroleum resources or provide goods, services, or technology for refining petroleum. The United States policy aims to discourage investments in Iran's energy sector and exports of refined petroleum resources. Presidential waiver provisions are also amended.
